In the past month , worries about foreign minister Abdullah Gul of the AK Party being nominated to the position of President came to a head with over a million marching in Istanbul for secularism preceded by a thinly veiled threat by the general staff of the Turkish army to intervene .
The Western medias response was positive towards a Middle Eastern and predominately Muslim nation having large public shows of support for secularism but tempered by the possibility of another military coup to defend this position , leading the Economist to declare ‘ If Turks have to choose , democracy is more important than secularism ’ .
The majority of the reasoning led towards a questioning of the Turkish military ’s role , a role that seems foreign to industrialized nations where the military is typically subordinate to civil governments .
While this speaks to an ideal of a coexistence of democracy and secularism , the reality is that there is popular support for the AK Party that outnumbers the secular opposition – if elections are to be held in July , they will most likely be dominated by the AK .
While this should n’t be declared as an Islamist majority or secular minority , the ambitions of the AK Party are unclear in regards to their Islamist roots ( to be fair , the majority of their rule has respected secularism and presided over a period of sustained economic development ) .
In this predicament , the military should n’t be discounted as the self - appointed defender of Ataturk ’s secular legacy .
The West ’s difficulty with its position is obvious : in a global memory bereft of military juntas that turned countries into prisons , the capability of a military to interfere in politics in a positive , progressive manner seems negligible .
But the reality is the military has acted as an institution maintaining Western values in a country that is a member of NATO and seeking future membership in the European Union .
While the Turkish system may not be the best of all worlds , in a region where Hamas in Palestine , Lieberman in Israel , and Ahmadinejad in Iran all attained power democratically , the short falls of an unchecked democracy should be apparent .
More importantly , the Turkish military has acted as an arbiter of power and primarily maintained a stable political system while countries around it have welted into Islamic regimes and authoritarian police states .
Given the climate of perpetual conflict and chaos in the Middle East , there needs to be a pragmatic approach towards the forces of secularism and modernization , including the Turkish military .

AYAAN HIRSI ALI COMMENTARY : Can Secular Turkey Survive Democracy ? , http://bookerrising.blogspot.com/2007/05/ayaan-hirsi-ali-commentary-can-secular.html
Artists were enlisted to draw up the camouflage designs .
Early in the war , designs were drawn for individual ships , with each ship having its own distinctive pattern ( see the drawings at left ) .
As the war progressed , standard patterns were devised and applied to large numbers of ships .
An example is the type 24 design .
( Note that the designs for opposite sides of the ship can be quite different from one another . )
Even the great passenger liners were camouflaged for the duration of the War .
It is unfortunate that there are no color photographs of these WWI ships .
People who witnessed convoys of dazzle painted ships reported that the scene was quite dramatic .
Imagine sailing across the North Atlantic surrounded by dozens of brightly painted ships , each in different colors and patterns .
If you compare the colored drawing with the black and white photograph of the ship " War Clover " , you can get an idea of how much we are missing .
( Aidan Hall sent me a colorized photo which gives a great idea of how these ships would have looked in real life .
Thanks , Aidan . )
At the end of the the First World War , dazzle painting was discontinued , as the admirals had never really liked painting their ships in such an un-military fashion .
Also , the introduction of effective air power made dazzle painting problematic , as it increased the ship 's visibility to aircraft .
The US Navy reintroduced dazzle painting during World War II ( after Japanese air power had been largely eliminated ) to protect our ships from the renewed threat of enemy submarines .
Examples include the US Navy cruiser " Alaska " and the destroyer " Yarnall " .
However , continuing improvements in radar and sonar eventually eliminated any need for submarine commanders to actually sight their targets visually .
This meant that by the end of the war dazzle painting no longer served any useful purpose , and US warships were quickly repainted to a " haze grey " color .

Deconstructing McRib -- the story , the photographs ...
In late 2005 , the global fast food giant McDonald 's announced the ' Farewell Tour ' of the McRib sandwich .
( Frankly , I do n't believe McRib will be retired permanently , but more on that later . )
The reappearance of the McRib reminded me of my lifelong fascination with the marketing and culinary mind set that creates a boneless rib sandwich with a pressed meat patty made to look like it has bones in it .
I mean , that 's weird , right ?
McRib Trivia ( from McDonald's )
Every year McDonald 's purchases 250,000,000 pounds of pork .
The McRib sandwich as been mentioned twice on David Letterman 's " Top 10 List . "
Each McRib sandwich is actually submerged in tangy BBQ sauce .
The McRib sandwich was first introduced to the public in 1982 .
The McRib sandwich sports 2 pickles and .25 ounces of onions .
The McRib sandwich was spoofed in The Simpsons episode # 303 .
So , knowing I 'd never understand the thought process that created it , I decided to ' deconstruct ' the McRib sandwich itself .
Hence the photos below .
But first , a little history :
The McRib was introduced in 1981 and was a regular item on the menu for several years .
Over time McRib became a ' special ' menu item and was only available in select regions at various times .
It became part of popular food culture with mentions on Letterman 's Top 10 list and The Simpsons .
Today McDonald 's has even taken to self - mockery with regards to the McRib .
They 've created the fictitious " Boneless Pig Farmers of America " web site ( www.bonelesspigs.org).
But now , with McDonald 's threat or tease about retiring the McRib , there are petitions on the net in favor and opposed to keeping the McRib around .
And , of course , there 's a petition at McDonald 's official McRib site .
And what about that fancy McRib.com web site that offers logos you can download for t- shirt iron - ons , trivia and games related to McRib and begs the question , " Why spend all the money if the sandwich is going away ? "
It 's not .
It 's just a revival of that perennial anomaly of the rib-less rib -meat sandwich .
The ' deconstruction ' :
Whether or not it would continue to be around , I decided one day that I wanted to ' see inside ' the McRib .
Rest assured , I was n't expecting to find ribs in there .
I knew better .
But I wanted to know what that ' meat ' patty looked like without the sauce .
And I wanted to know what was inside .
The photos below show what I discovered from the moment I came home and opened the McDonald 's bag to the moment I laid out the filleted McRib patty on the cutting board .
Just click on a photo to enlarge it in a new window .
Enjoy ! { comments ?}

Liberals Vow to Block Continued Iraq Funding
Seventy House members , nearly all liberal Democrats , vowed today that they would not support any more funding for Iraq military operations unless tied to a complete withdrawal of combat troops .
This is a big development .
Earlier this year , liberals grudgingly voted for Iraq funding bills because they did n't want to give Nancy Pelosi a defeat .
Now it seems that their patience has run out .
The next Iraq funding bill wo n't come up until the fall , so this showdown wo n't happen for a few months , but it appears to be shaping up as an epic battle between liberals in Congress and President Bush .
This may be the beginning of the end for the Iraq War .
The liberals ' full letter to Bush appears after the jump ...
Dear Mr. President :
We are writing to inform you that we will only support appropriating additional funds for U.S. military operations in Iraq during Fiscal Year 2008 and beyond for the protection and safe redeployment of all our troops out of Iraq before you leave office .
More than 3,600 of our brave soldiers have died in Iraq .
More than 26,000 have been seriously wounded .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or injured in the hostilities and more than 4 million have been displaced from their homes .
Furthermore , this conflict has degenerated into a sectarian civil war and U.S. taxpayers have paid more than $ 500 billion , despite assurances that you and your key advisors gave our nation at the time you ordered the invasion in March , 2003 that this military intervention would cost far less and be paid from Iraqi oil revenues .
We agree with a clear and growing majority of the American people who are opposed to continued , open - ended U.S. military operations in Iraq , and believe it is unwise and unacceptable for you to continue to unilaterally impose these staggering costs and the soaring debt on Americans currently and for generations to come .
Sincerely ,

After months of committee meetings -- and strong resistance from faculty and students -- the change began last fall .
With a few exceptions , departments are now allowed to schedule only half their classes in prime time , leading to a 20 percent increase in Friday offerings .
And where there were once 14 classes before 9 a .m. there are now 138 , a shift that ignores students ' biorhythms , the campus newspaper complained .
Many popular or required classes also now meet Wednesday and Friday , leaving students with little alternative but to sign up .
" I 'm not sure it 's a solution to Thursday night drinking problems , although I 'm sure it has some effect , " Dr. Lange says .
Duke has been working for several years to crack down on drinking on campus .
Now students refer to the Old Duke , where three - day fraternity keggers on the quads were common , and the New Duke , where serving alcohol is regulated and the campus pub is no more .
Mostly the parties have moved off campus .
Thomas Adelman , a 20 - year - old sophomore , is the social chairman responsible for one surviving event , Malt Liquor Thursdays , a celebration of the brew open to the entire university .
Wayne Manor , a selective on - campus housing group with a community service emphasis , has played host to M.L.T. since 1994 .
This semester , Mr. Adelman has cultural anthropology and Italian classes on Fridays .
He says he never cuts .
" My parents do n't pay $ 40,000 a year for me to skip class , " he says .
" If they thought that I did cut classes frequently they probably would n't be paying that bill . "
Duke students , he insists , have a five - day workweek .
Mr. Adelman turns his mind back to academics on Sunday : " Right after the games are over , I 'm doing homework . "
Like Duke , Syracuse had the bulk of its classes bunched up between 10 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. in the middle of the week .
By moving courses to Friday , it opened up classroom space throughout the rest of the week .
Syracuse now has nearly 200 more classes on Friday than it did two years ago .
" We think we 're changing the whole academic culture , " says Deborah Freund , vice chancellor and provost at Syracuse .
" If you want a campus to be a serious academic environment that provokes free and open inquiry , you do n't want to except one day from that inquiry . "
Getting students to show up is another matter .
It is not unusual for college class attendance to languish at about 60 percent .
Faculty members at Syracuse are telling administrators that students are coming on Fridays .
At Duke , Judith Ruderman , vice provost for academic and administrative services , observes , " I see lots of students around campus as of 8 a .m. or so , which I never saw before . "
Some educators point out that if a course engages students , they will take it no matter when it occurs .
" There 's a very popular drawing class that meets 3 to 5 Friday afternoon , and it 's always oversubscribed , " says Alexander M. Thompson III , dean of studies at Vassar .
In the previous article on How Your Mind Really Works , we explored the key strengths of human intelligence , such as our ability to identify invariant patterns and to recognize specific instances of them .
But these strengths do n’t come without major drawbacks .
The human mind certainly has its share of weaknesses , gaps , and blind spots .
It ’s wise to cultivate an awareness of our inherent mental weaknesses , since then we have a chance to compensate for them .
But if we remain blissfully ignorant of them , they ’ll only come back to bite us .
Here are 10 weaknesses of human intelligence :
Faulty hard drive – Witness recall is notoriously inaccurate .
When asked to describe something they just saw , people frequently overlook critically important details , get existing details wrong , and add details that were n’t present at all .
It ’s a bad idea to put too much faith in your memories , since they ’re likely riddled with errors .
You probably do n’t even remember what you ’re wearing .
Low RAM –
You can only load and process so much complexity in your mind at once .
There ’s so much you do n’t understand because your mind lacks the capacity to store all the subtleties needed for true comprehension .
Consequently , you ’re probably making a total mess of things .
Slow CPU – Let ’s just say you ’re not the sharpest tool in the shed .
Infinite loops –
Once a pattern of thought and behavior has become conditioned , it can be very difficult to reprogram .
This causes bad habits , addictions , and Republicans .
Lack of error correction –
Once errors get into the system , they tend to stick around for a while .
One bad decision left uncorrected will soon see more errors piled on top of it .
This is how people sink into debt , put on weight , and get jobs , only to regret it later .
Apparently we ’d rather be stupid than appear stupid .
Limited sensory input –
Our input channels are restricted to five senses ( six for some of us ) , which all have a limited range of capabilities .
We ca n’t see what ’s behind a wall , we ca n’t touch people at a distance , and we ca n’t hear what people in the next building are saying … unless of course we work for the CIA .
Poor networking capabilities – Transferring data between two human minds is slow , tedious , and error - prone , and the protocols are beyond confusing .
It ’s a safe bet that Microsoft is involved .
High maintenance costs –
Who ’d want to use hardware that takes 8 hours to reboot , suffers frequent data loss , and is routinely riddled with viruses ?
OK , aside from the Dept of Homeland Security .
Legacy code – System instability often results from running outdated limbic legacy code .
An impressive display of human intelligence is to queue up your fight - or - flight response when asking someone out on a date .
It ’s nice to be prepared just in case she tries to eat you after she rejects you .
DOS was great while it lasted , but it wo n’t help us save Antarctica .
Unreliable hardware –
It ’s only a matter of time before a critical component suffers an irreparable crash , and then the whole system gets dumped in a human landfill .
You ’d think we ’d have decent backup options by now , but at least we have the opportunity to sample hundreds of ice cream flavors before we go .
Damned # 3 .
I ’d say we ’re long overdue for an upgrade .
Icebergs have long gripped the popular imagination , whether as relatively run-of - the - mill floating hazards that cause “ unsinkable ’ ships to founder or , more recently , as enormous breakaway pieces of ice the size of states or small countries .
But , according to a paper published in this week ’s Science magazine , scientists have discovered that these floating ice islands–some as large as a dozen miles across–have a major impact on the ecology of the ocean around them , serving as “ hotspots ” for ocean life , with thriving communities of seabirds above and a web of phytoplankton , krill and fish below .
The icebergs hold trapped terrestrial material , which they release far out at sea as they melt .
Scientists have discovered that this process produces a “ halo effect ” with significantly increased nutrients , chlorophyll and krill out to a radius of more than 3 kilometers ( 2 miles ) .
Based on their new understanding of the role of icebergs in the ecosystem and the sheer number of icebergs in the Southern Ocean – the researchers counted more than 11,000 in satellite images of some 4,300 square miles of ocean –the scientists estimate that , overall , the icebergs are raising the biological productivity of nearly 40 percent of Antarctica ’s Weddell Sea .
Scientists also have begun to suspect , but argue for additional study , that icebergs may also play a surprising role in global climate regulation by removing carbon from the atmosphere .
The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) funded research was conducted by scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute , the San Diego Supercomputer Center , Scripps Institution of Oceanography , the University of San Diego and the University of South Carolina .
As manager of the U.S. Antarctic Program , NSF coordinates and provides logistical support to all U.S. research conducted on the southernmost continent .
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has designated NSF as the lead agency for the International Polar Year , a global scientific deployment to the Polar Regions that began in March 2007 .
NSF officials agreed that the new research may open a new and productive field for ecosystem research at the dawn of the Polar Year .
“ This research establishes yet another promising horizon for polar ecology , ” said Roberta Marinelli , organisms and ecosystems program director for the U.S. Antarctic Program .
“ And as we progress through the International Polar Year , NSF hopes to expand this work to learn yet more about these unique ecological niches and their significance to oceanic processes . ”

Accelerating the release of next - generation content
Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator ( AACS LA ) has developed the Advanced Access Content System , a specification for managing content stored on the next generation of prerecorded and recorded optical media for consumer use with PCs and CE devices .
Advanced Access Content System complements new innovations in the next - generation of optical discs , and enable consumers to enjoy next - generation content , including high - definition content .
“ But it appears from information we have that agents have a lot of discretion in doing these searches , and that there ’s a whole spectrum of reasons for doing them , ” she added .
The association is asking the government for better guidelines so corporate policies on traveling with proprietary information can be re-evaluated .
It is also asking whether corporations need to cut back on proprietary data that travelers carry .
“ We need to be able to better inform our business travelers what the processes are if their laptops and data are seized — what happens to it , how do you get it back , ” Ms. Gurley said .
She added : “ The issue is what happens to the proprietary business information that might be on a laptop .
Is information copied ?
Is it returned ?
We understand that the U.S. government needs to protect its borders .
But we want to have transparent information so business travelers know what to do .
Should they leave business proprietary information at home ? ”
Besides the possibility for misuse of proprietary information , travel executives are also concerned that a seized computer , and the information it holds , is unavailable to its owner for a time .
One remedy some companies are considering is telling travelers coming back into the country with sensitive information to encrypt it and e-mail it to themselves , which at least protects access to the data , if not its privacy .
In one recent case in California , a federal court went against current trends , ruling that laptop searches were a serious invasion of privacy .
“ People keep all sorts of personal information on computers , ” the court ruling said , citing diaries , personal letters , financial records , lawyers ’ confidential client information and reporters ’ notes on confidential sources .
That court ruled , in that specific case , that “ the correct standard requires that any border search of the information stored on a person ’s electronic storage device be based , at a minimum , on a reasonable suspicion . ”
In its informal survey last week , the association also found that 87 percent of its members said they would be less likely to carry confidential business or personal information on international trips now that they were aware of how easily laptop contents could be searched .
“ We are telling our members that they should prepare for the eventuality that this could happen and they have to think more about how they handle proprietary information , ” Ms. Gurley said .
“ Potentially , this is going to have a real effect on how international business is conducted . ”
The eagerly awaited new album by Prince is being launched as a free CD with a national Sunday newspaper in a move that has drawn widespread criticism from music retailers .
The Mail on Sunday revealed yesterday that the 10 - track Planet Earth CD will be available with an " imminent " edition , making it the first place in the world to get the album .
Planet Earth will go on sale on July 24 .
" It 's all about giving music for the masses and he believes in spreading the music he produces to as many people as possible , " said Mail on Sunday managing director Stephen Miron .
" This is the biggest innovation in newspaper promotions in recent times . "
The paper , which sells more than 2 m copies a week , will be ramping up its print run in anticipation of a huge spike in circulation but would not reveal how much the deal with Prince would cost .
One music store executive described the plan as " madness " while others said it was a huge insult to an industry battling fierce competition from supermarkets and online stores .
Prince 's label has cut its ties with the album in the UK to try to appease music stores .
The Entertainment Retailers Association said the giveaway " beggars belief " .
" It would be an insult to all those record stores who have supported Prince throughout his career , " ERA co-chairman Paul Quirk told a music conference .
" It would be yet another example of the damaging covermount culture which is destroying any perception of value around recorded music .
" The Artist Formerly Known as Prince should know that with behaviour like this he will soon be the Artist Formerly Available in Record Stores .
And I say that to all the other artists who may be tempted to dally with the Mail on Sunday . "
High street music giant HMV was similarly scathing about the plans .
Speaking before rumours of a giveaway were confirmed , HMV chief executive Simon Fox said : " I think it would be absolutely nuts .
I can't believe the music industry would do it to itself .
I simply can't believe it would happen ; it would be absolute madness . "
Prince , whose Purple Rain sold more than 11 m copies , also plans to give away a free copy of his latest album with tickets for his forthcoming concerts in London .
The singer had signed a global deal for the promotion and distribution of Planet Earth in partnership with Columbia Records , a division of music company Sony BMG .
A spokesman for the group said last night that the UK arm of Sony BMG had withdrawn from Prince 's global deal and would not distribute the album to UK stores .
U.S. Troops In Kurdistan ?
Its become something of an article of faith among a certain bien pensant foreign policy set that we should pull out of Iraq , save leave U.S. troops in Kurdistan .
This includes observers whose views on Iraq I typically respect , like Andrew Sullivan , who writes :
I 'll wait to hear what the president has to offer in detail before making a clear decision in my own mind .
But my view right now is that we should withdraw most combat troops by the middle of this year ; and leave a remaining force in the Kurdish region and along the Iraq - Turkey border .
Protecting the fledgling democracy in Kurdistan and reassuring Turkey should be our top priorities .
But here 's the rub folks .
The Turks do n't want us to put troops up in Kurdistan , or near their border .
It wo n't " reassure " them at all .
Quite the opposite , in fact , especially talk of NATO 'izing a foreign troop presence there ( the Turks will panic this is a precursor to an independent Kurdish state ) .
Meantime , and frankly , is Kurdistan really a " fledgling democracy " , as Andrew writes ?
I suspect one of the great under - reported stories of this war is all the reverse Arabization going on up in the North of the country .
It 's not all peachy clean up there , truth be told , and Kirkuk of course remains a mega tinderbox .
It 's likely about as " fledgling " a democracy as the rest of Iraq , all told , albeit of course enjoying less endemically poor security conditions .
The reality is that the Kurds ( who were petrified by the ISG report , which calls for more equitable sharing of oil revenue , and less federalism than Gelb - Biden ) -- must swallow painful concessions , or the risk of Turkey militarily intervening will likely become at least as high ( probably higher ) than Saudi and Iranian cross - border military meddling on behalf of their Sunni and Shi'a , respectively , proxies .
( And , as I said , U.S. troops garrisoned in Kurdistan are no panacea , indeed they would likely cause a major crisis , worse than the ' 02 - '03 one , in Turkish - American relations , probably unacceptably high tensions ) .
Again , all this is no longer about " victory " , but containing the damage from what could yet prove the biggest blunder in U.S. foreign policy history ( if it has n't already ) .
And sure , let 's call containing the worst spill - over , if this team is capable of it , " success " , if that makes POTUS happier .
But let 's keep focused now on realistic goals , not Alice in Wonderland stuff , OK ?
This means we wo n't be presiding over some glorious trinity of Shi'a , Sunni and Kurdish " moderates " singing kumbaya simply because we " surge " into Baghdad -- whilst slaying the Iranian Beast for good measure on our off hours .
Indeed , any surge , if it comes to that , must be viewed not as some Grand Push to Victory , but as a way to provide critical breathing space for intensive diplomatic and political efforts to somehow allow for an imperfect settlement to be broached that avoids A ) a massive , full - blown civil war in Iraq , and B ) major interventions in Iraq by regional players like Saudi Arabia , Iran and Turkey .
Our goal in Iraq , put simply , is to douse the raging fire our hubris and ineptitude set alight , as best and cleverly and forcefully ( given our limited resources ) that we can , hoping and praying our efforts at damage control can make some difference at this advanced hour , and keeping in mind we 're stuck with a national security team that has distinguished itself by its manifold blunders ( save Gates ) .
Important to keep in mind , as well , the reason the ISG is recommending a massive region - wide diplomatic crisis management effort involving Tel Aviv , Ramallah , Beirut , Damascus , Baghdad , Riyadh , Cairo , Teheran , and Amman , among other capitals , is because the region is in such a state of brewing chaos that any sources of further instability and conflict must be dampened down to keep the regional temperature under control , wherever and however possible .
Yes , the situation is this bad .
MORE : An excellent read from Scowcroft here .
Remember , he called all this correctly initially .
Let 's now take very seriously the advice of those who were on the right side of this debacle , not the wrong one , no ?

The First Day of a new job is almost always slow and uneventful .
A bit of paperwork in the morning , a quick walkthrough of the system , and possibly a trivial First Assignment .
Nick ’s First Day at the International Shipping Company ( as I ’ll call it ) was no exception .
In fact , it was so slow that it seemed like the First Day would last all week .
That is , until a frantic coworker burst into his cubicle .
“ Hey , New Guy , do you know anything about SQL Backups ? ” Before Nick could even nod affirmatively , he continued , “ ’ Cause , the backup on our Tracking Application is failing , and that ’s a big problem .
Oh , I ’m Dave by the way . ”
Nick immediately followed Dave to the server rom .
With a quick query of physical table sizes , Nick was able to determine exactly what the problem was .
The table “ TBLWEB00 ” was several dozen gigabytes and could not fit in the backup set .
Neither Nick nor Dave had any idea what was in that table .
Its name – and the fact that it was used by a web application – implied that anything could be stored there and its size implied that everything was stored there .
He peeked at the table schema and found something like this :
TABLE [ TBLWEB00 ] ( [ ICSROWID ] INT IDENTITY ( 1 , 1 ) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , [ LOGDATE0 ] DATETIME NULL , [ URL00000 ] VARCHAR ( 500 ) NULL , [ QUERY00 ] VARCHAR ( 500 ) NULL , [ QARG0001 ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ QVAL0001 ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , … [ CLIENTIP ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL )
A look at the data and it was obvious that the table was used to record page hits , along with referrers , IP address , query string , and really , anything else that ’d already in the web server log file along with a few columns of parsed / recoded data .
Since the table was n’t actually being used , Nick was able to drop some columns , a whole lot of rows , and cut the size of the database in half .
One question , however , remained : WTF was with that table ?
The Legend of Kyle Söze
“ Oh , that table , ” Dave responded hesitantly , “ yeah , that ’s one of Kyle’s .
You ’ll see a lot of that around here .
All I can say is just be glad you never have to work with him ! ”
As it turned out , Dave had n’t worked with Kyle , either .
In fact , no one had .
Most knew Söze ( as I ’ll call him ) through his work and everyone knew him through The Legend .
Long before anyone could remember , Kyle Söze was hired to help develop web and desktop applications .
Along with “ years and years of experience ” and a reputation for “ making things happen , ” Kyle brought along his own , unique way of doing things .
The pinnacle of his methodology lay in Database Design .
Design By Kyle
The rules of Kyle ’s database design are simple :
All identifiers ( table names , column names , etc ) must be exactly eight characters in length
All object names ( tables , views , etc ) must consist of a three letter type code ( “ TBL ” , “ QRY ” , etc ) and end with a two - digit numeric extension , starting at “ 00 ” .
The remaining three characters are used to identify the object
All tables must have an auto - identifier column named ISCROWID ( ISC for International Shipping Company )
Constraints ( including foreign key and unique ) shall not be used and enforced entirely in the UI
TBLWEB00 followed this format to a tee , as did hundreds of other Kyle Söze tables :
TABLE [ TBLISR00 ] ( [ ABCROWID ] INT IDENTITY ( 1 , 1 ) NOT NULL , [ CUSTNMBR ] CHAR ( 16 ) NULL , [ CNTYSTAT ] VARCHAR ( 100 ) NULL , [ CNTYOFIC ] VARCHAR ( 500 ) NULL , [ CONVDATE ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ INSTDATE ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ DATETRNA ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ DATETRNT ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ DATETRNC ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CONTACT1 ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CONTACT2 ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CNTEMAIL ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ PHONENM1 ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ PHONENM2 ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ FAXNUMBR ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL ) TABLE [ TBLISR01 ]
( [ ABCROWID ] INT IDENTITY ( 1 , 1 ) NOT NULL , [ ISRRECID ] INT NULL , [ CNTYSTAT ] VARCHAR ( 100 ) NULL , [ TAAGREMT ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ TAAGRECK ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ TTAGREMT ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ TTAGRECK ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , ... snip ... [ CLBILLED ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CLBILDCK ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CLINVOIC ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CONVMEET ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ CNVMETCK ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ SITEVIST ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL , [ SITVISCK ] VARCHAR ( 50 ) NULL ) ... etc ...
Kyle ’s coding Practices were just as “ unique . ”
The UI was responsible for enforcing business rules via JavaScript and code reuse was accomplished with copy / pasting .
Still , since Kyle “ made things happen , ” management gave him all the discretion he needed to continue .
Who were other developers to question Kyle Söze ?
The Usual Plan
With a portfolio of successful projects ( as in projects deployed to production ) , Kyle Söze was not an easy man to discredit .
Many young , brave developers tried and failed , losing significant amounts ( if not all ) of their own credibility along the way .
How could anyone rebuff , “ I ’ve been doing this for twenty years and only have a few hundred success stories , but what do I know ?
Yes , your way must be right ”
One clever developer , however , thought up a plan .
If they could get him on a larger project as an “ expert consultant ” ( as opposed to the lead developer ) , they might just be able to wear him down enough .
It was a crazy plan ; crazy enough to work .
The Fall of Kyle Söze
To help “ accommodate ” the “ expert consultant ” , the project team decided on “ democratic ” design process . ”
Any conflicting design ideas would be presented , discussed , and then voted on .
Every architect – regardless of his years of experience – would get one vote .
This made for a long and tedious process .
Week after week , Kyle would explain the one and only way to solve a particular problem .
Hours later , an “ alternative ” approach would be discussed , voted on , and then approved .
Kyle was the only one who would vote for his solution , and would always shake his head and scoff “ you guys are wrong , but what do I know , I ’m just the expert consultant ! ”
When they got to the topic of database design , however , Kyle ’s reaction was significantly different .
When a “ relational ” model won the design vote , Kyle became infuriated .
His way was the only way when it came to databases , and this was a battle he just refused to lose .
He threatened to escalate to management but was quickly rebuffed when the project manager reminded him that they had all already decided on a democratic approach .
Even more furious , Kyle stormed out of the meeting and left for the day .
Kyle Söze did not show up to work the following day and instead sent an email to his boss and the project manager .
It read “ I ’m quitting .
I ’ll work my last two weeks if you want , but unless I hear otherwise , I ’m not going to be coming in again . ”
At the next design meeting , the project manager passed out a copy of Kyle ’s email and tried to contact Kyle ’s boss to see what they should do .
Since his boss was on vacation , he never replied back to Kyle , and no one has ever heard from Kyle since .
Epilogue
All that remains today the great Kyle Söze at the International Shipping Company is a mountain of code and , of course , the Legend of Kyle Söze .
7. Cat Bombs
The earliest examples of cats being used in warfare dates back to the Ancient Egypt during a war against Persia .
The Persians , fully aware of the reverance that Egyptians paid to their felines , rounded up as many cats as they could find and set them loose on the battlefield .
When the Egyptians were faced with either harming the cats or surrendering , they chose the latter .
During World War I , cats were used in the trenches as an attempt to keep the rat population down and some cats were used as poison gas “ detectors ” .
The most creative way to use a cat as a weapon happened in World War II .
The United States ’ OSS ( Office of Strategic Services , the precursor of the CIA ) needed a way to guide bombs to sink German ships .
Somebody hit upon the inspiration that since cats have such a strong disdain of getting wet and always land on their feet that if you attached a cat to a bomb and drop it in the vicinity of a ship , the cat ’s instinct to avoid the water would force it to guide the bomb to the enemy ’s deck .
It is unclear how the cat was supposed to actually guide a bomb attached to it as it fell from the sky but the plan never got past the testing stages since the cats had a bad habit of becoming unconscious mid-drop .
Not to be outdone by its predecessor , the CIA also attempted to use cats but this time as a bugging device during the Cold War .
Although a disaster as a guided bomb , the CIA thought that a cat would make the perfect covert listening device in a project known as Operation Acoustic Kitty .
They attempted to surgically alter the cat by placing a bugging device inside him and running an antenna through its tail .
The project took five years and $ 15 million dollars before the first field test hit a slight snag when the bugged kitty was released near a Russian compound in Washington and was immediately hit by a car while crossing the street .
The project was ended soon after .

6. War Pigs
You are headed into battle against an army that is using war elephants , the tanks of ancient times .
They weigh several tons , are heavily armored and extremely difficult to kill .
How do you stop them ?
If you ’re the Roman Army you may have used Incendiary Pigs also known as War Pigs .
Pliny the Elder wrote about a method of covering pigs in tar , pitch , or other flammable substances and then setting them ablaze while attempting to drive the conflagrant swine towards the enemy .
The squealing and movement of the burning hogs headed toward the enemy army would cause elephants and horses to flee in panic .
Besides Pliny ’s accounts , there are no official records of war pigs actually being used in actual battle .

5. Land Mine Detecting Rats
The earliest examples of using animals as weapons usually involves setting them on fire and pointing them at your enemy ’s villages or camps .
The obvious flaw in this method is that there is just as much chance that the burning animal may turn around and cause destruction to your camp as it may your opponent ’s .
Rats were used mostly in this capacity as living ambient torches until they became used in one of the earliest examples of biological warfare .
In 1346 , during the seige of the Genoese city of Kaffa by Tartar forces under Janibeg , plague was spreading among the Tartars outside the city weakening their chance at keeping the seige going .
In a last ditch attempt , the Mongol army started catapulting dead rats and corpses of plague victims into the city in hopes to spread the disease .
A few Genoese ships tried to escape from the spreading plague and made their way back to Italy where the Black Death than spread throughout Europe .
The latest use of rats in the military are in detecting landmines ..
A Belgian company has trained African pouch rats , also called Gambian Pouch Rats , to locate buried bombs and landmines .
The rats are trained to smell explosive material by associating it with a food reward .
They have several advantages over the use of using dogs in locating landmines since they are cheaper to train and their small size will rarely trigger a mine as they find them .
They are currently being used in Mozambique to clear the landmines from its civil war .

4. Killer Dolphins
The use of dolphins for military operations did n’t start until the 1960s when the US Navy established the Marine Mammal Program which was originally used to design better torpedoes .
Impressed with the dolphin ’s intelligence , they started expanding the program and started training them in a variety of uses which ranged from helping them guide lost divers to killing enemy divers .
Under a program called “ Swimmer Nullification ” , hypodermic needles containing compressed CO2 were attached to the snout of a dolphin which was trained to inject it into divers who were found in restricted areas .
Once injected , the compressed carbon dioxide would expand inside the diver which would kill him and allow his corpse to float to the surface .
It ’s claimed that 40 Viet Cong frogmen and two Americans were killed during the Vietnam War by dolphins in this manner
Currently , dolphins are being used in Iraq and in the Gulf region to search and find mines that can be marked so that ships can avoid them until a demolitions team can be dispatched .

3. Pigeon Guided Missles
Pigeons have been used as primitive form of airmail since the Middle Ages and during the seige of Paris during the Franco - Prussian War , they were one of the only lines of communications left open for Parisians trying to get messages out of the city .
Messenger pigeons were used extensively during World War
One to carry orders from bases to the front lines where telephone lines had not yet been lain .
One pigeon , Cher Ami , even received military honors by saving the lives of 194 American soldiers who were stuck behind enemy lines .
Cher Ami was able to deliver messages from the stranded troops even after being shot in the chest .
During World War Two , American behaviorist B.F. Skinner attempted to use pigeons as the guidance system in missles .
The program was called Project Pigeon and worked by placing three pigeons in the nose of a bomb with a special lens that displayed an image of the target on a screen .
The pigeons were trained to recognize the target and peck at it if it moved off - center .
The placement of the pigeons ’ pecking would then move the bomb ’s tail surfaces and direct the payload to the target .
Skinner used three pigeons to control the bomb ’s direction by majority rule which he felt would be more fail - proof than using only one bird .
The military cancelled the project during testing because the idea was felt to be too radical .

2. Military Insects
The Romans found bees to be an extremely useful military weapon .
They would collect beehives and place them on catapults and fire them into beseiged cities or an attacking army .
Castle defenders adopted this idea during the Middle Ages and would drop an occasional beehive onto the heads of an attacking army .
During World War
One , the soft light emanating from glow worms were used by soldiers to read maps of the battlefield in the trenches at night .
Spiders were used by weapons manufacturers to spin silk that was used for the production of crosshairs in bomb sights .
The Germans used the Colorado potato bug to destroy potato crops in France during World War One and allegedly dropped boxes of potato bugs over Great Britain during World War Two to starve the English into submission .
In 1963 , experiments were done to train “ guard bugs ” .
The hope was that mosquitos , fleas , and other insects would act differently when they encountered humans and could be used as an insect tripwire to alert when an enemy was near .
Currently , honey bees are now being used to detect landmines .
Researchers have had success by putting trace amounts of target chemicals used in explosives into the honey bees ’ food supply .
The bees are then released and will instinctively forage for food where landmines are buried since their senses can detect the same chemicals that they are conditioned to believe is where the food is located .
By observing the locations where most of the bees hover looking for food , the researchers are able to detect the probability of where landmines located .
The bees are about 97 % accurate in finding landmines in controlled situations .

1. Bat Bombers
After the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor , Americans were looking for revenge against the Japanese .
Lytle Adams , a dental surgeon from Pennsylvania , had been touring caves in New Mexico and had observed bats in flight when he hit upon an idea of outfitting the bats with incendiary bombs and dropping them from a plane to wreak havoc on a city below .
He wrote up a proposal about his bat bombs and sent it to the Whitehouse which accepted it and assigned it to the Army Air Force for research and development .
After experimenting with a variety of bat species , the free - tailed bat was selected because there were plenty of them available and they could fly with a one ounce incendiary payload which was attached to its chest by a pin and string .
The hope was that a bat would seek a barn or building to sleep in at which point the timed - fuse would set the incendiary off which could cause fires in the buildings .
Testing did not go as well as planned when some of the bats escaped with live incendiary boms and set fire to a hangar and a general ’s car .
Several more years of testing were needed and the project was traded between military branches until the idea was finally shelved due to time constraints .

Dean Farrar Street , blocked by rubble
Enlarge Image
Emergency services were called to Dean Farrar Street in Westminster after the collapse at about 1600 BST on Tuesday .
One injured person was taken to hospital but fire crews were at first unable to reach the trapped man .
He was removed from the building , which is being renovated , at about 0130 BST .
The fire service said the operation to free him was " difficult and dangerous " .
Crews used a crane to reach the man , believed to be a builder .
A fire service spokesman said his condition was stable throughout the rescue attempt .
He is now being treated at the Royal London Hospital .
The five - storey building houses the office of Labour chairwoman Hazel Blears .
None of her staff were hurt .
Police said structural failure may have been to blame and it was down to " good fortune " it was not more serious .
Metropolitan Police Commander Steve Allen said : " There 's no evidence at this early stage that the damage has been caused by an explosion . "
Six fire engines and 50 firefighters were sent to the scene .
Fibre optic cameras and listening devices were used during the rescue .
' Showering down '
Eyewitness Anthony Gilberthorpe told BBC News 24 : " I heard a mighty explosion and about two floors and the roof of a building to my left hand side was literally showering down in front of me .
I was just sitting in the office when all of a sudden the whole building shook
Justin Linger
" So I literally threw myself , literally jumped up and threw myself , to the right hand side of the road not knowing whether I was going to be hit . "
Mr Gilberthorpe saw a van driver step out of his vehicle moments before it was hit by a huge piece of debris .
" What I did see which was quite shocking was a huge boulder went right through his vehicle , literally where he had been 15 seconds previously and I think that 's the most frightening thing that I actually witnessed .
' Calm evacuation '
A spokesman for Ms Blears , who is running for the deputy Labour leadership , said she spent several hours in her offices on the fourth and fifth floors with six other MPs at lunchtime today .
Six of her campaign volunteers were in the offices , part of the Queen 's Gate building , at the time of the collapse .
One of them , Sean Newman , said : " Some of us who were upstairs felt the building shake .
" Then we heard the alarm go off and left our stuff to go downstairs .
It was a calm evacuation , but they would not let us go back in . "
He estimated there were about 50 businesses based in the premises .
Justin Linger was also working in the building at the time of the collapse .
" I was just sitting in the office when all of a sudden the whole building shook , " he told BBC News 24 .
" As one of my colleagues put it , the building disco danced . "
Scotland Yard said the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) would be responsible for determining the cause of the collapse .

There is one thing I hate about Erlang , and it is records .
It is not so much that the syntax is annoying ( yet I am getting used to it ) , but you cannot use that syntax for dynamic field access ; records are a compile - time feature .
So , without using Yariv 's Smerl for something like this , I opted for a simpler solution .
Records are tuples after all , and you can get record information in a list .
So , you can use these two facts to create a function to get the field you specify .
Not anything stellar , but for dynamic record access , it works : I could n't find something like " lists : find / 2 " , so I implemented my own .
But the main function is " get_rec_value / 3 " .
So you do this : 1 > rd( person , {id , name , email} ) .
2 > get_rec_value( name , # person{name= " Brian " } , record_info( fields , person ) ) . " Brian " For fun , I also did setting record value .3 > set_rec_value( email , " c " , # person{name = " Brian " , id = " 1 " , email= " b" } , record_info ( fields , person ) ) .
I know this stuff looks really simple , but since I thought this was a bit of a nuisance , the fact that I cannot access records without hardcoding the values , something needed to be written .
Did I miss something though ?
I 'd like to know .
Please comment . :)
Israel was a " full partner " in American and British intelligence failures that exaggerated former president Saddam Hussein 's nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programs before the US - led invasion of Iraq , a report by an Israeli military research centre has alleged .
" The failures of this war indicate weaknesses and inherent flaws within Israeli intelligence and among Israeli decision - makers , " Brigadier - General Shlomo Brom wrote in an analysis for Tel Aviv University 's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies .
Israeli intelligence services and political leaders provided " an exaggerated assessment of Iraqi capabilities " , raising " the possibility that the intelligence picture was manipulated " , wrote General Brom , former deputy commander of the Israeli military 's planning division .

TURNABOUT
It appears that the media is quickly adopting a more sensible attitude toward Uri Geller and his pretentious claims .
Gone are the days when they were dazzled by his silly stories .
They ’ve begun to use quotation marks on certain modifiers .
In recent articles ( pertinent words emphasized here in red ) about his current “ copyright suit , ” in which he moans that the use of eight seconds of “ copyrighted material ” in an almost 15 - minute clip violates his “ rights , ” he is referred to as “ psychic ” Uri Geller and another article says that … The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) urged a judge Monday to dismiss a frivolous lawsuit filed by Uri Geller – the " paranormalist " famous for seemingly bending spoons with his mind – because of its blatant attempt to silence critic Brian Sapient with bogus copyright claims .
Geller 's quest to shut down Sapient 's criticism started when Sapient uploaded video to YouTube challenging Geller 's assertions about his mental powers .
The 14 - minute segment came from a NOVA television program , but Geller and his corporation Explorologist Ltd. claimed the video infringed its own copyrights and had the video removed from YouTube .
Sapient filed a counter - notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , had the video restored to YouTube , and sued Geller for misrepresentation .
Go to randi.org/uri/index.html to see this clip .
As Sapient was challenging Geller 's meritless claims , Explorologist filed a separate lawsuit against Sapient .
The suit includes more bogus charges , with many of them based on the assertion that Explorologist has the copyright to eight seconds of the introductory footage in the NOVA video .
EFF 's motion to dismiss the case points out the numerous holes in this claim , arguing that even if it were true , eight seconds is a classic fair use – especially given the critical purposes of the use .
The brief also argues that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects Sapient from infringement claims and other charges in Explorologist 's complaint , immunizing Sapient as the publisher of third - party content .
" Copyright law is meant to protect creative artists , not hypersensitive public figures who do n't like criticism , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Jason Schultz .
" The First Amendment does not allow Geller or his corporation to silence legitimate discussion of his abilities . "
Meanwhile , Sapient 's lawsuit against Geller is still pending before the Northern District of California .
The suit asks for damages due to Geller 's DMCA violation , a declaratory judgment that the NOVA video does not infringe Geller 's copyrights , and for Geller to be restrained from bringing any further legal action against Sapient in connection to the clip .
This use of quotation marks is to be applauded , and the tendency toward correct evaluation is obvious …
BUT WHICH WITCH ?
An anonymous reader submits I want you to sit down for this one because you ’re liable to break a rib when you start laughing .
As you know , Salem , Massachusetts has become something of a draw for modern day witches based on its famous past .
According to some reports , 10 percent of the population in Salem are witches .
Recently , these local witches got up in arms about out - of - town witches hustling in on their action .
They resented visiting fortune tellers who arrived in traveling caravans during the fall Halloween season , and so they sought to enact protectionist trade laws .
I now direct your attention to the following article : salemnews.com/psychicfreeforall
It is a veritable gold mine of the kind of statements that only a skeptic could truly appreciate .
For example : City councilors , hoping to crack down on fraudulent fortunetellers , are trying to define exactly how a psychic can become licensed to set up shop in the Witch City .
They want candidates to undergo a criminal background check and to either live in or run a business in Salem for at least a year .
But many psychics want the city to go a step further – make sure they 're actually qualified to predict the future .
Laurie Cabot , the official witch of Salem , says :
It 's become a free - for - all .
Anyone who says they 're psychic can come into the city .
We do n't even know where they come from .
We do n't know their qualifications Did you catch that ?
The official witch of Salem is demanding a part of the licensing process , making sure that a witch is qualified to predict the future !
Would n't that mean that NOBODY would pass the license exam , including Ms. Cabot ?
Alas , no .
From the story :
When Cabot became the first person in Salem to be granted a fortuneteller 's license decades ago , she said she first had to perform a legitimate reading in front of a police officer .
" He sat down with me , I did a psychic reading , he was pleased with the reading , and I got my license , " Cabot said .
A legitimate reading in front of a police officer …
So Salem 's cops are giving an official stamp of legitimacy to the town 's witches ?
Guess they know what side their tourist dollars are buttered on .
Doug Johnson is a psychic at Pyramid Books who wants candidates to show their experience and training before becoming licensed .
He says , from the article : Every reader in this room is legitimate .
But there are nuts out there – people that are not mentally there .
Really ?
A woman paid more than $ 2,000 for readings at a Salem shop , where she was told she had a black aura around her .
The psychic told the city councilors :
Then one day she came into my shop crying .
I said , “ You do n't have a black aura .
Sit down and I 'll show you your aura on my machine . ”
And it was blue and wonderful And , Randi , I hope your heart has fully recovered , because this next one may be hazardous to your health : " There has to be criteria or you 're going to get garbage coming here , " Barbara Szafranski , the owner of Angelica of the Angels , predicted .
" Everybody here is a legitimate person who 's worked for years and years …
When you do a reading , you hold a person 's life right in your hands .
We have people come to us who are willing to commit suicide , who wo n't go to a psychiatrist , so they come to us . "
The end result was that the city council did pass protectionist measures , but they do not require a test of one 's ability to foretell the future .
But apparently it was enough to make someone mad .
Since the measure passed , the local witches have been finding dead raccoons left on their doorsteps !
Hey , the JREF – as always , dead raccoons or not – stands ready to design and conduct tests of witches , and to award our million - dollar prize .
Howcum the city councilors of Salem have n’t become aware of that fact , we must ask ?
And there ’s much more on this at foxnews.com / story /0,2933,279035,00.html...
Reader Joe Niedbala adds to this item :
There ’s just so much wrong coming from so many angles on this story .
Once again a town looks to money and tourist revenue over common sense , rational thinking , and the protection of its citizens and visitors from outright fraud .
I think one of the most telling and sad quotations is this : “ To put 40 psychics in the same street is outrageous , ” Stathopoulos said before the meeting .
“ We hold people 's lives in the palm of our hand sometimes . ”
I have to commend the first part of the quote , though not as the speaker intended it to be taken , of course , and I am completely appalled at the notion of the second half – both with regards to the hubris and the sad reality it implies .
SCAM ARTIST JAILED Reader Tom Considine – and a few others – alerted us to some news .
Grace Uwanawich , 63 , of Chevy Chase , Maryland , went by the name " Mrs. Grace , ” and represented herself as a “ native American ” psychic .
She has now pleaded guilty in circuit court to tricking clients out of hundreds of thousands of dollars , and received a sentence of 18 months in jail .
She ’d talked several vulnerable middle - aged women into giving her these sums to rid themselves of curses .
I suspect that ethnic and cultural backgrounds were responsible for such gullibility .
Ms. Uwanawich – that name alone should have been a tip - off !
– pleaded guilty to felony theft and two counts of fortune - telling , the latter of which is a misdemeanor in Montgomery County , as well as in most other jurisdictions , though it ’s seldom enforced .
She must also pay $ 257,000 in restitution to four former clients .
Court records showed that this was not her first brush with the law .
She was arrested in the 1990s in connection with similar scams .
Her appeal to the court was of the expected sort : I promise in Jesus ' name I 'm not going to do this again …
I know it sounds like I 'm using Jesus .
I am ashamed .
Uwanawich advertised her services by handing out fliers that promoted her psychic powers .
Then , when the victims visited her at her apartment , she resorted to the old tried - and - true evidence of the curse exhibited by an egg that Uwanawich cracked in front of them , that contained blood and hair and smelled pretty bad .
In the specific case used to put her away in jail , Uwanawich wiped out a Poolesville woman 's bank accounts , maxed out her credit cards , and tricked her into buying a Mercedes Benz that she never got to drive .
Uwanawich 's daughter , Christine Miller , ended up driving that vehicle .
Then Uwanawich stopped giving the woman appointments .
Another of her woman victims said that Uwanawich told her that an ailing nephew would die unless she eliminated her family 's curse .
In amounts that grew larger , the woman had eventually given the scam artist more than $ 60,600 .
SOUTH AFRICA BACK IN THE WOO - WOO NEWS Readers Owen Swart and Ruaan Kellerman brought this to our attention .
A teenager , Francesca Zackey , has been featured on their local news .
She is a 17 - year - old girl who lives in Benoni , South Africa , and claims to have had Virgin Mary visions , a perennial favourite of teens who want attention , and unfortunately very easily accepted by the hungry public .
Hundreds of faithful Christians have been visiting her house hoping to receive blessings , etc .
But the story has now developed further , tragically so .
A 37 - year - old woman named Amal Nassif has , on the advice of Zackey , blinded herself .
Zackey told her that she , too , could witness the Virgin Mary just by staring directly into the sun .
Now she ’s complaining that at least four other people also damaged their eyes after being told " the lady " would make the sun spin , and thus confirm her presence to the believers .
Nassif went to a renowned eye doctor , who was horrified at what he saw .
“ This is an absolute disaster and a tragedy , " he said .
" I am shattered .
Apparently this has happened to other people , and must be exposed . "
He said that the sun 's rays had burnt Nassif 's eyes in the same way they burn a piece of paper when focused through a magnifying glass .
Her central vision , which allows a person to focus in on certain items , is " severely damaged " in both eyes .
Then he piously added : Let 's hope that God is kind to her and she recovers .
Wait a minute , doctor .
Instead of invoking the same brand of claptrap that got this woman into her plight , the same sort of misguided faith that some deity would appear to her , why not stick with your expertise , and invoke medical science ?
Get real !
The deluded teenager Zackey says that Nassif 's problem is not her fault , and that she is praying for the deluded woman .
Now she claims that the sun is still spinning each day , but should only have been looked at during sunset .
Brilliant .
I guess you forgot to provide that divine revelation ?
In any case , such a stupid act can bring about that sort of damage at any hour of the day .
Well , thousands have continued to flock to Zackey – who ’s obviously enjoying her stardom , since the first “ sighting ” in May – and they are still being encouraged to seek the lady inside the sun .
When will South Africa finally decide to join the rest of the rational world …?
MORE POLYGRAPH NONSENSE
Reader Charles Gulledge I 'm writing in reference to a recent SWIFT article at randi.org / jr/2007-05/052507.html # i6 that caught my attention .
Dr. Park states that " [t ] he polygraph , in fact , has ruined careers , but never uncovered a single spy . "
I would add that it has also cost the US Department of Defense at least one experienced and dedicated engineer , and likely many more .
While I was an engineer for a defense company , there was a security update policy .
This generally meant simply filling out a few forms every 5 years to ensure that Security knew where you lived and what organizations you belonged to .
Following the arrests of spies Aldrich Ames and John Walker Sr. and Jr. , the 5 - year updates began to include mandatory polygraphs .
Whether the policy before these events included any polygraphs , I do not know , but I 'm led to believe that the policy before was less stringent , being mostly for randomly selected individuals and those in sensitive positions .
I would caution anyone who is asked by a DoD polygrapher whether they think polygraphy should be used to identify security threats , that citing the Aldrich Ames matter as an example of its inefficacy – as I did – is not a wise move .
My first polygraph did n't go well ; nor my second ; nor the interview with the polygraph supervisor sent to investigate why my tests were n't going well ; nor the third and final test .
During that final test , I actually had to point out to my polygrapher that , no , I did not know whether it was raining , because I could n't see or hear anything outside the shielded room that I had been in for the preceding 4 hours .
At that point , I believe I was finally labeled untestable .
Despite being treated as though I was suspected of ... something , I was never given any indication of whether or not I was actually under such suspicion .
On a happier note , I am quite looking forward to attending TAM 5.5 .
It will be my 5th , or rather 4.5th .
Every TAM has been better than the last – how could it not be , when an ordinary guy like me gets to chat with James Randi and Richard Dawkins , have dinner with John Rennie , and an ice - cream with Phil Plait , not to mention the dozens of new friends my wife and I have made in the last 4 years .
I expect nothing less amazing of TAM 5.5 , even in its abbreviated form .
MORE INFRARED STUFF
Re last week ’s discussions of remote - control devices , reader Gary Mussar writes : I do remember using a TV with a sonic remote .
It was n't ultra-sonic because I could definitely hear it ( but I was much younger then ) .
And yes , jingling keys would change channels , etc .
The deployment of infrared ( IR ) remotes changed all that .
The system was more robust , however even infra-red remotes can exhibit unusual behavior .
I had an old Sony TV with an infrared remote that would turn off / on by itself .
I did n't search for ghostly causes since that bothered the engineer in me .
I tried shutting the curtains to try and prevent stray signals from neighbors from interfering – with no success .
I covered the IR sensor on the TV with black tape and that seemed to stop the behavior but that also meant I could n't use the remote , which bothered the lazy man in me .
This did seem to indicate that it was an external signal causing the problem , and the signal was likely IR rather that some other kind of electrical interference .
We were close to some powerful radio station transmitters .
It was a big step forward in the search .
I tried hiding the remote , with no success .
This seemed to indicate that it was n't the remote malfunctioning .
After months of trying stuff , I finally clued in to the fact that the weirdness always occurred shortly after I turned on the lights in the TV room .
We had switched to compact fluorescent bulbs and I found that some of these bulbs emit a large amount of garbage IR as they warm up .
At some point during the warm up , the garbage IR was interpreted by the TV sensor as on on / off signal .
I recently found that my PDA – which has an optional IR keyboard – is also affected by compact fluorescents as they warm up .
I am slightly saddened that your JREF prize is currently safe from our magic TV .
Well , it was n’t in any real danger , Gary …
SCIENTOLOGY FURTHER DEFINED Reader David Rice : The " Association of Human Detoxification Specialists , " and the “ International Academy of Detoxification Specialists ” are not “ Scientology offshoots " – this is Scientology .
The two Scientology front groups , and hundreds of others , are run by ABLE , which is itself a front group for Scientology Inc. 's " Sea Org . "
The so - called " New York City Detox Center " has been criticized by physicians as dangerous and worthless , yet the City has sent hundreds of thousands of dollars into Scientology Inc. 's coffers to " detox " the city 's fire fighters and emergency care providers .
Probably a “ faith - based ” decision , David …
THE SAM HARRIS QUESTION
I ’ve recently been advised by several readers that my acceptance of Sam Harris – author of The End of Faith – might be unwise .
To them I ’ll answer , no , but I ’m cautious about some of his personal beliefs in other directions .
I just ca n’t understand how such an accomplished author can have gaping blind spots in his belief spectrum , though I ’m not a stranger to that phenomenon .
Many times , following one of my lectures , I ’ve been approached by an academic who says something like : “ While I agree with your assessment of Sylvia Browne , UFOs , and homeopathy , Mr. Randi , I saw a book written about the Bermuda Triangle , and it was very convincing ! ” Sam Harris , in The End of Faith , made a comment that rather disturbed me .
I admit that I put the feeling aside rather than immediately addressing it , perhaps in hope that something else would be said to neutralize what I saw as a collapse of Mr. Harris ’ critical thinking faculty .
That comment was :
There also seems to be a body of data attesting to the reality of psychic phenomena , much of which has been ignored by mainstream science .
The dictum that " extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence " remains a reasonable guide in these areas , but this does not mean that the universe is n't far stranger than many of us suppose .
It is important to realize that a healthy , scientific skepticism is compatible with a fundamental openness of mind .
I ’ll repeat myself on that last sentence : an open mind , yes , but not gaping hole through which reason leaks out and blind belief seeps in to replace it .
In a footnote to the above paragraph , Sam Harris refers us to Dean Radin ’s The Conscious Universe : The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena , Rupert Sheldrake ’s The Sense of Being Stared At : And Other Aspects of the Extended Mind and to other books , as his authority for having such a belief .
Then he adds this astonishing – certainly for him – proposition :
There may even be some credible evidence for reincarnation .
It ’s very evident that Mr. Harris has not carefully examined either Radin ’s book , or anything written by Sheldrake .
If he had subjected that material to the same proper scrutiny which he applied to religion and the “ God ” question he so well handled , I ’m sure he ’d have come to the same conclusions that I have – that there ’s nothing in them , that there ’s no “ reality ” to psychic phenomena , nor to reincarnation , other than the conviction of some incautious or seriously deluded individuals who can attract publishers who know the naivety of the book market .
Mr. Harris also has an attraction to mysticism , particularly to Eastern aspects of it , and appears to give credence to some of its tenets .
To my mind , metaphysical claims and notions that result from mystical “ experiences ” – which can take place entirely within the individuals mind – cannot be accepted without accompanying , supporting , strong , empirical evidence .
Surely that is not too much to ask ?
GODDESS AT LARGE
An anonymous reader tells us :
Here ’s a story about a girl who was declared to be inhabited by a goddess .
It does n't seem as harmful as it could be , but people give money to the girl 's family and ask for good fortune .
It does n't seem as bad as the " god men " you have written about .
I also saw this story mentioned on ABC news which treated the girl as if she were the real thing , probably out of " cultural respect . "
The worshiped goddess supposedly enters the girl 's body , just hangs around inside the girl for a while , and then leaves .
I wonder if the Hindu and Buddhist priests that identified her – if kept separate – could tell exactly when the goddess leaves the girl .
I wonder if the girl could tell when the goddess leaves her body – or is even there to begin with .
The mention of reaching puberty gives me some ideas .
I would hate for anyone to waste their money and get a false blessing from the girl .
We ’re sent to iht.com / articles/2007/06/14/news/goddess.php for the story .

STRANGE MESSAGES Reader Sheldon
Helms refers us to sj-r.com/ sections/news/stories/116767.asp to learn of the latest technological miracle , which Sheldon has quite well in perspective …
I thought of you recently when reading this story out of Palatine , Illinois .
It seems that an elementary school science teacher has been monitoring more than just her infant on a newly purchased “ baby monitor . ”
Since Sunday , she 's been able to view video of NASA astronauts in the space shuttle Atlantis ..
One can only imagine how a grainier picture being picked up on equipment owned by a less rational person might have played out in the media .
A strict Catholic may have claimed to be seeing images of the Virgin Mary .
A UFOlogist may have claimed to have irrefutable proof of little men in space .
And we can only speculate how it all might be explained by a Scientologist – perhaps another visit from Xenu ?
At any rate , I 'm sure this story wo n't garner nearly as much interest as the numerous loonies who believe their coffee pots or other appliances are sending them messages from Beyond , but it 's cute nonetheless .
At least this scenario involves tuned circuits , which percolators can only aspire to .
I do n’t find it difficult to accept that certain frequencies – or harmonics thereof – can be picked up unexpectedly by one of the myriad of receivers available today .
Such monitors are available in frequencies from 49 MHz to 2.4 GHz .
Maybe the CIA should drop a few into Afghanistan and Iraq … ?
FROM WAY BACK Reader Garth Atkinson of Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , takes me back to another phase of my life , when radio featured largely in my activities via Long John Nebel and his guests .
Garth writes :
You certainly do n't know me , nor are you likely to meet me , however ... before either one of us kicks the bucket – I 'm 64 – I want to thank you for your contribution to my education .
As a young teenager in a tiny fishing village in Nova Scotia I began listening to Long John 's Party Line on WOR and later on WNBC .
The “ skip ” is great from 1 a.m. ( midnight in NYC ) to about 4 a.m. , later in the winter .
The “ skip ” referred to is the Heavyside Layer Effect in which AM radio signals are inadvertently reflected to remote localities .
And WOR - AM had a 100,000 - watt signal in those days …!
As the show evolved from people like " The Mystic Barber " ( The Mystic Tonsorial artist of Brooklyn ) and all the flying saucer abductees , etc. , I was fascinated with the level of knowledge and wisdom that I found coming from people like yourself , Lester Del Rey , Fred Pohl and many others , even Al Lotman , in his calmer moments .
This was my first exposure to eclectic chat among fine minds with broad knowledge .
I later attended university and worked in many fields , but my first and most effective exposure to a world that was not to be experienced in my little fishing community was with that program and the one you later had .
Guilty as charged .
I inherited the show from Nebel when he suddenly switched to WNBC .
I carried on there for almost two years , until I was removed under strange circumstances .
But that ’s another matter altogether , for another time …
I feel sad now that I never said this to Mr. Nebel while he was alive ...
Not that it would have meant a lot to him but that I feel one should offer thanks for a kindness one receives , even though it may have been unintended .
You are to be congratulated , as well , for the wonderful work you have done and are still doing to debunk the charlatans and idiots among us and promote rational and critical thought .
Thanks ... and may you continue your work in good health ' til you 're a hundred !
Only a hundred , Garth ?
I ’ve planned beyond that point …!
COMMENTS
A few responses to the latest Swift from reader “ David ” : You mention the British " Braniac " television programme .
While its dowsing trial seems to have been fair , there have been cases where they 've " sexed up " the experiments ( read explosions ) to make better television .
Ben Goldacre has covered this before at badscience .
net/?cat=58
Also , your piece on Adam Dreamhealer brought something to mind .
Dr. Schwarc z's column said ...
And suddenly , there it was !
A four foot tall black bird staring at Adam .
Surely a sight that would make any ornithologist 's mouth water .
In any case , faster than you can say Google , the bird downloaded all the information in the universe , whatever that may mean , into the teenager 's brain , and his healing career took flight .
This sounds a lot like " the Guide Mark II " which appears in the form of a large black bird in Douglas Adams ' " Mostly Harmless " , the fifth book in the Hitchhikers ' Guide to the Galaxy trilogy .
The guide / bird is essentially omniscient .
I wonder if Adam read Adams ' book when he was younger .
It was published when he was five years old , or so .
Well , it would be interesting if someone were to look up that Adams material and compare it with the silly story Adam is offering …
THE LATEST HOVIND Reader Jim McGuire of Hanover , Pennsylvania , writes :
As an avid SWIFT reader , I want to first express my deepest thanks for your fine work in promoting skepticism and rational thought .
Your example of intellectual honesty should be an inspiration to us all .
I thought you might be interested in this recent post on the CSE ( Creation Science Evangelism ) blog : cseblogs.com/?p=75
As you probably know , CSE was founded in 1989 by " Dr. " Kent Hovind , AKA " Doctor Dino . "
Surely one of the most ( in ) famous hucksters of Young Earth Creationism , Hovind is now enjoying the hospitality of the Federal Correctional Institution in Edgefield , SC , having been convicted as a Federal tax cheat in July 2006 .
This revealing blog entry not only updates us on Hovind 's current status , but also includes a fascinating transcript of a recent conversation the erstwhile minister had with the Almighty Himself .
This is truly a must - read .
I am reminded of a half - humorous warning I received many years ago :
It 's okay to talk to yourself , but you should start to worry if you begin to answer back .
May 24 , 2007  -- ABC
News has learned new details about what the intelligence community was telling the White House before the Iraq War about the challenges that would face the United States after the fall of Saddam Hussein .
In stark contrast to the WMD fiasco , the intelligence community was largely on target about what the United States would face in postwar Iraq .
But it 's not a slam dunk .
In some ways , the situation in Iraq is actually worse than the intelligence community predicted .
In January 2003 , the CIA 's National Intelligence Council delivered to the White House two reports predicting what the United States would face in Iraq .
The reports , which until now were classified , are expected to be released by the Senate Intelligence Friday .
Officials with access to the reports read excerpts to ABC News .
The first report is titled " Principal Challenges in Post - Saddam Iraq . "
It paints a picture of an Iraq beset by ethnic violence and unlikely to accept democracy .
Here are some highlights :
Iraq is unlikely to break apart , but it is " a deeply divided society . "
There is " a significant chance " that groups would " engage in violent conflict ... unless there is an occupying force to prevent them from doing so . "
Neighboring states could " jockey for position ... fomenting ethnic strife inside Iraq . "
" Iraq 's political culture does not foster political liberalism or democracy . "
" A generation of Iraqis " who have been subjected to Saddam 's repression are " distrustful of surrendering or sharing power . "
Al Qaeda could operate from the countryside unless there is a strong central power in Baghdad .
There would be " a heightened terrorist threat " that " after an initial spike would decline after three to five years . "
The second report is titled " Regional Consequences of Regime Change in Iraq . "
This report warns of potential instability in the region , especially if the war were to be long and violent .
It also warns that al Qaeda could exploit U.S. focus on Iraq by re-establishing its presence in Afghanistan .
This report , however , also outlines the potential regional benefits of success in Iraq .
For example , it says success in Iraq " would increase the willingness of regional governments to cooperate with the U.S. "

Blu-ray and AACS
I bought an 800 $ ( CAD ) Blueray burner and bought the " Lord of War " movie and will be working on this ( for a while i guess ) .
PowerDVD BD does n't play the movie properly AT ALL ( looks like when you have a defective pipeline in your video card ) .
WinDVD plays it just fine , and i'm about to go through the memory with WinHEX .
Here is what the directory structure looks like :
Volume in drive E is LOGICAL_VOLUME_ID

We need to kick DRM in the butt !
Well , since i was interested in HD DVD , i am now interested in blueray .
I bought an 800 $ ( CAD ) Blueray burner and bought the " Lord of War " movie and will be working on this ( for a while i guess ) .
PowerDVD BD does n't play the movie properly AT ALL ( looks like when you have a defective pipeline in your video card ) .
WinDVD plays it just fine , and i'm about to go through the memory with WinHEX .

" We Will Understand And Will Not Press You On The Issue "
So Gerald Ford is dead .
Of all the mainstream stories about him , I wonder how many will mention that he gave Indonesia a green light to invade East Timor on December 6 , 1975 ?
And that Indonesia eventually killed more than 200,000 Timorese ?
( Ford 's specific words to Indonesia 's ruler Suharto were : " We will understand and will not press you on the issue . " )
I 'm going to go out on a limb here and guess the number is zero .
However , Chris Floyd does have a non-mainstream perspective on it : " The Enduring Legacy of Gerald R. Ford . "
And Dennis Perrin chimes in with " The Great American Whitewash in Action . "
Parents cannot prevent schools from taking their children 's fingerprints , according to the Department for Education and Skills and the Information Commissioner .
But parents who have campaigned against school fingerprinting might still be able to bring individual complaints against schools under the Data Protection Act ( DPA ) .
DfES admitted to The Register that schools can fingerprint children without parents ' permission .
This position has also been taken by the Information Commissioner , who interprets and enforces the Data Protection Act - the law privacy campaigners hope might be used to stop schools fingerprinting their children .
The Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) is drawing up guidance on the use of fingerprints for purposes other than law - enforcement .
The guidance will say once and for all whether parents can prevent their children 's fingerprints being taken .
David Smith , deputy Information Commissioner , said it was a complex issue that was still being worked out , but it was likely that parents did not have an automatic right to decide whether their children 's biometrics could be taken by a school .
" The Data Protection Act talks of consent of the individual - essentially that 's consent of the child , " he said .
" Now there 's a requirement that consent is informed and freely given .
That will depend on the age of the child , " he said .
The idea is that as long as children can understand the implications of what they are being asked to do , they can give consent without deferring to their parents .
" The Data Protection Act is about the pupil 's rights , not the parents ' rights over the children 's information , " said Smith .
The ICO set a precedent of sorts over the consent of children with regard to direct marketing .
It decided that kids could sign up to get free gumpf through the post without parental consent unless they were required to hand over detailed personal information .
You might think that a child 's fingerprint is one of the most personal pieces of information that can be stored in a database .
But the type of information is irrelevant to the Act .
Even a child 's age is of little importance to the DPA , said Smith .
More important than consent even , the guidance will consider how a fingerprinting system has been applied : whether it is reasonable and proportionate .
If a school wants to use children 's fingerprints to control their use of its library books , anti-biometric parents might not have much room for protest within the law .
Even where the act does consider consent of the child , it cannot rule in a blanket fashion so as to , say , proclaim that schools should seek parental consent before fingerprinting children below a certain age .
" The capacity of a child to make a decision varies from child to child , while some decisions are more involved than others , " said Smith .
What do you do , Smith asks , if a child refuses to have its fingerprint taken but a parent insists that it should ?
The DPA is clear on this .
The parent only has limited opportunity to control the consent of their child .
" Where the child is n't capable of giving consent then under the data protection act it should go to the parents , " said Smith .
I had a cat when I was little , called Ajax .
Aha !
you cry , you named him after that Greek bloke did n't you ?
Well actually , no .
My parents named him ; and they named him after a ship whose crew showed great courage and determination during World War II - the ship 's name may have had the obvious origin ; I do n't know .
The naming of my next ( and current cat ) fell to me .
So he is called something much more mundane : Jet ; because he 's black .
The Ajax I 'm going to talk about is actually an acronym .
Yet another one .
And , of course , it has to do with computers .
Sorry .
So , what is this AJAX of which I speak ?
It is the latest buzzword to hit the blogging world and it also is not related to that guy who played draughts with Achilles .
Everybody seems to want a piece of the action , even though the actual acronym has only been in existence a few weeks .
In its full name , it is :
Asynchronous Normally , when browsing , you 're used to working synchronously :
You click on something ; it forces a page reload ; you wait .
In the synchronous scenario , you and the server take turns working .
In the asynchronous scenario , your browser silently talks with the server in a way that should n't affect the flow of what you are doing .
Javascript
Any programming on the client - side is best done in javascript .
This language ( or rather support for it ) has come a long way in the past few years and , to use the appropriate marketing speak , its full potential can now be leveraged .
Seriously , I love javascript : it can do a variety of really cool things and is n't too difficult to get to work .
And XML
This is of course a whole hype windbag in its own right .
In the mind of the man who coined the term , the xml component of this acronym describes the data - holding powers of xml , both on the server and on the client .
Javascript , for instance , can visit the DOM of xml with the same API as for html .
In the minds of most people , however , Ajax is associated with the XMLHttpRequest object in javascript , which actually powers all three aspects .
It enables you to send a request to a server via http from javascript .
Its calls can be either synchronous or asynchronous and it can return plaintext or preparsed xml .
So this is an exciting new technology ?
Not really .
It is exciting because it has had a lot of hype recently , what with Gmail , Flickr , Google Suggest and our very own e2 annotation tool .
But it is not new .
The potential for browsers to communicate silently with the server has existed since 1996 and the XMLHttpRequest object has existed in the main browsers since 2001 .
In fact , the web - based email client I use at school uses this and was developed in 2002 .
The main thing we have here is a technology : in various ways , it is demonstrably possible to communicate with the server in a silent manner .
Yay !
And this leads us to a solution : Ajax .
And now , as is the manner with all solutions , many people are desperately looking for a problem to solve .
In other words , it 's new , it 's shiny , only the enlightened know about it , I want to be part of the in crowd .
As much as the man who coined the term Ajax , Jesse James Garrett 1 would like us to believe otherwise , Ajax has , in the month the term has existed , just become another ( shorter ) word for " Solution using XMLHttpRequest " .
How does it work ?
Well , assuming you know javascript , the workings are quite simple :
You create an XMLHttpRequest object ; you set the url , the http method and whether you want the call to be asynchronous or not ; you define a return method ; and send it off ; voilà !.
// create a new request -- not quite as simple with Internet Explorer xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; // open a GET request to www.server.com which is non-blocking xmlhttp.open ( " GET " , " www.server.com " , true ) ; // define a function to call when the server sends stuff back xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xmlhttp.readyState==4 ) { // request has been completed // do something } } // send the request off to the server xmlhttp.send ( null ) ;
What do you put instead of do something ?
You can either get an xml tree or , as most people do , you write the response text as a javascript object and use the eval ( ) method to assign this object to a new variable .
Something like :
// assigns whatever was encoded in the response to myvar eval ( " var myvar = " + xmlhttp.responseText ) ;
And there you have it :
There is little point in actually using the XML part and it would be foolish to use something other than javascript so from all this A - J - A - X , we are just left with A : the asynchronous part .
I shall call it CLIC
There are three things wrong with this Ajax thingamajig :
It 's really only about the asynchronous part of browser scripting .
Bad name .
There are now hundreds of people trying to find a problem to associate with this solution .
Bad hype .
The hype is all around a technology and does not encompass the usability which this technology could improve .
Bad philosophy .
Let us consider this last point for a minute .
Up until recently , one of the major problems with web - based applications was their start - stop nature .
Forever having to submit a form and wait for a new page to load .
But this does not mean that such a way of doing things is bad .
In fact , sometimes it is the best way of doing things .
In particular , the only widget common to all browsers is the back button .
Do things asynchronously and it will be broken - we lose our usual way of correcting errors .
Further pitfalls include creating unusual widget behaviour and accessibility problems .
In the next few months , I predict a proliferation of bewildering websites .
Because they modify default behaviours and because they want to use a new technology to solve problems which do not exist ; because it is all shiny and new and I want to do it too !
For the purposes of this writeup and the benefit of future generations , I have coined the term CLIC : Clientside Cleverness .
This is my philosophy of where we should go .
Take all the clientside web - based technologies which have matured and use the right ones at the right time to create the best possible user experience :
Do as many clever things as possible , like form validation and such , on the clientside .
Nothing worse than waiting a minute for the page to reload only to discover that you did n't fill in a mandatory field .
Get data silently from the server , but only when absolutely necessary .
Preserve the navigation user - elements of the web whenever possible .
Try to make any innovations integrate into existing widgets so as not to confuse the user .
Incorporate the remaining usability principles such as feedback and efficiency to web applications .
You 'll notice that the one of the points of this philosophy is to not use this Ajax stuff - or only when it will really improve the user experience .
As an example of these principles in action , let 's look at how we give our credit card details to a site .
It 's a text box ; and half the time , we get told we entered it wrong .
Because we included spaces or did n't include spaces or included dashes ; or not .
After this Ajax noise , I 'm sure some people will be silently sending credit card numbers over the network , unsecured , to have them validated by the server .
Bad move !
Better would be to check the form with javascript and immediately tell the user whether his credit card number is in an acceptable form or not .
Even better , be informative and do n't make us guess how we should enter our credit card details .
Best of all : Let us enter the number any way we please , use some javascript to figure out whether you can make sense of it and only make us correct the format if really necessary .
So , if ever you feel like joining the Ajax bandwagon , think for a minute .
It might take some extra coding , but there is always the CLIC way of doing things .

Experts are certain Oetzi died from an arrow that pierced his shoulder
A Swiss - Italian team says the arrow that struck him in the left shoulder slit the artery under his collar bone .
Oetzi probably died as the result of a fight : he may either have fled his attacker - who then shot him in the back - or been ambushed .
The remains of the Neolithic man were discovered in 1991 emerging from a melting glacier .
They have since been subjected to a long series of investigations , with the latest results being published in the Journal of Archaeological Science .
He would not have walked around for days .
It was a quick death
Dr Frank Ruhli , University of Zurich
But later the same day , he was involved in a fight .
This assessment is based on the presence of a flint arrowhead lodged in his back and extensive cuts to his hands .
No one can be sure whether this attack took place in the valley below , prompting Oetzi to flee up the mountain ; or whether he was involved in a violent scrap at the 3,210 m ( 10,500 ft ) altitude where his body was discovered on the border between Austria and Italy 16 years ago .
Cold case
Recent advances in computerised tomography ( CT ) , a sophisticated X - ray scan that allows multidimensional imaging , have given researchers an unprecedented view of Oetzi 's internal anatomy .
The pictures reveal a 13 mm - long rip in Oetzi 's left subclavian artery which lies just under the collar bone .
Blood poured out into the surrounding tissue , forming a haematoma that can be seen in the breast cavity .
" We can conclude that this was really a deadly hit from the arrowhead , " Dr Ruhli told the BBC News website .
" He would not have walked around for days .
It was a quick death . "
Even today , people with this type of injury have only a 40 % chance of survival .
" Theoretically , you could have been hit by an arrow and survive .
If it does n't hit an artery or the lung , and you do n't get an infection it should n't be a problem , " said Dr Ruhli .
Clotted blood also entered the hole caused by the arrow 's wooden shaft , showing that it was broken off while Oetzi was still alive and therefore still bleeding .
Oetzi climbed up to the Schnalstal Glacier and died from cardiac arrest , brought on by shock , after sustaining massive blood loss , the science team says .
Professor Horst Seidler , from the Institute for Anthropology in Vienna , Austria , called the evidence in the paper " convincing " .
Cover up ?
Dr Ruhli speculated that it was possible the Iceman removed the shaft himself .
Alternatively , it could have been removed by an ally who tried in vain to help him , or perhaps by the attacker - if his arrows had a characteristic shaft - to try to cover up evidence linking him to the killing .
Scientists have modelled the arrowhead embedded in his back
But Dr Ruhli added , " this is speculation , because someone might have helped him up there .
I 'd rather stick to the facts " .
It is impossible to tell whether Oetzi was hit while he was walking , running , or stationary .
But it seems the arrow was shot from below Oetzi , suggesting the killer was either kneeling or further down a hill .
The arrow hit with some considerable power , penetrating the Iceman 's shoulder blade .
Oetzi represents one of the great archaeological finds of recent years .
He takes his name from the Oetz Valley where he was found - still wearing goatskin leggings and a grass cape .
His copper - headed axe and a quiver full of arrows were lying nearby .
At first , it was thought he died from cold and hunger , but researchers were eventually able to establish that he died from injuries sustained in a conflict .
Oetzi was about 159 cm tall ( 5 ft , 2.5in ) , 46 years old , arthritic , and infested with whipworm .
I just did this interview and I could n’t hold my tongue any more ….

Jimbo Wales has a fringe , anti-corporate bent to him , and it ’s holding Wikipedia back .
If Jimbo does n’t like advertising then the 100 key people at Wikipedia do n’t like advertising .
The * majority * of the leadership and core 100 members of the Wikipedia community do n’t seem to think for themselves , but rather follow Jimbo ’s wacky anti-corporate stance blindly .
This is highly ironic since Jimbo is doing a highly commercial Wiki project backed by VCs .
Oh wait , Jimbo is doing a highly profitable , advertising - based Wiki project for personal gain while pitching that Wikipedia not have advertising .
Hmmmm …. perhaps Jimbo does n’t want advertising on the Wikipedia because he knows that his for - profit Wikia would suffer if it did .
The Wikipedia community needs to leave Jimbo ’s amazing leadership behind and realize that they would have $ 50 M in the bank right now like Mozilla if they put up one advertisement on Wikipedia .
Jimbo ’s stance is killing the Wikipedia .
The Wikipedia could have 50 full - time people and a huge endowment if they would follow Firefox ’s example and stop listening to Jimmy Wales and his hypocritical anti-advertising stance .

I hear a lot of people on both sides of the ideological aisle complaining about the " coarsening of our culture " or some similar trash .
Fuck that shit ; our culture is not coarse enough .
People are too hung up on manners and social norms .
Sure , it 's nice to have polite people around , but it 's also nice to have people who tell it like it is .
And somebody needs to inform our " culture " that we should be fucking rioting .
Is there a nice way to say we should take to the streets and burn shit ?
' Cause I 'd like to say it in polite company and watch them jump into the moshpit of the streets with a torch and an axe .
It 's time to say " enough of this shit ! " and tellto fuck off .
in this case is the evil Bush Reich , a collection of fascists , zealots , traitors , liars , thieves and hypocritical scum - sucking whores to power .
Why should we give the Bush regime the courtesy they 've never given us ?
It 's time to stop playing nice .
Do you wanna know what should really happen ?
Bush is a mass murderer who should not only be impeached , he should be sent over to Iraq for trial , where he will be executed like Saddam .
It 's only fitting .
And Cheney ?
Shit , we should play a game with his fate .
I say we play the Most Dangerous Game with his ass .
We should send him out in the woods , naked , with a 30 minute headstart on the homeless people with shotguns who will be hunting him like a pheasant .
Whomever bags Cheney gets his mansion .
Seems fair to me .
Fuck being nice anymore .
I say the culture is not coarse enough .
Let 's let these assholes know they can't get away with their lies , obstruction and misdirection anymore .
Labels : America , Bush , Cheney , evil , fascism
It received just a few column inches in a couple of papers , but the story I read last week looks to me like a glimpse of the future .
A company in Ohio called City - Watcher has implanted radio transmitters into the arms of two of its workers .
The implants ensure that only they can enter the strongroom .
Apparently it is " the first known case in which US workers have been tagged electronically as a way of identifying them " .
The transmitters are tiny ( about the size of a grain of rice ) , cheap ( £ 85 and falling fast ) , safe and stable .
Without being maintained or replaced , they can identify someone for many years .
They are injected , with a local anaesthetic , into the upper arm .
They require no power source , as they become active only when scanned .
There are no technical barriers to their wider deployment .
The company that makes these " radio frequency identification tags " , the VeriChip Corporation , says they " combine access control with the location and protection of individuals " .
The chips can also be implanted in hospital patients , especially children and people who are mentally ill .
When doctors want to know who they are and what their medical history is , they simply scan them in .
This , apparently , is " an empowering option to affected individuals " .
For a while , a school in California toyed with the idea of implanting the chips in all its pupils .
A tag such as this has a maximum range of a few metres .
But another implantable device emits a signal that allows someone to be found or tracked by satellite .
The patent notice says it can be used to locate the victims of kidnapping or people lost in the wilderness .
There are , in other words , plenty of legitimate uses for implanted chips .
This is why they bother me .
A technology whose widespread deployment , if attempted now , would be greeted with horror , will gradually become unremarkable .
As this happens , its purpose will begin to creep .
At first the tags will be more widely used for workers with special security clearance .
No one will be forced to wear one ; no one will object .
Then hospitals - and a few in the US are already doing this - will start scanning their unconscious or incoherent patients to see whether they have a tag .
Insurance companies might start to demand that vulnerable people are chipped .
The armed forces will discover that they are more useful than dog tags for identifying injured soldiers or for tracking troops who are lost or have been captured by the enemy .
Prisons will soon come to the same conclusion .
Then sweatshops in developing countries will begin to catch on .
Already the overseers seek to control their workers to the second ; determining when they clock on , when they visit the toilet , even the number of hand movements they perform .
A chip makes all this easier .
The workers will not be forced to have them , any more than they are forced to have sex with their bosses ; but if they do n't accept the conditions , they do n't get the job .
After that , it surely wo n't be long before asylum seekers are confronted with a similar choice : you do n't have to accept an implant , but if you refuse , you can't stay in the country .
I think it will probably stop there .
I do n't believe that you or I or most comfortable , mentally competent people will be forced to wear a tag .
But itwill become an increasingly acceptable means of tracking and identifying people who could be a danger to themselves , or who could be at risk of sudden illness or disappearance , or who are otherwise hard for companies or governments to control .
They will , on the whole , be people whose political voice is muted .
As it is with all such intrusions on our privacy , it wo n't be easy to put your finger on exactly what 's wrong with this technology .
It wo n't really amount to a new form of control , as all the people who accept the implants will already be subject to monitoring or tracking of one kind or another .
It will always be voluntary , at least to the extent that anything the state or our employers want us to do is voluntary .
But there is something utterly revolting about it .
It is another means by which the barriers between ourselves and the state , ourselves and the corporation , ourselves and the machine are broken down .
In that tiny capsule we find the paradox of 21st - century capitalism : a political system that celebrates choice , autonomy and individualism above all other virtues demands that choice , autonomy and individualism are perpetually suppressed .
While implanted chips will not lead to the mass scanning of the population , another use of the same technology quite possibly will .
At the end of last month , a leaked letter from Andy Burnham , the Home Office minister , revealed that the identity cards for which we will involuntarily volunteer will contain radio frequency identification chips .
This will allow the authorities to read the cards with a scanner .
I propose that as the technology improves , the police will be able to scan a crowd and ( assuming everyone is carrying his voluntary - compulsory ID card ) produce a list of whom it contains .
I further propose that it will take only a year or two for this to seem reasonable .
Already we have become used to the police filming demonstrations for the same purpose .
When they started doing it , about 10 years ago , it caused outrage .
It gave us the impression that by protesting we became suspects .
But now we do n't even notice them : even to the extent of waving and shouting , " Hello , Mum " .
Like every other intrusion on our privacy , they have become normal .
I also propose that the mass scanning these identification chips will allow will be assisted by another kind of surveillance technology .
Last week , campaigners in west Wales obtained a letter sent by the Welsh Development Agency to Ceredigion County Council .
It revealed that the agency , with the help of the European Union , is setting up an industrial estate outside Aberystwyth .
Its purpose is the " market acceleration " of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) .
With the help of companies such as BAE Systems , Rolls - Royce and our new friend Qinetiq , the agency hopes to find the best way of encouraging the " routine operation of UAV systems UK - wide " .
Ceredigion council 's website lists various functions of the UAVs , of which the first is " law enforcement " .
So the police wo n't even have to be there .
Someone sitting in a control room could fly a tiny drone ( some of them are just a few inches across ) equipped with a receiver over the heads of a crowd and , with the help of our new identity cards , determine who 's there .
It sounds quite mad , just as the idea of biometric identity cards in the UK once did .
All these new technologies somehow contrive to seem both wildly implausible and entirely likely .
There will be no dramatic developments .
We will not step out of our homes one morning to discover that the state , or our boss , or our insurance company , knows everything about us .
But , if the muted response to the ID card is anything to go by , we will gradually submit , in the name of our own protection , to the demands of the machine .
And it will not then require a tyrannical new government to deprive us of our freedom .
Step by voluntary step , we will have given it up already .

Wirth ’s Law Niklaus Wirth Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster .
Much of statistical modelling involves shuffling around operations on stochastic variables — i.e. on their probability distributions .
This can be tricky stuff : it either involves loads of manual lifting with fully discrete distributions or clever analytic methods for continuous ones .
This is complicated enough that most of basic and intermediate - level applied statistical analysis is done working with a normality assumption ; the normal distribution has some simple linearity properties regarding affine functions of normal stochastic variables , and is thus used to avoid dicking around with convolutions and the jacobian method .
Like with Pancito , this is something I once independently tried to do , but got lost trying to model dense spaces and measure theory .
Martin Erwig did the actual work so far , even though there ’s no work in continuous spaces at all .
I ’m working on cleaning his code up — that is , making it more like the other GHC libraries , since this was done for an academic paper .
I ’d like to eventually turn this into Control .
Stochastic ; it ’s not a Data . * library , as it allows for transititions , functions whose outcome depends on stochastic variables .
This together with sigfpe ’s CA comonad could lead to a very compact library for simulating percolation systems !
In general , stochastic programming has wide , deep applications that make this econometrician ’s eyes shine with hope .
So after this short status report ( apparently I finally manage to become interested enough to work on a project for a significant ammount of time ) , let ’s take a look ath the centerpiece of Erwig ’s PFP library : the Dist monad .
First of all , probability is a measure over an algebra of events .
Erwig does n’t mull over too much on algebras , sigma - algebras and measure theory — I admire his restraint .
Instead , we have merely the concept of an event : something that might or not happen .
type Event a = a ->
Bool
A probability measure , by definition , is a real between 0 and 1 .
Martin eschews the bounded number problem ( you ca n’t define a type that enforces such a constraint ) by making an abstract datatype that will later be hidden ( though he did n’t really create an export list ) .
newtype Probability = P ProbRep
type ProbRep = Float
We omit here the Show method for Probabilities .
It involves a somewhat confusing rounding procedure I have n’t studied yet , and is n’t essential for our purpose here .
We instead jump directly to the Distribution type .
A distribution is a list of singleton events together with their probabilities ; the probabilities should sum one , and this will be handled by later handling functions .
newtype Dist a = D {unD :: [ ( a , ProbRep ) ] }
Record syntax is used to automatically define a destructor function ; this kind of reads “ wrong ” if you ’re used to records where destructor functions describe fields , but is really inconsequential .
Now we turn to instancing Dist as a functor :
instance Functor Dist where
fmap f ( D d ) = D [ ( f x , p ) | ( x , p ) <- d ]
Let ’s say you have a Bernoulli probability distribution with paramter 0.5 .
That is , with 50 % probability you will turn to 1 , and with 50 % probability it ’ll be 0 .
What happens if I want to model a head - or - tails game where I _lose_ one dollar if tails comes out and win one if heads comes up ?
We then have f( 1 ) with probability 0.5 and f( 0 ) with probability 0.5 , where f( x ) =2 * x - 1 .
This is precisely the definition above ; apply the function to the events and leave the probabilites alone .
Now , the monad .
instance Monad Dist where
return x = D [ ( x,1 ) ]
d >>= f = D [ ( y , q*p ) | ( x , p ) <- unD d , ( y , q ) <- unD ( f x ) ]
fail _ = D [ ]
The unit of this monad is merely a singleton certain ( proper jargon is almost certain when it can only assume one value with probablity 1 ) distribution .
Let ’s now remember the type of ( >>= ) so we ’re sure what we ’re looking for .
(>>= ) :: ( Monad m ) => m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
d >>= f = D [ ( y , q*p ) | ( x , p ) <- unD d , ( y , q ) <- unD ( f x ) ]
The content of d is a list of ( Event , probability ) pairs hidden inside the D constructor ; first we extract the pair with the destructor function ; then , a function of type ( a -> m b ) , in this case ( a -> D b ) is applied to the event extracted from d ; that function shall return another distribution , which we faithfully destruct into an ( Event , probability ) pair .
Finally , we take the event that function returned and multiply the probabilities .
Let ’s examine this all again .
Dist is a functor — an endofunctor on the category of Haskell types with functions as morphisms — that takes any type t to a type D t ( consisting of a hidden list of event / probability pairs ) ; fmap lifts functions that act on event types to functions that act on the probability distributions by applying the deterministic event -> event function to the event part and keeping the probability .
Dist is also a monad ; it has a trivial unit , and binds a function of type ( pure type -> probability distribution ) to a probability distribution itself ; the event part of that distribution results from applying the function to the pure type part of the d distribution and keeping the pure type part and multiplying the probabilities .
Multiplying probabilities is natural when you ’re intersecting events , but why does it happen here ?
We ’ll see this by examining lift M2 .
Let ’s switch to do - notation for this .
First , we sugar d>> =f into
do { z <- d ; f z}
Multiplying probabilities feels more natural in this context ; a stochastic value is taken from a distribution , and applying another stochastic function to it can only be interpreted in terms of an intersection of events .
But let ’s take a look at liftM .
What liftM is supposed to do is lift a function from ordinary types to monadically - qualified types .
This clearly is the very same thing as fmap , and only has this synonym for consistency : for higher - arity functions , we have the liftM n family :
liftM :: ( a1 -> r ) -> m a 1 -> m r
liftM2 :: ( a1 -> a 2 -> r ) -> m a 1 -> m a 2 -> m r
liftM3 : : ( a1 -> a 2 -> a 3 -> r ) -> m a 1 -> m a 2 -> m a 3 -> m r
liftM4 :: ( a1 -> a 2 -> a 3 -> a 4 -> r ) -> m a 1 -> m a 2 -> m a 3 -> m a 4 -> m r
( In all these , the ( Monad m ) => context has been omitted ) .
The semantics of fmap / liftM , as we ’ve seen , are clear .
What semantics does one expect from lift M2 ?
How about taking a function from two ordinary types to an ordinary type , and transforming it into a function from two distributions to a distribution ?
This is the stuff stochastic calculus is made of : operations over random variables .
Of course , there ’s deep theory on how to do this for continuous types , but let ’s think of an easy example .
What ’s the sum of two dice ?
Each dice can assume the values 1..6 with a 1/6 probability .
Let ’s construct the distribution for the sum of them .
Each ( a , b ) combination has a 1/36 = 1/6 x 1/6 probability of happening .
Let ’s count ’em .
Value Combinations that yield it Probability 1 … 0 2 ( 1,1 ) 1/36 3 ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,1 ) 2/36 4 ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,1 ) 3/36 5 ( 1,4 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3 , 2 ) , ( 4 , 1 ) 4/36 6 ( 1,5 ) , ( 2,4 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 5,1 ) 5/36 7 ( 1,6 ) , ( 2,5 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 4 , 3 ) , ( 5,2 ) , ( 6,1 ) 6/36 8 ( 2,6 ) , ( 3 , 5 ) , ( 4 , 4 ) , ( 5,3 ) , ( 6,2 ) 5/36 9 ( 3 , 6 ) , ( 4 , 5 ) , ( 5,4 ) , ( 6,3 ) 4/36 10 ( 4 , 6 ) , ( 5 , 5 ) , ( 6,4 ) 3/36 11 ( 5,6 ) , ( 6,5 ) 2/36 12 ( 6,6 ) 1/36 > 12 … 0
We ’d like to be able to lift M2 (+ ) two dice so it calculates our probabilities .
Let ’s first see what a dice looks like
dice = D [ ( 1,1/6 ) , ( 2,1/6 ) , ( 3,1/6 ) , ( 4,1/6 ) , ( 5,1/6 ) , ( 6/16 ) ]
What happens when we fmap ( that is , liftM a function into that ?
Remember fmap f ( D d ) = D [ ( f x , p ) | ( x , p ) <- d ] .
Hence ,
fmap ( * 2 ) dice == D [ 2*x , p | ( x , p ) <- unD d ] == D [ ( 2,1/6 ) , ( 4,1/6 ) , ( 6,1/6 ) , ( 8,1/6 ) , ( 10,1/6 ) , ( 12/16 ) ]
That ’s the probability distribution for twice the result of the same dice .
Now what ’s the definition of lift M2 ?
lift M2 = do { x1 <- m1 ; x2 <- m 2 ; return ( f x1 x2 ) }
or , desugaring ,
m 1 >>=( \ x1 -> m 2 >>= ( \ x2 -> return ( f x1 x2 ) ) )
Let ’s take this for one event in the join distribution : ( 2,1 ) .
By the definition above , the probabilities of 2 and 1 are multiplied , yielding 1/36 ; the sum of these ( f x1 x2 ) is 3 .
The final distribution then is written down with ( 3 , 1/36 ) .
When later ( 1,2 ) comes up , another ( 3,1/36 ) will be written down .
As a result , the internal representation of this distribution is actually
[ ( 2,1/36 ) , ( 3,1/36 ) , ( 3 , 1/36 ) , ( 4 , 1/36 ) , ( 4 , 1/36 ) , ( 4 , 1/36 ) , ..... ( 12 , 1/36 ) ]
We fix this by writing a query function (?? ) , defined as
(?? ) :: Event a ->
Dist a ->
Probability
(?? ) p = P . sumP . filter ( p . fst ) . unD
where
sumP :: [ ( a , ProbRep ) ] ->
ProbRep
sumP = sum .
map snd
For example , a simple query over the two - dice distribution is
( ==7 ) ?? ( lift M2 (+ ) dice dice )
where dice is defined as above .
The dice distribution is destroyed , lift M2 is applied so to produce the “ inner representation ” we ’ve shown before and then the query combinator filters through the instances of 7 and sums their probabilities .
A suitable Show method can be ( it actually is , but it ’s confusing and spans two different files ( in my opinion needlessly ) ) defined to quickly visualize the table we ’ve manually constructed .
Evidently , liftMn works accordingly .
Bingo : stochastic calculus in a monad .
Suitable combinators for defining probability distributions without working directly with the D constructor are defined ; for example , dice = uniform [ 1..6 ] .
Of course , uniform [ 1,2,2,3 ] is suitably adjusted for all queries , with 2 being more likely .
This is a financial modeller ’s wet dream .
To think you can use the empirical distribution function of past data directly as your input , with no ugly binomial / normality assumptions !
Of course , distribution assumptions yield important theoretical results , but this stochastic calculus is an extremely powerful modelling tool in its own right .
And wait until I start raving on stochastic transitions 😉

UPDATE ON THE IRAQI OIL LAW – download our June 30 briefing on the Iraq Oil Law
The Bush / Cheney administration is prioritizing the passage of an Iraqi oil law before it leaves office .
This renewed push began with Dick Cheney ’s visit to Iraq in March 2008 and the next six months will be key to the future of Iraq ’s oil .
In the mean time , the Iraqi government plans to sign service contracts for development of the largest oilfields .
The first six were due to be signed on June 30 with Shell , BP , ExxonMobil , Chevron , Total and four smaller companies , but were not for reasons that are not immediately apparent .

Download and read Crude Designs , the November 2005 report on Iraq ’s oil law – co-published by Oil Change International – authored by Greg Muttitt of PLATFORM .
Key Facts
Iraq has 115 billion barrels of known oil reserves – 10 per cent of the world total .
There are 80 discovered oilfields , of which only 17 have been developed .
Oil accounts for more than 70 per cent of Iraq ’s GDP and 95 per cent of government revenue .
The proposed Iraq hydrocarbon law would take the majority of Iraq ’s oil out of the exclusive hands of the Iraqi government and open it to international oil companies for a generation or more .
The law is a dramatic break from the past .
Foreign oil companies will have a stake in Iraq ’s vast oil wealth for the first time since 1972 , when Iraq nationalized the oil industry .
BearingPoint , a Virginia based contractor is being paid $ 240 m for its work in Iraq , winning an initial contract from the US Agency for International Development ( USAid ) within weeks of the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
A BearingPoint employee , based in the US embassy in Baghdad , was hired to advise the Iraqi Ministry of Oil on drawing up a new hydrocarbon law .
BearingPoint employees gave $ 117,000 to the 2000 and 2004 Bush election campaigns , more than any other Iraq contractor .
The process of drafting the oil law has been particularly troubling .
The timeline of which entities have seen the draft when suggests that Iraqi interests are not being considered first and foremost :
Draft shown to US government and major oil companies – July 06
Draft shown to the International Monetary Fund September 06
Draft shown to Iraqi Parliament : February 07
The Iraq National Oil Company would have exclusive control of just 17 of Iraq ’s 80 known oil fields , leaving two - thirds of known — and all of its as yet undiscovered — reserves open to foreign control .
The law sets no minimum standard for the extent to which foreign companies would not have to invest their earnings in the Iraqi economy , partner with Iraqi companies , hire Iraqi workers or share new technologies .
The international oil companies could also be offered some of the most corporate - friendly contracts in the world , including what are called production sharing agreements .
These agreements are the oil industry ’s preferred model , but are roundly rejected by all the top oil producing countries in the Middle East because they grant long - term contracts ( 20 to 30 years in the case of Iraq ’s draft law ) and greater control , ownership and profits to the companies than other models .
In fact , they are used for only approximately 12 percent of the world ’s oil .
Iraq ’s neighbors Iran , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia maintain nationalized oil systems and have outlawed foreign control over oil development .
They all hire international oil companies as contractors to provide specific services as needed , for a limited duration , and without giving the foreign company any direct interest in the oil produced
Iraqis may very well choose to use the expertise and experience of international oil companies .
They are most likely to do so in a manner that best serves their own needs if they are freed from the tremendous external pressure being exercised by the Bush administration , the oil corporations — and the presence of 140,000 members of the American military .
The leadership of Iraq ’s five trade union federations released a statement opposing the law and rejecting ‘’ the handing of control over oil to foreign companies , which would undermine the sovereignty of the state and the dignity of the Iraqi people . ’’
They ask for more time , less pressure and a chance at the democracy they have been promised .

New Oil Law to go Before Iraqi Cabinet
by Antonia Juhasz 2007-01-19 TomPaine.com
For more than four years , the Bush administration and its oil company cohorts have worked toward the passage of a new oil law for Iraq that would turn its nationalized oil system over to private foreign corporate control .
On Thursday , January 18 , this dream came one step closer to reality when an Iraqi negotiating committee of “ national and regional leaders ” approved a new hydrocarbon law .
The committee chair , Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih , told Reuters that the draft will go to the Iraqi cabinet next week and , if approved , to the parliament immediately thereafter .

Christians have a duty to denounce Bush for his crimes , and see that he and Cheney are impeached .
A recent news story says “ Southern Baptists split over politics ” .
They are arguing about whether or not to be involved in the political process .
How hypocritical !
Christians , especially evangelicals , helped put Bush into power .
They believed Pat Robertson , who “ anointed ” him to lead America .
They thought he would bring about God ’s kingdom on earth .
Now they do n’t like what he has done , so they want to retreat from politics .
Sour grapes .

By now , Genarlow Wilson ’s story should be familiar to everyone .
At 17 he was convicted of having consenual oral sex with his fifteen year old girlfriend and , because of the absurdity of Georgia ’s sex offender laws , he was sentenced to ten years in prison .
Earlier this month , the judge in charge of his case reduced Wilson ’s conviction to his misdemeanor and ordered his immediate release .
Wilson had already spent two years in prison , and that would ’ve seemed to have been the end of it , except the Georgia Attorney General filed an appeal .
Yesterday , Wilson learned that he would not be released while that appeal is pending :
Genarlow Wilson , whose 10 - year prison sentence for having consensual oral sex with a 15 - year - old when he was 17 was voided by a judge earlier this month , is not eligible to be released on bail while the state appeals his sentence , a judge ruled today .
The ruling , which came just days after investors announced they ’d post a $ 1 million bond for Wilson , likely means Wilson will remain in jail for several more months .
The Georgia Supreme Court is scheduled to hear his case in October .
The order , issued by Douglas County Superior Court Judge David Emerson , canceled the bond hearing that he originally set for July 5 .
In his Wednesday ruling , Emerson cited a Georgia law that prevents trial courts from granting bail to people convicted of certain crimes , including aggravated child molestation , when the original sentence exceeds five years , as is the case with Wilson .
“ As the court has no authority to grant an appeal bond in this case , there is no need for an evidentiary hearing on the defendant ’s eligibility for a bond , ” Emerson wrote in a three - page order .
It would appear that the Judge did n’t do anything wrong here .
He simply does n’t have the authority to release Wilson on appeal because of the type of the crime he was convicted of committing .
The fault lies with the Georgia legislature for writing an absurd law , and with a prosecutor who continues to pursue a case that really ought to be dropped by now .

A city center 's eyesore is turned into a public art with the help of a rotator .
Twice Turner Prize nominated Richard Wilson cut a 26 foot oval out of the side of the Yates Wine Lodge building and re-installed it with a rotator that rotates it on both its x and y axis .
As it turns , people on the street can catch a glimpse of the inside .
The exhibit officially opens on the 20th and will be up until 2008 .

As he left the bank , he called his girlfriend , Yamil Mejia , to say he thought a car was following him .
Soon after , she heard a struggle over the phone and then the line went dead .
At home , his mother had just finished decorating the Christmas tree when she got a panicked call from Mejia , asking if Gerardo had made it back yet .
When his mother rushed out to look for him , she found his bloodied body lying in the street a few blocks away .
He had been shot in the back .
Someone who lived across the street found him with his eyes rolling and blood bubbling from his mouth and nose .
The bullet had punctured his lung .
Stephanie Rodolico , who lives in the apartment above the Parragas , remembers that evening .
" We heard the commotion downstairs , but they were n't the kind of family to scream and yell , " she says .
It was n't until the following morning they learned what had happened , when Gerardo 's father called out to Stephanie 's husband and started crying , " John , John , they killed my son . "
Gerardo's father came to the US from Ecuador and the whole family were doing their best to live the dream .
Throggs
Neck was a move up for them .
Were it not for the planes flying low over the Long Island Sound on their way to La Guardia airport , it would be a quiet neighbourhood .
Madonnas stand , arms crossed , in glass cases on clipped lawns .
Crime is down and on the porches American flags are up .
Gerardo had enrolled in a part - time course in software engineering , computer programming and web design at Columbia University , targeted at promising students from low - income families .
" You hardly ever saw him , " says John Rodolico .
" He was either at work or at school . "
After Gerardo's death , the Parragas moved to Queens .
On the corner where he fell , a bouquet of dried flowers hangs from a lamppost .
" His mother could n't keep walking past the spot where he died every day , " Stephanie says .
" They came to this area to better their lives and this is what happens .
It shocked all of us . "
On an average day , eight Americans aged 19 or under are killed by firearms - over a year , that adds up to more than the number who perished in the World Trade Centre on 9/11 .
Of those eight victims , according to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention figures for 2004 ( the last year for which statistics are available ) , seven are likely to be male and one female ; variously , three are black , four white and one Hispanic ; five are likely to be the victims of murder , two suicides and one classed as " unintentional " , " undetermined " or " legal intervention " - a police shooting .
In many respects , then , Gerardo 's death set the scene for just another day in America .
Over the following 24 hours , on this day picked at random , another eight children would lose their lives .
Gerardo was the eldest ; the youngest was two .
Eight were black and one was Hispanic .
They died in housing estates , suburbs and malls , at parties and on porches , in areas of average income and of above - average poverty .
They were shot by a relative , friend , unknown assassin , a pizza delivery man , an off - duty police officer and by accident .
It was Thanksgiving , the biggest travelling weekend of the year , when people are returning home after joining their families for the holiday .
By the time the day was over , nine families were one member short .
3.20 am As Gerardo Parraga 's life was ending , Jonathan Jacques ' night out in the Dorchester area of Boston was just beginning .
At 9.30 pm , he had given his mother , Martine , a big kiss , and she had watched from her bedroom window as he set off to meet friends .
" He loves to party , " she says .
" He likes hip hop , reggae and R&B . "
She still wavers between present and past tense when talking about her son , who was 18 when he died .
He and his friends were heading for The $ hort $ kirt Affair , a three - day party that had been advertised on MySpace : $ 5 for boys and $ 2 for girls .
At around 2.45 am , one of the loudspeakers caught fire and the partygoers moved outside .
Some of Jonathan 's friends called it a night , but he was still there after 3 am when an argument started .
Locals , disturbed by the noise , were ready to call the police when at 3.20 am there was the sound of gunshots blended with shrill teenage screams .
Two girls , aged 14 and 15 , and two boys , aged 16 and 17 , were wounded .
Jonathan was shot dead .
One of his friends called Martine , who rushed to the hospital .
" He died instantly , " she says , " but someone told me that the hearing is the last to go .
So I got to hold him and talk to him and I thought , even if he was dead , maybe he could still hear me . "
Jonathan was known as 40 Cal - as in 40 - calibre pistol .
It is a testament to the pervasiveness of gun culture among US youth that his friends insist his nickname owed nothing to street violence .
His middle name was Calvin and he was 6ft 4in and reed thin , like the barrel of a .40 .
" He 's a comedian , " Martine says .
" You could never stay mad at him for long .
He had a very playful personality .
People would always ask him to babysit . "
Martine , who was born in Haiti and came to the US when she was eight , says she has good days and bad days - " Days when I can't talk about it at all . "
She still has the soap from his last shower .
" Every time he left the house , he would look in the mirror and ask me how many phone numbers I thought he would get that night . "
Jonathan dropped out of school .
He had a part - time job at a Stop & Shop supermarket , but wanted to go into real estate .
Martine had only recently moved from north Dorchester , where she worried her children might get into trouble .
She 'd thought about moving to the suburbs , but believed Jonathan would then be harassed by " racist white cops asking what he was doing there " .
There had been a time when Jonathan hung out with the wrong crowd and had had a few brushes with the law , but all of that was behind him now .
" He was no hoodlum , " his mother says .
" He was a good kid . "
Since her boys were teenagers , she had been haunted by the fear that guns might take them .
There is a connection , she believes , between the violence that blights America and the country 's actions elsewhere .
" When people see what we 're doing in the rest of the world , they think , why not in my neighbourhood ?
The government sets an example of violence and then it gets played out on the streets . "
A mile or so away , at the Louis D Brown Peace Institute , Clementina Chery says American society is failing its children .
" This violence did not just happen overnight , " she says .
" We allowed it to happen .
This country does not help people to help themselves .
I love Dorchester .
But we live in hell .
The only resources we get are helicopters , police , cameras and prisons .
These are the hellkeepers , but we have no resources to find the peacekeepers . "
Chery 's son , Louis D Brown , was 15 when he was shot 14 years ago .
The institute that bears his name aims to assist families of both victims and perpetrators in the immediate aftermath of shootings , and works in schools and the community to educate people about gun violence .
When Jonathan was killed , Chery knew how to help .
As the sun came up on the morning of November 26 , a memorial for Jonathan , complete with candles and flowers , was already forming in the neighbourhood where he 'd grown up .
" The victims and perpetrators are getting younger and younger , " Chery says .
10.28 am Timberlan Addison , two years old , was staying with his 37 - year - old father , Timothy , in Tampa , Florida .
The west coast of Florida simmered in the mid-70s that day and , amid the palm trees and Spanish moss , you could almost forget that one in five families in this part of the city lives below the poverty line .
Timothy had had several brushes with the law , including time in prison for cocaine possession .
But neighbours say he was an attentive father who often looked after Timberlan at weekends .
Renee Henderson , who lives across the road , described Timothy as " a sweet person " .
Her daughter , Marquita , was pregnant with his seventh child .
Timberlan was his sixth .
That Sunday morning , the two of them had gone out to get some breakfast .
Back home , Timberlan was playing , climbing over the furniture , when he reached behind the couch and found a Sig Sauer 9 mm semi-automatic .
According to the police report , Timothy said he had the gun for protection - there had been several burglaries in the neighbourhood - but usually left it in a safe when his son was home .
Timberlan pulled the trigger .
When Timothy heard the bang , he picked up his crying son to comfort him , thinking he was just scared .
Only when he saw the blood seeping through his red-and - white striped T - shirt did he realise that Timberlan had shot himself .
Timothy ran across the street with Timberlan in his arms , knocking and shouting for Renee .
When she opened her door , she saw the baby slumped in one of the white plastic chairs on the porch .
She tried to staunch the blood by putting a towel to his chest , and then called an ambulance .
Michael Spirk was the first policeman on the scene .
He " observed an adult black male holding a small black male child , lying on a sofa in the living room .
The adult black male was extremely distraught . "
When he tried to give Timberlan mouth - to - mouth resuscitation , " copious amounts of blood would run from his wound " .
Timberlan was taken to Tampa General Hospital .
Timothy was taken to the station for questioning while the police searched the house .
They allegedly found two 1 oz bags of marijuana in the microwave and more seeds on digital scales on the kitchen counter .
They also reportedly recovered a Glock semi-automatic pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition , including some for an assault rifle .
" He was then handcuffed , " reads the police report , " and placed under arrest for being a felon in possession of a firearm , after which he was told that his son had expired as a result of the gunshot wound .
Mr Addison then became overcome with grief , and began screaming and crying .
After a short time he became more agitated and refused to sit in a chair or be cooperative .
He was then transported to central booking by uniformed officers . "
Two months later , Timothy was arrested while at his construction job and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell , parole violation and possession of a firearm during a drug crime .
He still faces state charges of culpable negligence for leaving the gun where Timberlan could get hold of it .
Timberlan 's mother was at the hearing , where she reacted angrily to the charges .
" I forgave him from day one , " she said .
" These people are not taking into consideration that this man lost his child ...
He wakes up every morning crying .
He feels like it 's his fault . "
All of this made Timberlan 's death newsworthy for several weeks - far longer than any of the teenagers killed by gunfire that day .
It is nothing unusual for a shooting to rate a few paragraphs in the local press and then disappear altogether from the public record .
" Over the past few years we have seen America become more desensitised to gun violence , " says Alicia Horton of the Brady Campaign , an advocacy group to prevent gun violence .
" I 'm not sure if it 's an emotional reflex or a coping strategy or what , but people have just started to turn the channel .
They shut down in a way that they did n't used to . "
2 pm The case of Brandon Martell Moore , a 16 - year - old killed in Detroit , caused barely a ripple .
Moore was shot by an off - duty police officer outside the National Wholesale Liquidators on 8 Mile .
Brandon was never named by the authorities or the city 's two main newspapers .
" Why would I want to live in a place where my son ca n't even be remembered ? " says his father , John Henry Moore Sr. " That means he did n't mean nothing to this city . "
Brandon was a quiet boy .
According to his sister Ebony , the only time he had anything to say was when " he was seeing a girl or making jokes " .
He and his younger brother were such devotees of Beavis and Butt - head that his mother had to hide the video so they would n't keep watching it .
" At the funeral , lots of girls I did n't even know came up to me crying and said , ' I was his girlfriend , ' " says his mother , Susie Burks , laughing .
" There was a whole row of them there . "
National Wholesale Liquidators , a warehouse store , sprawls along the edge of Bel - Air mall on the corner of a road lined with boarded - up houses , empty lots and abandoned stores - a burned - out carcass where the heart of a community once beat .
On the front door , a sign says that those 16 years and younger must be accompanied by an adult .
Brandon had come with four friends to buy video games .
They did n't see the sign but , since one of them was 22 and another 19 , it did n't apply to them anyway .
Police say Brandon was part of a gang making trouble in the store , and that one of the staff had asked them to leave .
On their way out , they ran into an off - duty police officer ( who was moonlighting at the store as a security guard ) : " One teenager took off his coat and rushed the off - duty police officer , " according to a police spokesman quoted in the Detroit Free Press .
The others got involved and the officer opened fire , killing one and wounding another .
Diane Bukowski , from the local black paper , the Michigan Citizen , was the only reporter to pursue the case and heard an entirely different account from those who were with Brandon that day .
They had split up and were walking round the store when Brandon 's older brother , John Henry , saw his friends being thrown out .
They argued but left anyway , before realising that one of their number was n't with them .
One of the boys ( not Brandon ) tried to get past the security guard and back into the store .
A tussle began .
" I saw something fall to the floor .
I thought it was a cell phone , but it was a gun in its holster , " John Henry said .
" The man did n't realise at first .
Then he picked it up , put one arm on top of the other arm and started aiming at us .
Brandon was n't involved in anything .
He was the last one to take off running , I guess . "
According to the autopsy , Brandon was shot in the back .
When his father asked for a police report , an officer allegedly told him , " I 'm not fucking giving it to you . "
The man who killed Brandon is Eugene J Williams .
His badge number is 4174 .
According to various press reports , he has had a colourful history with Detroit 's finest .
In 1971 , he was sacked after he was involved in a fatal hit - and - run accident while under the influence of alcohol .
He was reinstated in 1974 on appeal .
Five years later , he shot dead an armed and drunk 31 - year - old man while in a neighbourhood dispute .
Five years after that , he shot his wife in the side during a domestic dispute in which he claimed she lunged at him with a pair of scissors .
She survived , and he was able to continue his career in the police force .
Williams was not suspended for the shooting of Brandon Moore ; instead , he was assigned to a Detroit traffic unit .
When I called the unit , Williams answered the phone and , after some initial equivocation , denied ever having heard of Brandon .
Last month an investigation ruled that the shooting was justifiable homicide .
3.30 pm
An hour and half after Brandon died , and 700 miles to the south - east , a 13 - year - old took his late great uncle 's shotgun out of a closet and shot his cousin Terry Hayes , 14 , square in the face at point - blank range .
The bullet went through Terry 's left cheek and took off the back of his head .
The boys had just returned from church in Petersburg , Virginia , a sleepy town that feels more southern than its geography would have you believe .
By all accounts Terry was a regular kid .
He wanted to be a businessman or a pro-footballer .
He loved sketching , and playing video games with his cousin .
" They were always hanging out , " says Tania Hayes , Terry 's stepmother .
" They were beyond cousins .
They were best friends . "
She recalls a time when she grounded Terry only to find his cousin at her door demanding access .
" Mrs T , you 're either gonna let me in or let him out , " he told her .
The Hayes ' extended family had been having a tough winter .
A few weeks earlier the 13 - year - old 's great uncle , James Brunt , had been killed by a drunk driver .
Uncle " Bo " always told him to stay away from the closet , but now he was gone .
" We 're still trying to find out where the gun came from , " said police lieutenant Tom Young .
" We think it was stolen but whoever stole it never checked to see if it was loaded . "
Last month the boy appeared in court , but sentencing was postponed pending psychiatric evaluations .
" The judge was asking him simple questions , like , ' Where do you live ? ' and ' How old are you ? ' " explains
Young , " and he kept saying , ' I do n't know . ' "
Terry 's dad , Terry Sr , has been in the military , stationed in Europe , and knows American gun culture is not inevitable .
" I 'm torn , " he says .
" I respect the right to bear arms .
But you do n't know what fool out there might have a gun or what child in the next room might pick one up next .
And then - bang ! "
7.49 pm
In a wealthy suburb of Las Vegas , three time zones away , Jason Moore , Lamar Brown and four friends went to another friend 's house to drop off some jeans .
The friend and his family were all away , but Lamar knew the code to the garage door and let them in .
Once inside , they made themselves at home , logging on to a computer and messing about with Lamar 's MySpace page .
Lamar 's younger sister , Tatiana , describes him affectionately as " a little shrimp always talking like a big lobster " .
Jason is variously described by friends and family as " cool " , " chilled " and " really nice " .
He wanted to be a rapper and certainly had attitude .
He had recently been suspended from school after he " cussed out " a PE teacher who " jumped up in his face " .
Lamar , 18 , and Jason , also 18 , were foster brothers .
Their mothers had once been friends .
But Lamar 's mother , Robin Stumps , had become Jason 's legal guardian because of his own mother 's drug habit .
" When you saw one , you saw them both , " she says .
" They were so close . "
But there , in their friend 's house , something happened .
No one will say what , but it ended shortly before eight o'clock when Lamar shot Jason in the chest with a 20 - gauge shotgun , according to the police report .
" I did n't know what happened , " says Curtis Perkins , one of the boys who was with them .
" I heard a gunshot and then suddenly everybody was just running out the house .
I ran , too . "
According to the police report , Lamar threw the gun in the bushes , called 911 for Jason and then got in a car with three of the friends and drove away .
Later , he came to the hospital to see how Jason was faring and was picked up by detectives .
News reports that night suggested Jason 's condition was critical but stable and recovering .
He was pronounced dead at 3.50 am the next morning .
" He bled to death , " insists family friend Dee - Dee Lovato .
" The bullet hit his shoulder and missed his major arteries and organs .
Lamar shot him , but he did n't have to die . "
" Accidents happen , " says Jason 's brother , Genesis .
" People should watch what they do with guns and shit - they ain't nothing to play with . "
I met Jason 's family the day that Seung - Hui Cho shot dead 32 of his fellow students at Virginia Tech university before turning the gun on himself .
On the way there , I heard several callers to the local radio station ringing in to say the tragedy could have been avoided if the students had been armed .
" If you 're not a policeman , you do n't need a gun , " says Robin Stumps .
" I thought I was the best black mother in the world .
None of my kids were gang members .
None of them has a gun . "
" I do , " says her eldest son from across the room .
" Well , I know how to get one . "
Tatiana has Jason 's name tattooed on her arm - it is just one way in which the young here remember their dead .
Stores in some areas do a good trade in Rest In Peace T - shirts .
Inner city walls are decorated with RIP murals .
More recently , pages on MySpace have transformed a social networking site into an electronic graveyard , with friends posting testimony to the departed .
Jason 's page bears a picture of him and Lamar with their arms around each other 's shoulders , taken just days before the shooting .
Lamar pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter .
Originally it was thought he would get five years ' probation but , following the publicity surrounding the shooting , a young woman came forward with an accusation of sexual assault against him that could carry anything from 10 years to life in prison .
According to his sister Chenell , he now sits in Clark County Detention centre crying himself to sleep .
When it comes to sentencing , his mother will act as a character witness for both him and Jason .
7.57 pm
Two and a half thousand miles east , in Hyattsville , Maryland , gunfire shattered the quiet of a new housing development near the Martin Luther King Highway .
Korey Campbell , 17 , had been shot in the back just five minutes from his home .
Korey was going places .
Specifically , the next day he was going back to Keystone , Pennsylvania , where he was just two weeks from graduating from Job Corps , a vocational training programme for young adults .
Korey had been doing well : three weeks earlier , his supervisor 's report had described him as an " outstanding young man " with " excellent leadership skills " - " Korey will be an asset to whomever and wherever he takes employment . "
" He was ready for life , " says his mother , Vonda Campbell .
" The first thing he had to do was learn to drive .
But he was ready ... He was ready . "
Vonda had struggled to make sure her children made something of themselves .
Her eldest son got a basketball scholarship to attend New Haven university .
Korey had come back for Thanksgiving , and when he was shot he was walking home from a friend 's house to pack for the next day 's trip .
" A lot of women around here have lost their children for no reason , " Vonda says .
" I would hold my breath when Korey was back until he got on the bus for Pennsylvania .
I chose to send him away from this area . "
Korey was the fourth person to be shot in the area - notorious for drug dealing , she says - in the past four months .
" They had a vigil right there after two previous murders , but I never thought it would happen to me . "
She pulls out a small black bag with some of Korey 's things in it , including some T - shirts and his favourite chewing gum .
She hands me a picture of him in his coffin .
" I ca n't look at it , " she says .
" If his sister comes in , pretend it 's something else .
She can't handle that at all . "
The prison where Korey 's father is incarcerated would not let him out for the funeral .
The police have not contacted Vonda in several months to tell her of any developments in the case .
" It feels like nobody cares , " she says .
" Like he was never here .
Just another black kid dead .
But he was here .
He was my child .
He existed . "
The Campbells live just 25 minutes ' drive from Washington DC - the nation 's capital and , tellingly , the place where young people are by far the most likely to be shot dead ( more than 15 times more so than in New York state ) .
It is also home to the Supreme Court , which upholds the second amendment of the constitution enshrining the right to bear arms .
Back in the 18th century , this was a revolutionary measure , crafted to protect the general population from tyrannical government ( notably Britain ) .
Nowadays , the citizenry are more likely to shoot each other .
Even the most strident supporters of gun control , such as the Brady campaign , say they respect the second amendment .
" We do n't even want to get into the discussion , " says Alicia Horton .
" We are not a gun-banning organisation .
The number one preventative measure to stop young people being killed by guns would be to reduce access to firearms .
Regardless of how they died , if young people could n't put their hands on a gun , then other young people would n't be shot . "
Most Americans seem to agree : a Pew research poll shows that while public support for greater gun control has waned over the past decade , the majority still back it .
But it does not look likely to happen any time soon - the gun lobby can still rally sufficient support to take gun control off the political agenda regardless of who 's in power .
Before the 2000 election , the National Rifle Association boasted that it was so close to George Bush that it would be working " out of his office " .
They have been pretty much true to their word .
( The NRA turned down repeated requests for comment for this article . )
Just a few weeks before these nine youngsters died , the Democrats won control of both Senate and House of Representatives in the Congressional elections .
John Conyers , who became the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee , pledged he would not " support or forward to the House any legislation to ban handguns " .
9.45 pm In Cherry Hill , Baltimore , 14 - year - old Bernard Simon was sitting on a friend 's porch , just around the corner from his home , when someone shot him .
At one end of the street where he lived , searchlights stand on 20ft poles ; at the other is a flashing neon - blue light , courtesy of Baltimore police , with the message " 24/7 Believe " .
No one on the small block where Bernard was shot will admit to having even heard of him .
His mother has moved away .
The only evidence that Bernard was ever there is some graffiti scrawled on a power box : " Hez hooliganz .
RIP Bernie . "
Cherry Hill has the feel of a South African township .
With just a few ways in and out , it is easier to contain than it is to police .
Sitting on a promontory poking out into the Potapsco River , it is not on the way to anywhere .
Outsiders have no reason to go there , and many of those who live there have no reason to leave because they do n't have work .
More than half of its 8,000 residents live in poverty .
" If you 're in Cherry Hill , then chances are it's your destination , " says Cathy McClain , executive director of the Cherry Hill Trust , a local group dedicated to revitalising the area .
Boarded - up houses punctuate the estate .
In what is left of the playpark opposite Bernard 's former home stands half a slide with small steps leading to thin air .
The night before I arrived in town , somebody was shot dead .
Gangs became rampant in the 80s ; membership was based on where you lived .
And if gang life is no longer synonymous with the drugs trade as it once was , the dealing continues .
Bernard was a member of the Up The Hill gang - not to be mistaken for the Hillside gang .
" I do n't know what you can do to fix this , " says McClain .
" We just have n't been successful in persuading these kids to want to live beyond their teenage years .
They do n't seem to want to be grandparents .
They 'd rather live on on somebody 's T - shirt .
If they 're 21 , then they 're old . "
Bernard 's assailant was never found .
Indeed , not one of the four cases of teenagers killed by unknown gunmen that Sunday has been solved .
10.15 pm Less than an hour after Bernard Simon was gunned down , a call came in to Super Crown Pizza in suburban Atlanta for a home delivery to the Huntingwood Pointe housing complex two miles away .
Super Crown has a list of addresses it wo n't deliver to .
It 's not difficult to see why - pizza delivery is a dangerous business in these parts .
" A lot of my deliverymen have been robbed , " says Muhammad Iftkhar , a Pakistani immigrant who arrived in the US 13 years ago .
" They steal the money , they steal the food , the car .
One time they took all the man 's clothes and car keys .
The guy just walked back here in his underwear . "
Another time , Muhammad had a pistol stuck in his mouth while the place was cleaned out .
The chefs work behind bulletproof glass .
Muhammad wo n't say whether or not he keeps a gun in the shop .
" My main concern is business , " he says .
" I do n't want any kind of trouble . "
It was Zaid Mahmood 's turn to take the pizza .
Zaid had risked his life to deliver pizzas before : four months earlier , he had been beaten and had all his money and his green card stolen .
Huntingwood Pointe is one of several housing estates that sits back off a main road and is enclosed on all other sides by trees - it was not on Super Crown 's no - go list .
Zaid delivered the pizza and was on his way back to his car when , according to police reports , " he was approached by a group of three or four people who demanded his money " .
They told him to lie on the ground and hand over his car keys .
Zaid stayed standing and handed over the keys .
One of the boys , 14 - year - old Kenyatta Calhoun , told Zaid to hand over his mobile phone .
Zaid allegedly put his hand into his pocket , as though he were going for his phone , took out his gun and shot Kenyatta several times .
Two of the boys , one of whom had already got into Zaid 's car , ran away .
Kenyatta lay dying under a tree .
Chikobi Bush , 19 , says he heard the shots and ran out to see what was going on .
" I saw Kenyatta lying on the ground .
He was breathing , but he could n't say nothing . "
He describes Kenyatta as a " cool guy " .
" He used to come out , sit around and talk to people . "
It 's 11 o'clock in the morning when I visit , and Chikobi is doing just that himself , sitting and talking in one of the stairwells .
One of his friends struggles to recall Kenyatta .
" The short nigga ? "
" No , the light - skinned guy . "
" He got shot ?
Shit ! "
A lot of people get shot around here , they say - " For drugs , gangs , girls ... anything . "
When I ask whether everyone has guns , they just laugh .
" You knock on a door and ask , ' Have you got a gun ? ' and see if they do n't pull a pistol on your ass , " says the friend and laughs some more .
What do they need guns for ?
" Protection , " says Chikobi .
From whom ?
" From everybody . "
A few months earlier , Georgia had passed a " stand your ground " law that permitted state residents to use deadly force to respond to threats in public places , with no duty to retreat .
Zaid walked free .
And so Thanksgiving Sunday ended in Atlanta as it began in the Bronx - with robbery , death and the sound of gunshot .
No one would know from where the next day 's deaths would come .
The only certainty was that they would come .
On the morning of November 27 , a gunlovers ' website , glocktalk.com , ran a discussion thread about Kenyatta 's death the night before .
The Fly wrote , " I do love a cleaner gene pool . "
Butcher asked , " How many 14 - year - old gangbangers are gonna be killed this week ? "
Lcarreau responded , " Not enough . "
Walk into any Wal - Mart and you will not be surprised to see the shelves sagging with Chinese - made goods — everything from shoes and garments to toys and electronics .
But the ubiquitous “ Made in China ” label obscures an important point :
Few of these products are made by indigenous Chinese companies .
In fact , you would be hard - pressed to find a single homegrown Chinese firm that operates on a global scale and markets its own products abroad .
That is because China ’s export - led manufacturing boom is largely a creation of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , which effectively serves as a substitute for domestic entrepreneurship .
During the last 20 years , the Chinese economy has taken off , but few local firms have followed , leaving the country ’s private sector with no world - class companies to rival the big multinationals .
India has not attracted anywhere near the amount of FDI that China has .
In part , this disparity reflects the confidence international investors have in China ’s prospects and their skepticism about India ’s commitment to free - market reforms .
But the FDI gap is also a tale of two diasporas .
China has a large and wealthy diaspora that has long been eager to help the motherland , and its money has been warmly received .
By contrast , the Indian diaspora was , at least until recently , resented for its success and much less willing to invest back home .
New Delhi took a dim view of Indians who had gone abroad , and of foreign investment generally , and instead provided a more nurturing environment for domestic entrepreneurs .
In the process , India has managed to spawn a number of companies that now compete internationally with the best that Europe and the United States have to offer .
Moreover , many of these firms are in the most cutting - edge , knowledge - based industries - software giants Infosys and Wipro and pharmaceutical and biotechnology powerhouses Ranbaxy and Dr. Reddy ’s Labs , to name just a few .
Last year , the Forbes 200 , an annual ranking of the world ’s best small companies , included 13 Indian firms but just four from mainland China .
India has also developed a much stronger infrastructure to support private enterprise .
Its capital markets operate with greater efficiency and transparency than do China’s .
Its legal system , while not without substantial flaws , is considerably more advanced .
China and India are the world ’s next major powers .
They also offer competing models of development .
It has long been an article of faith that China is on the faster track , and the economic data bear this out .
The “ Hindu rate of growth ” — a pejorative phrase referring to India ’s inability to match its economic growth with its population growth - may be a thing of the past , but when it comes to gross domestic product ( GDP ) figures and other headline numbers , India is still no match for China .
However , the statistics tell only part of the story - the macroeconomic story .
At the micro level , things look quite different .
There , India displays every bit as much dynamism as China .
Indeed , by relying primarily on organic growth , India is making fuller use of its resources and has chosen a path that may well deliver more sustainable progress than China ’s FDI - driven approach .
“ Can India surpass China ? ” is no longer a silly question , and , if it turns out that India has indeed made the wiser bet , the implications - for China ’s future growth and for how policy experts think about economic development generally - could be enormous .
The Stifling State
The fact that India is increasingly building from the ground up while China is still pursuing a top - down approach reflects their contrasting political systems : India is a democracy , and China is not .
But the different strategies are also a function of history .
China ’s Communist Party came to power in 1949 intent on eradicating private ownership , which it quickly did .
Although the country is now in its third decade of free - market reforms , it continues to struggle with the legacy of that period - witness the controversy surrounding the recent decision to officially allow capitalists to join the Communist Party .
India , on the other hand , developed a softer brand of socialism , Fabian socialism , which aimed not to destroy capitalism but merely to mitigate the social ills it caused .
It was considered essential that the public sector occupy the economy ’s “ commanding heights , ” to use a phrase coined by Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin but popularized by India ’s first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru .
However , that did not prevent entrepreneurship from flourishing where the long arm of the state could not reach .
Developments at the microeconomic level in China reflect these historical and ideological differences .
China has been far bolder with external reforms but has imposed substantial legal and regulatory constraints on indigenous , private firms .
In fact , only four years ago , domestic companies were finally granted the same constitutional protections that foreign businesses have enjoyed since the early 1980s .
As of the late 1990s , according to the International Finance Corporation , more than two dozen industries , including some of the most important and lucrative sectors of the economy - banking , telecommunications , highways , and railroads - were still off - limits to private local companies .
These restrictions were designed not to keep Chinese entrepreneurs from competing with foreigners but to prevent private domestic businesses from challenging China ’s state - owned enterprises ( SOEs ) .
Some progress has been made in reforming the bloated , inefficient SOEs during the last 20 years , but Beijing is still not willing to relinquish its control over the largest ones , such as China Telecom .
Instead , the government has ferociously protected them from competition .
In the 1990s , numerous Chinese entrepreneurs tried , and failed , to circumvent the restrictions placed on their activities .
Some registered their firms as nominal SOEs ( all the capital came from private sources , and the companies were privately managed ) , only to find themselves ensnared in title disputes when financially strapped government agencies sought to seize their assets .
More than a few promising businesses have been destroyed this way .
This bias against home - grown firms is widely acknowledged .
A report issued in 2000 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences concluded that , “ Because of long - standing prejudices and mistaken beliefs , private and individual enterprises have a lower political status and are discriminated against in numerous policies and regulations .
The legal , policy , and market environment is unfair and inconsistent . ”
Foreign investors have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the constraints placed on local private businesses .
One indication of the large payoff they have reaped on the back of China ’s phenomenal growth :
In 1992 , the income accruing to foreign investors with equity stakes in Chinese firms was only $ 5.3 billion ; today it totals more than $ 22 billion .
( This money does not necessarily leave the country ; it is often reinvested in China . )
The Mogul as Hero
For democratic , postcolonial India , allowing foreign investors huge profits at the expense of indigenous firms is simply unfeasible .
Recall , for instance , the controversy that erupted a decade ago when the Enron Corporation made a deal with the state of Maharashtra to build a $ 2.9 billion power plant there .
The project proceeded , but only after several years of acrimonious debate over foreign investment and its role in India ’s development .
While China has created obstacles for its entrepreneurs , India has been making life easier for local businesses .
During the last decade , New Delhi has backed away from micromanaging the economy .
True , privatization is proceeding at a glacial pace , but the government has ceded its monopoly over long - distance phone service ; some tariffs have been cut ; bureaucracy has been trimmed a bit ; and a number of industries have been opened to private investment , including investment from abroad .
As a consequence , entrepreneurship and free enterprise are flourishing .
A measure of the progress :
In a recent survey of leading Asian companies by the Far Eastern Economic Review ( FEER ) , India registered a higher average score than any other country in the region , including China ( the survey polled over 2,500 executives and professionals in a dozen countries ; respondents were asked to rate companies on a scale of one to seven for overall leadership performance ) .
Indeed , only two Chinese firms had scores high enough to qualify for India ’s top 10 list .
Tellingly , all of the Indian firms were wholly private initiatives , while most of the Chinese companies had significant state involvement .
Some of the leading Indian firms are true start - ups , notably Infosys , which topped FEER ’s survey .
Others are offshoots of old - line companies .
Sundaram Motors , for instance , a leading manufacturer of automotive components and a principal supplier to General Motors , is part of the T.V.
Sundaram group , a century - old south Indian business group .
Not only is entrepreneurship thriving in India ; entrepreneurs there have become folk heroes .
Nehru would surely be appalled at the adulation the Indian public now showers on captains of industry .
For instance , Narayana Murthy , the 56 - year - old founder of Infosys , is often compared to Microsoft ’s Bill Gates and has become a revered figure .
These success stories never would have happened if India lacked the infrastructure needed to support Murthy and other would - be moguls .
But democracy , a tradition of entrepreneurship , and a decent legal system have given India the underpinnings necessary for free enterprise to flourish .
Although India ’s courts are notoriously inefficient , they at least comprise a functioning independent judiciary .
Property rights are not fully secure , but the protection of private ownership is certainly far stronger than in China .
The rule of law , a legacy of British rule , generally prevails .
These traditions and institutions have proved an excellent springboard for the emergence and evolution of India ’s capital markets .
Distortions are still commonplace , but the stock and bond markets generally allow firms with solid prospects and reputations to obtain the capital they need to grow .
In a World Bank study published last year , only 52 percent of the Indian firms surveyed reported problems obtaining capital , versus 80 percent of the Chinese companies polled .
As a result , the Indian firms relied much less on internally generated finances :
Only 27 percent of their funding came through operating profits , versus 57 percent for the Chinese firms .
Corporate governance has improved dramatically , thanks in no small part to Murthy , who has made Infosys a paragon of honest accounting and an example for other firms .
In a survey of 25 emerging market economies conducted in 2000 by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia , India ranked sixth in corporate governance , China 19th .
The advent of an investor class , coupled with the fact that capital providers , such as development banks , are themselves increasingly subject to market forces , has only bolstered the efficiency and credibility of India ’s markets .
Apart from providing the regulatory framework , the Indian government has taken a back seat to the private sector .
In China , by contrast , bureaucrats remain the gatekeepers , tightly controlling capital allocation and severely restricting the ability of private companies to obtain stock market listings and access the money they need to grow .
Indeed , Beijing has used the financial markets mainly as a way of keeping the SOEs afloat .
These policies have produced enormous distortions while preventing China ’s markets from gaining depth and maturity .
( It is widely claimed that China ’s stock markets have a total capitalization in excess of $ 400 billion , but factoring out non-tradeable shares owned by the government or by government - owned companies reduces the valuation to just around $ 150 billion . )
Compounding the problem are poor corporate governance and the absence of an independent judiciary .
Dollars and Diasporas
If India has so clearly surpassed China at the grass - roots level , why is n’t India ’s superiority reflected in the numbers ?
Why is the gap in GDP and other benchmarks still so wide ?
It is worth recalling that India ’s economic reforms only began in earnest in 1991 , more than a decade after China began liberalizing .
In addition to the late start , India has had to make do with a national savings rate half that of China ’s and 90 percent less FDI .
Moreover , India is a sprawling , messy democracy riven by ethnic and religious tensions , and it has also had a longstanding , volatile dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir .
China , on the other hand , has enjoyed two decades of relative tranquility ; apart from Tiananmen Square , it has been able to focus almost exclusively on economic development .
That India ’s annual growth rate is only around 20 percent lower than China ’s is , then , a remarkable achievement .
And , of course , whether the data for China are accurate is an open question .
The speed with which India is catching up is due to its own efficient deployment of capital and China ’s inefficiency , symbolized by all the money that has been frittered away on SOEs .
And China ’s misallocation of resources is likely to become a big drain on the economy in the years ahead .
In the early 1990s , when China was registering double - digit growth rates , Beijing invested massively in the state sector .
Most of the investments were not commercially viable , leaving the banking sector with a huge number of nonperforming loans - possibly totaling as much as 50 percent of bank assets .
At some point , the capitalization costs of these loans will have to be absorbed , either through write - downs ( which means depositors bear the cost ) or recapitalization of the banks by the government , which diverts money from other , more productive uses .
This could well limit China ’s future growth trajectory .
India ’s banks may not be models of financial probity , but they have not made mistakes on nearly the same scale .
According to a recent study by the management consulting firm Ernst & Young , about 15 percent of banking assets in India were nonperforming as of 2001 .
India ’s economy is thus anchored on more solid footing .
The real issue , of course , is n’t where China and India are today but where they will be tomorrow .
The answer will be determined in large measure by how well both countries utilize their resources , and on this score , India is doing a superior job .
Is it pursuing a better road to development than China ?
We wo n’t know the answer for many years .
However , some evidence indicates that India ’s grassroots approach may indeed be wiser - and the evidence , ironically , comes from within China itself .
Consider the contrasting strategies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang , two coastal provinces that were at similar levels of economic development when China ’s reforms began .
Jiangsu has relied largely on FDI to fuel its growth .
Zhejiang , by contrast , has placed heavier emphasis on indigenous entrepreneurs and organic development .
During the last two decades , Zhejiang ’s economy has grown at an annual rate of about 1 percent faster than Jiangsu’s .
Twenty years ago , Zhejiang was the poorer of the two provinces ; now it is unquestionably more prosperous .
India may soon have the best of both worlds :
It looks poised to reap significantly more FDI in the coming years than it has attracted to date .
After decades of keeping the Indian diaspora at arm ’s length , New Delhi is now embracing it .
In some circles , it used to be jokingly said that NRI , an acronym applied to members of the diaspora , stood for “ not required Indians . ”
Now , the term is back to meaning just “ nonresident Indian . ”
The change in attitude was officially signaled earlier this year when the government held a conference on the diaspora that a number of prominent NRIs attended .
China ’s success in attracting FDI is partly a historical accident - it has a wealthy diaspora .
During the 1990s , more than half of China ’s FDI came from overseas Chinese sources .
The money appears to have had at least one unintended consequence :
The billions of dollars that came from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan may have inadvertently helped Beijing postpone politically difficult internal reforms .
For instance , because foreign investors were acquiring assets from loss - making SOEs , the government was able to drag its feet on privatization .
Until now , the Indian diaspora has accounted for less than 10 percent of the foreign money flowing to India .
With the welcome mat now laid out , direct investment from nonresident Indians is likely to increase .
And while the Indian diaspora may not be able to match the Chinese diaspora as “ hard ” capital goes , Indians abroad have substantially more intellectual capital to contribute , which could prove even more valuable .
The Indian diaspora has famously distinguished itself in knowledge - based industries , nowhere more so than in Silicon Valley .
Now , India ’s brightening prospects , as well as the changing attitude vis -à - vis those who have gone abroad , are luring many nonresident Indian engineers and scientists home and are enticing many expatriate business people to open their wallets .
With the help of its diaspora , China has won the race to be the world ’s factory .
With the help of its diaspora , India could become the world ’s technology lab .
China and India have pursued radically different development strategies .
India is not outperforming China overall , but it is doing better in certain key areas .
That success may enable it to catch up with and perhaps even overtake China .
Should that prove to be the case , it will not only demonstrate the importance of home - grown entrepreneurship to long - term economic development ; it will also show the limits of the FDI - dependent approach China is pursuing .

This current MS behavior seems to rather indicate that there might be no strong connection between Microsoft and SCO ( tSCOG ) .
They ( that is : MS ) must be watching how " well " the SCO saga is proceeding and how well it is hindering adoption of Linux and other non-MS systems .
In consequence they should then be well aware that Darl - tactics do n't play well in the long run .
Or is this the sooper intelligent plot to make us all think that MS has no close relation with SCO in bed , as they are behaving so dumb that SCO can't be their little test ?
Or is MS trying to proof that old " history repeating " meme , doomed to repeat other people 's mistakes ?

But I 'm not panicking .
If Microsoft really wants to

thus can be used as a defense agaisnt them bringing a patent issue on linux via
the legal estoppel or whatever this that is called .
Awful clear that they are giving rights to use gpl software and thus anyone
using the gpl software is entitled thus to the same rights forever .
Free of an infringing claim they make that is .
They can rant and whine all they
like but by selling the vouchers to dell and having taken the vouchers from
novell to sell services based on linux it may be implied one would have to get
the software then too so MS would have to tell htem where to get it even if it
was dell they have to say it too .
Arguable i know .
But the idea htey claim patents are in linux but allow it to be
used means or me thinks it measn this legal estoppal is in play already .

I would n't be so sure that Microsoft would n't sue their own customers .
They certainly have no problem threatening their customers .
Here are two examples of Microsoft threatening their own customers .
It 's not a far stretch from threatening your customers to suing them .

re : 6 ) Sigh !

Never smeg off the guys who make BIG holes in the

If they launch an attack then what will the counter attack be like ?
Closed or
not their software will be ripped into with a vengeance .
They will attract the
attention of just about anyone who is anybody in software .
Even their sycophants
who are locked into producing apps for Windows will start to wonder why they are
being locked out of the emerging market .
Not good .
There must also be an internal struggle withing Microsoft .
While the upper
echelons continue with their monolithic vision there will be a realisation , from
the bottom upwards , that the model needs to change and Microsoft needs to make a
move towards Linux and Open Source if it is to survive .
Where and when those two
philosophies will meet is anyones guess .
Why spend umpteen squillions on Vista
if you can produce an OS based on Linux for a fraction of the cost .
It has to
make economical sense for them .
If they need to do that then they need to
recognise the community .
Which way lies their ultimate survival ?

I say " Linux " but on the other hand I understand and use
GNU / Linux when conversing with those who can or * need * to
understand the distinction .
Mr. Parloff is being rather boorish in pointedly refusing
to use the term at the request of RMS .
The distinction is
important for his article , particularly for his prospective
readers if he * wishes * to inform those who do not allready
understand .
By avoiding the proper use of the term " GNU / Linux " when
needed , he is helping MS maintain it 's pet cloud .
He could have had a very informative interview with RMS
about why GNU should * not* be implied with Linux and never
have used the term at all .

But he does break down the total number allegedly violated - 235 - into categories .
He says that the Linux kernel - the deepest layer of the free operating system , which interacts most directly with the computer hardware - violates 42 Microsoft patents .
The Linux graphical user interfaces - essentially , the way design elements like menus and toolbars are set up - run afoul of another 65 , he claims .
The Open Office suite of programs , which is analogous to Microsoft Office , infringes 45 more .
E-mail programs infringe 15 , while other assorted FOSS programs allegedly transgress 68 .
Linux : 42 .
Which are in optional kernel modules ?
Which are in architecture - dependent modules ?
( Merely having the source code on your disk cannot infringe , so it 's only compiled code that matters .
That 's why it's ok to include the font - hinting - patent code in the source , and only compile it in the free world , leaving it out here in the USA . )
How many could co-exist in the same compile of the kernel ?
How about the loadable binary - only modules ?
Who can know about those .
GUIs : 65 .
Which of the many GUIs ?
Do the same GUIs violate the same patents when run on * BSD , OSX , or some other Unix ?
OOo ( StarOffice , too , by implication ) : 45 .
Which programs in the OOo suite ?
Does he include other ODF implementations under the what he calls " Open Office " ?
E-mail programs : 15 .
Which email programs ?
Sendmail and the like , which provide so much of the prior art that Microsoft bases its patents on ?
Others : 68 .
Which of the umpty - thousand others ?

I was just rereading one of the Scott Adams book ( he of Dilbert fame ) the
other day , Way of the Weasel I believe it was .
I remember a portion about
' estimating ' numbers .
According to his wisdom , if you want numbers to be
believed by people , pick a ' funny ' number .
Never round it off .
What does that mean ??
Well , which of the following statements would make you
believe that a complete and thorough comparison had been done .
a) This code infringes 250 of our patents
b ) This code infringes 253 of our patents
In the example cited in the book , he chose to use millions of dollars , probably
because it is easier to come up with ' funny ' numbers .
I will leave it to the
readers to fill in their own comparisons .

In the recent ruling in AT&T vs Microsoft , Justice Alito 's concurring opinion said Because no physical object originating in the United States was combined with these computers , there was no violation of § 271 ( f ) .
Accordingly , it is irrelevant that the Windows software was not copied onto the foreign - made computers directly from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the United States .
To be sure , if these computers could not run Windows without inserting and keeping a CD - ROM in the appropriate drive , then the CD - ROMs might be components of the computer .
But that is not the case here .
I interprete this to mean that software , by itself , is not patentable .
It must be combined with some hardware ( i.e. it can be on firmware inside the computer ) but cannot be simply present on the hard drive and executing as an application or even as part of the operating system .
Of course , this was only 3 justices out of 7 , but the others simply determined that they did n't have to decide this issue because , as footnote 14 says :
We need not and do not reach that issue here .
However , as I read Justice Ginsberg 's opinion of the court , it appeared to me that " component " was generally meant to refer to something physical .
I suspect that had AT&T and Microsoft not stipulated that Microsoft violated the patent in the U.S. that a majority of the justices would have joined Justice Alito 's decision .

You missed one .
Laches .
The longer Microsoft waits to actually bring a lawsuit against anyone , the more
chance Linux producers and users have of invoking the laches doctrine , which
states that you can't sit on a known case of patent infringement until it 's more
advantageous or profitable to sue .
If you discover an infringement , you should
launch your lawyers at the " infringers " immediately or risk not being
able to sue .
Here , Microsoft has chosen to string out this ' infringement ' as FUD for a long
time now .
All anyone needs to do to show that they 've known about it but not
sued anyone is to collect the Thoughts of Chairman Steve And His Big Mouth over
the past two or three years or so , and file it as an exhibit ...

I love no 2 and no 4 ( from PJ 's list ) .
I love no 2 because MS have themselves sunk their patent portfolio regarding
everything ever included in SuSE .
I now understand why the FSF did n't sue
Microsoft and Novell for violation of GPL V2 .
This patent defense is much better
than anything lawsuit over GPL2 could have given , so they just let them
distribute .
Hats off to the FSF legal team .
I love no 4 because it makes explicit that Microsoft has a business model of
" You must buy our products because you do n't have choice " .
This is a
model that work best when people are under the ( misguided ) perception that lack
of choice is the natural consequence of superior work from Microsoft 's part so
they accept to put up with it .
Do n't laugh , there are PHBs that think that way .
Once people understand that lack of choice is the result of threats of being
kneecapped if you offer meaningful choice , you get a very different reaction .
This is especially true when people are personally being threatened .
No 4 means
Microsoft themselves advertise publicly they are in the kneecapping business and
ask everybody to feel threatened .
They do n't have to sue , just making the noises
will be enough .
Now we are poised to reap the benefits of this long fight with SCOG .
Everybody
knows suing without telling what the infringement is is nothing but bullying .
It
will be much easier to connect the dots between Microsoft behavior and SCOG in

After that , Microsoft 's threats will be very much neutered .

Perhaps there is a way to get the patent list from MS .
Someone could take over a
recently abandoned 1 - man Linux distro and contact Microsoft for a patent license
because , of course , we would not want to infringe on Microsoft 's patents with
out distro .
Then demand a list of those 235 - odd patents that are supposed to be
infringed upon .
We want to know what we are licensing of course .
There might even be some interesting fallout if Microsoft refuses to negotiate
or supply the list .

Thanks to a Slashdot contributor for suggesting that this is remarkably like Joe McCarthy 's headline - grabbing , but never substantiated , claim .
Censure of Senator Joe McCarthy ( 1954 )
Microsoft is rather neatly hoist on its own petard here .
After sponsoring SCO to make similar claims , and having those claims rather comprehensively debunked , people are much more skeptical of cries of wolf .
If Microsoft had started with this , there would have been a lot more fear of the 800 lb. gorilla .
But now that people — particularly people with money and authority over buying decisions — are immunized , the response is " where 's the beef ? "
Vague allegations are n't enough , because there 's an earlier example of dire threats turning out to be 100 % pure vapour .

Not an expert on US ( or any law ) but in order to claim damages from a patent
infringement I always thought the patent holder had to at least attempt to
defend the patent ....
I would have thought MS 's actions here were self defeating , they 've blocked
themselves from damages claims ( and possibly from ANY claims ) by NOT being
explicit about the infringement .
Any lawyers care to comment ? [ Reply to This | # ]

Surely Microsoft is n't going to sue .
Microsoft has much more revenue than any member of OIN , so the counter - claims would be devastating .
Let 's say each party gets one patent to stick and each is assessed at 0.5 % of related product revenue .
That 's $m paid to Microsoft and $b paid by Microsoft .
This is pure FUD , as there 's no way Microsoft can take the risk of a successful patent counter - claim .

Now that Microsoft have officially announced the number of patents ' infringed '
by Linux .
How long do they have to begin enforcing these ?
Surely they have to
move soon , or as I understand it the doctrine of latches will prevent them doing
anything at all ?
And if you think about it , once that kicks in MS are kind of stuck .
They 've
claimed patents in Linux , Open office , Email and ' assorted ' FOSS programs .
If
they wait too long , if they try to enforce * any * patent against any FOSS
program , one of the first defence arguments will be to ask them to prove that
particular patent was n't one of the ones they knew about today .
And as I do n't
see them getting around that without declaring in court exactly which patents
they knew about today .
The first case they try could blow this whole thing wide
open .
Personally , I 've no doubt at all this is about FUD .
MS know that if they name
one , they have to name them all , and they will wait as long as they possibly can
before they specifically name these ' violations ' .
They even admit in the
article that they refuse to identify patents lest FOSS advocates start filing
challenges to them .
It seems to me that they know they 're on shaky ground .
You could even read into this that MS are running scared , and that this is more
of a tactical retreat .
They 've seen SCO 's attack on Linux fail miserably , their
Novell plan looks like an approach that wo n't hold water , and the recent rulings
by the Supreme Court may considerably reduce the value of the patents they do
hold .
MS are trying to get every ounce of value out of these patents before they have
to write them off as worthless .
Just my 2c .

Microsoft 's real problem in the marketplace is that folks already hate the company 's business tactics .
That does n't seem to have slowed down their growth any .
So why is it a problem for them ?

At least , Microsoft would never sue a major creator or distributor of Linux .
And
this , I suspect , means that it will never happen .
Firstly , because of the publicity .
These days , MS prefers to skulk around in the
shadows and try and influence through intermediaries .
Think Commonwealth of
Massachusetts .
Secondly , because they would lose , and lose big .
Just imagine the discovery
bonanza that someone like IBM would have against Microsoft ...
And the sweetest bit ?
If , in an alternate universe , SCO were to win on their
" non-literal infringing " nonsense , just imagine how vulnerable that
would make the Windows environment ?
Just think of all those software features copied by MS over the years ... back
before they decided it was bad for business to be copying other people 's IP .

" 4 . What kind of companies threaten to hurt you if you do n't pay them
protection money ?
Do you want to do business with that type of company ?
Can
Microsoft risk that inevitable reaction ? "
Desperate companies .
I think there is some dramatic action behind the scenes :
- Vista is completely tanking
MS sold assets to prop up their profits and claimed it was Vista sales .
How
desperate can you get ?
- Vista security is already broken , including users being able to circumvent ALL
Vista DRM ( using a boot kit developed by two Indian students , talk about quality
students )
- Vista is much worse than modern Linix distributions , HW efficiency is
incomparable
- The really good developers moved out of MS
- MS / Vista DRM requirments are HW and price killers
- MS do n't have the people to accomodate new , revolutionary or evolutionary
hardware ( they could n't get XP on the OLPC laptop )
- There is no plan B
- Companies are seeing MS profits are paid directly from their own net profits ,
with no increase in productivity
- Maybe OOXML is going to tank too , and with it Sharepoint as the new toll
booth .
Remember there are only 603 OOXML documents in Google .
Also , ISO might
not be the easy ride MS thought
- Even the Intel Classmate , Intel 's OLPC crusher , is defecting and linked up
with RedHat .
So the next billion computers might run Linux either way .
And MS are the only ones who actually KNOW how many computers are running Floss
( ie , total number of computers sold and connected to the internet minus those
activating XP or Vista , using MS Office ) .
With a $ 12B or so yearly profit evaporating , I would become desperate too .
Maybe my earlier prediction of the death of the monopoly ( start 2009 ) might even
have been too pessimistic .

I was wondering if it makes sense that we as consumers should file complaints
with the FTC .
Is n't this the kind of stuff that they are supposed to deal with ?
As I see it , everything that MS says about " alleged MS IP violating "
software is intended to put fear into the consumer about potential IP violation
without actually having to prove anything .
So the real intent is to confuse and
deter consumers from considering alternative competing software .
Correct me if
I 'm wrong , but this smells like an unfair business practice .
Although the
software is free , this illegal practice still hurts vendors who could and do
provide services that can be used to support the use of free software .
I think
the FTC needs to get involved and force MS to either put - up or shut - up !
" unfair competition " is sometimes used to refer only to those torts
that are meant to confuse consumers as to the source of the product .

FWIW , I 've got a copy of Microsoft Interix sitting in my . wine / drive_c directory .
And yes , it contains a bona fide version of gcc.3.3 , distributed under the GPL v2 , which contains the words : 7 . If , as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason ( not limited to patent issues ) , conditions are imposed on you ( whether by court order , agreement or otherwise ) that contradict the conditions of this License , they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License .
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations , then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all .
For example , if a patent license would not permit royalty - free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you , then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program .
I take it as read that since Microsoft is making these threats and mutterings of patent infringement and has neglected a minor matter of specificity , the FSF and the GNU Project are obliged to point out the implications of this to Microsoft - that they are no longer permitted to distribute Microsoft Interix as it currently stands , because of their complete lack of specificity means that the gcc and other GNU Project applications included in the Interix distribution , could well be covered by their nebulous allegations .
Indeed , Samba would also be entitled to point out to Novell that acquiescing in Microsoft 's completely aspecific allegations of patent infringement means that Novell is no longer permitted to distribute Samba .
I suspect that Microsoft is doing a SCO Group , for much the same financial reasons .
I expect Microsoft to meet the same fate the SCO Group will - ignominious massive reality failure .

PJ - totally agree with you about the * likelyhood * of any action succeeding but IMHO this is just a continuation of Microsoft 's dispicable FUD strategy .
I honestly think they are starting to get a little scared that the days of ( almost ) complete Microsoft monopoly on Personal Computers are drawing to an end .
Redhat / Fedora , openSUSE , Ubuntu Linux , Mandriva and many other Linux distributions are now starting to look very polished and professional and I think the general public are just beginning to notice this and the thought terrifies Redmond .
When you have stories like this one and this one on the BBC web site in full view of the general public then a certain percentage are bound to notice .
Microsoft seem now to be in the unenviable position of having a disintegrating monopoly which is eroding their bottom line and they are doing anything they can to hold onto power .
Hey Redmond !
Move on !
Start producing innovative and exciting products like you used to do instead of fighting everybody else who actually has new ideas and you might actually hang on to customers .

At this point , free software and open software advocates have a common need for
a patent clause on gplvx
There is consensus on gpl2
There is consensus on gpl2 + anti-patent provisions
gpl3 = gpl2 + anti-patent provisions + anti-drm
open sourcers do not agree ( philosophically ) with imposing politics or banning
uses in licensing .
Today , drm. tomorrow , porn .
the day after , rock music .
Be
careful of what you ban .
open sourcers will stick with gpl2 instead of gpl3 due to anti-drm clause
free software ppl will hold out for purity and get no upgrade to gpl2 at all .

It seems to me that this statement by Microsoft is damaging other
people 's businesses .
Most people are not in a position to do anything about it .
One company that is affected and has the resources to do something is IBM .
When
faced with a similar situation with Caldera / SCO they did not have to initiate
anything because Darl made the first move .
As we have come to know , the IBM
legal team grind like the mills of the gods .
Even Billy G acknowledges that IBM
is a four - times heavier gorilla than Microsoft .
Now my question is : disregarding the terms of the GPL and disregarding whether
Microsoft ( or indeed IBM ) actually distribute Linux or the other allegedly
offending code ; does IBM have standing to bring a case on the grounds that
Microsoft are damaging their business by making false statements about products
upon which IBM depends for a section of its business ?
As Microsoft has
effectively made 235 independent claims of patent infringement , IBM could
presumably make Microsoft justify every one of these separately in court and
claim damages for each one shown to be false .
I cannot see how Microsoft can buy their way out of this one .
They could agree
to settle out of court for some substantial sum of money but the problem is that
they cannot make ' denying liability ' part of the settlement ; having made the
statement they would be obliged to withdraw it .
Withdrawing it would mean
admitting that all the patents are invalid ( or at least irrelevant to the
software in question ) which would leave them open to further claims by other
interested parties .

Giving out or assigning vouchers is NOT distribution .
This was discussed earlier .
I think FSF mis-spoke .
It 's definitely incorrect .
A voucher is distribution of only a voucher , not actual product .
If you are not
the one doing the fulfillment of the product , then you never distribute .
If Novell or Red Hat or whoever does fulfillment , they are the ones doing
distribution .
Only the entity doing the actual distribution is encumbered by the GPL ( even
under GPLv3 this is the case ! )
So in this way Microsoft avoids the GPL rules , they 're smarter than you think
( sometimes ) .
Does n't mean their patent BS holds water , it just means that
sometimes Microsoft does smart things .

Microsoft waited too long to use the patent weapon .

The big corporate customers have heard it before , and nothing came of it .
Why are they going to worry now ?
It was n't like SCO did n't have the money to press their claims .
Waiving a briefcase full of copyright or patent violations just does n't scare anyone anymore .
If MS had an ironclad case , they would bring it to court , not to Fortune Magazine .

My guess is that most of these so called " patents " are so broad that
they not only potentially affect Linux , they potentially affect all operating
systems and software .
That would mean that Microsoft would be targeting not just
Linux , but anyone creating operating systems and software .
By actually making such an arrogant move Microsoft declares themselves owed not
only the position of being the current overbearing monopoly they are , but the
right to be the ONLY legitimate OS at all allowed to " innovate " in the
marketplace .

The general belief seems to be that this is posturing : Microsoft is n't going to
sue anyone .
I think their fear of letting people know which patents are being
violated is pretty good proof of that .
So the only reasons they could be doing this is : 1 ) they hope to sell licenses ,
or 2 ) they 're trying to create market uncertainty .
Both are certainly working at least a little , but probably not enough .
And if
someone , say in germany , were to sue saying " put up or shut up " , like
what happened with SCO , that would do alot .
But I think there is more we can do .
OIN could start making press releases .
IBM
could too .
A few " microsoft is violating 22 THOUSAND patents with its OS
and office products . " would get them scrambling , * AND * be a taste of their

Not to correct PJ , but the US Government can use ANY patent it wants , when it
wants .
Usually the government works with the company it is taking IP from and
comes to a mutually beneficial arrangement .
But if there is no
" agreement " the government can just take the IP and do with it as it
pleases .
So Microsoft wo n't be suing the Pentagon or any other government agency ( DOT ,

Is it possible to petition the courts in some way so as to have a court - order forcing MS to disclose the patents MS feels Open Source is infringing ?
Petition may be a bad word .
I do n't mean to petition by having half a million people sign something .
I 'm refering more to the definition : Petition - request : a formal message requesting something that is submitted to an authority .
I 'm thinking there must be some way you can present some kind of filing that will : Outline the fact that Patents are publicly available information .
MS claims GNU / Linux infringes a number of their patents .
MS has made it clear they do n't want to inform what the patents are .
At least a portion of the open source industry does not want or need the MS patents .
That portion would like the oppertunity to stop the infringing action .
So the request would be : please order MS to disclose under public terms the patents that they feel GNU / Linux infringes .
Is there some way to do that which would be significantly more cost - effective then raising a whole lawsuit ?

I saw a comment elsewhere to the effect that , so far the FOSS community has
played nice with Microsoft , competing on merits , but if it comes down to
hardball on both sides , Microsoft 's lock - out strategy could easily be turned
around and used against them .
The FOSS community , having quite a bit of control
over the workings of the internet ( FOSS software is used in the majority for
web - servers , routers , firewalls , DNS , etc. on the web ) , could simply stop
supporting Microsoft 's non-standard quirks which they used in their futile
attempts to take over the web , and Microsoft software would suddenly quit

People dislike their products too , and the prices , but as a result of those
business practices , they do n't really feel they have any choice .
The proof of
the effectiveness of Microsoft 's monopoly power is that they have achieved and
maintained market dominance despite the fact that their products are n't very
good , and they certainly are n't competitively priced .
It is the hammerlock on
the distribution channels that makes all the difference .

All of Microsoft 's patents are publicly described , albeit with some delay , in
the IBM patent database .
Let 's not wait for them to try to use their patents .
Let 's try to invalidate them now -- even the ones that have nothing to do with
F/OSS .
The software patent gold rush has caused so many overlapping patents that
you'd be hard pressed to find a software company that is not violating at least
one patent .

Three questions :
< p>1 ) Why does n't the FSF create a GPLv4 , which would say that Microsoft
can use GPLed code if it allows open source programs to use Windows code -- in
short , cross-licensing , such as is endemic in the tech world .
< p>2 ) Why is it fine for the Free Software Foundation to enforce its
intellectual property rights , but immoral for Microsoft to do the same ?
< p>3 ) Many firms in the open source world profit quite well from selling
hardware , services , proprietary software applications , and internet services
related to Linux .
Why is moral to make money from these activities , but not
moral to make money from selling an operating system ? [ Reply to This | # ]

This

The

This is only one system out of hundreds , maybe thousands .
Lets see ... Who exactly was it that came up with SELinux ?
I know it was some

So M$ is going to walk up and tell these folks that they are infringing - I
do n't think so .
Obviously , though we do n't know the exact stupid motive , this is just more FUD .

I too find it hard to imagine Microsoft suing its own customers and being
successful in the long run .
I wonder if the real target may be software
developers and / or software companies ?
Think about the real roadblock to business adoption of Linux as a desktop .
For
most , it 's getting your business critical apps to run on Linux and for many ,
there is no Linux version of what they need so you have to rely upon an
emulator , which most large corporations are just not going to do .
Large
companies want reliability and if they have to pay Microsoft several million a
year to feel secure then they do it without thinking twice about it .

PJ says she is not unduly worried about  Microsoft 's patent saber rattling  in
the Fortune article .
I agree , but for different reasons .
The article quotes Linus Torvalds - he is also not worried because while the
 FSF considers proprietary software to be something evil and immoral  he just
doesnt care about it .
Well , that s refreshing .
It is what I believe Roger
Parloff was getting at earlier in the article when he talks about businesses
working out non-GPL licenses that that accommodate to the proprietary sector .
It is in that same vein that Microsoft has worked out licenses with customers
and the agreement last year with Novell .
Richard Stallman once referred to a study - and I dont remember the source -
that the Linux kernel infringed more than the 235 patents cited to in the
Fortune article .
So , patents on Linux is not new .
What is new is a statement
that Microsoft has identified 235 patents in its patent portfolio that cover
free and open source software .
Unlike the way PJ has covered the article , the statements by Ballmer and Smith
are not a call to a war on patents .
Stallman and Moglen seem to be the ones
calling for that .
Rather , Ballmer and Smith talk about licensing and not patent
infringement actions .
I suppose that that is one of the reasons for not naming
specific patents and specific products covered by them - to avoid being dragged
into court where they dont want to be on declaratory judgment actions .
It is true that recent Supreme Court decisions have pared back patentability of
inventions and infringement actions - but I think that is an evolutionary and
not radical alteration as suggested by PJ .
There is also the peer to patent
project of NYU that PJ mentions .
Really , all of this is good if it means
weeding out good patents from bad .
But none of this goes to the true desire of
the FSF - to eliminate patent protection for software .
PJ suggests that Microsoft is already a distributor of GPLd Linux under GPLv2 .
I dont think so , and neither does she , really , given her reference to GPLv3 .
In GPLv3 , FSF makes their disdain for patents on computer software clear .
But
rather than taking the issue to the only party that can do something about it -
the US Congress - FSF is more inclined to take it to the streets and fan the
flames to ignite the tinderbox that Moglen referred to in the article .
They
would apparently welcome it .
But it is cooperation and not conflagration that
Microsoft is interested in .
No , we can not all be friends - but we need not put
our friends , customers , and software users in a cross fire , which is precisely
what the GPL v3 does .
So , I am not worried about proprietary software or patents .
I am not worried
about how many patents Richard Stallman or Brad Smith thinks cover Linux .
I am
worried about the combatants on the anti-patent side of the aisle that do not
take the issue on directly but who actively seek confrontation instead .

Had she asked two years ago , I might have considered getting a laptop with W2K

Now , I will not even consider getting
a MS OS at all .
I will note I have used Linux and various * nices for decades ,
but there are some games we have that were then only available on Windoze .
Vista , because it was written for , and at the behest of , the ' content industry '
( sure seems like it at least ) was not written to be a proper OS , but rather a
revenue stream guarantee tool .
My views on that are not printable .
I will simply set up a system using one of the various Linux distros which will
give her all she needs for the system .

Here they go again !
It seems that since the SCOfiasco
began we Open Source users have been threatened ,
intimidated and harassed .
I 'm sure that every one of us
has had this deep feeling of doubt in our conscious as to
the ' final ' outcome in the courts of these
larger - than - life nuissance lawsuits and public slanders ..
As has been stated so many times at Groklaw ... show us the
code !!
In the IBM , Novell , Red Hat and related suits we
must wait for final disposition to know what the TRUTH is .
And wait we must .
What we all would like to see is for this whole thing to
be over so we can get on with our lives and use great
software of our own choice .
Not asking too much in my
opinion .
So what are we to do ??
So I 'm wondering how it will all pan out as are you .
It's
been said many times that if they ' show us the code ' we
could remove it and come up with non-infringing
replacements .
That is obvious but probably an over
simplification .
As in the SCOX case , if we replace the
supposedly infringing code with something that ' seems ' to
be non-patent infringing than they come back and say that
it is n't the ' actual ' code but rather the ' method ' that is
infringing , then what is next ??
Do we come up with a new
method ??
This just seems to be a never ending vicious
cycle .
So many patents out there we do n't even know
about .
All it takes is $ MONEY and a lawyer to keep going
and going and ...
A few years ago ( 2001 ) I switched from Red Hat to SuSE .
The reason (s ) does n't really matter .
I thought all was
well until the SCOXtorsion began .
FUD to the nth degree .
Then the announcement that Novell was buying SuSE came
along ..
I , as well as many others , wondered what that
might portend in the future .
Now the MS$ / Novell deal is
history .
And we hear about ' patent protection '
agreements .
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS !!
What
patents ??
( sorry for shouting . )
We need all this out
in the open !!
We need to either show that ALL purported
patents are invalid or else get rid of the infringing
code .
Period !!
Unless large corporate entities such as
Novell , IBM , etc. pay ' out of their pockets ' to get
PERMANENT , royalty free use of these patents for all end
users then either we rid ourselves of this code or prove
it non-infringing .
Either way we MUST see the code .
One
vendor making an agreement with another vendor does not
remove the threat to the community at large .
I , for one , do not like this deal Novell has made with
MS$ .
It stinks .
I am keeping my mind open as to
switching to another distribution as are , no doubt , many
other SuSE / openSuSE users ...
I may even roll my own as
I 'm not totally pleased with any one distribution I'm
aware of .
This may seem a bit crazy but I 've often wondered if we ,
as a community , have the right to sue SCOX and now MS $ for
emotional distress !!
After all have n't they intimidated
all of us as well as threatened us with possible law
suits ?
Have n't they spread FUD enough to cause
irreparable damage to the reputation of FOSS companies and
users alike ?
How much larger would the community be by
now without these constant threats and lawsuits ?
Here 's a wild idea .
Why not start a campaign to spread
truth , expose evil and spread the word to the rest of the
world about FOSS ?
Bumper stickers , T - shirts , signs .
The works .
A grass roots effort to enlighten the
un -knowing .
I still do n't see much advertisement out
there .
Except for a few commercials by IBM
regarding ' Linux Servers ' I 've NEVER seen advertisements
on television or in the local paper ( L.A. Times ) for FOSS .
Considering all those advertisements we see for Mac v PC's
( sic ) should n't there bee ads for Mac v Windows v FOSS ?
Or perhaps that should be Proprietary Silo v Freedom
Software ?
This gives me an idea .
Start my own business selling
promotional FOSS items with a share going to the FSF ..
Who said you can't make money selling Freedom ?
Probably said too much but it needs to be said .
" Give Me Freedom or get the hell out of the way "
P.S. Of course I would contact FOSS first to make sure I
am in compliance with the present / Future version of the
GPL ...

Something occurred to me while reading the comments ..
The Novell / MS deal has some points to it that may apply here .
The GPL specifically forbids distribution , if the distributor knowingly infringes copyrights , trademarks , or patents .
At the time of the deal , Novell stated that they did not know of any code in SuSE that infringed an MS patent .
Now MS has come out with a specific count of MS patents which they feel Linux infringes upon .
When the Novell / MS deal was first announced , Novell could hide behind a nebulous cloud of " vague unknown " generalized patent protection from MS prosecution .
Now MS has put a specific number to the " unknown " .
Now a few questions occur to me : Can Novell still hide behind a generalized statement ?
Is Novell legally obligated to obtain a list of these patents ?
Is Novell legally obligated to stop distribution of SuSE ?
Can any recipient of a " covenant " from MS ( through Novell ) demand the list of patent numbers from MS ?
Can Dell demand the list of patent numbers from MS ?
The way I see it , this puts Novell in a tight spot .
They cooked up this deal with MS , and now " generalities " have become more specific with this statement from MS .
They have a business relationship with MS , specificly relating to patents in SuSE ( GNU / Linux ) .
This statement from MS puts them in a very awkward position with their continued distribution of SuSE under the GPL .
If Novell does n't already have lawyers crawling all over this , they should be very soon .
I suspect the first sign that MS may actually have something tangible will be when Novell stops distributing SuSE .
Novell will be the canary to pay atention to .

I hope no one bothers , personally .
Let Microsoft sue if it wishes .
If there is one thing we 've learned from the SCO saga , it 's that FUD does n't kill you , so long as you know better than to give in to it .
Unfortunately , what they may do ( i.e. , they may not be as stupid as SCOG has been ) is sue someone who DOES NOT have deep pockets , so it would be very difficult for the victim (s ) to defend themself ( ves ) .
Like the RIAA , sue a bunch of relatively defenseless small fry and build up some legal precedents .
Or try , anyway .
It 's not at all clear to me , being NAL , that the " innocent " end - user should be liable when they get allegedly patent - violating stuff from someone else , but rather the actual violator .
That would force the predator at least a LITTLE bit higher up the food chain .

I wish someone like Eben Moglen would come out with a statement saying something
like " Microsoft software is found to violate 23,653 patents according to a
recent study . " ( the number is probably higher , but I was being
conservative )
Follow that up with a few stories about the likelihood of
distribution of all MS software being stopped , and how MS could never bring
itself into compliance given the huge amount of work involved .
Have Stallman and
some others make some speeches about how OSS has always respected other people 's
IP .
I would love to see that in print .
Surely the process ' that went into finding
the patents that Stallman was talking about could be applied to MS software ?

P.J. et al , I 'd like not to think so , but realistically I do n't think your
arguments are strong enough .
(1) It seems very weak to suggest that Microsoft 's distribution of SuSE Linux
vouchers constitutes distribution of SuSE GNU / Linux .
It is indirect , at
best -- essentially sub - contracting for someone else to distribute the product .
(2) Many of their patents will be defeated but it only takes one to succeed .
The surviving patents will be stronger than the 235 were originally .
(3) I do n't think the damage to Microsoft 's reputation will extend beyond those
who do n't already dislike Microsoft .
Did the anti-trust trial ?
Furthermore , I
think many of Microsoft 's business customers also feel strongly about " IP
rights " .
They will support Microsoft blindly on this .
And regular
consumers wo n't care ... as usual .
(4) Considering the stakes , I do n't think many ( if any ) judges would be willing
to up - root the whole basis of software patents .
If the argument of software is
mathematic algorithms comes up , the judge will take any excuse he can find
validate the legality of software patents .
Remember the DeCSS / 2600 case where
the judge finally accepted that DeCSS was speech but said it was a different
kind of speech and therefore not protected under the 1st amendment ?
Everyone wants the good guy to win , but we should n't be so naive to always
think that 's going to happen .
A lot of power and influence stands against us .
I would n't be surprised if congress even stepped in to enact legislation
protecting Microsoft and software patents .
Did n't they get off scott - free from
an absolutely damning anti-trust conviction ?

Or not .
Personally , I 'd love to see IBM , Google , Red Hat , and a few others file an action for declaratory judgment on the grounds that MS ' public statements , plus their stated demands for royalties from Linux users , constitute sufficient grounds for apprehension of lawsuit .
Of course , discovery would likely cover the licenses they 've already entered into and the terms thereof , although I 'm pretty sure we would n't see that thanks to presumptive confidentiality of the agreements .
There 's a rumor circulating ( and , no , I do n't even know the source ) that MS ' NDA for even opening negotiations is so strict that they do n't even allow outside counsel to be informed .
I still have a problem with that one , but IANAL and all that .

It is actually very simple why they will most likely never sue .
1 . No one to sue .
The copyright holders are spread through out the world and if
the sue a small company or anyone the FSF will jump to defend them .
2 . If they file , discovery will require opening up the MS source code to the
defense .
The defense will then in addition to tearing up their patents look at
all the other code that may exist that is " copied " from open source or
other locations for counter suites .
3 . No money in it .
Sue a small fry and you get noting but bad press even if you
win .
Sue big company , spend alot of time / money in court and get bad press to
boot .
Loose the case and potentially destroy MS patents as defense against
other companies patent claims .

After years of planning this , building up their patent portfolio , and then
making this last - ditch attempt at heading off FOSS , they have found exactly 68
patents which FOSS projects infringe on .
68 ?
Is that it ?
Even if it costs $ 1 million to overturn each of those , FOSS can be free from M $
for a mere $ 68 million .
That sounds like a pretty good deal to me .

increase animosity towards US trade policy .
It seems they are also likely to increase resistance to US sponsored trade

It seems to me that it will hurt Microsoft domestically .
In the law of unintended consequences department , it seems the Berne

1 ) If MS thought that it could win a law suit it would have picked a weak

3 ) Discovery ( as seen in SCO v. IBM and reported here ) would reveal MS's
repeated , intentional , persistent and ongoing violations of others ' patents .
4 ) Discovery would also reveal MS violations of FOSS licenses .
MS has
repeatedly been sued ( and settled to avoid disclosure of their malfeasance ) for
copyright / patent violation .
That is just the stuff easily identified without
access to the source .
With the army of developers that they have its inevitable
that some have cribbed FOSS get out of a tight spot ( with and without sanction ) .
MS knows that it 's vunerable and can't stand the scrutiny .
5 ) Since only the US allows fullfledged software patents any success will be
limited to the US market and to a lesser extent the EU .
This would put US firms
at a competative disadvantage and congress would be forced to limit or eliminate
software patents .
Other jurisdictions would definitively reject software
patents to curtail MS 's monopoly power .
Outcomes that MS wants to avoid at any
cost ; much less the loss of theoretical royalties on shaky patents .

They do n't think its fair to have to compete with Open Source .
It does n't
follow the same rules .
They blame open source for all hackers , virus writers ,
zombie managers and spammers .
They think it is fair and essential to cheat back
under the circumastances .
Lying about their opposition , filing dubious patents ,
embracing and extending , sponsoring bogus suits , retailer manipulation , sabotage
code , stringing out the DOJ and Europe , incomprehensible standards , lobbying and
political intimidation , all the dirty tricks .
They believe they are the chosen .
They are right .
They know what is best for
the world .
Their wealth is confirmation of their superiority .
All is fair
since maintaining their dominance is a good thing for them and the world .
They
do only good with their business and charities .
The spread of Red Hat and other Linux distributions has taken its toll .
It must
be killed .
If it hangs around on the server and more desktops , people will find
how secure , stable , and economical it is , to use open source and avoid Monopoly
products .
They can not compete fairly with an office suite that does almost as
much as their suite and far more than the average consumer will ever realize .
It is also free .
It is as if the workers of the wourld have risen up and made
propietary software obsolete .
They have eliminated concern for patents and
copyright .
They have eliminated the need for lawyers .
If allowed to run
rampant , businesses would require open source software , and hardware too !
It is
better , cheaper , and adaptable .
It is the only way any of the disenfranchised ,
or locked out , coder community could compete with the Monopoly .
FUD is all they have .
The patent threats today are lies , ... LInus has a job ,
Linux is dead .
They misconstrue their oponents in the finest political
tradition .
They have billions to spend to stay on top .
They have lawyers and
publicists all toeing the party line .
VISTA proves they are liars .
It requires
a heavy hardware upgrade for a marginal improvement inperformance .
Why bother
or why not try something else like Mac or Ubuntu , that catchy , insidious new
stuff .
It is new , marvellous , and cheap .
Not only does some of it replace
Monopoly product , but clever procurement officers use it to drive down Monopoly
prices .
This is a bad time to rely on software patents .
They are not in favor with the
Supreme Court .
This weapon is lethal no more .
The Supreme Court outlined how
the District Court Judges could grant summary judgments against obvious patents .
They also eased up on the obvious tests .
What 's more it is further weakened
when wielded by a Monopoly supposedly under a supervised settlement .
Opening a
new patent front in the FUD campaign will begin with a wave of obvious patents
being eliminated by the Judge .
Word is getting out that VISTA is bad and the
Monopoly relies on FUD and power .
Their innovation is devoted to lock - in and
lock - out , with bloat and complexity .
They must sense a weakness in their
entrenchment .
Although unappreciated by the consuming masses , Open Source
products like Ubuntu , OO and others are just too good to be permitted to thrive
at Monopoly expense .
Litigation is a very risky step for the Monopoly .
The DoJ may perk up in an
effort to show that they can function with Gonzalez sans deputies .
They have a
problem showing actual damages since open source software is free .
One pays
basically for support when corporations buy Red Hat .
Without damages , an
injunction is less likely .
They are more likely to face appeals and lose
patents every step of the way .
The patentability of software will also get a
good review .
There are some intelligent receptive justices amongst the
Supremes .
The Linusians would probably form a class action defense .
Imagine
IBM and Moglen involved .
The patent Office and system is so disfunctional .
The
Monopoly has argued against it itself since it is sued so often .
Their own
words wil be turned against them .
Plus if they start a patent war on Linux , IBM
could try to join their part of it into the SCO trial .
SCO and the Monopoly
telling Judge
Wells she does n't understand her own orders .
It will be a marvellous war .
The code does n't use the patent .
If it does , the
patent does not give notice .
The patent if it does give notice , is invalid .
It
is invalid because their is prior art .
It is also invalid because it is
obvious .
It is invalid because software is merely a business method or math ,
which can't be patented .
You can't patent something just because someone put it
on a computer .
Software is just language , talking to a computer .
It deserves
copyright protection only .

There are two groups of people .
Group one knows that Linux DOES violate lots of software patents .
They do not
know what patents exactly and they have no way of knowing .
It is simple .
It is
impossible to write ANY reasonable program nowdays that does not violate some
patents .
I you looked hard enough , even
10 REM MY FIRST PROGRAM
15 LET A$ =" HELLO WORLD "
20 PRINT A $
copied from the manual for the first " personal computer " I had ever
touched .
( Sinclair ZX Spectrum . )
The problem is , there is no way for developers to know that they are infringing .
And to do any reasonable research to establish if some obscure aspect of your
software does not infringe some of the waguely defined submarine patent is
impossible .
Group two does not know and does not care .
Period .
Come on , Microsoft .
Do you really want to start software patent war ?
There is
enough code written by MS programmers to infringe all software patents in
existence .

One of the biggest problems in the US patent system is the lack of transparency .
What the US patent system needs is some sunlight shed on what has become a rather murky and disreputable business .
Perhaps a modest reform would be to require patent holders to declare their interests in any proposed standards .
This could take the form of something like the following proposal : Nationally recognised standards bodies would publish official review draft copies of their proposed standards with a declaration that the standard is intended to be unencumbered by patents .
A patent holder would have a period of time ( 6 to 12 months ) from the draft being published to " declare an interest " ( say that it believes one of its patents may be incorporated in the standard ) .
The declared interest must be specific and detailed .
The standards body could challenge the patent ( on any of the usual grounds ) , or it may choose to simply excise the covered functionality from the standard .
The first level of challenge would be for the standards body to ask the patent office for an administrative ruling on whether the patent is valid and whether it covers the disputed function on the standard .
Patent office rulings could be appealed to the usual courts by either the patent holder or by any member of the standards committee .
Some appropriate rules would be needed here to prevent patent holders from simply automatically appealing every ruling against them ( standards members on the other hand are less likely to appeal a ruling which goes against them ) .
Once the final standard had been published ( after the waiting period has elapsed ) without a valid interest being declared , any implementation feature covered by the standard is considered to be non-infringing on any patent and no patent holder has the right to sue for infringement .
This would not affect rights to the patent when used in areas not covered by the standard .
If at the time of publishing there is still a question as to whether the patent covers anything in the standard , the standard could be published as being " in dispute " ( on the shelf , but not to be used ) .
When the issue is settled one way or the other , the standard could then be fully released ( found not to be encumbered ) or withdrawn ( found to be encumbered and sent back to committee ) .
Any standards ( including draft copies ) intended to be covered by this rule would have to be available to anyone at no charge ( preferably on a web site ) .
Existing standards or industry practices could be submitted as standards in this same manner to bring existing practices under the same rules .
This would mean that any software which incorporated unencumbered standards in its essential functions would not be subject to the sort of patent FUD and trolling we have seen lately .
What this proposal would do is to place the onus of monitoring for potential patent infringement where it belongs - on the patent holders .
Instead of a software developer having to plow through hundreds of thousands of vaguely worded patents to ensure he is not infringing on any of them , the patent holder need only monitor a much smaller number of standards .
Standards , unlike patents , must by their nature be clearly worded to be useful .
While not everything in software can be covered by standards , the essential functions which cannot be avoided could be .
The proposal is also quite equitable to patent holders .
Since standards which are intended to make use of this proposed rule must be available free of charge to anyone , a patent holder would not face any charges to obtain copies of them for review .
Since a patent holder is supposed to be an expert in their field of endeavour ( i.e. they come up with ideas which are not obvious to the average practitioner ) , it is reasonable to expect them to keep up with standards being published in their field .
If they are not aware of work being conducted in areas which the patent could cover and they lose their potential rights as a result , then they can't really be considered to have lost anything ( they were n't trying to do anything useful with it in that area anyway ) .
In general , there are many benefits to this proposal .
Society as a whole would benefit , as each software developer would no longer be expected to duplicate wasted effort looking at the same patents .
Instead , the patent holder would need to look at the standard just once .
It is much more equitable .
The burden of monitoring the patents would fall on those who expect to benefit from them .
Less money would be spend on legal disputes and on insurance against legal disputes .
Money spent on these things is a total loss to society .
The software industry would have greater incentive to document its practices so they may be incorporated into standards .
Official standards would be more readily available to everyone , instead of only to paying members of organizations ( as is the case for many standards ) .
Software developers could spend their time attracting users by developing good software instead of by employing good lawyers .
Patent holders would be encouraged to concentrate on patent quality instead of patent quantity .
The above may not satisfy those who wish to simply abolish software patents altogether where they current exist , but it is perhaps a good second best .
It is also something that could apply to any field which is covered by patents , not just software .

It s been reported in a lot of places , but I read on ArsTechnica that Microsoft is yelling something about patents and linux again .
Ballmer must be off his meds .
The last time Microsoft tried this strategy , members of the linux community told him to put up or shut up ,  and Microsoft shut up for a while .
Will play out the same way this time ?
It then gets into VERY interesting specifics about how this might play out in court , including laches and the Medimmune v. Genentech decision that would let copyright holders sue Microsoft for their statements before MS sues anyone , themselves .

How about the Government regulating Microsoft as a public utility and it's

It is a

Did n't MS and Apple already fight it out over whether the ' Look and Feel ' of an
interface can be patented ?
I thought MS won that suit and the courts ruled that
' Look and Feel ' can not be patented .
So , how can a GUI be patented now if a
lawsuit brought against MS by Apple says it can't ? [ Reply to This | # ]

Surely ... at some point if MS takes no action to protect " its " patents
it will become estopped from protecting them at all ?
So for the Linux distros out there that have been doing so for say 10 years and
MS has never made a move to prevent the use of its patented ideas in that distro
then surely MS have no access to " redress " ? [ Reply to This | # ]

IANAL ,
But as far as i know Microsft declariations implies the millions Linux users
could be liable for patent infringement .
These declartion causes big distress to Linux users which is agravated by
Microsoft refusal to specify the patents in question , which prevent us from
mitigating the liablities .
So i believe that Linux users could launch a class action lawsuit against
Microsoft and claim damages for caused distress .
BTW it could be good way to obtain a list of patents in questions .
An as far as
i understand EACH member of the class will have the right to examine the list .

In the letter , explain that free software does not wish to infringe on
* anyone 's* patents .
As such , call upon Microsoft to divulge which Microsoft
patents free software infringes , so we can clean up open source code .
If Microsoft refuses to divulge their patent data , they 'll have a huge uphill
climb in order to claim any damages .

I think what is going on here is that Microsoft is desperate to get more
companies to sign up for Novell type deals before GPL v3 goes live .
Maybe this
way they are hoping to prevent GPL3 from becoming mainstream , or else try to
portray it as an anti-business license .
Like : " See this new GPL3 thing is
hurting so many companies !
Does n't let them distribute open source because of
their deal with us !
This FSF is just a gang of commies ! " and so on .
I do n't think it will work , but still getting GPL v3 out the door as soon as
possible would be a very good thing .

I really want Microsoft to open this can of worms !
I am still extremely
disappointed in the lack of punishment the DOJ layed out in the monopoly trial
where Microsoft was found guilty .
This is the best and fastest way for the Government to re-open that case and
perhaps " fix " the monopoly !
Remember , that one of the biggest users of Linux is the Fedaral Government .
DoD , DoJ , IRS , NASA , etc.. etc.. etc ...
Sadly Microsoft realizes that those second 2 acronyms could / would really put a
hurting on them so will never follow up on anything .. it 's just FUD .

just found that M$ has a patent for - " consistently producing bug filled
software products " .
So , Linux developers beware - bugs in Linux would be
termed as patent infringement .
On a serious note - M$ ought to concentrate on delivering a " good "
product instead of indulging in bullying to sell an inferior product .
During
the last few weeks there have been numerous complaints from users about the M $
updates site freezing / hanging .
The very page that is supposed to deliver bug
fixes / patches to users is hanging up on them - not due to a virus or hack attack
- but plain buggy software .

I do n't know if anyone has mentioned this yet , but it my be time for the FOSS
community to start reviewing all Microsoft 's patents ( non-programmers anyway ) .
If someone set up a webpage it probably would n't be very hard to start attacking
their portfolio .
It could maybe even get some press and damage their share

Since this all started I 've been wanting to find out instead if we the community
ca n't simply sue for something like liable instead ?
Something along the lines
to make them prove it or shut up .
It seems to me that a declaratory judgment is not the direction we want to go .
I 'm no legal expert but my 5 minutes of research ( lol ) says that we have to
first violate the patent and then get the courts to throw it out .
Something
like this would mean we are acknowledging the accusations .
While everyone seems
to think that there may be some infringing patents , no one knows what patents we
are infringing .
The suspected ones ( like Fat32 ) do n't in all actuality have a
existing patent and therefor Linux is not infringing on it .
I 've been wanting to know what some people with more experience then I say about
this situation .
The comments made by Microsoft hurt FOSS on a ridicules claim
of patent infringements and MS needs to be called out on this one .
Win or
loose , they would still be forced to tell us where the infringements are in
Linux and we can then resolve the issue 's or look into a declaratory judgment
for the one 's with no workaround .
All I know that if Linux was my company and some other company just publicly
made a statement for the sole purpose of harming my company and not disclosing
the facts , you 'd better believe I 'd take legal action of some kind to make
them .

Nice title , so who is he ?
Miliband is Secretary of State for Environment , Food & Rural Affairs , a senior cabinet position in the Blair Government .
He became an MP for Labour in 2001 and was appointed to the cabinet in 2005 .
At just 41 he ’s regarded as young for his position and there has even been press speculation he might challenge Gordon Brown for leadership in the summer when Blair steps down .
On 5 March 2007 David Miliband MP delivered a lecture titled " The transition economy : a future beyond oil ? "
Full text available here .
The 18MB MP3 audio file is available here .
David Miliband MP
" I believe that energy security and climate change objectives mean the time is right to look at what it would mean for the UK to create over a period of 15 - 20 years a post - oil economy – a declaration less of ‘ oil independence ’ and more the end of oil dependence . "
The scientists say that we have 10 to 15 years for global carbon emissions to peak .
The economists say that over the same period North Sea oil production is due to decline significantly .
The international relations experts say that a world less dependent on oil would be good for global stability .
So my starting point is the twin challenges of climate change and energy security : an economy no longer dependent on oil would be good for both .
Interesting how he cites the economists rather than geologists or oil companies saying North Sea oil is in decline .
Could this be because North Sea decline is primarily an economic problem with exports and royalties being replaced with imports and trade deficit expansion ?
Core to the lecture is " climate change and energy security " , positioning them as two different reasons for developing " a transition economy " to reduce carbon emissions and increase the productivity with which natural resources are used .
His thinking for climate change is clear , citing the IPCC and the Stern Report .
Energy security is a concern as :
... many of our coal and nuclear power stations are coming to an end .
For years , the UK has been self - sufficient in gas and oil , thanks to North Sea Oil production .
In future , we will increasingly depend on oil and gas imports from Russia , Central Asia , the Middle East and Africa .
We could be importing as much as 90 % of our gas by 2020 compared with around 10 % now .
So there are plainly dangers of energy insecurity .
That is the clearest description of the UK ’s energy predicament I ’ve heard from a minister yet .
Before addressing common solutions ( demand reduction , decarbonisation and decentralisation ) he recognises not all solutions are common to both problems .
For example coal to liquids is mentioned as increasing carbon emissions .
This is interesting as it implies the problem is not simply " energy security " but liquid fuel security .
My impression , reading between the lines is that this is n’t really an energy security and climate change lecture but rather a peak oil and climate change lecture – constrained by the fact he must n’t mention the P - word !
I ’ll come back to this .
Reducing electricity demand is highlighted before increasing supply , the aim of 20 % supply from renewables by 2020 is reiterated , as is the fear that :
Unless we replace our existing nuclear power stations , we will have to increase our reliance on coal and gas , which would increase our emissions .
I would argue that it is unrealistic to suggest existing nuclear can be replaced before the bulk of decommission so it ’s not an option to avoid increased reliance on coal and gas .
Miliband suggests carbon capture and storage is the most critical technology for future electricity supply .
Transport is the largest section of the lecture , strange perhaps as it is only responsible for 23 % of UK carbon emissions compared with 31 % for electricity and runs predominantly on oil where there exists a robust global market compared with electricity which faces coal and nuclear decommissions and indigenous gas depletion for which there is n’t a robust market .
Again , is this a peak oil lecture in all but name ?
The plan for aviation is to bring it " ... into the European Union Emissions Trading scheme at the earliest opportunity .
By putting air travel within a cap and trade scheme that has teeth , we will ensure that overall emissions are driven down , within the EU or more widely across the world . "
Improved car efficiency , biofuels and hybrids are predictably mentioned for road transport but also fully electric and hydrogen cars are described as realistic options in the long term along with this bizarre factoid :
Research suggests that if electric vehicles replaced existing cars , we would need an additional 12 per cent of electricity supply .
I need to check that .
According to DUKES 3.4 the UK uses 38,287 thousand tonnes of oil in road transport ( 2005 ) and Miliband tells us car are responsible for 60 % of road transport emissions so must use some 23 million tonnes .
At 45 megajoules per kg , 23 million tonnes of oil represents 10 joules or 288TWh .
This is the primary energy , internal combustion engines are some three times less efficient than electric motors so to make sure we ’re not comparing apples with oranges the figure should be reduced to 96TWh .
This compares with a total electricity supply of 409TWh ( DUKES 5.2 ) and so represents 23 % more electricity .
To get to Miliband 's 12 % we have to assume electric cars actually use less energy to deliver the same energy service ( the transportation ) .
This is actually quite feasible as the electric drive train is more efficient and the vehicle mass can be significantly reduced .
I ’m genuinely surprised that the UK's existing car fleet could be replaced with electric vehicles ( if they existed ) for just 12 % increase in existing generation .
Bearing in mind charging could be scheduled for off peak times ( or when the wind blows or the tide flows ) , required generation infrastructure would be less .
It ’s an interesting aside – however given the challenges the UK faces in electricity generation – a purely academic one for the time being .
Tesla Motors
Miliband : " ... the Lotus built Tesla has a top speed of over 130 Mph , a battery range of up to 250 miles , and has a lifetime of at least 100,000 miles . "
Back to the lecture and Miliband considers Sweden 's Commission on Oil Independence .
The primary rationale for the Commission on Oil Independence was to address climate change .
For the avoidance of doubt , it was not about protectionism or about a fear that oil will ‘ run out ’ .
But the commission were also driven by a concern about the impact of oil prices on Sweden ’s economic growth and employment , by the impact of oil on peace and security across the world , and a desire to gain a first mover advantage in new environmental markets .
This is curious , why does Miliband feel the need for the " avoidance of doubt " sentence ?
I spoke to Kjell Aleklett ( Swedish physics professor and president of ASPO ) about this plan last year , he said it was a real victory and ASPO had been key in its inception .
It is peak oil inspired , the negative impact of price on the Swedish economy being a nod to future scarcity and high prices .
Maybe Miliband is semantically right , it 's not , it 's about a fear of peak oil !
Miliband is to be commended however , this lecture was more radical than I ’ve heard any minister make .
I believe it is peak oil inspired even though he can't bring himself to say the words and whilst he predictably looks towards ( largely inappropriate ) technology to provided answers , demand reduction is stated as the number one transformation our energy system needs :
First , demand reduction - radically reducing our energy needs through much greater energy efficiency .
That 's quite a statement for an aspirational young minister to make .
Next week Miliband will announce the details of the Climate Change Bill which should establish in law the goal and timetable for becoming a low - carbon economy .
It will be interesting to see how the currently planned airport expansion and forecast 3 - fold increase in aviation is compatible with this legislation .

Attila conceived himself to have a divine claim to the dominion of the earth : — the Spaniards subdued the Indians under plea of converting them to Christianity ; hanging thirteen refractory ones in honour of Jesus Christ and his apostles : and we English justify our colonial aggressions by saying that the Creator intends the Anglo - Saxon race to people the world !
An insatiate lust of conquest transmutes manslaying into a virtue ; and , amongst more races than one , implacable revenge has made assassination a duty .
A clever theft was praiseworthy amongst the Spartans ; and it is equally so amongst Christians , provided it be on a sufficiently large scale .
Piracy was heroism with Jason and his followers ; was so also with the Norsemen ; is so still with the Malays ; and there is never wanting some golden fleece for a pretext .
Amongst money - hunting people a man is commended in proportion to the number of hours he spends in business ; in our day the rage for accumulation has apotheosized work ; and even the miser is not without a code of morals by which to defend his parsimony .
The ruling classes argue themselves into the belief that property should be represented rather than person — that the landed interest should preponderate .
The pauper is thoroughly persuaded that he has a right to relief .
The monks held printing to be an invention of the devil ; and some of our modern sectaries regard their refractory brethren as under demoniacal possession .
To the clergy nothing is more obvious than that a state - church is just , and essential to the maintenance of religion .

And so on throughout society .

Education has for its object the formation of character .
To curb restive propensities , to awaken dormant sentiments , to strengthen the perceptions , and cultivate the tastes , to encourage this feeling and repress that , so as finally to develop the child into a man of well proportioned and harmonious nature — this is alike the aim of parent and teacher .

As a corollary to the proposition that all institutions must be subordinated to the law of equal freedom , we cannot choose but admit the right of the citizen to adopt a condition of voluntary outlawry .
If every man has freedom to do all that he wills , provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man , then he is free to drop connection with the state — to relinquish its protection , and to refuse paying towards its support .
It is self - evident that in so behaving he in no way trenches upon the liberty of others ; for his position is a passive one ; and whilst passive he cannot become an aggressor .
It is equally selfevident that he cannot be compelled to continue one of a political corporation , without a breach of the moral law , seeing that citizenship involves payment of taxes ; and the taking away of a man ’s property against his will , is an infringement of his rights .
Government being simply an agent employed in common by a number of individuals to secure to them certain advantages , the very nature of the connection implies that it is for each to say whether he will employ such an agent or not .
If any one of them determines to ignore this mutual - safety confederation , nothing can be said except that he loses all claim to its good offices , and exposes himself to the danger of maltreatment — a thing he is quite at liberty to do if he likes .
He can not be coerced into political combination without a breach of the law of equal freedom ; he can withdraw from it without committing any such breach ; and he has therefore a right so to withdraw .

“ No human laws are of any validity if contrary to the law of nature ; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority mediately or immediately from this original . ”
Thus writes Blackstone , to whom let all honour be given for having so far outseen the ideas of his time ; and , indeed , we may say of our time .
A good antidote , this , for those political superstitions which so widely prevail .
A good check upon that sentiment of power - worship which still misleads us by magnifying the prerogatives of constitutional governments as it once did those of monarchs .
Let men learn that a legislature is not “ our God upon earth , ” though , by the authority they ascribe to it , and the things they expect from it , they would seem to think it is .
Let them learn rather that it is an institution serving a purely temporary purpose , whose power , when not stolen , is at the best borrowed .

The Development Hypothesis ( 1852 ) [ edit ]
The blindness of those who think it absurd to suppose that complex organic forms may have arisen by successive modifications out of simple ones becomes astonishing when we remember that complex organic forms are daily being thus produced .
A tree differs from a seed immeasurably in every respect ...
Those who cavalierly reject the Theory of Evolution , as not adequately supported by facts , seem quite to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all .
Like the majority of men who are born to a given belief , they demand the most rigorous proof of any adverse belief , but assume that their own needs none .
Well , which is the most rational theory about these ten millions of species ?
Is it most likely that there have been ten millions of special creations ?
or is it most likely that , by continual modifications due to change of circumstances , ten millions of varieties have been produced , as varieties are being produced still ?
Should the believers in special creations consider it unfair thus to call upon them to describe how special creations take place , I reply that this is far less than they demand from the supporters of the Development Hypothesis .
They are merely asked to point out a conceivable mode .
On the other hand , they ask , not simply for a conceivable mode , but for the actual mode .
The supporters of the Development Hypothesis ... can show that any existing species — animal or vegetable — when placed under conditions different from its previous ones , immediately begins to undergo certain changes fitting it for the new conditions .
They can show that in successive generations these changes continue ; until , ultimately , the new conditions become the natural ones .
They can show that in cultivated plants , in domesticated animals , and in the several races of men , such alterations have taken place .
They can show that the degrees of difference so produced are often , as in dogs , greater than those on which distinctions of species are in other cases founded .
Throughout all organic nature there is at work a modifying influence of the kind ... as the cause , these specific differences : an influence which , though slow in its action , does , in time , if the circumstances demand it , produce marked changes — an influence , which to all appearance , would produce in the millions of years , and under the great varieties of condition which geological records imply , any amount of change .
That by any series of changes a protozoon should ever become a mammal , seems to those who are not familiar with zoology , and who have not seen how clear becomes the relationship between the simplest and the most complex forms when intermediate forms are examined , a very grotesque notion .
Habitually , looking at things rather in their statical aspect than in their dynamical aspect , they never realize the fact that , by small increments of modification , any amount of modification may in time be generated .
The blindness of those who think it absurd to suppose that complex organic forms may have arisen by successive modifications out of simple ones becomes astonishing when we remember that complex organic forms are daily being thus produced .
A tree differs from a seed immeasurably in every respect ...
Yet is the one changed in the course of a few years into the other : changed so gradually , that at no moment can it be said —
Now the seed ceases to be , and the tree exists .
That the uneducated and the ill - educated should think the hypothesis that all races of beings , man inclusive , may in process of time have been evolved from the simplest monad , a ludicrous one , is not to be wondered at .
But for the physiologist , who knows that every individual being is so evolved — who knows , further , that in their earliest condition the germs of all plants and animals whatever are so similar , " that there is no appreciable distinction amongst them , which would enable it to be determined whether a particular molecule is the germ of a Conferva or of an Oak , of a Zoophyte or of a Man " ; — for him to make a difficulty of the matter is inexcusable .
Spencer here references William Benjamin Carpenter , Principles of Comparative Physiology see p. 473

Surely if a single cell may , when subjected to certain influences , become a man in the space of twenty years ; there is nothing absurd in the hypothesis that under certain other influences , a cell may , in the course of millions of years , give origin to the human race .
We have , indeed , in the part taken by many scientific men in this controversy of " Law versus Miracle , " a good illustration of the tenacious vitality of superstitions .
Ask one of our leading geologists or physiologists whether he believes in the Mosaic account of the creation , and he will take the question as next to an insult .
Either he rejects the narrative entirely , or understands it in some vague non-natural sense .
... Whence ... this notion of " special creations " ...
Why , after rejecting all the rest of the story , he should strenuously defend this last remnant of it , as though he had received it on valid authority , he would be puzzled to say .
The Philosophy of Style ( 1852 ) [ edit ]
Poetry , regarded as a vehicle of thought , is especially impressive partly because it obeys all the laws of effective speech , and partly because in so doing it imitates the natural utterances of excitement .
There can be little question that good composition is far less dependent upon acquaintance with its laws , than upon practice and natural aptitude .
A clear head , a quick imagination , and a sensitive ear , will go far towards making all rhetorical precepts needless .

A clear head , a quick imagination , and a sensitive ear , will go far towards making all rhetorical precepts needless .

Education : Intellectual , Moral , and Physical ( 1861 ) [ edit ]
The education of the child must accord both in mode and arrangement with the education of mankind , considered historically .
In other words , the genesis of knowledge in the individual , must follow the same course as the genesis of knowledge in the race .
In strictness , this principle may be considered as already expressed by implication ; since both being processes of evolution , must conform to those same general laws of evolution ... and must therefore agree with each other .
Nevertheless this particular parallelism is of value for the specific guidance it affords .
To M. Comte we believe society owes the enunciation of it ; and we may accept this item of his philosophy without at all committing ourselves to the rest .
If there be an order in which the human race has mastered its various kinds of knowledge , there will arise in every child an aptitude to acquire these kinds of knowledge in the same order .
So that even were the order intrinsically indifferent , it would facilitate education to lead the individual mind through the steps traversed by the general mind .
But the order is not intrinsically indifferent ; and hence the fundamental reason why education should be a repetition of civilization in little .
It is provable both that the historical sequence was , in its main outlines , a necessary one ; and that the causes which determined it apply to the child as to the race .
... as the mind of humanity placed in the midst of phenomena and striving to comprehend them has , after endless comparisons , speculations , experiments , and theories , reached its present knowledge of each subject by a specific route ; it may rationally be inferred that the relationship between mind and phenomena is such as to prevent this knowledge from being reached by any other route ; and that as each child 's mind stands in this same relationship to phenomena , they can be accessible to it only through the same route .
Hence in deciding upon the right method of education , an inquiry into the method of civilization will help to guide us .

It can not but happen that those individuals whose functions are most out of equilibrium with the modified aggregate of external forces , will be those to die ; and that those will survive whose functions happen to be most nearly in equilibrium with the modified aggregate of external forces .
But this survival of the fittest , implies multiplication of the fittest .
Out of the fittest thus multiplied , there will , as before , be an overthrowing of the moving equilibrium wherever it presents the least opposing force to the new incident force .

The Coming Slavery [ edit ]
" The Coming Slavery " ; also published in The Contemporary Review ( April 1884 ) , p. 474
Influences of various kinds conspire to increase corporate action and decrease individual action .
And the change is being on all sides aided by schemers , each of whom thinks only of his pet plan and not at all of the general reorganization which his plan , joined with others such , are working out .
It is said that the French Revolution devoured its own children .
Here , an analogous catastrophe seems not unlikely .
The numerous socialistic changes made by Act of Parliament , joined with the numerous others presently to be made , will by - and - by be all merged in State - socialism — swallowed in the vast wave which they have little by little raised .
" But why is this change described as ' the coming slavery ' ? , " is a question which many will still ask .
The reply is simple .
All socialism involves slavery .
What is essential to the idea of a slave ?
We primarily think of him as one who is owned by another .
To be more than nominal , however , the ownership must be shown by control of the slave 's actions — a control which is habitually for the benefit of the controller .
That which fundamentally distinguishes the slave is that he labours under coercion to satisfy another 's desires .
The relation admits of sundry gradations .
Remembering that originally the slave is a prisoner whose life is at the mercy of his captor , it suffices here to note that there is a harsh form of slavery in which , treated as an animal , he has to expend his entire effort for his owner 's advantage .
Under a system less harsh , though occupied chiefly in working for his owner , he is allowed a short time in which to work for himself , and some ground on which to grow extra food .
A further amelioration gives him power to sell the produce of his plot and keep the proceeds .
Then we come to the still more moderated form which commonly arises where , having been a free man working on his own land , conquest turns him into what we distinguish as a serf ; and he has to give to his owner each year a fixed amount of labour or produce , or both : retaining the rest himself .
Finally , in some cases , as in Russia before serfdom was abolished , he is allowed to leave his owner 's estate and work or trade for himself elsewhere , under the condition that he shall pay an annual sum .
What is it which , in these cases , leads us to qualify our conception of the slavery as more or less severe ?
Evidently the greater or smaller extent to which effort is compulsorily expended for the benefit of another instead of for self - benefit .
If all the slave 's labour is for his owner the slavery is heavy , and if but little it is light .
Take now a further step .
Suppose an owner dies , and his estate with its slaves comes into the hands of trustees ; or suppose the estate and everything on it to be bought by a company ; is the condition of the slave any the better if the amount of his compulsory labour remains the same ?
Suppose that for a company we substitute the community ; does it make any difference to the slave if the time he has to work for others is as great , and the time left for himself is as small , as before ?
The essential question is — How much is he compelled to labour for other benefit than his own , and how much can he labour for his own benefit ?
The degree of his slavery varies according to the ratio between that which he is forced to yield up and that which he is allowed to retain ; and it matters not whether his master is a single person or a society .
If , without option , he has to labour for the society , and receives from the general stock such portion as the society awards him , he becomes a slave to the society .
The Sins of Our Legislators [ edit ]
Be it or be it not true that Man is shapen in iniquity and conceived in sin , it is unquestionably true that Government is begotten of aggression , and by aggression .
In small undeveloped societies where for ages complete peace has continued , there exists nothing like what we call Government : no coercive agency , but mere honorary headship , if any headship at all .
In these exceptional communities , unaggressive and from special causes unaggressed upon , there is so little deviation from the virtues of truthfulness , honesty , justice , and generosity , that nothing beyond an occasional expression of public opinion by informally - assembled elders is needful .
Conversely , we find proofs that , at first recognized but temporarily during leadership in war , the authority of a chief is permanently established by continuity of war ; and grows strong where successful aggression ends in subjection of neighboring tribes .
And thence onwards , examples furnished by all races put beyond doubt the truth , that the coercive power of the chief , developing into king , and king of kings ( a frequent title in the ancient East ) , becomes great in proportion as conquest becomes habitual and the union of subdued nations extensive .
Comparisons disclose a further truth which should be ever present to us — the truth that the aggressiveness of the ruling power inside a society increases with its aggressiveness outside the society .
As , to make an efficient army , the soldiers in their several grades must be subordinate to the commander ; so , to make an efficient fighting community , must the citizens be subordinate to the ruling power .
They must furnish recruits to the extent demanded , and yield up whatever property is required .
An obvious implication is that the ethics of Government , originally identical with the ethics of war , must long remain akin to them ; and can diverge from them only as warlike activities and preparations become less .

He who carries self - regard far enough to keep himself in good health and high spirits , in the first place thereby becomes an immediate source of happiness to those around , and in the second place maintains the ability to increase their happiness by altruistic actions .
But one whose bodily vigour and mental health are undermined by self - sacrifice carried too far , in the first place becomes to those around a cause of depression , and in the second place renders himself incapable , or less capable , of actively furthering their welfare .
In estimating conduct we must remember that there are those who by their joyousness beget joy in others , and that there are those who by their melancholy cast a gloom on every circle they enter .

There is a principle which is a bar against all information , which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance — that principle is contempt prior to investigation .
Commonly attributed to Spencer , information provided in The Quote Verifier : Who Said What , Where , and When ( 2006 ) by Ralph Keyes and The Survival of a Fitting Quotation .
( 2005 ) by Michael StGeorge , indicates the attribution may have originated with the book [ w: The_Big_Book_( Alcoholics_Anonymous ) |

It was used exactly as written above in the personal stories section of the first edition in 1939 and in ' Appendix II : Spiritual Experience ' of all subsequent editions .
" Contempt prior to examination " was a phrase used by William Paley , the 18th - century English Christian apologist .
In A View of the Evidences of Christianity ( 1794 ) , he wrote :
The infidelity of the Gentile world , and that more especially of men of rank and learning in it , is resolved into a principle which , in my judgment , will account for the inefficacy of any argument , or any evidence whatever , viz .
contempt prior to examination .
Paley 's characterization of non-believers was later modified and used by other religious authors who uniformly attributed their words to Paley .
In Anglo - Israel or , The British Nation : The lost Tribes of Israel ( 1879 ) , Rev. William H. Poole may have been the first to render the quotation in its more familiar and enduring form :
There is a principle which is a bar against all information , which is proof against all argument , and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance .
This principle is , contempt prior to examination .
Various authors following Rev. Poole would offer new iterations of the quotation into the early decades of the 20th century .
Most of these credited William Paley , but by the early 1930s the first obscure publications to falsely attribute this quote to Spencer emerged .
Its usage for decades since as a maxim in Alcoholics Anonymous and the twelve - step recovery community has popularized its erroneous association with Herbert Spencer .
Quotes about Spencer [ edit ]
Spencer argued in a very articulate way for the communality of these processes of self - organization , and used his ideas to make a theory of sociology .
However , he was not able to put these ideas into mathematical form or argue them from first principles .
And no one else has , either — doing so is perhaps the central problem in the study of complex systems .
J. Doyne Farmer , The Third Culture : Beyond the Scientific Revolution ed. John Brockman ( 1995 )
One of the factors that caused Spencer 's ideas to lose popularity was social Darwinism ...
Social evolution is different from biological evolution : it 's faster , it 's Lamarckian , and it makes even heavier use of altruism and cooperation than biological evolution does .
None of this was well understood at the time .

Spencer had a photo of Marian ( George Eliot ) in his bedroom until the day he died .
The sisters who kept house for him in the 1890s used to tease him about it .
" What a long nose she had !
She must have been very difficult to kiss , Mr Spencer ! "
" Yes indeed !
he brightly acquiesced , to our intense delight at the apparent admission .
He laughingly protested he was speaking theoretically ; but would Herbert Spencer , the philosopher , have generalised from an a priori reasoning ? "

Humour Political Attention Deficit Disorder By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published June 25 , 2007
According to a report to be released , the Council on Science and Public Health of the American Medical Association has recommended that a chronic and widespread affliction of Americans be officially declared a psychiatric disorder .
It has been named Political Attention Deficit Disorder ( PADD ) .
It is recommended that the disorder be included in the next revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric Association .
The current manual was published in 1994 ; the next edition is to be completed in 2012 .
The benefit to people of an official classification is coverage by health insurance .
" The symptoms of PADD are all around us and treating it professionally can do more for our country than any election , " said Dr. Mable Wank in the report 's introduction .
She is chairperson of the Council and a professor at UCLA .
Here are the Council 's main findings on PADD :
Nearly 80 percent of adult American citizens are unable to pay sustained attention to issues and problems associated with their government .
They are unable to accept their responsibility as citizens , including their obligation to vote , read in - depth articles and books on political issues , become active members of politically oriented groups , and initiate discussions on current events with friends and family .
" The decades - old decline in voter turnout is a direct result of a national epidemic of PADD , " said the report .
The chief cause of PADD is the desire to avoid the very real pain of cognitive dissonance , the difference between what Americans want to believe about the greatness of their country and the disturbing reality that their government and country are in terrible shape , which is a constant reminder when there is normal , healthy political attention .
Such pain suppression , however , is counterproductive and was found through careful studies at several universities , including the Harvard Medical College , to correlate with depression and anxiety disorders , as well as a heightened level of cynicism and despair .
According to the report , many suicides and possibly many criminal acts result from PADD .
Another consequence of PADD is that people devote more of their time , energy and money to pleasure - seeking distractions .
PADD is correlated with profound statistical significance to clinical symptoms such as obesity , alcoholism , drug addiction , video game addiction , Internet addiction , sexual promiscuity , excessive shopping , gambling addiction , and other harmful behaviors .
The report profiles a person severely afflicted by PADD .
The psychiatrists unanimously concluded that George W. Bush is a PADD victim .
Symptoms include no desire to pursue major and contentious policy issues through in - depth reading , discussion and analysis ; a clear dependence on others for policy decisions , particularly Vice President Dick Cheney ; an inability to maintain sustained focus on diverse policy issues simultaneously ; and an inability to articulate policy .
The widespread public perception that Bush is unintelligent , uninformed and dogmatic stems from his PADD , concluded the Council .
" He needs immediate , emergency therapy for his PADD .
That might help get us out of Iraq , " said Dr. Wank .
Reached by phone , Dr. Aaron Gestaltstein , a Council member and psychiatrist with the Michigan Institute for the Study of Individual and Societal Health , said the AMA proposal will help raise awareness and called it " the right thing to do if the United States is ever to regain effective government and equitable public policies . "
" Sick Americans deserve compassionate treatment if our country is to survive – PADD is no joke , " he added .
" I saw a college - educated man last month who was so depressed about the Bush Administration – yet he could no longer read newspapers , watch cable news shows or visit news and commentary websites .
He was spending virtually all of his non-work time visiting pornography websites and eating at Chinese buffets , " Gestaltstein said .
" He is a terrible mess and swears he will never vote again . "

NOTICE AND DEMAND
TO CEASE AND DESIST
TO : Mr. Stephen R. Monier
c /o Office of the U.S. Marshal
Warren B. Rudman U.S. Courthouse
55 Pleasant Street , Suite 207
Concord 03301
NEW HAMPSHIRE , USA
FROM : Paul Andrew Mitchell , B.A. , M.S .
Private Attorney General , 18 U.S.C. 1964 ( a ) , Rotella v. Wood
DATE : June 15 , 2007 A.D .
SUBJECT : Mr. Ed and Mrs. Elaine Brown
Greetings Mr. Monier :
This is to inform you formally and officially that my office legally represents the United States ex rel. in Tenth Circuit appeal #07-2017 .
In that case , extensive verified evidence has already been admitted into that Court ’s record , proving conclusively that there is no Statute at Large creating a specific liability for income taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code ( “ IRC ” ) .
The alleged “ liability ” was fabricated by the Internal Revenue Service , but there is no corresponding Act of Congress creating that specific liability for any income taxes imposed by IRC subtitle A .
Accordingly , even if the IRS were a de jure service , bureau , office or other subdivision of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ( which they are NOT ) , they would still not have any authority to create a tax liability by means of regulations published in the Federal Register .
See 31 U.S.C. 333 ; Commissioner v. Acker , 361 U.S. 87 ( 1959 ) .
Moreover , you are hereby served with formal NOTICE that the constitutionality of IRC subtitle A , the federal Jury Selection and Service Act and the Act of June 25 , 1948 , has now been properly and formally challenged in that Tenth Circuit Appeal .
In the first instance , it is now the position of the United States ex rel. that the Jury Selection and Service Act is un constitutional because it expressly discriminates against State Citizens by requiring that all jury candidates be federal citizens .
The U.S. Supreme Court has already held that such “ class discrimination ” in jury selection is unconstitutional .
There are two ( 2 ) classes of citizens in America .
Therefore , the Browns were never “ indicted ” by a lawfully convened federal grand jury , and they were never “ convicted ” by a lawfully convened federal trial jury .
Both panels of federal citizens were not lawfully convened federal juries , in the first instance .
My office has not yet had an opportunity to review any of the court pleadings filed in the Browns ’ case .
Nevertheless , our 17 years of experience in State and federal litigation inform us that the U.S. Department of Justice routinely institutes criminal proceedings on behalf of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .
However , the latter entity incorporated twice in Delaware , and both of those foreign corporations have now been revoked by the Delaware Secretary of State .
To make matters much worse , the long - standing rule in all federal litigation is that statutes conferring original jurisdiction on Federal District Courts must be strictly construed .
The Article IV United States District Court has no criminal jurisdiction whatsoever .
The general grant of criminal jurisdiction at 18 U.S.C. 3231 confers original jurisdiction upon the Article III District Courts of the United States , not on the Article IV United States District Courts .
We have enclosed a few key documents to substantiate every statement above , and full details are readily available from supporting links and related resources in the Supreme Law Library on the Internet here :
http://www.supremelaw.org/cc/williamson2/appeal/
DEMAND TO CEASE AND DESIST
Accordingly , formal demand is hereby made of you and all of your associates , accomplices and accessories of whatever description , to cease and desist immediately from any further attempts to apprehend the Browns or to trespass upon their fundamental Rights or private property in any manner whatsoever .
NOTICE OF INTENT
If you willfully violate this lawful NOTICE AND DEMAND TO CEASE AND DESIST , this is our formal NOTICE to you of our intent to lodge a VERIFIED CRIMINAL COMPLAINT , ON INFORMATION specifically naming you as a principal in a conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activities in connection with the Browns and in connection with any other attempts by your office to enforce a non-existent liability for IRC subtitle A “ income taxes ” , in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962 .
Notice to agents is notice to principals .
Notice to principals is notice to agents .
Thank you for your immediate cooperation .
Sincerely yours ,
/s/ Paul Andrew Mitchell

Ever wondered where all those nukes are stored ?
A new review published in the November / December issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists shows that the United States stores its nearly 10,000 nuclear warheads at 18 locations in 12 states and six European countries .
The article ’s authors – Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists and Robert S. Norris of the Natural Resources Defense Council – identified the likely locations by piecing together information from years of monitoring declassified documents , officials statements , news reports , leaks , conversations with current and former officials , and commercial high - resolution satellite photos .
The highest concentration of nuclear warheads is at the Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific in Bangor , Washington , which is home to more than 2,300 warheads – probably the most nuclear weapons at any one site in the world .
At any given moment , nearly half of these warheads are on board ballistic - missile submarines in the Pacific Ocean .
Approximately 1,700 warheads are deployed on Ohio- class ballistic missile submarines operating in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans , and about 400 warheads are at eight bases in six European countries – Belgium , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Turkey and Great Britain ( for more information on U.S. warheads in Europe , go to http://www.nukestrat.com/us/afn/nato.htm).
The United States is the only nuclear weapon state that deploys nuclear weapons in foreign countries .
Consolidation of U.S. nuclear storage sites has slowed considerably over the past decade compared to the period between 1992 and 1997 , when the Pentagon withdrew nuclear weapons from 10 states and numerous European bases .
Over the past decade , the United States removed nuclear weapons from three states – California , Virginia and South Dakota , and from one European country – Greece .
The overview finds that more than two - thirds of all U.S. nuclear warheads are still stored at bases for operational ballistic missiles and bombers , even through the Cold War ended more than 16 years ago .
More than 2,000 of those warheads are on high alert , ready to launch on short notice .
Only about 28 percent of U.S. warheads have been moved to separate storage facilities .
The largest of these , an underground vault at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque , New Mexico , stores more than 1,900 warheads .
The 10 U.S. sites that currently host nuclear weapons are : the Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific , Bangor , Washington ; Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada ; Warren Air Force Base , Wyoming ; Kirtland Air Force Base , New Mexico ; Malmstrom Air Force Base , Montana ; Minot Air Force Base , North Dakota ; Pantex Plant , Texas ; Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana ; Whiteman Air Force Base , Missouri ; and the Strategic Weapons Facility Atlantic , Kings Bay , Georgia .
( See map . )
Full - size map available here .
Full article available from Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists here .
Go on a Nuclear Google Trip
Based on the information in the Bulletin article , FAS and NRDC have created a virtual satellite image tour of the 18 nuclear weapons storage facilities in the United States and Europe .
To take the tour you need to have GoogleEarth installed on your computer .
( GoogleEarth is available for free here . )
Once you ’re set up , click here or on the link below the Google map below to begin .
When GoogleEarth has finished loading , check the “ Where the Bombs are , 2006 ” box in the “ Places ” window to the left to activate the placemarks , click once on a placemark to get an overview of the nuclear weapons stored at the base , and click twice to zoom in on the facility .
The U.S. government refuses to disclose where it stores nuclear weapons , but the researchers emphasize that all the locations have been known for years to house nuclear weapons .
Safety of nuclear weapons is determined not by knowledge of their location but by the military ’s physical protection of the facilities and that the weapons cannot be detonated by unauthorized personnel .
Background :
Where the Bombs are , 2006 | Status of World Nuclear Forces
The latest Rejuvenation Research is available online , and microglia are the order of the day , it seems .
Microglia are a component of the immune system , scavenging debris and defending the central nervous system .
What is their role in the degenerations of aging , and what is there to be done about it ?
Evidence That Aging And Amyloid Promote Microglial Cell Senescence
Advanced age and presence of intracerebral amyloid deposits are known to be major risk factors for development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , and both have been associated with microglial activation .
However , the specific role of activated microglia in AD pathogenesis remains unresolved .
Here we report that microglial cells exhibit significant telomere shortening and reduction of telomerase activity with normal aging in rats , and that in humans there is a tendency toward telomere shortening with presence of dementia .
Human brains containing high amyloid loads demonstrate a significantly higher degree of microglial dystrophy than nondemented , amyloid - free control subjects .
Collectively , these findings show that microglial cell senescence associated with telomere shortening and normal aging is exacerbated by the presence of amyloid .
They suggest that degeneration of microglia is a factor in the pathogenesis of AD .
Cellular Therapy Using Microglial Cells
Recent insights into the function and dysfunction of microglia may inform future therapies to combat neurodegeneration .
We hypothesise how different aspects of microglial activity including migration , activation , oxidative response , phagocytosis , proteolysis , and replenishment could be targeted by novel therapeutic approaches .
A combined approach is suggested , encompassing opsonization and anti-inflamatory strategies in conjunction with an engineering of microglial precursors .
Xenoproteases for bioremediation could be used to enhance intracellular and extracellular proteolytic capacity .
The capacity of microglial precursors to cross the blood - brain barrier and to home in on sites of neural damage and inflammation might prove to be particularly useful for future therapeutic strategies .
One of the names attached to this second paper is John Schloendorn , who works on bioremediation research funded by donations to the Methuselah Foundation .
" Xenoproteases for bioremediation could be used to enhance intracellular and extracellular proteolytic capacity " means " let 's adopt some useful biochemicals from bacteria that can help microglia clean up cellular debris by degrading harmful metabolic byproducts . "
Our metabolism generates damaging chemicals as a side - effect of its operation .
When these build up with age , they damage the workings of our cells - and thus damage the workings of our bodies .
So why not try to help the body out by removing the source of damage ?
Given that many types of bacteria consume human remains - and also consume the damaging biochemical junk that builds up in and between our cells - it stands to reason that researchers can find the basic components of biochemical tools in those bacteria that will enable us to safely decompose damaging chemicals while we 're still alive .
Given that some fraction of aging is due to the buildup of these compounds , that should benefit us greatly .
Shifting topics , here is another interesting paper ; it does n't sound like a practical line of research to me , but it 's still an intriguing idea .
A popular science article from yesterday is somewhat more informative for the layman than the abstract of the paper :
Food containing heavy isotopes of hydrogen , carbon and nitrogen could slow down the aging process .
That 's the claim of Oxford - based researcher Mikhail Shchepinov , who suggests that seeding key biological molecules with deuterium or carbon - 13 could drastically reduce oxidative damage or even avert it altogether .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are a staple of ageing research , as they are believed to cause cumulative damage to biomolecules such as DNA , proteins , and lipids .
Typically , breaking a carbon - hydrogen bond is the rate - limiting step of these reactions .
But if the carbon or hydrogen atoms involved were replaced by a heavier version of the same element ( 13C or D ) , the reaction will be slowed down due to a well - established phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect .
...
Heavy water ( D2O ) is toxic to higher organisms , but Shchepinov argues that isotopes would only be incorporated in the sites that need to be protected from oxidation .
' Ideally , they will slow down the oxidation reaction so much that they will never be released to take part in other reactions .
If some of them do break free , they will only occur in small concentrations , ' he said .
As for the other folk quoted in the article , I 'm dubious - it seems to me that the level of technology required to target the isotopes reliably ( and keep them targeted ) would enable far more effective methdologies of repairing rather than preventing oxidative damage .

Q & A : Our Omnipotent President Q. Can the president spy on Americans without a warrant ?
A . The president has to spy on Americans without a warrant !
We 're at war , and the president 's gotta defend America , and he's not gonna wait for a permission slip from a judge or a senator or America to do it !
Q . That 's just the kinda tough , no - nonsense thinking I like in a de facto dictator !
Now some crazy people say the president broke some silly old laws like FISA and the National Security Act and the Fourth Amendment .
Are these crazy people crazy ?
A . They sure are !
Maybe those laws worked back in 1978 back when Leonid Brezhnev was snortin coke with Ayatollah Khomeini and groovin to the hits of the Bee Gees , but in today 's dark and dangerous times they just are n't enough .
Q. Things sure have changed since the innocent days of mutually assured destruction !
But is it legal for the president to ignore the law ?
A. Maybe not according to plain ol stupid ol regular law , but we 're at war !
You do n't go to war with regular laws , which are made outta red tape and bureaucracy and Neville Chamberlain .
You go to war with great big strapping War Laws made outta tanks and cold hard steel and the American Fightin Man and WAR , KABOOOOOOM !
Q. How does a War Bill become a War Law ?
A . It all begins with the president , who submits a bill to the president .
If a majority of both the president and the president approve the bill , then it passes on to the president , who may veto it or sign it into law .
And even then the president can override himself with a two - thirds vote .
Q. See it 's the checks and balances that make all the difference in our democratic system .
A . It 's true .
Q. Can the president spy on me without a warrant ?
A . The president would never , ever spy on you , unless you 're talking to a terrorist .
Q. That sounds reasonable !
A . Or an associate of a terrorist or a suspected associate of a terrorist or a possible suspected relative of a member of an affiliate of a terrorist or someone with a name that 's spelled like a terrorist 's or someone who 's been mistakenly identified as a terrorist by an NSA algorithm .
Q . That sounds like I should look into switching to smoke signals .
A . Well if you want , the president can stop the illegal wiretapping just for you .
Q. Really ?
Well thanks , that 'd be great !
A . And then the terrorists can come and eat you .
Q. Wait !
What ?
A. Cause without the wiretaps there 's nothin to stop the terrorists from eatin you , yknow .
The terrorists and their army of bees .
Q. Oh no !
I 'm allergic to terrorists AND bees !
A . Oh that 's too bad , cause now the president hasta stop the illegal wiretaps and let alllll those terrorist bees eat you .
Q. Quick !
Put the wiretaps back , put the wiretaps back !
A . No no , you just said you wanna get eaten .
Eaten by terrorist bees .
Q. I change my mind !
Please let the president wiretap me , pleeeease .
A. I dunno ...
Q. Please , I can change !
I DO believe in terror , I DO believe in terror !
A. Oh , alright .
But just this once !
Q. It 's a Nine - Elevenmas miracle !
Q . Is the president above the law ?
A. Nobody 's above the law !
As commander - in - chief the president just outranks the law .
Q . So the president does n't break the law .
He just appoints new laws to fill vacancies in the office of law , as empowered by Acticle II of the Shmonstitution !
A . In the presidential order of succession the law falls between Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson .
Q . You can't put the law any higher .
It would just slow down the War on Terror with bureaucratic rules and regulations like the Geneva Conventions and the Bill of Rights .
A . If the law outranked the president we 'd never get anything done !
The president would go toss Osama bin Laden through a plate glass window and the law would call him into his office an go " Dammit president , you 're outta control ! "
Q . And then the president'd be all " You 're outta control , chief !
The whole freakin system 's outta control ! "
A . And then the president would totally turn in his badge and quit the force to fight crime !
Q. Fight crime ... with mind - powers .
Q. Can the president eat a baby ?
A . If that baby has suspected ties to al Qaeda , then it 's the president 's duty to eat it - for the sake of national security .
Q . The president does n't want to eat sweet , delicious babies .
He just wants to protect America from the growing threat of a rogue baby insurgency .
A. Exactly .
And nobody will have more compassion for that succulent baby barbecue than him .
Q . How many non-terrorist babies would it be acceptible for the president to accidentally eat in the course of enforcing a rigorous terrorist baby - eating program ?
A. First of all , the president would never ever eat a baby unless it was reasonably suspected to be affiliated with possible terroresque program activities .
Second of all , do we really wanna start tyin the president 's hands when he 's tryin to protect everybody from jihadist babies ?
They could be Islamifying our country 's drool supply as we speak !
Q. Sir , I demand the immediate establishment of a cabinet - level Department of Baby - Eating !
A. Just til we win the War on Terror , of course !
Q . And with our sophisticated baby - eating technology we should be taking the Terrorstani capital of Fearlamabad any day now !
A. Of course !
But the actual occupation could last quite some time , you understand ...
Q. Well , yes .
But the fight has to be won .
These people want to use terror to destroy our freedom .
A . And that 's just un -American .
Q. Can the president spy on Americans without a warrant ?
A.
The president has to spy on Americans without a warrant !
We 're at war , and the president 's gotta defend America , and he's not gonna wait for a permission slip from a judge or a senator or America to do it !Q.

Second of all , do we really wanna start tyin the president 's hands when he 's tryin to protect everybody from jihadist babies ?
They could be Islamifying our country 's drool supply as we speak !
Q. Sir , I demand the immediate establishment of a cabinet - level Department of Baby - Eating !
A.
Just til we win the War on Terror , of course !Q.
And with our sophisticated baby - eating technology we should be taking the Terrorstani capital of Fearlamabad any day now !
A.
Of course !
But the actual occupation could last quite some time , you understand ... Q.
Well , yes .
But the fight has to be won .
These people want to use terror to destroy our freedom .
A . And that 's just un-American .

Her defense , however , is that she was making a joke , not speaking a slur .
Her logic suggests that the two are mutually exclusive .
They 're not .
And when you unpack Coulter 's joke , you see she does both .
Her joke was that the world is so absurd that someone like Isaiah Washington is forced to go into rehab for calling someone a " faggot . "
She 's absolutely right that this is absurd and funny and an example of p.c. insanity .
She could have made a joke about that - a better one , to be sure - but a joke .
But she did n't just do that .
She added to the joke a slur : " John Edwards is a faggot . "
That 's why people gasped and then laughed and clapped so heartily .
I was in the room , so I felt the atmosphere personally .
It was an ugly atmosphere , designed to make any gay man or woman in the room feel marginalized and despised .
To put it simply , either conservatism is happy to be associated with that atmosphere , or it is n't .
I think the response so far suggests that the conservative elites do n't want to go there , but the base has already been there for a very long time .
( That 's why this affair is so revealing , because it is showing which elites want to pander to bigots , and which do not . )
Coulter 's defense of the slur is that it was directed at an obviously straight man and so could not be a real slur .
The premise of this argument is that the word faggot is only used to describe gay men and is only effective and derogatory when used against a gay man .
But it is n't .
In fact , in the schoolyard she cites , the primary targets of the f- word are straight boys or teens or men .
The word " faggot " is used for two reasons : to identify and demonize a gay man ; and to threaten a straight man with being reduced to the social pariah status of a gay man .
Coulter chose the latter use of the slur , its most potent and common form .
She knew why Edwards qualified .
He 's pretty , he has flowing locks , he 's young - looking .
He is exactly the kind of straight guy who is targeted as a " faggot " by his straight peers .
This , Ms Coulter , is real social policing by speech .
And that 's what she was doing : trying to delegitimize and feminize a man by calling him a faggot .
It happens every day .
It 's how insecure or bigoted straight men police their world to keep the homos out .
And for the slur to work , it must logically accept the premise that gay men are weak , effeminate , wusses , sissies , and the rest .
A sane gay man has two responses to this , I think .
The first is that there is nothing wrong with effeminacy or effeminate gay men - and certainly nothing weak about many of them .
In the plague years , I saw countless nelly sissies face HIV and AIDS with as much courage and steel as any warrior on earth .
You want to meet someone with balls ?
Find a drag queen .
The courage of many gay men every day in facing down hatred and scorn and derision to live lives of dignity and integrity is not a sign of being a wuss or somehow weak .
We have as much and maybe more courage than many - because we have had to acquire it to survive .
And that is especially true of gay men whose effeminacy may not make them able to pass as straight - the very people Coulter seeks to demonize .
The conflation of effeminacy with weakness , and of gayness with weakness , is what Coulter calculatedly asserted .
This was not a joke .
It was an attack .
For the second year in a row , violence and persecution in Iraq fueled a sharp rise in the number of people worldwide who were forced to flee their homelands , according to the latest edition of " World Refugee " released here Wednesday by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants ( USCRI ) .
By the end of 2006 , according to the report , nearly 14 million people were living as refugees , an increase of nearly two million people from 2005 , and the highest global total since 2001 .
Of the two million uprooted from their homelands in the course of the year , nearly half were Iraqis , according to the report , which assailed the United States , the main occupying power in Iraq , for granting refuge to a mere 202 Iraqis last year , although Washington has subsequently pledged to resettle 3,000 more Iraqis by the end of the current fiscal year , Sep. 30 .
By contrast , neighboring Syria permitted some 450,000 Iraqis to enter in 2006 , bringing the total Iraqi population there to some 800,000 ; while Jordan took in some 250,000 last year , bringing the number of Iraqis there to some 700,000 .
Some 80,000 more Iraqis also entered Egypt .
" Just like the war itself , this refugee crisis is complicated , has grown exponentially , has no end in sight and no simple solution , " according to Lavinia Limon , USCRI ’s president .
" This is a ‘ silent surge ’ that is providing temporary safety for millions but has been underreported by the media , elicited minimal response from the US Congress and virtually ignored by the ( George W. )
Bush administration , European and Middle Eastern capitals , and the international community , " she wrote in an introduction to the report .
In addition to Iraq , major new sources of refugees included Somalia , where a military offensive by Ethiopia late last year spurred an exodus of tens of thousands of people to Yemen , Kenya , and Ethiopia ; Sir Lanka , where an upsurge in fighting between the government and Tamil rebels was responsible for an outflow of some 26,000 people to India ; and central Africa , where cross - border violence affecting the Central African Republic , Chad , and Sudan uprooted tens of thousands of people .
Of the world ’s 13.9 million refugees and asylum - seekers , less than 70,000 were permanently resettled during 2006 , with the US taking some 41,000 , followed by Australia ( 12,133 ) , Canada , ( 10,600 ) Sweden ( 1,555 ) , and Norway ( 924 ) , according to the report .
By the end of the year , Afghanis remained the world ’s largest refugee population at about 3.4 million , followed by Palestinians ( three million ) , Iraqis ( 1.7 million , which has since grown to well over two million , according to the latest estimates by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , or UNHCR ) , Burmese ( 693,000 ) , and Colombians ( 453,000 ) .
Meanwhile , Pakistan hosted the largest refugee population  some 2.2 million mostly Afghan nationals ; followed by Syria with an estimated refugee population of 1.33 million ; Iran ( 1.025 million ) ; the Gaza Strip ( 1.02 million ) ; Jordan ( 862,000 ) , and the West Bank ( 722,000 ) .
The latest report , which , as in the past several years , grades countries on how well they comply with the basic rights provided under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees , found a general deterioration during 2006 .
Two countries  Russia and Tanzania  earned failing grades on providing physical protection for refugees and not forcibly returning them to their homelands ( known as refoulement ) , providing them access to courts , guaranteeing freedom of movement , and respecting their right to earn a living .
Algeria , Bangladesh , Iran , the Israeli - occupied territories , Malaysia , Namibia , South Africa , Sudan , Thailand , and Yemen received F ’s in at least two of the four major categories .
On the other hand , Australia , Benin , Canada , Ethiopia , Sierra Leone , and the US scored A’s in at least two categories , although the US also received an F for its refoulement of Haitians without adequate screening for asylum claims and a D for its detention of asylum seekers .
The five largest hosts of Iraqi refugees ( Syria , Jordan , Egypt , Lebanon , and Iran ) also received mostly poor grades , including an F for Jordan ’s refoulement of Iraqis , for compliance with the 1951 Convention .
All five received D’s for failing to provide refugees with the right to earn a living .
Syria and Egypt received
Bs for ensuring freedom of movement , while the other three received Cs in that category .
The new report comes on the heels of an unusually harsh denunciation of donor countries last week by UNHCR for their neglect of the mounting Iraqi refugee crisis .
Only 80 million dollars has been pledged or donated to UNHCR to deal with the Iraqi outflow to date , while UNHCR says that hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to cope .
" The two countries caring for the biggest proportion of Iraqi refugees  Syria and Jordan  have still received next to nothing in bilateral help from the world community , " according to the agency ’s spokesman , Ron Redmond , who warned that the refugees are " facing enormous hardships that will only get worse if the international community does n’t put its money where its mouth is . "
In her analysis , Limon noted that the ongoing crisis is " atypical " in that it has taken place gradually and in ways that have not attracted much media attention , in part because " there are no photos of thousands fleeing across the border carrying their children and salvaged belongings . "
The crisis also creates difficult challenges because most of those who have fled Iraq are " urban refugees " the standard response to which is to treat them as " illegal immigrants and not recognize their eligibility for refugee status or economic assistance by ( UNHCR ) . "
The result has been widespread neglect of their plight which , according to Limon , is " inconsistent with the all the declarations of concern and commitment to the Iraqi people ’s freedom and well - being made by governments , human rights organizations and the media .
The international silence and inaction is shameful and compounds the Iraqi people ’s tragedy . "
She called on the US , which so far has contributed only 18 million dollars  or roughly what the US military spends every two hours conducting operations in Iraq  to UNHCR ’s Iraq - related efforts , to take " moral leadership " by guarantee ( ing ) coverage for all costs associated with hosting these refugees . "
She also called on the US to establish an efficient programme for resettling them here , noting that Washington may not even meet its current goal of resettling 3,000 Iraqis here by October .
That appeal echoes more sweeping proposals by former top refugee officials who have contrasted the Bush administration ’s failure to provide safe haven for Iraqis to the resettlement here of more than 131,000 Vietnamese who were believed to be at risk of persecution during the latter half of 1975 .
In addition to the more than two million Iraqis who have fled the country since the 2003 invasion , another two million Iraqis have been internally displaced by the violence which , despite intensified US military efforts this year to pacify Baghdad , in particular , has not been significantly reduced nationwide .

Confusion is the natural ( dis - ) order of things .
Defy it .
Working with a material 10 times lighter than steel — but 250 times stronger — would be a dream come true for any engineer .
If this material also had amazing properties that made it highly conductive of heat and electricity , it would start to sound like something out of a science fiction novel .
Yet one Florida State University research group , the Florida Advanced Center for Composite Technologies ( FAC2T ) , is working to develop real - world applications for just such a material .
Dr. Ben Wang
Ben Wang , a professor of industrial engineering at the Florida A&M University - FSU College of Engineering , serves as director of FAC2T ( www.fac2t.eng.fsu.edu), which works to develop new , high - performance composite materials , as well as technologies for producing them .
Wang is widely acknowledged as a pioneer in the growing field of nano - materials science .
His main area of research , involving an extraordinary material known as " buckypaper , " has shown promise in a variety of applications , including the development of aerospace structures , the production of more - effective body armor and armored vehicles , and the construction of next - generation computer displays .
The U.S. military has shown a keen interest in the military applications of Wang 's research ; in fact , the Army Research Lab recently awarded FAC2T a $ 2.5 - million grant , while the Air Force Office of Scientific Research awarded $ 1.2 million .
" At FAC2T , our objective is to push the envelope to find out just how strong a composite material we can make using buckypaper , " Wang said .
" In addition , we 're focused on developing processes that will allow it to be mass - produced cheaply . "
Buckypaper is made from carbon nanotubes — amazingly strong fibers about 1/50,000th the diameter of a human hair that were first developed in the early 1990s .
Buckypaper owes its name to Buckminsterfullerene , or Carbon 60 — a type of carbon molecule whose powerful atomic bonds make it twice as hard as a diamond .
Sir Harold Kroto , now a professor and scientist with FSU 's department of chemistry and biochemistry , and two other scientists shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of Buckminsterfullerene , nicknamed " buckyballs " for the molecules ' spherical shape .
Their discovery has led to a revolution in the fields of chemistry and materials science — and directly contributed to the development of buckypaper .
Among the possible uses for buckypaper that are being researched at FAC2T :
If exposed to an electric charge , buckypaper could be used to illuminate computer and television screens .
It would be more energy - efficient , lighter , and would allow for a more uniform level of brightness than current cathode ray tube ( CRT ) and liquid crystal display ( LCD ) technology .
As one of the most thermally conductive materials known , buckypaper lends itself to the development of heat sinks that would allow computers and other electronic equipment to disperse heat more efficiently than is currently possible .
This , in turn , could lead to even greater advances in electronic miniaturization .
Because it has an unusually high current - carrying capacity , a film made from buckypaper could be applied to the exteriors of airplanes .
Lightning strikes then would flow around the plane and dissipate without causing damage .
Films also could protect electronic circuits and devices within airplanes from electromagnetic interference , which can damage equipment and alter settings .
Similarly , such films could allow military aircraft to shield their electromagnetic " signatures , " which can be detected via radar .
FAC2T " is at the very forefront of a technological revolution that will dramatically change the way items all around us are produced , " said Kirby Kemper , FSU 's vice president for Research .
" The group of faculty , staff , students and post - docs in this center have been visionary in their ability to recognize the tremendous potential of nanotechnology .
The potential applications are mind - boggling . "
FSU has four U.S. patents pending that are related to its buckypaper research .
In addition to his academic and scientific responsibilities , Wang recently was named FSU 's assistant vice president for Research .
In this role , he will help to advance research activities at the College of Engineering and throughout the university .
" I look forward to bringing researchers together to pursue rewarding research opportunities , " Wang said .
" We have very knowledgeable and talented faculty and students , and I will be working with them to help meet their full potential for advancement in their fields . "
That 's only partially correct , and is probably the extent of most people 's understanding of this transition .
But given that I am very keen that people should understand the energy industry , it is worth a review , and a layman 's explanation .
I explained the details behind this transition in Refining 101 : Winter Gasoline .
But let ’s review some concepts .
Just what is summer gasoline ?
Twice a year , in the fall and in the spring , you hear about the seasonal gasoline transition .
However , most people probably do n’t understand what this actually means .
AAA has provided a Top 10 list explaining the seasonal rise in gasoline prices , and summer gasoline checked in at # 7 :
There are two key ( although not the only ) specifications that refiners must meet for gasoline .
The gasoline needs to have the proper octane , and it needs to have the proper Reid vapor pressure ( RVP ) .
While the octane of a particular grade is constant throughout the year , the RVP spec changes with the seasons .
The RVP is based on a test that measures vapor pressure of the gasoline blend at 100 degrees F. Normal atmospheric pressure varies , but is usually around 14.7 lbs per square inch ( psi ) .
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the air over our heads .
If a liquid has a vapor pressure of greater than normal atmospheric pressure , that liquid boils .
For example , when you heat a pan of water , the vapor pressure increases until it reaches atmospheric pressure .
At that point , the water begins to boil .
In the summer , when temperatures can exceed 100 degrees F in many locations , it is important that the RVP of gasoline is well below 14.7 .
Otherwise , it can pressure up your gas tanks and gas cans , and it can boil in open containers .
Gas that is vaporized ends up in the atmosphere , and contributes to air pollution .
Therefore , the EPA has declared that summer gasoline blends may not exceed 7.8 psi in some locations , and 9.0 psi in others .
The particulars vary , but key considerations are the altitude and motor vehicle density of a specific location .
The EIA summarizes the key points :
As gasoline evaporates , volatile organic compounds ( VOC ’s ) enter the atmosphere and contribute to ozone formation .
Gasoline ’s propensity to evaporate is measured by Reid vapor pressure ( RVP ) .
In order to control VOC emissions , the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that all gasoline be limited to an RVP maximum of 9.0 psi during the summer high ozone season , which the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) established as running from June 1 to September 15 .
The Act also authorized the EPA to set more stringent standards for nonattainment areas .
As a result , EPA limits areas designated as “ high volatility non-attainment ” to a maximum RVP of 7.8 psi during the high ozone season .
Some States elected to require even more stringent restrictions to achieve local clean air goals , and require 7.2 - and 7.0 - psi gasolines .
Butane , which has an RVP of 52 psi , can be blended into gasoline in higher proportions in the winter because the vapor pressure allowance is higher .
There are 2 advantages in doing this .
First , butane is a cheaper blending component than most of the other ingredients .
That makes fall and winter gasoline cheaper to produce .
But butane is also abundant , so that means that gasoline supplies increase in the winter because more butane is thrown into the mix .
Not only that , but this all takes place after summer driving season , when demand typically falls off .
These factors normally combine each year to reduce gasoline prices in the fall ( even in non-election years ) .
The RVP is stepped back down to summer levels starting in the spring , and this usually causes prices to increase .
There are some misconceptions that I often seen repeated about this seasonal transition .
One is that it is the reason that spring and fall maintenance are done .
That is not the case .
Most , if not all refineries can carry out this transition without shutting down or interrupting production .
The reason that maintenance is done in the spring and fall is that it provides a combination of moderate weather ( the inside of a vessel can be unbearable in the summer ) and off - peak demand .
Vessels must be inspected , new equipment must be installed , catalyst change - outs occur , etc .
This is similar to tuning up your car to keep it in proper running condition .
But the seasonal maintenance is unrelated to the gasoline transition .
In fact , for reasons I wo n't get into here , seasonal maintenance often complicates the transition .
Another misconception that some have is that they can save money by buying cheap gas in the winter and storing it for the summer .
Remember that winter gasoline will pressure up as the weather heats up , and the contained butane will start to vaporize out of the mix .
You will end up with less gasoline than you paid for , and you will be contributing to the air pollution problem that summer gasoline was designed to avoid .
If , on the other hand , you were to buy summer gasoline and try to store it until winter , you might find yourself having problems getting the fuel to ignite , due to the lower vapor pressure .
This would be like putting a little bit of diesel in your gasoline – not very good for your car .
So buy and use gasoline in the correct season .
The Politics of Ethanol Blending
I should also mention a bit about ethanol blending .
The blending of ethanol into the gasoline pool has been controversial because ( among other things ) it increases the vapor pressure of gasoline blends .
This has resulted in the need for a 1 psi waiver for ethanol - containing fuels .
From the previously linked EIA report :
As a part of the Clean Air Act Amendments , conventional gasoline containing 10 percent ethanol was allowed to exceed the Federal RVP maximums by 1 psi .
This of course means that ethanol will exacerbate smog at certain times of the year , and has resulted in a campaign by Senator Diane Feinstein to limit ethanol blending in California :
California contends its refineries can make clean - burning gasoline without oxygenates such as ethanol or MTBE .
In fact , California ’s Sen .
Diane Feinstein contends ethanol ’s volatility may be the cause for increasing smog levels in Southern California since the waiver was denied and more ethanol was added to the state ’s gasoline supply .
Recently , Feinstein asked the EPA and the California Air Resources Board to investigate the impact of ethanol - blended gasoline on California ’s air quality .
She said air quality in the South Coast Air Quality Management Zone has gotten worse this year compared to last and " the switch to ethanol - blended gasoline is considered one of the main culprits in increased ozone . "
" Since ethanol ’s volatility increases smog , particularly in the summer , I believe we need to look carefully at its impact on air quality , " said the senator .
However , it looks like she is losing this battle for political reasons :
In the face - off between California and Corn Belt states over ethanol , California lost again this month .
Federal officials concede that the corn - based fuel additive can increase smog and soot pollution from vehicles .
But in a ruling shocking in its disregard for public health , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency refused for a second time to scrap the rule requiring California to blend ethanol in its gasoline .
The EPA conceded that California air quality officials are right about ethanol 's polluting effect in summer .
Nonetheless , in its tortured ruling , the federal agency said California had not " clearly demonstrated " that the ethanol requirement would delay or interfere with the state 's ability to meet federal clean air standards .
Incredibly , the ruling said that even if California had demonstrated that the ethanol rule prevented the state from meeting clean air standards , the EPA " would deny the waiver . "
Why ?
" This reduction in the use of ethanol would undermine the potential benefits vis a vis energy security and support for rural and agricultural economy that Congress expected " from its ethanol rule .
The EPA ruling 's effect is to increase payouts to one special interest , Midwest corn producers .
For that California endures higher gasoline prices and dirtier air .
California cannot afford to let this assault on public health , fairness and common sense stand .
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , has persuaded the Senate Energy Committee to add a clause to a pending energy bill that would exempt California from the ethanol rule during summer months .
All the state 's elected officials should join her in that fight .
All energy issues seem to be completely entangled with politics , and the sad fact is that the politics often trump the science .
Ethanol blending is a perfect example where we are willing to exempt certain pollution issues " for the greater good . "
Conclusion
Hopefully that was an easy - to - understand explanation of the seasonal gasoline transition in the U.S.
The purpose of the transition is to curb pollution , but as the last section demonstrates the politics often interfere with the original intent .
Now the next time you hear " season gasoline transition " , you will know exactly what they are talking about and what the expected impact on supply and price will be .
The current Bush administration has sometimes been very frank about the need to sell the ' war on terror ' , and many of the elements used to sell that attack on Iraq -- the intelligence dossiers , the unsourced revelations , the denigration of hard evidence , the cosying - up to prominent exiles -- are now being used to sell an attack on Iran .
With some 22 minutes out of every hour on US TV given over to advertising , the public is accustomed to being sold things on the promise of nirvana if they only succumb .
If the Iraq debacle is anything to go by , the process can be extended - - remarkably smoothly , in many ways -- to selling ( and buying ) a war .
Andy Card , George W. Bush 's chief of staff , said Congress had not been asked in August 2002 to authorise military force in Iraq because " From a marketing point of view , you do n't introduce new products in August . "
When Colin Powell appointed a Madison Avenue advertising star , Charlotte Beers , as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs , he explained on 6 September 2001 : " I wanted one of the world 's greatest advertising experts , because what are we doing ?
We 're selling .
We 're selling a product democracy the free enterprise system , the American value system . "
This was less direct than Andy Card , but one could easily add ' war ' to this list of goodies since war -- particularly after the cataclysm of five days later - was the chosen way of achieving these benefits .
Rampton and Stauber commented : " Rather than changing the way we actually relate to the people of the Middle East , [ US officials ] still dream of fixing their image through some new marketing campaign cooked up in Hollywood or Madison Avenue . "
But how , exactly , do you sell a war ?
The usual rules of advertising seem to serve just fine .
The first rule is : repeat your message often enough and people will believe it .
Adolph Hitler had already taken this insight into the political sphere : " The receptivity of the great masses is very limited , their intelligence is small , but their power of forgetting is enormous [ Propaganda ] must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over . "
Hitler , in fact , made the connection with commercial advertising explicit : " All advertising , whether in the field of business or politics , achieves success through the continuity and sustained uniformity of its application . "
In her book The Origins of Totalitarianism , Hannah Arendt noted the reliance of Soviet and Nazi leaders on repeating lies .
After 9/11 , US government officials repeatedly stressed the links between Iraq and 9/11 .
Bush frequently linked bin Laden and Saddam Hussein in the same breath , though he was pretty tricky in the exact wording , suggesting he knew it was an artful lie .
In an October 2002 opinion poll , 66 per cent of Americans said they believed Saddam Hussein was involved in the 9/11 attacks , and 79 per cent said he possessed , or was close to possessing , nuclear weapons .
As late as July 2006 , 64 per cent of US respondents still believed Saddam had maintained strong links to al - Qaida and 50 per cent believed he had harboured weapons of mass destruction .
Reporters who interviewed US soldiers in Kuwait on the eve of the war in Iraq were shocked to find them convinced they were going to fight ' terrorists ' , a misconception that -- as Max Rodenbeck points out - surely fed into the frequent instances of overly aggressive behaviour .
Now the official focus has switched to Iran , whose government , according to Bush , is " belligerent , loud , noisy , threatening " .
There were no less than five mentions of Iran in Bush 's January 2007 State of the Union address and Iran is constantly in the news .
A second rule of advertising is : find some memorable catch - phrases .
After Bush introduced the phrase " axis of evil " in a January 2002 speech , Woodward reported , " [ Deputy Defence Secretary Paul ]
Wolfowitz saw once again how important it was to grab the headlines , and he was reminded that academics did n't get it .
Oversimplification was required in a sound - bite culture . "
When Rumsfeld mentioned the concept of " shock and awe " , Bush said it was a catchy notion .
Another common sound - bite was the " smoking gun " -- as when Bush said of Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction , " we cannot wait for the final proof , the smoking gun , that could come in the form of a nuclear cloud . "
More recent catch - phrases suggest a shifting definition of the enemy and an intensifying spotlight on Iran .
Bush noted in August 2006 that the US was " at war with Islamic fascists " , while Blair ( echoing the " axis of evil " ) has invoked an " arc of extremism " in the Middle East and beyond , adding that expansion of Iranian power calls for an " arc of moderation " to pin it back .
A third rule of advertising is to promise big benefits from your product .
This is common - sense but it may be done quite subtly .
Advertising has a strong strain of wish - fulfilment -- it appeals to a pervasive and powerful kind of magical thinking .
Typically , the product is portrayed as possessing magical qualities that will bring you love , sex , respect , security , or some combination of these .
Raymond Williams argued that the problem with consumer society is not that we are too materialistic , but that we are not materialistic enough ; if we were sensibly materialistic , if we confined our interest to the usefulness of objects , we would find most advertising to be of insane irrelevance .
The magical thinking behind the ' war on terror ' is what allows such a radical disconnect between problem and solution -- most glaringly , between 9/11 and attacking Iraq .
Arendt noted in The Origins of Totalitarianism that it can be very attractive when leaders offer solutions with a degree of certainty ; the illogical nature of the proposed ' solution ' ( for example , eliminating the Jews as a remedy for Germany 's military and economic problems ) does not necessarily make it any less attractive .
Arendt also noted that the need for certainty may be particularly intense in circumstances where people 's own economic and social circumstances are precarious ; she suggested that part of the appeal of fascism was that the identification of a clearly - identified enemy -- whilst frightening -- was less frightening and less disorienting than a world in which the source of insecurity remained obscure .
That analysis resonates today .
In his book What 's the matter with Kansas ? , Thomas Frank provides a revealing case - study of how economic insecurity has fed into support for Bush and for right - wing politicians more generally .
Frank argues that in Kansas ( and , by extension , much of middle America ) , a longstanding hostility towards big corporations has been displaced into a ' backlash ' politics that includes hostility towards foreign enemies , towards a range of ' outgroups ' , and towards the forces ( like science , evolution , secularism and pluralism ) that seem to undermine old and comfortable certainties .
Whilst the Bush administration has significantly exacerbated domestic inequality and insecurity , the search for scapegoats precedes his regime .
In her 1999 book Stiffed , Susan Faludi considered how economic security in the US had corroded traditional masculine roles centred on on protecting and providing .
She wrote of " the search for someone to blame for the premature death of masculine promise " , and she elaborated :
What began in the 1950s as an intemperate pursuit of Communists in the government bureaucracy , in the defence industries , in labor unions , the schools , the media , and Hollywood , would eventually become a hunt for a shape - shifting enemy who could take the form of women at the office , or gays in the military , or young black men on the street , or illegal aliens on the border , and from there become a surreal ' combat ' with nonexistent black helicopters , one - world government , and goose - stepping UN peacekeeping thugs massing on imaginary horizons .
The desire to find some kind of an enemy was already in place , in other words .
It seems that the terrorist - perhaps the ultimate shape - shifter with his civilian garb , his fluctuating ' state backers ' , and his tendency to disintegrate at the moment of his greatest crime -- has stepped into an existing template .
Much earlier instances of scapegoating were illuminated in Keith Thomas 's classic study Religion and the Decline of Magic .
Thomas noted that when suffering is not explicable within existing frameworks , human beings have tended to resort to magical thinking -- in other words , to turn to solutions with no logical or scientific connection to the problem .
The limits of medical knowledge in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , for example , created a powerful impulse to explain illness through ' witchcraft ' .
Today , in the face of the ' disease ' of contemporary terrorism and the increased disorientation and anxiety after 9/11 , severe shortcomings in state - based and economics - based explanatory frameworks have helped to create political and intellectual space for explanations and prescriptions that are once more leading us into the realms of the superstitious and the persecutory .
In many ways , we are witnessing a return to magical thinking -- the belief and hope that we can re-order the world to our liking by mere force of will or by actions that have no logical connection to the problem we are addressing .
And as the old witch - hunts , it is the weakness of the victim that attracts the persecutor -- the lack of weapons - of - mass - destruction , the inability to hit the US .
The personalities of both George W. Bush and Tony Blair have apparently contributed to this latest wave of magical thinking .
US analyst Joe Klein said of Bush , " The President seems to believe that wishing will make it so . "
Novelist Doris Lessing said of Blair " He believes in magic .
That if you say a thing , it is true . "
Commenting on Blair and the supposed Iraqi ' weapons of mass destruction ' , Polly Toynbee observed that the British Prime Minister " is so easily carried away by the persuasiveness of his own words and the force of his own arguments that you can hear him mesmerise himself
There is an almost childish blurring between the wish and the fact : if he says something strongly enough , his words can magic it into truth "
Perhaps the the most convincing salesmen actually do believe in their products ( or at least have persuaded themselves to believe ) ; but believing and cajoling have increasingly been revealed as insufficient .
In a recent Foreign Affairs article , Blair argues that confronting ' Islamist terrorism ' means not only using force but also " telling them that their attitude toward the United States is absurd , that their concept of governance is pre-feudal , that their positions on women and other faiths are reactionary . "
It also means rejecting " their false sense of grievance against the West " .
These words may have magical powers that only Blair is aware of ; the rest of us may wonder how helpful or persuasive it is to be told that your attitudes are ' absurd ' or your grievances are ' false ' .
In the ' war on terror ' , key policy - makers have adopted ( and sometimes openly expressed ) the idea that you do not need evidence on which to base something as serious ( and incendiary ) as a war .
Rumsfeld came close to acknowledging this with his statement that " absence of evidence is not evidence of absence of weapons of mass destruction " .
Notoriously , M16 chief Sir Richard Dearlove told a Downing Street meeting in July 2002 that in the US " the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy " .
More recently , in January 2007 , Richard Perle noted that when it came to assessing the nuclear threat from Iran , " You ca n't afford to wait for all the evidence " .
There are some indications that , for the Bush administration , the aim has not been to study reality ( and then base behaviour on it ) but to create reality .
In the summer of 2002 , journalist and author Ron Suskind met with one of Bush 's senior advisers , who was unhappy with an article Suskind had written about the administration 's media relations .
The adviser commented that :
guys like me were " in what we call the reality - based community , " which he defined as people who " believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . "
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
He cut me off .
" That 's not the way the world really works anymore , " he continued .
" We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality - judiciously , as you will -- we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . "
A fourth rule of advertising is that you are selling not only the product but also the problem or threat that the product is alleged to address .
To sell the toilet - cleaner , in other words , you have to sell the germs .
By extension , to sell the ' war on terror ' , you have to sell the terror .
Of course , 9/11 was a horrifying fact , as were the bombings in Madrid and London that followed the invasion of Iraq .
But we now know that the threat from Iraq was systematically exaggerated .
Moreover , for all the fears being whipped up in relation to Iran , the threat of a direct attack on the US by Iran is small , particularly when compared with the threat of total obliteration by the Soviet Union during the Cold War .
Of 42 terrorist organisations listed by the US State Department , only a handful ( all linked to al - Qaida ) have ever attacked the US or indicated that they wish to do so .
A fifth rule in advertising is another very basic one : you stress that the product will not cost much .
Selling the attack on Iraq was like selling a dodgy mortgage : the cost looked reasonable but after a certain period -- surprise !-- the rates went up dramatically .
Just before the Iraq war , the Pentagon estimated that it would cost about $ 50 billion .
Wolfowitz told Congress , " There is a lot of money to pay for this [ the Iraq war ] .
It does n't have to be US taxpayer money .
We are talking about a country that can finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon . "
Bush underlined the promise in the case of the ' war on terror ' by pushing through tax - cuts in the run-up to war .
( Indeed , the belief that major foreign and domestic problems can be magically solved without raising significant new taxes is something that seems to have united the Republican Bush and Labour 's Blair . )
The impression that war would be relatively costless was reinforced by the incitement to a spending spree in the tough - talking aftermath of 9/11 .
Whilst the US intervention in World War Two had led to a concerted recycling effort and to rationing of gasoline and food , 9/11 led only to calls to US consumers to maintain their spending as a patriotic duty : there was to be a veritable feast at the wake .
On 17 October 2001 , Bush declared , " They want us to stop flying and they want us to stop buying , but this great nation will not be intimidated by the evildoers . "
Yet somehow , sometime , the costs of war will have to be met .
US Congressional Budget Office figures reveal that the Iraq war is currently absorbing some 200 million dollars a day .
The total bill so far : $ 400 billion -- a sum that economist Linda Bilmes says could provide health insurance for all the uninsured Americans .
Assuming a gradual withdrawal of US troops that will be complete by 2015 , Bilmes and renowned economist Joseph Stiglitz calculate the war could end up costing almost $ 2.5 trillion .
Before the Iraq invasion , promising low costs also included promising low troop commitments and low casualties - the latter reflecting , in part , an emphasis on technological ' advances ' like Cruise missiles .
Rumsfeld in particular promoted the idea of quick and relatively costless military solutions .
Once again , this deceptive brand of magic has hardly borne scrutiny .
Death and war are blood brothers who do not wish to be separated , and what was supposed to be ' a new kind of war ' has turned out to be a pretty old kind in many ways .
As of April 5th 2007 , a total of 3,259 American soldiers had been confirmed as killed in Iraq .
More than 50,000 US soldiers have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the cost of looking after them could eventually run to some $ 536 billion .
An October 2006 study in The Lancet suggested that some 655,000 had died as a result of the US - led invasion - - a careful calculation made by a team from Johns Hopkins university .
The increasingly obvious costs of the ' war on terror ' potentially present a problem that is familiar to consumer society more generally : the problem of dealing with broken promises .
Consumerism has to sustain itself in the face of a reasonably consistent and persistent failure to bring happiness by means of a new skirt , car , deodorant , floor - cleaner or whatever .
The trump card is that the dissatisfaction arising from the false promises of advertising is not so much a problem as a solution : it creates continued demand !
This is the perverse genius of capitalism , and it was implicitly celebrated in an unusually frank in - store 2004 campaign by London 's department store Selfridges , which reminded its customers , " You want it , you buy it , you forget it " .
If skillfully manipulated , frustrated desires can be encouraged to home in on some new product , some new promise that is also unlikely to be fulfilled .
The process can be remarkably seamless and shameless .
US officials have an impressive CV when it comes to selling the useless and expensive wars that sustain the country 's vast armaments industry , and the ' war on terror ' is only the latest in a long line .
Served either hot or Cold , these serial wars have never quite delivered what they promised -- either to the ordinary citizens of America or to the wider world .
After the stand - off with the Soviet Union ( with its huge financial costs and horrendous human costs in the developing world ) came the ' war on drugs ' ( which fuelled paramilitary abuses in Colombia , for example ) , and the US stand - off with ' rogue states ' .
The ' war on terror ' has itself mutated with great speed .
In 1996 , the Taliban was welcomed by Western diplomats as a relatively palatable and pliable alternative to the warlords terrorising Afghanistan .
But this was soon forgotten as al - Qaida moved centre - stage and the Taliban was increasingly seen as a key backer .
The toppling of Taliban was not an initial aim of the US - led war ; the stated purpose was to bring justice to those responsible for 9/11 and eliminate their bases .
But again this was quickly forgotten .
The 2001 attacks on Afghanistan did not bring peace , either there or in the wider world .
Again , this was not necessarily a problem so long as the TV crews disappeared and some new crisis could be brought to western TV screens .
A key way that you make people forget their dissatisfaction with what they have been offered is precisely by offering them something new .
A small child has started crying and the minder picks up a rattle , saying " Here , take a look at this ! "
Suddenly , the child is not crying any more .
At a meeting of the National Security Council on 25 September 2001 , Donald Rumsfeld said , " Look , as part of the war on terrorism , should we be getting something going in another area , other than Afghanistan , so that success or failure and progress is n't measured just by Afghanistan ? "
The debacle in Iraq has itself produced an urge for some new distraction , perhaps a war that will focus on aerial bombing and will not be so costly in terms of American lives .
This " new , improved " product -- seriously entertained in relation to Iran - has already been road - tested in Lebanon and Somalia .
Meanwhile , the bizarre ' beauty ' of the ' war on terror ' is not only that it fails to remove the security deficit ; it actively creates demand !
First , it fosters a general sense of dread within the West : since we are ' at war ' , it is logical to conclude that the enemy must be powerful and pervasive .
Second , the ' war on terror ' predictably produces new terrorists .
Over time , the exaggeration of threats is made more plausible by the creation of enemies .
Iraq was labeled a source of terror , and it has obligingly become so .
The whole fiasco is almost a copybook case of Hannah Arendt 's ' action - as - propaganda ' , a concept she explained by pointing to " the advantages of a propaganda that constantly ' adds the power of organization ' to the feeble and unreliable voice of argument , and thereby realizes , so to speak , on the spur of the moment , whatever it says . "
The idea that strengthening the enemy is actually functional may sound bizarre , but it all depends on your goals .
Winning is not everything .
Making money and winning elections are also important .
Being seen to be winning may sometimes be paramount .
During the attack on Afghanistan in 2001 , US officials " admitted privately that they would soon be running out of things to bomb -- and running short of the videos that help keep public support for the war afloat " .
( As with music sales , a short video can do wonders . )
Woodward noted , " [ Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul ]
Wolfowitz said that the Taliban were getting reinforcements but [ General Tommy ]
Franks [ head of US Central Command ] thought that had a good news side -- it would create more targets . "
The predictably counterproductive effects of attacking Iraq also throw doubt on whether defeating terror is really a core aim .
Certainly , the war has been counterproductive .
An assessment by 16 US intelligence agencies found that the invasion and occupation of Iraq had helped to create a new generation of Islamic radicalism and that the overall terrorist threat had grown since 9/11 .
One study found a sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks when comparing the period between 9/11 and the start of the Iraq invasion and the following period up to end -September 2006 .
When " terrorist attacks " inside Iraq and Afghanistan were excluded , there was still a rise of more than one - third .
The probably of terror attacks in a particular country rose if the country had troops in Iraq , was close to Iraq , had a significant degree of identification with the Iraqi people and exchanged ideas or personnel with Iraqi jihadist groups .
Some products have an inherently limited demand : there are only so many potatoes you can eat until you feel full .
Some have a level of demand that can be increased through advertising : whilst a person only needs a limited number of sweaters : the dictates of fashion can overcome this awkward fact .
Still other products have an intrinsically magical quality : the more you have , the more you seem to need .
This may be because the products are addictive , or because they help to create a world in which they seem more and more ' essential ' .
Drugs and guns have both these happy qualities , and so does the ' war on terror ' .
( Note that the warmongers are not simply selling war but also the instruments of war : each new instalment of perpetual warfare -- not least in the ' war on terror ' - brings a chance to advertise your high - tech killing wares ; in this sense , as Jean Baudrillard noted , war is advertising . )
We know that selling something frequently represents an opportunity to sell something else : would you like a nice stand for that TV , sir , or some shoes to go with that suit ?
Moreover , if a product is unreliable , this is not so much a problem as an opportunity to sell insurance .
Finally , if after a while the product becomes useless of even downright dangerous , this conveniently creates demand for a replacement .
Indeed , this process may have an element of design : they used to call it ' built - in obsolescence ' , a technique that works best when the manufacturer has a monopoly of what is being sold .
( This need for a monopoly makes it doubly unfortunate that in the US the Democrats have , until recently , tended to fall in line with the solutions peddled by the Republican administration ) .
In the quasi-monopolistic conditions of American politics , it seems the frustrated desire for security can always be harnessed to some new promise , some new war , some new threat : whether it is Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon , Somalia , Syria , Iran or North Korea .
For those in search of safety and certainty , war has both the advantages and limitations of a drug or a spot of ' retail therapy ' : each new war we buy into can bring some temporary relief in the context of a general free - floating powerlessness ; but this inevitably wears off and before long you may need another hit to make you feel better .
All it requires , to keep the dysfunctional system going , is that we quickly and obligingly forget how badly the last ' solution ' worked , that we erase how soon the good trip turned to bad , that we subscribe to the new definition of evil as readily as the media - drenched ' proles ' of George Orwell 's 1984 , that we choke off our disillusion through some new fever ; in short , that we take the Selfridges slogan and let it seduce us into supporting whatever war is currently on offer : " You want it , you buy it , you forget it " .
Gore Vidal had much earlier referred to the " United States of Amnesia " , and Rumsfeld himself happily observed of journalists , " they 've got the attention - span of gnats " .
TV seems to be the perfect medium here .
A survey in the US by a team at the University of Massachusetts during the 1991 Iraq war found : " The more TV people watched , the less they knew Despite months of coverage , most people do not know basic facts about the political situation in the Middle East , or about the recent history of US policy towards Iraq . "
With no sense of history , it is easy to portray the actions of ' the other side ' as naked , unprovoked aggression ; the element of retaliation is obscured .
A good example may be the much - publicised capture of 15 British sailors by Iranian authorities .
How many people realize that this is quite likely to represent retaliation for the capture by US officials in northern Iraq of five Iranian officials , a raid apparently aimed at two very high - ranking Iranian security officials ?
Capitalism and the ' war on terror ' not only help to sustain one another but they also have this in common : they worship success but are nourished by failure .
As dutiful consumers , we must pat ourselves on the back for our high standards of living , and yet we can never admit that we have enough .
We celebrate our economic victory ( as individuals , as ' the West ' , as ' developed ' nations ) - and America 's particularly high levels of consumption are sometimes taken as attaching a special , other - worldly seal of approval to ' God 's own country ' .
But at the same time we are constantly reminded , every hour of every day , of what we do not have and of all the material and physical desires ( often re-defined as ' needs ' ) that remain unfulfilled .
The ' war on terror ' works in something of the same way .
We celebrate each ( fleeting ) military victory ( which some see , again , as attaching God 's approval to this endeavour ) .
But we are constantly reminded -- by the government , by the police , by journalists - of what we do not have , and all the ways in which our need for security and certainty remain chronically unfulfilled .
We are forever winning the ' war on terror ' , in other words , but there is always so much more to do .
One day Bush is standing aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln after the fall of Saddam and declaring under a banner proclaiming ' Mission Accomplished ' : " We do not know the day of final victory , but we have seen the turning of the tide . "
Twelve days later , there are bombings in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , and in a special on the ' war on terror ' , Time magazine has to break the news to its readers : " No , it 's not over . "
Each terror attack serves to remind us that we remain chronically in need of those whom we know ( but somehow keep forgetting ) are making the problem worse .
In this macabre dance of officialdom and the media , victory and failure are simultaneously glorified , and each failure -- in a pattern that has long characterised humanitarian relief , for example - is redefined as both ' need ' and ' opportunity ' .
Is the doctrine of deterrence increasingly redundant in the face of suicide attacks ?
Then we must renew our commitment to it by deterring states from supporting terrorists that they do not , in any case , support !
Has the technology of the West been turned against itself on 9/11 by attackers armed with no more than knives , box -cutters and a willingness to die ?
Then we must have more technology : more high - tech weapons , more smart weapons and drones !
Are terrorists angry at our meddling in the Middle East ?
Then we must meddle some more !
Is Iraq falling apart ?
Then we must attack Iran !
Apparently confident of our capacity to forget , the official response to dissatisfaction with the ' war on terror ' seems to be that we have not been trying -- or buying -- hard enough .
Referring to the battle with " Islamist extremism " , Tony Blair asks , " Why are we not yet succeeding ? "
His answer : " Because we are not being bold enough , consistent enough , thorough enough in fighting for the values we believe in . "
When Meyrav Wurmser , a prominent neo-con and director of the Centre for Middle East Policy at the Hudson Institute , said of the Iraq situation , " It 's a mess , is n't it ? " , there were promising hints of a neo - con rethink .
But as with many neo-cons , her plea has been for more of the same : " My argument has always been that this war is senseless if you do n't give it a regional context . "
Wurmser explains further : " The objective was to change the face of the Middle East .
But it was impossible to create a mini- democracy amidst a sea of dictatorships looking to destroy this poor democracy , and thus , where do insurgents in Iraq come from ?
From Iran and Syria . "
She adds that " many parts of the American administration " wanted Israel to attack Syria rather than Hizbollah , seeing the former course as likely to weaken Iran and weaken rebellion in Iraq .
Of course , the forcible ending of Sunni dominance in Iraq under Saddam Hussain has itself boosted Iranian influence in Iraq , where the Shi'a majority has gained in power through democratization .
Evidence from witch - hunts past and present suggests that they operate within closed systems of thought that make them difficult to challenge .
When the killing or banishment of a witch does not eliminate a particular problem , the conclusion is usually not that the witch - hunt was ill - conceived but that more witches must be found .
Even as the number of chosen enemy shifts with Orwellian rapidity , this is disguised with the insistence that " they are all the same , really " -- an essentially racist discourse that angers and belittles those on the receiving end .
Tony Blair recently came up with a typical example of this ' lumping ' :
The struggle against terrorism in Madrid , or London , or Paris is the same as the struggle against the terrorist acts of Hezbollah in Lebanon , or Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Palestinian territories , or rejectionist groups in Iraq .
The murder of the innocent in Beslan is part of the same ideology that takes innocent lives in Libya , Saudi Arabia , or Yemen .
And when Iran gives support to such terrorism , it becomes part of the same battle , with the same ideology at its heart .
Blair says that what these groups have in common is that they hate " us " , a formulation that panders to his audience 's sense of self - importance .
But not everyone is buying either the reckless , mutating definitions of the enemy or the policy of endless war as a route to peace .
For all the mind - numbing influence of sound - bites and ' real - time ' TV , lies may not be forgotten overnight , and the false promise of a quick and easy solution to the desire for security have been increasingly exposed as such .
Many US soldiers and relatives had the impression that taking Baghdad would be the soldiers ' ticket home .
But as early as July 2003 , Julian Borger noted of the home - base of the US's Third Infantry Division in the state of Georgia , " Hinesville feels the pain of a war that is refusing to end as neatly as was advertised . "
In relation to Iraq , the warmongers ' plan ( again in line with Arendt 's analysis of totalitarianism ) was that action would serve as the most effective propaganda .
Thus , the late Robin Cook recalled of Blair , " In the many conversations we had in the run-up to the war , he always assumed that the war would end in victory , and that military triumph would silence the critics . "
Prior to the attack on Iraq , Bush 's close adviser Karl Rove proclaimed : " Everything will be measured by results .
The victor is always right .
History ascribes to the victor qualities that may not actually have been there .
And similarly to the defeated . "
Another statement was very similar to Rove's : " The victor will not be asked afterwards whether he told the truth or not .
When starting and waging a war it is not right that matters , but victory . "
That last statement was from Adolf Hitler in 1939 .
Part of the problem , for Bush and Blair , is that relying on ' victory ' to generate legitimacy is clearly a double - edged sword .
Moreover , those who claim that God is on their side may be particularly vulnerable to a loss of popularity and prestige when defeat or stalemate implies that God is more ambivalent .
Meanwhile , although the salesmen of war have shaped and manipulated the debate , dissent can never be stifled completely .
Noam Chomsky has suggested that effective propaganda tends to involve slogans that nobody is going to oppose and that will not encourage people to think .
Thus , ' Support our troops ! ' works well ; ' Support our policy ! ' does not work so well .
The official mantra has been that opposing the ' war on terror ' is disloyal to ' our soldiers ' .
But now we find old slogans neatly subverted , as in this American banner : " Support our troops - - bring them home . "
Take a look at www.freewayblogger.com, and you can see how part of the problem ( the American love affair with the car and the accompanying thirst for oil ) is being turned into part of the solution : those stuck in traffic can now read a range of improvised banners on bridges and roadsides with slogans like " Nobody died when Clinton lied " , " A nation of sheep soon begets a government of wolves " , and " 655,000 Dead Iraqis and I 'm still paying $ 2.69 for unleaded . "
It seems peace , too , can be advertised with skill and ingenuity .
The Swedish diplomat and arms inspector Hans Blix summed up the Iraq debacle well .
Noting that US and UK governments presumably claimed their certainty that weapons existed in order to get endorsement by their legislatures and by the UN Security Council , he added that governments " are not just vendors of merchandise but leaders from whom some sincerity should be asked when they exercise their responsibility for war and peace in the world . "
But sincerity is not top of the salesman 's list of qualities .
Perhaps those who peddle false certainties are half aware that their audience ( like those witnessing a magic trick ) may actually want , at some level , to be fooled : certainly , any feeling of temporary reassurance would depend on this mechanism .
In any event , the shrewd vendor seems to know something that many of us do not : his products will not bring us the promised benefits ; yet if our frustrated desires can be managed successfully , we may want these products all the more for that .

Hidden Functions of the ' War on Terror ' ( Pluto , 2006 ) .
The big story over the weekend involved the arrest of several men involved in an alleged conspiracy to destroy John F. Kennedy Airport in New York by igniting it ’s jet fuel lines .
Now that time has passed and questions can be raised , it ’s not all that clear that this plot ever did , or could , amount to much of anything :
The plot as painted by law enforcement officials was cataclysmic :
A home - grown Islamic terrorist had in mind detonating fuel storage tanks and pipelines and setting fire to Kennedy International Airport , not to mention a substantial swath of Queens .
â€ œHad the plot been carried out , it could have resulted in unfathomable damage , deaths and destruction , â€  Roslynn R. Mauskopf , the United States attorney in Brooklyn , said in a news release that announced charges against four men .
She added at a news conference , â€ œThe devastation that would be caused had this plot succeeded are just unthinkable .â€ Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly then stepped to the lectern with a vision only a bit less grim .
â€ œOnce again , would - be terrorists have put New York City in their crosshairs , â€ he said .
Mr. Kelly said a disaster had been averted .
Or has it ?
There ’s no question , it would seem , that these guys has plotted to try to do something .
But , the rhetoric of politicians and prosecutors notwithstanding , it does n’t seem like it was ever anything more than just talk :
At its heart was a 63 - year - old retired airport cargo worker , Russell M. Defreitas , who the complaint says talked of his dreams of inflicting massive harm , but who appeared to possess little money , uncertain training and no known background in planning a terror attack .
â€ œCapability low , intent very high , â€ a law enforcement official said of the suspects .
Some law enforcement officials and engineers also dismissed the notion that the planned attack could have resulted in a catastrophic chain reaction ; system safeguards , they said , would have stopped explosions from spreading .
Moreover , much of the Government ’s case seems to revolve around information provided by a suspect in an unrelated drug case who agreed to become a prosecution witness and provide information about Defrietas and others involved in the alleged conspiracy .
Beyond discussions about igniting fuel lines , though , it seems clear that the men involved in this “ plot ” really did n’t know what they were doing : Mr. Defreitas and the informant drove out to the fuel tanks at night , conducting surveillance , and made video recordings of Kennedy Airport and its buildings .
They also â€œlocated satellite photographs of J.F.K. , â€ the complaint states , â€ œand sought expert advice , financing and explosives.â€ 
But the satellite photographs amount to images easily downloaded from Google Earth .
A law enforcement official characterized the surveillance videos as â€œamateurishâ€ ; but he added that the material offered enough detail , taken together with the Google images , to at least help with planning .
The complaint also states that the men discussed â€œescape routesâ€ through local roads and highways .
Many of the plotâ€™s larger details are left to the imagination .
According to the complaint , one suspect discussed the need to disable an airport control tower , the better to provide cover to destroy the fuel tanks .
Another problem is that none of the suspects appears to have planned or carried out any previous attacks .
That does n’t mean , of course , that they were n’t capable of doing something at JFK .
Along with everything else that ’s come to light since these arrests were announced , though , it does lead one to doubt just how imminent this threat actually was .

The symbolism of Chavez 's itinerary will not be lost on Washington
Mr Chavez is expected to visit a helicopter factory and discuss the possible purchase of diesel submarines .
This is Mr Chavez 's second visit in under a year to Russia , which he has designated as a " strategic partner " .
At an international level , he wants to minimise Washington 's influence in the world , especially in Latin America .
President Chavez has a very clear idea of what he wants to achieve .
At home , he is working to set up a socialist republic , but his former goal is proving more difficult than his dream of a socialist revolution .
The US sees Venezuela as a destabilising force in the region , and Mr Chavez knows that if he wants to stand up against the US he needs allies outside of Latin America .
Important symbolism
Mr Chavez has chosen his allies carefully .
Iran has nuclear expertise to offer , while China represents a very attractive market for Venezuelan oil .
Experts say Mr Chavez is seeking a tie - up with the Russian gas giant
Venezuela has bought fighter planes , helicopters and assault rifles from Russia , and could now buy between five and nine diesel submarines .
This would make Venezuela the country with the biggest submarine fleet in Latin America .
But Mr Chavez is also interested in Russia 's oil and gas knowledge .
Venezuela is home to the Orinoco belt , which holds the world 's largest reserves of heavy oil , and talks are already under way between Lukoil - Russia 's biggest oil company - and the state - owned Petroleos de Venezuela .
Mr Chavez also wants to build a gas pipeline from Venezuela to Argentina , and plans to set up an Organisation of Gas Exporting Countries in South America .
All this would be under the technical guidance of Russia 's Gazprom - the world 's largest gas producer .
But perhaps the symbolism of what follows Mr Chavez 's visit is what matters most .
After leaving Russia , he will travel to Belarus and Iran .
At the same time , President Putin will be meeting George W Bush in the US .
Mr Chavez 's visit to Russia and then Iran is unlikely to go unnoticed .

Mr Prodi says no crime can justify one person killing another
The leader of the current centre - left coalition has said no crime can justify one person killing another .
Politicians from both the left and right have been expressing disgust at the execution of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
Italy took one of the 10 non-permanent Security Council seats this week .
The Italian ambassador to the UN has already called on the General Assembly to re-examine a document presented for debate last month .
Outcry
Italy presented proposals for a moratorium on the death penalty at the UN assembly in 1994 and again in 1995 .
Last July the Italian parliament approved a cross-party motion urging the government to table yet another moratorium proposal but this came to nothing because of disagreement among Italy 's EU partners .
Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been among the politicians expressing disgust at the hanging of Saddam Hussein , calling it a political and historic error .
The outcry has also been reflected by almost universal condemnation in the Italian press of the press leaks and videos of the hanging .
The semi-official Vatican daily , L'Osservatore Romano , said the transformation of the final moments of Saddam Hussein 's life into a public spectacle was a violation of a fundamental human right .
The Iraqi government has said that Italy has no right to criticise Saddam Hussein 's execution when , at the end of World War II , the fascist dictator , Benito Mussolini , was killed by partisans and left hanging by his feet in a Milan square to the derision of crowds .
Mussolini 's granddaughter , Alessandra , a right - wing MP , joined in the argument , saying she found the killing of Saddam Hussein disgusting and shameful .
Sex Tips For Geeks : The Art of the Pickup
The first , most important thing for you to know is this ; women can smell fear -- and they run away from it .
When you 're trying to pick up a girl , whether it's for a one - night stand or because you think she might be the love of your life , the most powerful thing you can do is to be unafraid of either failure or success .
The flip side of this is that self - confidence is your best friend .
As we discussed in How To Be Sexy , women can smell self - confidence too -- and they go for it like cats for catnip .
It does n't much matter exactly why you 're self - confident ; it could be because you 're an alpha male in some hierarchy , or it could be because you 've encountered the woman in a setting where you are functioning at your best and you know it , or it could even be because you just took the right recreational drugs .
" But Eric , " I hear you ask , " I 'm a beta male , and I 'm standing around at some stupid party , and I am neither tipsy nor stoned .
How do I become self - confident enough not to smell of fear ? "
I can answer in two words : fake it .
I realize that this goes against all the standard advice you get from the usual well - meaning people , who will begin and end with " be yourself " .
If yourself is chronically inept with attractive women , this advice sucks .
You need to learn method acting .
At that party , watch guys who are chatting up women effectively .
Imitate them .
Do n't worry too hard about replicating their mental states or understanding why they do what they do ; if you do their moves understanding will happen naturally over time .
Play the role of confident person until you become it .
You are going to crash and burn a few times as you work this .
Cope with it , and learn from your mistakes .
It 's like programming or any other skill ; you get better with practice .
And you need to practice , in situations where the stakes are low .
If you tried to learn programming by thinking about it a lot , but not actually trying it until success was a life - or - death issue , chances are you 'd never get any good at it .
There are a couple of things you can do to keep the stakes low and make the learning process less harrowing .
One is to not automatically zero in on the hot chicks who make your pulse pound .
Try your method acting out on women who look moderately attractive but do n't send you into instant and total sexual panic ; you 're much less likely to freeze up that way .
Another is to chat up women for your friends .
If you notice your buddy staring tongue - tied and longingly at that foxy redhead in the bolero , walk over to her , smile conspiratorially and tell her he'd like to meet her .
You 'll find it amazing how much easier talking to an attractive woman gets when your own ego is n't on the line .
OK , so what are the successful moves to imitate ?
There are a couple of basics every guy should know .
You want to take on the body language of relaxation and confidence -- so speak softly , and move gracefully and deliberately .
Use the lower end of your normal vocal range ; high notes come from a tense throat .
Make eye contact .
Ideally , look at her as though the two of you are sharing a private joke .
Hold the contact long enough to give her time to respond .
Watch for pupillary dilation ; if they get wider when she looks back at you , you 're winning .
Conversely , if her pupils shrink you are probably better off looking elsewhere .
Unlike most body language , these are involuntary responses and cannot be faked .
To be sexy , let your sexual interest show in a quiet , controlled way .
Women really go for men who appreciate them without being overly needy or uptight or conflicted or hesitant about it .
Some men have this down well enough that they can make eye contact with a woman they 've never met before , smile , say " You 're very pretty . " and make her smile back .
Try this sometime .
The self - confidence required to pull it off is attractive to women -- if you sound sure of yourself when you do it , the response you get may surprise you .
Cathy :
Try this on a stranger in an elevator , if you must , to minimize the fear level .
In picking up women , failure breeds failure .
If , when you meet a woman you like , your first thought is of the times you screwed up similar encounters before , it will show in your body language and she 'll turn off .
Conversely , success breeds success .
If you remember previous successes and behave as though other women have found you attractive , she 'll notice .
Maybe not consciously , but she will notice .
Now let 's say you 've gotten past eye contact the mutual introduction to the point where she 's interested enough to have a conversation with you .
The most important thing is to pay attention .
Calm down .
Listen .
You want her to feel that , at least for the time she chooses to spend talking with you , she is the center of the world and has your undivided attention .
This means not being distracted by other things going on around you ; but more importantly it means not being distracted by the things going on in your own head .
If you 're busy worrying about how you 're doing or whether or not you 're going to score , your attention will fall away from her , and she 'll notice .
Amy : " Yes , listening is good .
But do n't be too shy to talk .
My man hardly said a word to me the first few months we knew each other .
I thought he figured I was a dork !
The truth is that he was too damned shy and geeky to give me anything more than yes or no answers to anything I said .
( Sound like Columbia Internet yet ? )
He finally asked me out .
I did n't leave his apartment for three days following that date .
Get the picture ?
If you talk to us , the worst thing we can do is indicate we are n't interested and you do n't get laid .
On the other hand , you may strike up a conversation and find out she 's had a crush on you for months !
If you do n't talk to us , you can guarantee you wo n't get laid .
Play the statistics ! "
The verbal level of the conversation is significant .
Finding common interests is a good thing .
But body language , kinesics , and instinct are just as ( if not more ) important .
We 're animals .
We mate mostly with hindbrains and glands and bodies , not with our frontal lobes .
Animal awareness helps .
Men who fully understand this seldom lack for female company , even if they 're jerks .
Cathy : " Try to have a smile in your voice -- you want it to radiate relaxation and pleasure .
If that 's too vague , think about the way a good trainer talks to a horse . "
Most simply : you need to establish communication so you can find out what she wants .
Men who assume that every woman wants to be wooed like a prospect for marriage are almost as blind as men who who treat women solely as sex objects .
Sometimes she 'll be looking for romance , sometimes for a simple horny fuck , and often she 'll be after something in between .
The more accurately you zero in on her desire , the more likely you are to get yours .
Cathy : " If you can't find any common interests after a couple of minutes of conversation , maybe you 're talking with the wrong woman . "
Even if you 're both in simple - horny - fuck mode , communication and mutual respect matter a lot .
For one thing , they make the sex better .
For another thing , being the kind of person who respects your partners gets you more partners and keeps them around longer .
Being a decent human being and treating her like a human being is not a distraction or a sacrifice , it 's an investment that pays off .
Among other benefits , you might find that what starts out as a fuck ends up being lovemaking .
The next step is touch .
It 's very easy to touch a woman intimately ( even a woman you 've just met ) if you bear two things in mind .
One is that you must not fear the consequences of touching her ; if you do , that fear will make your touch unpleasant .
The other is that she must at all times feel that she has control of the level of intimacy , so she does n't fear getting involved in something she is n't ready for .
When you reach towards her , whether it's to touch her hand put an arm around her or whatever , ask permission kinesically .
Stop the motion , just short of completion , long enough that she knows she has the option to move away or otherwise refuse the offered intimacy .
Often , the fact of asking such permission will be enough to ensure that you get it .
When you touch her , relax and enjoy it -- moderately .
Do n't cling ; do n't prolong the contact beyond what 's natural for the situation .
At first , the best touches are not sexual but suggest sexual possibility .
For example , if after some conversation she 's standing beside you and returns a smile , you might offer her a light hug around the waist or run a hand lightly down her upper back .
How she responds will tell you a lot .
Amy : " A very good way to tell whether a women is interested ( or , at least , not grossed out ) is whether she touches you .
This does n't mean that she jumps you in the middle of the cubicle farm .
All she really needs to do is in some way make physical contact -- like picking a piece of lint of your shirt .
Conversely , if you brush up against her ( perhaps completely innocently ) , and she pulls away , chances are she 's not interested .
If she does n't react at all , proceed but with caution .
If she strips naked and jumps you in the middle of the cube farm , you 've got other problems entirely ! "
Cathy : " In fact , if she 's interested she is more likely to touch you in subtle ways ( like brushing up against you ) instead of doing something more overt , or actually telling you she 's interested .
Part of this is conditioning - `nice ' girls do n't make the first move !
And part is , on some level , a desire for plausible deniability in case the guy does n't respond .
So she can say ` Well , I did make nice at him but I guess he was n't interested , ' even if the problem is that he was simply unaware how interested she was !
Women have egos , too . "
Once you 've reached the point where you 're both comfortable touching each other in a semi-sexual way , we 're out of the pickup script and into the mating dance proper .

For Cheney , office 's relocation out of executive is nothing new Michael Roston
Published : Sunday June 24 , 2007 Print This Email This
While news of the re-location of the Vice President 's office outside of the executive branch surprised many political observers Thursday , earlier news reports reveal that Dick Cheney and his staff have long maintained that for the purposes of certain laws , the Office of the Vice President is a unique part of the government that is not part of the executive or legislative branches .
In 2005 , the Center for Public Integrity reported that Cheney 's office has considered itself outside the executive branch since 2002 when it argued that it was exempt from disclosing trips taken by its employees paid for by non-federal sources .
" Instead of making disclosures like most of the White House , Cheney 's office since March 2002 has periodically responded to [ Office of Government Ethics ] inquiries by stating that it is not obligated to file such disclosure forms for travel funded by non-federal sources , " wrote Kate Sheppard and Bob Williams .
" The letters were signed by then - Counsel to the Vice President David Addington ...
In the letters to the Office of Government Ethics , Addington writes that the Office of the Vice President is not classified as an agency of the executive branch and is therefore not required to issue reports on travel , lodging and related expenses funded by non-federal sources . "
Tom Fitton of the group Judicial Watch went on to tell the CPI that for Cheney and his staff , " Their view is that the vice president is a constitutional office that is not subject to the laws that others in the executive branch are .
They have been consistent in that . "
Earlier this year , the blog Talking Points Memo also highlighted the Office of the Vice President 's unwillingness to disclose the names of its staff - members in a resource known as the " Plum Book " that is published by the executive branch .
In place of the Vice President 's staff , the Office published an entry outlining Addington 's constitutional argument .
" The Vice Presidency is a unique office that is neither a part of the executive branch nor a part of the legislative branch , but is attached by the Constitution to the latter .
The Vice Presidency performs functions in both the legislative branch ( see article I , section 3 of the Constitution ) and in the executive branch ( see article II , and amendments XII and XXV , of the Constitution , and section 106 of title 3 of the United States Code ) , " the section noted .
TPM contributor David Kurtz remarked at the time , " I 've gone from being open to the idea of an Imperial Vice Presidency to being convinced that historians will debate whether something approaching a Cheney - led coup d'etat has occurred , in which some of the powers of the Executive were extra-constitutionally usurped by the Office of the Vice President . "
While criticism mounted regarding the argument offered by Cheney 's office , the White House deflected expressed concerns , saying that the story was not a newsworthy subject .
" This is an interesting constitutional question that legal scholars can debate ... the Vice President has a unique role in our United States government , " said Dana Perino Friday afternoon at the White House .
She went on to say that Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , had no standing to investigate the compliance of the Vice President 's office with the activities of the Internal Security Oversight Office .
" The executive order is enforced solely by the President of the United States .
I think this is a little bit of a non-issue , " she added .
The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington instead suggested that a counterpart office in the Senate should probe the Vice President 's office 's activity with regard to classification and declassification of government documents , if Cheney 's argument that his office is part of the legislative branch is to be believed .
" By claiming the Office of the Vice President is within the legislative branch does Mr. Cheney agree that he is subject to Senate security procedures ? " asked Melanie Sloan , the group 's executive director , in a Friday release .
" To safeguard sensitive information , in 1987 the Senate created the Office of Senate Security , which is part of the Secretary of the Senate .
The Security Office 's standards , procedures and requirements are set out in the Senate Security Manual , which is binding on all employees of the Senate . "
The office of Senator Harry Reid , Democratic Majority Leader , did not respond to RAW STORY 's inquiries of whether it would call on the Office of Senate Security to look into whether it had oversight on the Office of the Vice President 's activities
As far as constitutional debate goes , founding father Alexander Hamilton opined on the need for an ' extraordinary person ' to be elected Vice President in no. 68 of the Federalist Papers .
Hamilton made clear in the March 1788 essay , signed by ' Publius , ' that there were distinctly separate legislative and executive branch responsibilities for the Vice President .
The appointment of an extraordinary person , as Vice - President , has been objected to as superfluous , if not mischievous .
It has been alleged , that it would have been preferable to have authorized the Senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that description .
But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect .
One is , that to secure at all times the possibility of a definite resolution of the body , it is necessary that the President should have only a casting vote .
And to take the senator of any State from his seat as senator , to place him in that of President of the Senate , would be to exchange , in regard to the State from which he came , a constant for a contingent vote .
The other consideration is , that as the Vice - President may occasionally become a substitute for the President , in the supreme executive magistracy , all the reasons which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one , apply with great if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other .
It is remarkable that in this , as in most other instances , the objection which is made would lie against the constitution of this State .
We have a Lieutenant - Governor , chosen by the people at large , who presides in the Senate , and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor , in casualties similar to those which would authorize the Vice - President to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the President , " Hamilton wrote in March 1788 With research assistance from Muriel Kane .

Dimension : Type Arithmetic and Physical Units in Haskell June 3 , 2007
One of Haskell ’s most outstanding features is it ’s type - checker .
Mis -matching types are a quick indication that something is wrong with a particular piece of code .
And type annotations are useful documentation tool that provides hints about the uses of a function .
Type checking is however not unique to programming languages .
There is a similar concept in Physics : Units .
Some programming languages , such as Mathematica provide built - in unit-checking .
The Haskell language lends itself to this purpose very nicely , due to it ’s type - checking system .
As opposed to Mathematica , this can be done without changes to the core language itself .
This post will start out by introducing simple type arithmetic using Peano numerals and progresses to implementing a full unit checker on top of the Haskell language .
The post is also available as a literate Haskell module .
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler ( GHC ) is used , as we will require the use of the - fglasgow - exts and - fallow - undecidable - instances extensions .
> {-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts #-} > {-# OPTIONS - fallow - undecidable - instances #-} > module Scientific .
Dimensions where
Arithmetic in the type - checker
In our unit - checking code , we will need the ability to add and subtract numbers in the type system .
The numbers themselves are represented using Peano numerals .
Positive Peano numerals are composed of two parts : Succ and Zero .
In Haskell , their definition would look like this :
> -- Peano numerals > data Zero = Zero deriving ( Eq , Show ) > data Succ n = Succ n deriving ( Eq , Show )
Where Zero represents the number “ 0 ” , and Succ is the “ successor ” of a number .
For example , the type ‘ Succ Zero ’ is “ 1 ” , and ‘ Succ ( Succ ( Succ Zero ) ) ’ is the number “ 3 ” .
To add two numbers , we create a Haskell type class .
> class Add a b c | a b -> c where > add :: a -> b -> c
In the above class definition , the type variables ‘ a’ and ‘ b ’ are the inputs to the calculation , and ‘ c ’ is the resulting output type .
The “ a b -> c ” part tells the type - checker that the type - variable ‘ c ’ can be determined by knowing ‘ a ’ and ‘ b ’ .
In other words , a and b “ determine ” c .
This means that for every possible case of ‘ a ’ and ‘ b ’ , we will have to specify the resulting ‘ c ’ .
Here ’s our first case :
> --
Adding any number to Zero returns that number > instance Add num Zero num where > add num Zero = num
Then , we need to cover the reverse condition : adding Zero to a positive number .
We only accept positive numbers here , since the case of adding Zero to Zero is already covered by the previous case .
> -- Adding Zero to a positive number returns that number > instance Add Zero ( Succ a ) ( Succ a ) where > add Zero ( Succ a ) = Succ a
Now , we need to cover the slightly more complicated case of adding any two positive numbers .
This is done recursively : Given the positive numbers ‘ Succ a’ and ‘ Succ b’ , we first calculate ‘c = a + b’ , and then return ‘c + 2 ’ .
Note that ‘ a ’ is equal to ‘ Succ a’ minus one , and that ‘c + 2 ’ is the same as ‘ Succ ( Succ c ) ’ .
> --
Adding two positive numbers ' Succ a ' and ' Succ b ' returns ' Succ ( Succ ( a + b ) ) ' > instance Add a b c => --
This means : c = a + b > Add ( Succ a ) ( Succ b ) ( Succ ( Succ c ) ) where > add ( Succ a ) ( Succ b ) = Succ ( Succ c ) > where c = add a b
In the above instance declaration , everything before the ‘= >’ symbol is a precondition .
Since we calculate ‘c = add a b’ , we need to make sure that addition is defined on ‘ a ’ and ‘ b ’ with result - type ‘ c ’ .
This is the reason for the pre-condition .
In our unit - checking code , we will also need negative numbers .
They are defined using ‘ Prec’ , where ‘ Prec ’ stands for “ preceding ” .
For example , ‘ Prec ( Prec Zero ) ’ represents the number “ - 2 ” .
> -- Negative Peano numerals > data Prec n = Prec n
Of course , we will have to extend our definition of ‘ Add ’ to include negative numbers .
The new instance declarations are very similar to the ones for positive numbers .
> -- adding Zero to a negative number returns that number > instance Add Zero ( Prec a ) ( Prec a ) where > add Zero ( Prec a ) = Prec a
> --
Adding negative numbers ' Prec a ' and ' Prec b ' returns ' Prec ( Prec ( a + b ) ) ' > instance Add a b c => >
Add ( Prec a ) ( Prec b ) ( Prec ( Prec c ) ) where > add ( Prec a ) ( Prec b ) = Prec ( Prec c ) > where c = add a b
> --
Adding negative number ' Prec a ' to positive number ' Succ b ' returns ' a + b ' > instance Add a b c => >
Add ( Prec a ) ( Succ b ) c where > add ( Prec a ) ( Succ b ) = add a b
> -- Reverse of above > instance Add a b c => >
Add ( Succ a ) ( Prec b ) c where > add ( Succ a ) ( Prec b ) = add a b
That ’s it !
We are now able to add any two numbers .
Let ’s try it out :
> -- 1 = 3 - 2 > one = add ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ Zero ) ) ) ( Prec ( Prec Zero ) )
The type of ‘ one ’ is ‘ Succ Zero ’ .
This is determined at compile - time using our recursive class - definition for ‘ Add ’ .
We will also want to be able to subtract two numbers .
The definition of Sub is almost identical to Add :
> class Sub a b c | a b -> c where > sub :: a -> b -> c
> instance Sub a Zero a where > sub a Zero = a
> instance Sub Zero ( Succ a ) ( Prec a ) where > sub Zero ( Succ a ) = Prec a
> instance Sub Zero ( Prec a ) ( Succ a ) where > sub Zero ( Prec a ) = Succ a
> instance Sub a b c => >
Sub ( Succ a ) ( Prec b ) ( Succ ( Succ c ) ) where > sub ( Succ a ) ( Prec b ) = Succ ( Succ c ) > where c = sub a b
> instance Sub a b c => >
Sub ( Prec a ) ( Succ b ) ( Prec ( Prec c ) ) where > sub ( Prec a ) ( Succ b ) = Prec ( Prec c ) > where c = sub a b
> instance Sub a b c => >
Sub ( Prec a ) ( Prec b ) c where > sub ( Prec a ) ( Prec b ) = sub a b
> instance Sub a b c => >
Sub ( Succ a ) ( Succ b ) c where > sub ( Succ a ) ( Succ b ) = sub a b
Lists in the Type System
We will also need to use lists in our type - checker .
Lists have a very simple definition :
> -- Linked list > data Nil = Nil deriving ( Eq , Show ) > data x ` Cons ` xs = x ` Cons ` xs deriving ( Eq , Show )
Nil is an empty list , and Cons is a pair of types .
A list of an Integer , a String , and a Double is defined like this :
> funkyList :: Int ` Cons ` ( String ` Cons ` ( Double ` Cons ` Nil ) ) > funkyList = 256 ` Cons ` ( " hello world " ` Cons ` ( 3 .
14159 ` Cons ` Nil ) )
Changing the fixity of the Cons type - constructor will allow us to drop the parentheses .
> infixr 6 ` Cons `
Using this definition of lists allows many functions to be implemented in a more type - safe manner than using Haskell lists .
For example , the Prelude functions ‘ head ’ and ‘ tail ’ will fail when passed an empty list .
If head was instead defined using our new definition for lists , the type - checker would ensure at compile - time that no empty lists are passed as arguments .
> safeHead :: x ` Cons ` xs -> x > safeHead ( x ` Cons ` xs ) = x
Running something like ‘ safeHead Nil ’ will result in a type - error .
Implementing functions such as ‘ foldl’ , ‘ map ’ and ‘ concat ’ is left as an exercise to the reader .
( If you ca n’t figure it out , make sure to ask for help at # haskell on irc.freenode.org )
Unit Checking
We are now ready to start start implementing our unit-checker .
Units are represented as a list of numbers that count how much of a certain “ primitive ” unit is contained in our unit .
For example , suppose we use use the SI units Meter , Kilogram and Second as our primitive units :
> -- primitive unit count > data MeterCount = MeterCount deriving ( Eq , Show ) > data KilogramCount = KilogramCount deriving ( Eq , Show ) > data SecondCount = SecondCount deriving ( Eq , Show )
The unit Meter would be defined as having a MeterCount of “ 1 ” , a KilogramCount of “ 0 ” and a SecondCount of “ 0 ” :
> type Meter = ( MeterCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
Recall that ‘ Succ Zero ’ is the Peano numeral representing “ 1 ” .
Similarly , the unit of ‘ meter ^2 * kilogram / second ^3 ’ would be defined as :
> type FunkyUnit = ( MeterCount , Succ ( Succ Zero ) ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Prec ( Prec Zero ) ) > ` Cons ` Nil
Kilograms and Seconds are defined similar to Meters :
> type Kilogram = ( MeterCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
> type Second = ( MeterCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
Unitless values occur quite frequently in physics , so we create a type for them as well :
> type Unitless = ( MeterCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
To multiply two units , we define the Mult class :
> -- multiplies to units > class
Mult a b c | a b -> c , a c -> b , b c -> a where > mult :: a -> b -> c
As with the Add class , ‘ a’ and ‘ b ’ are the two units multiplied together , and ‘ c ’ is the resulting unit .
This time , any two units determine the third .
As with the ‘ Add ’ class , we need to instantiate the ‘ Mult ’ class with every possible input .
> -- multiply empty units > instance Mult Nil Nil Nil where > mult Nil Nil = Nil
> -- multiply units composed of non - empty lists recursively > instance ( Add i j k , Mult r s t ) => >
Mult (( a , i ) ` Cons ` r ) ( ( a , j ) ` Cons ` s ) ( ( a , k ) ` Cons ` t ) where > mult (( a , i ) ` Cons ` r ) ( ( _ , j ) ` Cons ` s ) h1 > > ( a , add i j ) ` Cons ` mult r s
Division of units is very similar to multiplication .
In stead of adding unit -counts , they are subtracted .
> class Div a b c | a b -> c , a c -> b , b c -> a where > divide :: a -> b -> c
> -- divide empty units > instance Div Nil Nil Nil where > divide Nil Nil = Nil
> -- divide units composed of non - empty lists recursively > instance ( Sub i j k , Div r s t ) => > Div ( ( a , i ) ` Cons ` r ) ( ( a , j ) ` Cons ` s ) ( ( a , k ) ` Cons ` t ) where > divide ( ( a , i ) ` Cons ` r ) ( ( _ , j ) ` Cons ` s ) h1 > > ( a , sub i j ) ` Cons ` divide r s
Now , we create a Dimension type : a value - unit pair .
> -- Physical dimension with unit > data value ` Dimension ` unit = value ` Dimension ` unit deriving ( Eq , Show )
We also want ` Dimension` to have lower precedence than `Cons` to eliminate unnecessary parentheses :
> infix 4 ` Dimension `
To make it easy to create physical dimensions , we create constructors for each of our primitive unit types .
> meter :: Fractional x => x -> x ` Dimension ` Meter > meter x = x ` Dimension ` ( MeterCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons` ( KilogramCount , Zero ) > ` Cons` ( SecondCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
> gram :: Fractional x => x -> x ` Dimension ` Kilogram > gram x = ( 0 . 001 * x ) ` Dimension ` ( MeterCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
> second :: Fractional x => x -> x ` Dimension ` Second > second x = x ` Dimension ` ( MeterCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Succ Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
> unitless :: Fractional x => x -> x ` Dimension ` Unitless > unitless x = x ` Dimension ` ( MeterCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( KilogramCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` ( SecondCount , Zero ) > ` Cons ` Nil
For SI units it makes sense to define unit-prefixes ( kilo , cent , milli , etc. ) :
> giga f x = f ( x * 1000000000 ) > mega f x = f ( x * 1000000 ) > kilo f x = f ( x * 1000 ) > deca f x = f ( x * 10 ) > deci f x = f ( x * 0.1 ) > centi f x = f ( x * 0 . 01 ) > milli f x = f ( x * 0 . 001 ) > micro f x = f ( x * 0 . 000001 ) > nano f x = f ( x * 0 . 000000001 )
Using the primitive dimension constructors and prefixes , dimensions are defined like thus :
> mile = meter 1609 .
3 > gravity = kilo gram 9 . 8 .* meter 1 ./ ( second 1 .* second 1 ) > speedOfLight = unitless ( 10 ^ 8 ) .* meter 3 ./ second 1
It would be nice , if we could instantiate the Prelude Num class to define functions such as (+ ) , ( -) and ( * ) for our dimensions .
However , multiplication in the Num class is only allowed on values of equal type .
Thus , we need to define our own addition , subtraction , multiplication and division functions :
> ( a ` Dimension ` b ) .* ( c ` Dimension ` d ) = ( a * c ) ` Dimension ` ( mult b d )
> ( a ` Dimension ` b ) ./ ( c ` Dimension ` d ) = ( a / c ) ` Dimension ` ( divide b d )
For addition and subtraction , we need to additionally make sure that the units of the two arguments are the same :
> (.+ ) :: Num a => ( a ` Dimension ` b ) -> ( a ` Dimension ` b ) -> ( a ` Dimension ` b ) > ( a ` Dimension ` b ) .+ ( c ` Dimension ` _ ) = ( a + c ) ` Dimension ` b
> (.-) :: Num a => ( a ` Dimension ` b ) -> ( a ` Dimension ` b ) -> ( a ` Dimension ` b ) > ( a ` Dimension ` b ) .- ( c ` Dimension ` _ ) = ( a - c ) ` Dimension ` b
However , it does make sense for Unitless dimensions to instantiate Num .
That ’s exactly what unitless dimensions are : numbers without unit .
> instance Num a =>
Num ( a ` Dimension ` Unitless ) where > ( a ` Dimension ` unit ) + ( b ` Dimension ` _ ) = ( a + b ) ` Dimension ` unit > ( a ` Dimension ` unit ) - ( b ` Dimension ` _ ) = ( a - b ) ` Dimension ` unit > ( a ` Dimension ` unit ) * ( b ` Dimension ` _ ) = ( a * b ) ` Dimension ` unit > abs ( a ` Dimension ` unit ) = abs a ` Dimension ` unit > signum ( a ` Dimension ` unit ) = signum a ` Dimension ` unit > fromInteger i = fromInteger i ` Dimension ` unit > where _ ` Dimension ` unit = unitless 1
To use the ( / ) function on Unitless values , we need to instantiate the ‘ Fractional ’ class :
> instance Fractional a => Fractional ( a ` Dimension ` Unitless ) where > ( a ` Dimension ` unit ) / ( b ` Dimension ` _ ) = ( a / b ) ` Dimension ` unit > fromRational r = fromRational r ` Dimension ` unit > where _ ` Dimension ` unit = unitless 1
Conclusion
Unit checking is very useful for Scientific applications , and is now possible in the Haskell language .
Hopefully , this will encourage Haskell ’s use in the Scientific community .

So the first step in Hambrecht ’s plan is to enter big cities where the N.F.L. is n’t .
As Mark Cuban put it to me in an e-mail , “ There are quite a few good - sized non-N.F.L. cities that can support a pro team . ”
So far , the U.F.L. has decided to put teams in Los Angeles , Las Vegas and Mexico City .
( Cuban is considering taking the Las Vegas franchise . )
Each owner will put up $ 30 million , giving him an initial half - interest in the team ; the league will own the other half .
But eventually the fans themselves will become shareholders — because each team is going to sell shares to the public .
Then the owner , the league and the fans will each own a third of every franchise .
Hambrecht and his executives believe that the initial public offerings will raise , on average , another $ 60 million per team , giving it about $ 90 million in working capital .
They also hope that the stock sale will create intense fan loyalty .
“ This is going to be a very accessible league , ” says Daugherty , the C.E.O .
“ Fans will own a piece of the team , and they ’ll get tickets at more affordable prices . ”
Hambrecht expects his owners to be wealthy — and patient — enough to absorb losses for up to five years .
The league will need a television contract , of course , but its existence is not predicated on a megabucks deal , at least not at first .
The U.F.L. is open to making a smaller deal with a cable network like USA , TNT or Comcast ’s Versus network ( the former OLN ) .
One mistake other leagues have made , Hambrecht believes , is counting on an upfront TV deal — and bringing in owners who expect to make money instantly .

One television advantage the U.F.L. will have is Friday night .
Thanks to the 1961 Sports Broadcasting Act , the N.F.L. is prohibited from televising games on most autumn Friday nights .
( The prohibition was meant to protect high - school football . )
Any new league would have televised football all to itself on that evening .
A new league ’s biggest issue , though , is whether it really can approximate the N.F.L. ’s level of play .
As Daugherty puts it , “ If you do n’t put a good product on the field , nothing else matters . ”
When he first signed on , he and Brod immediately began looking into that question — and they came away convinced they could land decent players right away , and very good players eventually .
“ Bill Walsh used to tell me that the last 20 players cut from every team were almost interchangeable with the last 20 players to make the team , ” Hambrecht says .
The new league will hire the best of those last 20 players — along with the best of the Arena players , the Canadian Football League players and so on .
Though the U.F.L. will have a salary cap , it will be able to pay those players more than they are making now .
It wo n’t be able to afford to sign marquee names like Peyton Manning or the biggest stars coming out of college , obviously .
But the U.F.L. will be able to offer most rookies , who are n’t top draft choices , far more money than the N.F.L. would give them .
And since the N.F.L. salary cap has been negotiated with the players ’ union , it ca n’t be unilaterally changed .
Why happiness at work matters for people
When I got my first consulting job I worked very hard .
I was the picture - perfect , traditional IT consultant working many overtime hours in the name of success .
Id moved to a new city for that job , far away from my friends and family , but that was fine : I didnt really have time for anything outside of work .
Basically , my main goal was success at work !
But after a year of this I suddenly realized something : I was successful , certainly , and I made good money .
But I was not happy .
I was in fact feeling lonely and unhappy , because all I ever did was work .
I thought about that for a while , and I decided to change my life and to always work in a way that would make me happy .
I cut back on work and started spending time exercising and making friends in my new hometown .
Over the course of a year , my life transformed completely .
Before my evenings consisted of the drive home from work , some fast food and lots of TV .
Now I had new friends , interesting hobbies and I was in the best shape of my life from all that exercise .
I also lost that extra 20 pound consultant - belly I ’d been slowly amassing :o )
Think about it :
You will spend more of your adult life on your job than on anything else , except possibly sleep .
Your work will take up more of your time than your family , friends and hobbies combined .
Wont it be nicer if that time is spent at a job that actually makes you happy ?
All through the industrial age there has been this sense , that work is hard and unpleasant – that ’s why we get paid to do it .
This is expressed most clearly in Max Weber ’s biblically based work “ The protestant work ethic ” , which was used by protestant preachers to preach that hard labor was good for people , good for Christian society and a salve for original sin .
Traditional Judeo- Christian beliefs state that sometime after the dawn of creation , man was placed in the Garden of Eden “ to work it and take care of it ” ( NIV , 1973 , Genesis 2:15 ) .
What was likely an ideal work situation was disrupted when sin entered the world and humans were ejected from the Garden .
Genesis 3:19 described the human plight from that time on .
“ By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground , since from it you were taken ; for dust you are and to dust you will return ” ( NIV , 1973 ) .
Rose stated that the Hebrew belief system viewed work as a “ curse devised by God explicitly to punish the disobedience and ingratitude of Adam and Eve ” ( 1985 , p. 28 ) .
Numerous scriptures from the Old Testament in fact supported work , not from the stance that there was any joy in it , but from the premise that it was necessary to prevent poverty and destitution ( NIV ; 1973 ; Proverbs 10:14 , Proverbs 13:4 , Proverbs 14:23 , Proverbs 20:13 , Ecclesiastes 9:10 ) .
The Greeks , like the Hebrews , also regarded work as a curse ( Maywood , 1982 ) .
According to Tilgher ( 1930 ) , the Greek word for work was ponos , taken from the Latin poena , which meant sorrow .
Manual labor was for slaves .
The cultural norms allowed free men to pursue warfare , large - scale commerce , and the arts , especially architecture or sculpture .

In short : life is hell ( or “ nasty , brutish and short ” as Hobbes put it ) , therefore work is hell but we must endure it because we ’re all sinners , but do n’t worry we ’ll get our reward ( and / or punishment ) once we ’re dead .
Maybe it ’s time to put that particular view of work behind us .
Richard Reeves had this to say in his excellent book Happy Mondays :
Anybody who thinks work should be miserable simply because it is work or that there should be a cordon sannitaire between work  and life needs to find a time machine , key in the year 1543 , and go and join Calvins crew .
Theyll feel more at home there .
In the meantime , the rest of us will get on with enjoying our work , and our workplaces .
Patricia ’s story shows that being happy or unhappy at work also spills over to your private life .
Some people have the ability to have a lousy day at work and to then go home and be happy as if nothing has happened .
Most people can’t do this , I certainly can’t .
When I have a bad day at work , it tends to also affect the rest of my day .
Patricia ’s story also shows how easy it is to accept a job that makes you unhappy , because the way it changes you can sneak up on you very gradually .
Think about it – did you use to be happy , outgoing and energetic , and lost that somewhere ?
The explanation could be found at work , and many people find that having a job that makes them happy gives them energy and zest for life .
Identity
Work is fast replacing religion in providing meaning in peoples lives .
Work has become how we define ourselves , it is now answering the traditional religious questions :
Who am I ?
How do I find meaning and purpose ?
Work is no longer just about economics ; its about identity .
– Benjamin Hunnicutt , historian and professor at the University of Iowa at Iowa City
Just 50 years ago people had many sources of identity : Religion , class , nationality , political affiliation , family roots , geographical and cultural origins and more .
Today many of these , if not all , have been subsumed by work .
When you meet someone at a party , what ’s the first question you ’re typically asked ?
“ So , what do you do ? ”
We are increasingly defined by our work .
It ’s what takes up most of our time .
It ’s where we get to employ most of our talents .
It ’s where we experience our greatest triumphs and failures .
It ’s also the basis for our standard of living .
All of this means that when work is not working for us , we become very vulnerable , and that being happy at work becomes crucial !
Health – mental and physical
Being unhappy at work can make you sick and being happy at work can make you healthier .
This sounds like an unlikely claim at first , but it ’s perfectly true .
Lancaster University and Manchester Business School performed a study in 2005 involving 250,000 employees which found that low happiness at work is a risk factor for mental health problems , including emotional burn - out , low self - esteem , anxiety and depression .
The report warned that just a small drop in job satisfaction could lead to burnout of “ considerable clinical importance ” .
Mental stress symptoms like the ones found in the study also increase the risk of physical health problems including ulcers , heart problems and a generally weakened immune system .
Martin Seligman found the same thing in his positive psychology studies , in which he concluded that optimists are healthier and live longer than pessimists .
So not only are people who ’re happy at work happier – they ’re also healthier .
Success – at what cost
A business coach who often coaches top executives told me this tale :
It happens quite often that when I coach top leaders , they end up realizing that while they have indeed achieved all the outward signs of success , they ’re just not happy at work or in life .
They have the corner office , company Mercedes , million dollar salary and stock options .
But ask the right questions , and it turns out that many of them are lonely and lost .
Their work brings them no joy , it holds no meaning and creates no positive , lasting relationships .
It also takes up all their time and keeps them away from their family and friends .
One well - known top leader broke down crying over the realization , that most of his work life had been wasted on chasing money and power .
Soon after , he quit his job and is now doing work he enjoys – at 1/10 the pay .
This begs the question :
What is success worth , if it does n’t make you happy ?
The Dalai Lama once said :
I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness .
That is clear .
Whether one believes in religion or not , whether one believes in this religion or that religion , we all are seeking something better in life .
So I think the very motion of our life is towards happiness …
He was talking about happiness in life , but the point applies equally at work , and I believe that we are seeing a new approach to work emerge .
Where previously work was something we did to earn a living , in the future the point of going to work , is to be happy .
The happy are successful
So should you just be happy and forget about succes ?
This is where it gets interesting :
In december of 2005 a group of researchers published the results of a meta -study .
A meta-study is a study that combines the result of a lot of other studies done in a specific field , and this meta-study combined 225 studies in happines that had examined the lives of 225.000 people .
The researchers concluded that while sucess does make you happier , there is an even stronger correlation in the opposite direction , ie .
that happiness will make you succesful .
The study also found that happy people are more optimistic , outgoing , likeable , motivated and energetic – all essential qualities for business success .
This means that we do n’t have to sacrifice happiness for the sake of success – a depressingly common assumption today .
In fact , the opposite is true :
The happier you are , the more succesfful you ’re likely to be .

May 31 , 2007  --
High school valedictorian Shannon Spaulding never expected her graduation speech to create such debate .
But the blond honors student , who graduated at the top of her 383 - member class at Wolfson High in Jacksonville , Fla. , gave a valedictory speech that some said sounded more like a sermon .
For nearly 20 minutes , Spaulding quoted the Bible and spoke about Jesus Christ , suggesting that those who did n't believe would go to hell .
" I want to tell you that Jesus Christ can give you eternal life in heaven , " Spaulding said .
" If we die with that sin on our souls , we will immediately be pulled down to hell to pay the eternal price for our sins ourselves . "
" I guess I do n't totally understand why it 's such a big deal , " she said .
At many points during her address , the crowd offered enthusiastic applause .
But a handful of parents , as well as some civil liberties groups , have cried foul .
" If you are Jewish and you hear this and are told to convert or die , you might get upset by that , " said the Rev. Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State .
The Duval County schools superintendent , Joseph Wise , issued an immediate apology , saying , " On behalf of the Duval County Public Schools and Wolfson High School , I deeply regret that the student exercised her time in her valedictorian speech in a manner that was offensive and insensitive to some .
I applaud the principal , faculty , staff and graduates in their efforts to quickly return the ceremony to its intended and dignified purposes as soon as the speech was completed . "
Was Shannon Spaulding exercising her right to free speech ?
Or did her valedictory address violate the civil rights of others ?
Legal experts say that all depends on whether school officials had read and approved her speech .
" If the school retains the authority to review the message , then it becomes the school 's message , " said Randall C. Marshall , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida .
He adds , " If what the district has done is allowed unrestricted student - led messages , then it 's constitutionally permissible under the law .
It would have been equally as permissible for a student to launch into a 20 - minute diatribe about how terrible the school system is , or comment on just about anything else . "
The courts have ruled in a number of such cases .
In one , Nicholas Lassonde vs. the Pleasanton [ Calif . ]
Unified School District , a high school salutatorian who wanted to include what were considered " proselytizing " comments in his graduation address claimed the school violated his freedoms of religion and speech by editing his message .
A California appellate court found in favor of the school district , saying it had the power to edit the student 's comments .
Before Lassonde 's graduation , which took place before the court 's ruling , the student and school reached a compromise , and he was permitted to speak about his faith and what it meant to him , but passages aimed at swaying the crowd 's religious beliefs were omitted .
He was also allowed to distribute an unedited text version of his speech just outside the site where the graduation ceremony was held .
" Occasional or brief reference to the role religion has played in the life of the student is permissible , according to the law .
But to turn the opportunity for a student address into a sermon is inappropriate at a public school graduation , " said Lynn .
In Shannon Spaulding 's case , school officials said they had asked to review the text of her speech , but because Spaulding was in the midst of final exams , she did n't finish writing it in time .
ABCNEWS.com obtained an internal memo from a member of the superintendent 's executive staff , which called the speech " wholly inappropriate " and claimed that Spaulding purposely concealed the contents of her speech and " played the adults who had trusted her to behave responsibly , and she betrayed that trust . "
Shannon Spaulding , however , tells a different story .
She said administrators failed to provide any guidelines about the length or content of her speech , and never pressured her to provide a copy .
" They knew I was busy trying to get everything else ready , so they just said , ' Do n't worry about it . '
They knew I would get it done , " she said .
" I can't say I 'm sorry for the message I shared .
I 'm sorry if people were offended , but I still believe in what I said . "
" It was not seen by any administration officials , " said Duval County schools spokeswoman Mary Anne Christensen .
" She had such a great record academically , so the fact that no one had seen her speech did n't raise any red flags . "
At this point , Christensen said there is no mandatory policy in place for reviewing valedictory speeches .
" If you 're asking whether or not there should be one , " she said , " that is currently being reviewed . "

A 17 - year - old girl has been stoned to death in Iraq because she loved a teenage boy of the wrong religion .
As a horrifying video of the stoning went out on the Internet , the British arm of Amnesty International condemned the death of Du’a Khalil Aswad as " an abhorrent murder " and demanded that her killers be brought to justice .
Reports from Iraq said a local security force witnessed the incident , but did nothing to try to stop it .
Now her boyfriend is in hiding in fear for his life .
Miss Aswad , a member of a minority Kurdish religious group called Yezidi , was condemned to death as an " honour killing " by other men in her family and hardline religious leaders because of her relationship with the Sunni Muslim boy .
Scroll down for more ...
They said she had shamed herself and her family when she failed to return home one night .
Some reports suggested she had converted to Islam to be closer to her boyfriend .
Miss Aswad had taken shelter in the house of a Yezidi tribal leader in Bashika , a predominantly Kurdish town near the northern capital , Mosul .
A large crowd watched as eight or nine men stormed the house and dragged Miss Aswad into the street .
There they hurled stones at her for half an hour until she was dead .
The stoning happened last month , but only came to light yesterday with the release of the Internet video .
It is feared her death has already triggered a retaliatory attack .
Last week 23 Yezidi workmen were forced off a bus travelling from Mosulto Bashika by a group of Sunni gunmen and summarily shot dead .
An Amnesty International spokesman in London said they receive frequent reports of honour crimes from Iraq – particularly in the predominantly Kurdish north .
Most victims are women and girls who are considered by male relatives to have shamed their families by immoral behaviour .
Kurdish authorities have introduced reforms outlawing honour killings , but have failed to investigate them or prosecute suspects , added the Amnesty spokesman .
Kate Allen , the organisation ’s UK director , said : " This young girl ’s murder is truly abhorrent and her killers must be brought to justice .
" Unless the authorities respond vigorously to this and any other reports of crimes in the name of ' honour ' , we must fear for the future of women in Iraq . "
Abstract
In a long - running ruby process with a highly dynamic object - space , we encountered performance degradation and finally memory - allocation failure due to heap fragmentation .
The problem can be mitigated by linking ruby against ptmalloc3 .
Hi all !
I ’m writing this mail in the hope that my experiences may point you in the right direction , if you ever encounter a similar problem .
Naturally I would be delighted to read your comments and advice on my conclusions and the steps taken .
http://ch.oddb.org [ 1 ] provides information on the swiss health - care market .
Behind an Apache / mod-ruby setup lies a single ruby - process , which acts as a DRb - Server .
Predating Ruby on Rails , the application is based on self - baked libraries [ 2 - 4 ] .
A couple of weeks ago we experienced a spike in user requests .
Although the application seemed to scale well most of the time , we began experiencing outages after a couple of hours .
Whenever that happened , CPU - Load rose to 100 % and DRb - Requests were hanging , sometimes for several minutes .
At the same time , memory usage started rising considerably .
If left to run for enough time , the application would crash with a NoMemoryError : ‘ Failed to allocate Memory ’ – even though there was still plenty of Memory available in the system .
Thanks to Jamis Buck [ 5 ] and Mauricio Fernandez [ 6 ]
I was able to determine that the application was stuck for several seconds in glibc ’s realloc , which may be called ( via ruby_xrealloc ) from basically anywhere within ruby where a new or enlarged chunk of memory might be required .
Having stated the diagnosis : heap fragmentation [ 7 ] , there were a couple of things I could try to improve the performance of our application , all revolving around the principle of creating fewer objects , and in particular fewer Strings , Arrays and Hashes .
By eliminating a number of obvious suspects ( mainly to do with the on - demand sorting of values stored in a large Hash ) , I was able to raise the life - expectancy of our application considerably – close , but no cigar .
And then – all praise bugzilla – I found a bugreport [ 8 ] describing almost exactly my problems and leading me to ptmalloc3 [ 9 ] .
Glibc ’s malloc implementation is based on ptmalloc2 , and may be replaced by simply linking ruby against ptmalloc3 .
As far as I understand , ptmalloc3 does not eliminate heap fragmentation .
However , due to the bit - wise tree employed in the newer version , it finds free chunks of the right size in shorter time by several orders of magnitude .
Additionally , it seems that glibc 2.5 abandons its attempts to find a best - fit chunk after a while ( possibly after 10000 tries ) , instead expanding the heap as long as possible and finally failing to allocate memory – causing first the fast rise in memory usage and later the observed NoMemoryError .
At this time , http://ch.oddb.org has run – powered by ruby and ptmalloc3 – for a little more than 24 hours without displaying any of the signs I have come to associate with heap fragmentation .
Significantly less time is spent in allocating memory – and consequently in GC , and the overall memory - footprint has decreased by about 30 % .
I hope this is of use – thanks in advance for any thoughts you want to share .

June 20 , 2007  -- Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton was booed this morning by some attendees at the liberal Take Back America conference for blaming failure in Iraq on the Iraqi government .
" The American military has succeeded .
It is the Iraqi government , which has failed to make the tough decisions that are important for their own people , " the New York senator said from the podium , earning jeers from some members of the audience .
" I love coming here every year , " said Clinton .
" I see the signs , " she added , referring to the " Lead Us Out of Iraq " signs which were being held up by members of the antiwar group Code Pink .
Clinton sought to appease the members of the audience who were dissatisfied with her Iraq comments by pointing to her work with Sen.
Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , to make Oct. 11 , 2007 , an expiration date for the Iraq war authorization .
Congress authorized the use of force in Iraq in 2002 with Clinton 's support .
" The point of our proposal is very simple , " said Clinton , " to end the president 's authority on the war and to force him to seek new authority .
He thinks he can get any kind of authority through the Congress .
I think that he is mistaken . "
She said the purpose of the measure was to " strip " President Bush 's war effort of " legitimacy . "
Jodie Evans , Code Pink 's co-founder , told ABC News that she was outraged by what she saw as Clinton 's finger - pointing .
" She does n't understand that what we 've done to Iraq is what we 've done to Iraq and Iraq is not liable for it or responsible in any way , " said Evans .
" She has a long way to go to gain our trust , a very long way to go . "
Dana Eller , another conference attendee , was generally pleased by Clinton 's presentation , but remains disappointed that Clinton has not referred to her 2002 war vote as a mistake .
" She has n't actually come out and said ' I was wrong . ' "
Eller remarked .
" I need that , and without that I will not give her my support . "
The Take Back America conference is the same gathering of progressive activists who booed Clinton 's Iraq position in 2006 .
Last year , she was heckled for speaking out against a " date certain " for troop withdrawal .
Since then she has come out in favor of a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops , going as far as voting against a war funding bill last month .
That bill did not include such a timetable .
Where Clinton Earned Cheers
Clinton was heckled by some , but not all , at the conference .
Many in attendance cheered her hard - hitting speech , which set forth what she called a " new progressive vision for the 21st century . "
The speech touched on a range of issues including stem cell research , equal pay , income inequality , universal health care and making college more affordable .
Clinton Supports On - Going U.S. Role In Iraq
One Iraq policy topic that Clinton did not broach in front of the audience of progressive activists was the four - pronged continuing mission that she sees for U.S. forces in Iraq even after the timetable for the withdrawal of combat troops has come and gone .
While participating in a Tuesday forum sponsored by the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , Clinton reiterated her support for leaving troops in Iraq after the timetable for troop withdrawal .
She said the troops will help prevent al Qaeda from gaining a staging ground , look after the treatment of the Kurds , guard against the influence of Iran and train Iraqi forces if the Iraqi government " gets its act together . "
Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , a top rival for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination , also envisions residual forces left behind in Iraq .
But , it was Clinton 's support for an ongoing mission in Iraq that drew fire at Tuesday 's conference from New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , another Democrat vying for the 2008 presidential nomination .
ABC News ' Leigh Hartman contributed to this report .
[ Editor 's note : this is the second in an occasional series written by Alan Durning , head of Sightline think - tank in Seattle .
He and his family are living car - free for a year , and he 's writing a series about how they 're faring . ]
When my family decided in March not to replace our Volvo for at least a year , we were mostly thinking about the practical implications .
We were thinking about pollution , of course , but also about dollars and safety and bus routes and walking distances .

His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
What has become evident a few months into this adventure is just how much our cars equate not just to money saved or spent but also to cultural currency .
Even while we 're saving bundles of cold hard cash on gas , insurance and upkeep , hidden costs have emerged in a social barter system that , like much of our culture , is car - centric .
We quickly collided with the face of the car economy : other parents .
Driving gifts
The thing about parenting is that it 's best done in groups , so you can share with others .
This sharing operates largely on the gift economy .
That is , parents do favours for each other .
The most routine favour they give -- the currency of parenting -- is the ride : I give your kid a ride to practice ; you give mine a ride home .
You bring your kid over to play ; I drive her home again .
The swapping of rides is a convenience and a practicality , of course .
But it 's also a form of community building .
In fact , anthropologists regard the reciprocal doing of favours as not just a form of community building but as the essence of community building .
That 's because humans , like other primates , seem to be programmed to honour the norm of reciprocity , which Stanford social psychologist Deb Gruenfeld defines as " a powerful and pervasive social rule that compels us to treat others as they have treated us .
For example , when others have done us a favour , we feel that we ' owe ' them one in return . "
When the bonds of mutual reciprocity are thick and stretch in many directions , you have a strong community -- one that 's high in social capital .
And you 've got the feeling , as a parent , that many hands are there to support you .
People chip in to help you when bad luck strikes , and you do the same for others .
Uh oh
But subtract the car from this equation , and you 're suddenly out of currency for the most basic exchanges .
When we first went carless , for example , Amy and I found that our pre-existing credits -- favours we 'd done over time -- all came rushing to our aid .
Our community aimed to rescue us from carlessness .
One family offered : " Do you want to take our second car for a week or two ? "
One family contemplated giving us an old car they 'd inherited .
Then , after we declined these offers by explaining that we have FlexCar when we need it and that we 're figuring out ways to live without driving much , reactions differed .
Some families have stepped up , hero - like , and insisted on doing all the driving themselves : " You should n't have to pay for a car just to take the kids to rehearsal .
I 'll drive both ways .
I do n't mind . "
But we do n't want to accept favours that we can't reciprocate .
We do n't want to accumulate social debts and feel beholden to others .
And we suspect that such heroism would lead to resentment and withdrawal before long .
Transportation pariahs
Other families -- more of them -- have pulled back , uncertain how to interact with us because we do n't hold the currency .
They become a little shy toward us , a little awkward .
And feeling this way , they often take the path of least resistance , which is to swap rides with someone else instead .
Sadly , that leaves us , and our kids , out of the community .
To guard against heroic over - giving and shy withdrawal , we have been trying to become more assertive about alternative exchanges , bartering child care and other favours for rides when a ride is necessary .
And this assertiveness typically works -- when we can muster the courage to take such social risks .
Despite the ambiguity ( how many hours of child care are worth one ride to a sleepover ? ) , other parents are receptive to other forms of exchange , and these more complicated exchanges build community just as quickly as ride swapping .
Lacking a car , Amy and I have been forced to do more asking and more creative reciprocating .
This necessity has become a virtue : more community , more time with neighbours .
In fact , renegotiating the social side of the car economy , and adapting to life with no cultural car capital , we 've found new -- enjoyable and enriching -- ways to experience and engage with our communities .
We have discovered that without our car , we spend more quality time with our own kids and with groups of their friends because of creative carless favours .
We enjoy more activities that are around the corner rather than across town , which means supporting community businesses and services and keeping our neighbourhood vibrant , bustling and safe .
We now see other parents as more than just mini-van drivers -- we actually interact with them more .
We like this new barter system !
And we 're not the only ones who have noticed the benefits .
One of my wife Amy 's buddies remarked to me , " I love that you do n't have a car .
I see Amy a lot more . "
They get groceries together .
The friend drives ;
Amy buys the lunch .
They both enjoy the outing .
We 're not saying everyone should scrap their car .
But reducing car travel and insisting on complete , compact communities instead of poorly planned sprawl can actually save people time in traffic and can lengthen their lives -- by staving off crashes ( the leading cause of death up to the age of 44 in the Northwest ) ; encouraging regular walking ( reducing obesity ) ; and clearing the air of toxic pollutants .
Our carless experiment has revealed new ways to enjoy our neighbours and strengthen our neighbourhoods .
Rather than losing on the exchange , we are building communities that nurture our kids as they grow up .
At the same time , we 're investing in our kids ' futures .
Beryl , Compiz , And Metisse - The 3D Desktop on Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring
After having included the AIGLX , Xgl and Compiz 3D desktop technologies in Mandriva Linux 2007 , Mandriva has added all the latest 3D desktop updates in Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring , like Metisse and Beryl .
Metisse
Metisse is a pioneering French research project to improve human - computer interfaces .
It is not exactly a 3D desktop , but a windowing environment which makes possible new interactions with windows .
For example , Metisse allows you to reduce considerably the number of required clicks to copy and paste from one window to another : if a window masks an area where a user interacts , Metisse will “ roll ” these windows to make this area visible .
Instead of a 3D cube to represent a virtual desktop , an overview is available , a ' bird 's eye view ' .
All virtual desktops are displayed as if on a table , and this view enables you to switch from one virtual desk to another .
This view allows you to select another window , or move from a desktop to another .
This is a great alternative to the display functionalities available in Compiz .
To use this function press the meta key + d or use the mouse wheel while you press the meta key .
On most keyboards , the meta key is to the Windows key .
Window interactions can be frequent in Metisse , as windows can be distorted in various ways :
You can rotate , resize , make them bigger to zoom in , or duplicate them .
To do these kind of operations , just click the left button on the title bar or on its border , then move the cursor .
Clicking the right button on this area display a summary of the available operations .
Clicking the middle button cancels all transformations .
After the window is transformed you still can work in it !
In a more advanced use of Metisse , the interfaces contained in the windows can also be modified , by creating " façades " .
It is possible to copy buttons and menus to create your own interface : to create a personalized tool palette in image processing software like The GIMP , for example .
To get a clear idea of how this works , check out this video .
Compiz
Compiz is a window manager that uses the 3D acceleration features of your graphics card to apply transformations and effects to the desktop .
The most noticeable feature is the display of virtual desktops as a 3D cube .
As well as so - called ' eye candy ' , Compiz has a lot of features that can improve the efficiency and convenience of desktop use .
Just switch from one virtual desktop to another to see what ' 3D desktop ' really means .
Press Ctrl + Alt+left arrow and Ctrl + Alt + right arrow .
You can rotate the cube freely by holding Ctrl +
Alt , holding down the left mouse button , and moving the mouse .
The ' scale ' functionality ( similar to Apple Mac OS X's ' Exposé ' ) offers a view of all open windows ( by using miniatures ) , to let you switch between several windows while being able to see what is being displayed in each .
It is activated by moving the mouse to the top right - hand corner of the screen , or by pressing Ctrl + Alt .
Compiz also offers a live view of the contents of each window in the application selector ( Alt + Tab ) , instead of a simple static icon .
Beryl
Beryl is a ' fork ' of the Compiz project .
In other words , Beryl is based on Compiz 's code but is now developed and maintained by another development team .
The Compiz and Beryl projects are likely to merge again , and the next Mandriva Linux edition will probably include a unified version of the two projects .
Beryl is very similar to Compiz and has most of the same features , like the 3D cube and the ' scale ' window display .
Where Beryl differs from Compiz is in offering a wide range of plug-ins enabling more features .
For example , there is a Beryl plug - in which displays a window miniature for each window in the task bar when you hover the mouse over that task bar entry .
Moreover , a wider range of configuration tools developed by Beryl community is available .
The beryl - manager applet simplifies 3D desktop management by presenting a convenient menu of tools and settings in the system tray .
You can also find a preferences manager , beryl - settings , which allows you to choose plug-ins and modify each plug - in 's settings .
To make it easier to try out and switch between all these 3D desktop technologies , Mandriva has developed a tool available in the Mandriva Control Center and directly from the login screen .
This tool offers the choice between a Metisse desktop , a ' 3D Cube ' desktop or no 3D desktop .
For expert users , advanced options exist for the ' 3D Cube ' desktop , allowing you to manually choose Compiz or Beryl and set whether the AIGLX or Xgl underlying server technology is used .
This tool can also be launched from the command line to disactivate 3D desktop , useful in case of any problems with the 3D desktop .
To do this , just run the command
drak3d
as root .

Desktop environment adaptation
Recent Compiz and Beryl versions include window decorators for several desktop environments , and thanks to Mandriva configuration tools , you can easily adapt Compiz and Beryl to the desktop you prefer .
Compiz already had the gtk - window - decorator in Mandriva Linux 2007 , enhanced for the GNOME environment , but generic enough to be used in " alternate " environments like Xfce .
In Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring , it includes improved support for Metacity themes ( the default window manager of GNOME ) , which improves integration with the " Ia Ora " desktop theme developed by Mandriva , and means that Compiz will properly respect any window theme you choose manually in GNOME .
In Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring , a new kde - window - decorator is available .
Compiz is now better integrated with the KDE environment , using the KDE window theme ( " Ia Ora " , or your own manual choice ) , and also using KDE default keyboard shortcuts ( like Alt + F2 to display a command prompt ) .
The Beryl project offers a larger range of window decorators .
The Emerald decorator acts as generic window decorator and has its own theme format .
There is even a theme editor to ease the customization of Emerald .
Like Compiz , Beryl also has window decorators adapted to the common desktop environments .
Heliodor is a GTK + window decorator which re-uses the Metacity themes , like gtk - window - decorator .
Aquamarine is a KDE window decorator , and is similar to Compiz 's kde - window - decorator .
The drak3d configuration tool will automatically install window decorator packages adapted to the currently used window manager , in harmony with the desktop environments installed .
For example , if Compiz is selected and KDE is running on the system , the tool will install compiz - decorator - kde .
Advertisement
Mandriva 's Compiz and Beryl packages include compiz - window - decorator and beryl - window - decorator scripts , which offer an abstraction layer for the window decorators : they detect the best decorator to be used , according to the available ones and the current desktop .
For example , in an KDE environment , compiz - window - decorator will launch kde - window - decorator if it is available , and if not , it will fall back on gtk - window - decorator .
Advanced configuration
Mandriva is not only a distribution for beginners .
The Mandriva 3D desktop configuration system was made to be easily modifiable by an experienced user , while also being compatible with the graphical configuration tool .
In the file / etc / sysconfig / compositing - wm , the value {yes|no} of COMPOSITING_WM_START indicates whether a 3D desktop window manager must be launched , and COMPOSITING_WM contains the name of the window manager to launched ( Compiz , Beryl , or metisse - start - fvwm ) .
In the same way , in the /etc / sysconfig / compositing - server file , COMPOSITING_SERVER_START indicates if an additional graphic server should be used , and the variable COMPOSITING_SERVER contains the server name to launch ( Xgl or Xmetisse ) .
Other variables can be modified , like the window decorator ( with COMPOSTING_WINDOW_DECORATOR ) , or the arguments to the windows manager ( COMPOSITING_WM_ARGS ) .
The default values of these variables are in the files /usr / share / compositing - wm / {wm}.defaults ( where {wm} is compiz , beryl or metisse - start - fvwm ) and /usr / share / compositing - server /{server} .
defaults ( where {server} is Xgl or Xmetisse ) .
In Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring , the 3d desktops can also be configured per-user as well as for the whole system , using the files ~/. compositing - wm and ~/.compositing - server ( which work just like the system - wide versions ) .

Some high school seniors may have scoffed at warnings about partying instead of studying this spring .
But nagging counselors and parents turn out to have been right : A senior - year slump can have painful repercussions .
In June and July , elite universities in California and across the country increasingly are revoking admission offers to students whose grades originally were good enough to gain acceptance but whose final exams and transcripts took a dive into Ds or worse .
It ’s a little - known practice , but it can dump as much as 2 % of an incoming class .
For example , UCLA has begun to send out letters informing some students that their “ academic record no longer meets the standards for admission . ”
So the coveted acceptances to the freshman class , celebrated just months ago , are withdrawn .
Gone .
Revoked .
Frittered away .
“ It can be quite traumatic , ” Susan Wilbur , director of undergraduate admissions for the UC system , said of the revocations ’ effect on students and their parents .
The early summer timing is especially hard , she said , because by then the student usually has turned down other admissions offers and has few options left at four - year colleges .
Advertisement
But with so many strong applicants previously rejected at competitive campuses , “ it is absolutely incumbent upon us to uphold the integrity of the process and maintain the high standards , ” Wilbur said .
Universities say they are open to appeals about special circumstances , such as an illness or a divorce that affected grades .
They may forgive an otherwise stellar student who stumbles in one ambitious course .
And some , especially private universities not bound by state entrance formulas , will allow students to repeat courses in summer school , delay admission for a year or admit them on a probationary basis .
Still , the increasing competition at elite schools is making some institutions less tolerant of senioritis and more willing to eject a student who had already sent in an enrollment deposit , said Barmak Nassirian , associate executive director of the American Assn. of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers .
“ Schools are becoming more stern about that than they were in the past , ” he said .

“ If it is a case of [ a student ] deciding that 12th grade was a time for merriment , it is hard to cut those kids some slack in these competitive times , ” he said .
The number of such reversals is not large , but many high schools in Southern California report at least a couple of students worried sick about a final D or F in a required course .
UCLA already has revoked about 25 freshman admissions in recent weeks and expects to withdraw about 90 by midsummer as final high school transcripts arrive for its expected 4,600 freshmen , according to Vu T. Tran , director of undergraduate admissions .
Because application deadlines were in November , grades in senior classes are not used in initial admissions decisions , he said .
Still , students are expected to maintain a B average in their senior year and not to score below a C in any of their major courses , especially the ones required for entrance , Tran said .

UCLA reviews each case individually and may show leeway if the trouble is with just one course and there are mitigating factors , he said .
“ We are not coldhearted , ” he stressed .
But he too spoke about the need “ to be equitable and fair , not only for the students we admitted but also for the ones we denied . ”
San Diego State is taking a tough stance .
Before 1999 , the popular campus allowed admitted students to attend summer school if they earned a D or lower in a high school class required by the Cal State system .
But no more .
Beverly Arata , director of admissions , said she expects to revoke about 2 % of the 5,400 who were planning to enroll as freshmen and redirect them to less - crowded Cal State campuses or community colleges .
“ It would n’t be fair to admit an ineligible student , ” she said .

High school counselors said they often warn students that college acceptances are conditional , based on keeping up their grades .
But the message does not always get through .
Embarrassed about their predicament , most revoked students are reluctant to discuss it .
A graduate of Lancaster High School recalled how he got a D in advanced placement calculus in the fall of his senior year and then dropped the class for the second semester .
As a result , UCLA , his dream school , canceled his acceptance , although UC San Diego , where he just finished his freshman year , did not .
The student , who asked not to be identified , said he is very happy as a biology major at UC San Diego but that he still has some resentment about what happened last spring .
“ I do n’t think that one class should have changed everything , ” he said .

Another graduate of a Los Angeles - area high school recalled a frighteningly close call last year .
Once she was accepted to UC Santa Cruz in April , she slid into senior slackerdom .
She skipped classes , went to the beach and blew off homework .
The June result was an unshakable D in environmental science .
“ That was the class I was least worried about .
It later came around and bit me , ” said the student , who also asked not to be identified .
Her parents were extremely upset , and the young woman recalled “ freaking out . ”
At her counselor ’s advice , she confessed to the university before final transcripts were mailed .
UC officials threatened her with revocation unless she explained her grade better .
She was honest : “ I told them it was my fault , and it was something I would never do again . ”
Because her academic record was otherwise excellent , the campus relented .
UC Santa Cruz officials say that all students whose entrance offer survives such a review are placed on a watch list to monitor their first - year grades .

Now the grateful student , who successfully finished her freshman year , warns friends in high school that “ if you get a case of senioritis , do n’t push it too far . ”
At San Marino High School , revocations are rare but happen about twice a year .
Last year , two students got Ds in senior English and lost their fall spots at Cal Poly Pomona ; they first had to attend community college , said Assistant Principal Mary Johnson .
“ It ’s a heartbreak , ” Johnson said .
“ But in my own opinion , consequences follow actions all too infrequently in some students ’ lives .
And this is the real thing . ”
At Eagle Rock High School in Los Angeles , college counselor Stephen Williams recalled a student two years ago whose acceptance to UCLA was revoked because of a D in advanced placement calculus .

After “ a bunch of mea culpas , ” the student landed at Brandeis University in Massachusetts , a school whose previous acceptance he had turned down .
Another counselor at a school in northern Los Angeles County , who asked not to be identified , said one boy had a 3.8 grade - point average and excellent SAT scores but then became so addicted to video games that he failed a couple of classes this month .
He lost his admission to Cal State Long Beach and plans to attend a two - year school instead .
“ It is major tears , ” the counselor said of such situations .
Private universities say they can be more flexible than state schools .

USC expects to revoke a handful of freshmen out of an expected class of about 2,900 , according to school officials .
“ A lot of students get senioritis , but very few of them die of it , ” said Jerry Lucido , USC ’s vice provost for enrollment policy and management .
Lucido , like other university officials around the country , urges students with late academic troubles to let the colleges know and not to wait until summer transcripts are mailed .
“ It makes a big difference if students self - report , ” he said .
“ We do n’t want to feel we were led astray in the admission process . ”
At the University of Pennsylvania , a private Ivy League institution , Dean of Admissions Lee Stetson said his office looks at final transcripts and is more likely to send a warning about declining high school grades than a revocation .
Such students usually are told they will be closely watched their freshman year .
Some senioritis is understandable , Stetson said .
“ If you ’ve already gotten into the school of your choice , it ’s human nature to let up a little bit .
It ’s only natural .
On the other hand , it ’s the degree , the pattern , that is the issue . ”

Staying in good stead
How to avoid having a college admissions offer revoked , and what do to if a college threatens to do so :
* Remember that an acceptance letter is conditional upon maintaining good grades .
* Be honest on your college applications .
Do not exaggerate the courses you are taking or your grade - point average .
Advertisement
* If you are in trouble in a course , talk to the teacher early about possible tutoring and extra-credit work .
* Let colleges know early if you are likely to receive a D or lower in any major class and if you have dropped a course that you previously indicated you were taking .
* Alert the college admissions office to any potential issue that might cause a grade decline , such as illness , a death in the family or the need to hold down an after - school job .
* Fully scout out potential remedies before it is too late .
Many summer school classes start in June ; do n’t lose your spot .
Be willing to attend a remedial course at college in the fall .

In The Federalist No. 51 , arguably the most important one of all , James Madison wrote in defense of a proposed national constitution that would establish a structure of checks and balances between the different departments  of the government and , as a result , constrain the governments oppression of the public .
In making his argument , Madison penned the following paragraph , which comes close to being a short course in political science :
[ T ]he great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department , consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others .
The provision for defence must in this , as in all other cases , be made commensurate to the danger of attack .
Ambition must be made to counteract ambition .
The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place .
It may be a reflection on human nature , that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government .
But what is government itself , but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ?
If men were angels , no government would be necessary .
If angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary .
In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men , the great difficulty lies in this : you must first enable the government to control the governed ; and in the next place oblige it to control itself .
A dependence on the people is , no doubt , the primary control on the government ; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions .
( [ 1788 ] n.d. , 337 )
The passage that refers to the angels is a rhetorical masterpiece , so memorable that it has become almost a cliché .
In Madisons argument , however , it does more than emphasize that human nature is something less than angelic .
It also serves as a springboard that propels Madison directly into a consideration of framing a government which is to be administered by men over men ,  which is but the greatest of all reflections on human nature . 
In short , it moves Madison directly to a consideration of government as we have known it for the past several thousand years a monopoly operating ultimately by threat or actual use of violence , making rules for and extracting tribute from the residents of the territory it controls .
Henceforth , for clarity , I refer to this all - too - familiar type of organization as  the state . 
Perhaps everyone will agree that if we were all angels , no state would be necessary , and if angels were the governors , they would require neither internal nor external constraints to ensure that they governed justly .
In terms of figure 1 , we would be indifferent between the two cells in the first row .
Figure 1
Madisons Model
No State State Men are angels OK OK Men are not angels Not conceivable Best conceivable
In Madisons mind , the no-state option was inconceivable , for reasons he expressed obliquely when he wrote :  In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker , anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature , where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger ; and as , in the latter state , even the stronger individuals are prompted , by the uncertainty of their condition , to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves ; so , in the former state , will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced , by a like motive , to wish for a government which will protect all parties , the weaker as well as the more powerful  ( [ 1788 ] n.d. , 340 ) .
Thus , Madison , apparently following Locke , believed that individuals would not choose to remain in a stateless condition and would submit to the authority of a state in order to attain greater security of person and property .
Countless other thinkers over the years have reasoned likewise , as Mancur Olson did in his final book when he concluded :  If a population acts to serve its common interest , it will never choose anarchy  ( 2000 , 65 ) .
Disorder , Liberty , and the State
Nothing is more common than the assumption that without a state , a society will fall necessarily and immediately into violent disorder ; indeed , anarchy and chaos are often used as synonyms .
The Random House Dictionary gives the following four definitions for anarchy :
a state of society without government or law political and social disorder due to absence of governmental control .
a theory that regards the absence of all direct or coercive government as a political ideal and that proposes the cooperative and voluntary association of individuals and groups as the principal mode of organized society .
confusion ; chaos ; disorder .
Suppose , however , that the situation described by the third definition were not merely an ideal , but a genuine possibility , perhaps even a historically instantiated condition .
Locke , Madison , Olson , and nearly everybody else , of course , have concluded from their theoretical deliberations that the stateless option cannot existat least , not for long because its deficiencies make it so manifestly inferior to life in a society under a state .
The alleged absence of significant historical examples of large , stateless societies during the past several thousand years buttresses these theory - based conclusions : just as  the poor we have always with us ,  so except among primitive peoples , society and the state are taken to have always coexisted .
One need not spend much time , however , to find theoretical arguments ―some of them worked out in great detail and at considerable length ( for example , Rothbard 1978 , Friedman 1989 ) ―about why and how a stateless society could work successfully .
Moreover , researchers have adduced historical examples of large stateless societies , ranging from the ancient Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley ( Thompson 2006 ) to Somalia during the greater part of the past decade and a half ( Higgs 2004 , 374 , 376 ; Kim 2006 ) .
Given the enormous literature that has accumulated on stateless societies in theory and in actual operation , we may conclude that , if nothing else , such societies are conceivable ( for a far - reaching compendium on the entire subject , see Stringham 2007 ) .
In this light , both cells in the second row of Madisons model must be seen as live options , whose most likely outcomes are , I suggest , as indicated in the More Realistic Model shown in figure 2 :
Figure 2
More Realistic Model
No State State Men are angels OK OK Men are not angels Bad situation Worse situation
Although I admit that the outcome in a stateless society will be bad , because not only are people not angels , but many of them are irredeemably vicious in the extreme , I conjecture that the outcome in a society under a state will be worse , indeed much worse , because , first , the most vicious people in society will tend to gain control of the state ( Hayek 1944 , 134-52 ; Bailey 1988 ; Higgs 2004 , 33 - 56 ) and , second , by virtue of this control over the states powerful engines of death and destruction , they will wreak vastly more harm than they ever could have caused outside the state ( Higgs 2004 , 101-05 ) .
It is unfortunate that some individuals commit crimes , but it is stunningly worse when such criminally inclined individuals wield state powers .
Lest anyone protest that the states true function  or duty  or end is , as Locke , Madison , and countless others have argued , to protect individuals  rights to life , liberty , and property , the evidence of history clearly shows that , as a rule , real states do not behave accordingly .
The idea that states actually function along such lines or that they strive to carry out such a duty or to achieve such an end resides in the realm of wishful thinking .
Although some states in their own self - interest may at some times protect some residents of their territories ( other than the states own functionaries ) , such protection is at best highly unreliable and all too often nothing but a solemn farce .
Moreover , it is invariably mixed with crimes against the very people the state purports to protect , because the state cannot even exist without committing the crimes of extortion and robbery , which states call taxation ( Nock 1939 ) , and as a rule , this existential state crime is but the merest beginning of its assaults on the lives , liberties , and property of its resident population .
In the United States , for example , the state at one time or another during recent decades has confined millions of persons in dreadful steel cages because they had the temerity to engage in the wholly voluntary buying and selling or the mere possession of officially disapproved products .
Compounding these state crimes ( of kidnapping and unjust confinement ) with impudence , state officials brazenly claim credit for their assaults on the victims of their so - called War on Drugs .
State functionaries have yet to explain how their rampant unprovoked crimes comport with the archetype described and justified in Lockes Second Treatise of Government .
In vain do many of us yearn for relief from the states duplicitous cruelty :
Where is the state of nature when we really need it ?
An Application of the Precautionary Principle
In pondering the suitability of the More Realistic Model , we might well apply the precautionary principle , which has been much discussed ( and nearly always misapplied ) in recent years in relation to environmental policy .
This principle holds that if an action or policy might cause great irreparable harm , then , notwithstanding a lack of scientific consensus , those who support the action or policy should shoulder the burden of proof .
In applying this principle to the states establishment and operation , the states supporters would appear to stagger under a burden of proof they cannot support with either logic or evidence .
Everyone can see the immense harm the state causes day in and day out , not to mention its periodic orgies of mass death and destruction .
In the past century alone , states caused hundreds of millions of deaths , not to the combatants on both sides of the many wars they launched , whose casualties loom large enough , but to their own  populations , whom they have chosen to shoot , bomb , shell , hack , stab , beat , gas , starve , work to death , and otherwise obliterate in ways too grotesque to contemplate calmly .
( R. J. Rummels latest estimate of twentieth - century democide stands at 262 million persons ; the details are available at his Web site . )
Yet , almost incomprehensively , people fear that without the states supposedly all - important protection , society will lapse into disorder and people will suffer grave harm .
Even an analyst so astute as Olson , who speaks frankly of governments and all the good and bad things they do ,  proceeds immediately to contrast  the horrible anarchies that emerge in their absence ( 2000 , 66 , emphasis added ) , although he gives no examples or citations to support his characterization of anarchy .
But the states harms  the bad things they doare here and now , undeniable , immense , and horrifying , whereas the harms allegedly to be suffered without the state are specters of the mind and almost entirely conjectural .
This debate would not appear to be evenly matched .
Defending the continued existence of the state , despite having absolute certainty of a corresponding continuation of its intrinsic engagement in robbery , destruction , murder , and countless other crimes , requires that one imagine nonstate chaos , disorder , and death on a scale that nonstate actors seem incapable of causing .
Nor , to my knowledge , does any historical example attest to such large - scale nonstate mayhem .
With regard to large - scale death and destruction , no person , group , or private organization can even begin to compare to the state , which is easily the greatest instrument of destruction known to man .
All nonstate threats to life , liberty , and property appear to be relatively petty , and therefore can be dealt with .
Only states can pose truly massive threats , and sooner or later the horrors with which they menace mankind invariably come to pass .
The lesson of the precautionary principle is plain : because people are vile and corruptible , the state , which holds by far the greatest potential for harm and tends to be captured by the worst of the worst , is much too risky for anyone to justify its continuation .
To tolerate it is not simply to play with fire , but to chance the total destruction of the human race .
Dynamic Considerations
In thinking about the social disorder that so many people have been led to fear , we can organize our thoughts with reference to table 3 , which shows the degree of disorder and the scope for liberties with and without the state over time :
Figure 3
Disorder , Liberties , and the State
No State State Degree of disorder D - NS(0 )
D-NS(1 )
D-NS(2 )
etc. D - S(0 )
D -S(1 )
D -S(2 )
etc. Scope of liberties L - NS(0 )
L-NS(1 )
L-NS( 2 )
etc. L-S(0 )
L-S(1 )
L-S(2 )
etc .
The notation in the table indexes the degree of social disorder ( D ) and the scope of liberties ( L ) in a society with no state ( NS ) and in a society with a state ( S ) at successive points in time 0 , 1 , 2 , etc .
Classic discussions of state versus nonstate societal outcomes usually involve static comparisons ; they ignore the changes that occur systematically with the passage of time .
Thus , for example , a Hobbesian or Lockean account stipulates that in a state of nature ,  which has no governing state , a great deal of disorder prevails , and adoption of a state brings about a more orderly condition : in terms of my notation , D - NS ( 0 ) > D - S( 0 ) .
Analysts recognize that the people sacrifice some of their liberties when they adopt a state Hobbes goes so far as to suppose that the people sacrifice all their liberties to an omnipotent sovereign in exchange for his protection of their lives .
Even if the trade - off is less severe , however , L - NS ( 0 ) > L - S( 0 ) upon the establishment of a state .
A ruler always assures his victims that their loss of liberties is the price they must pay for the additional security ( order ) he purports to establish .
Well might we question whether the ruler has either the intention or the capability to reduce the degree of social disorder .
Plenty of evidence exhibits state - ridden societies boiling with disorder .
In the United States , for example , a country brimming with official protectors  of every imaginable stripe , the populace suffered in 2004 , according to figures the government itself endorses , approximately 16,000 murders , 95,000 forcible rapes , 401,000 robberies , 855,000 aggravated assaults , 2,143,000 burglaries , 6,948,000 larcenies and thefts , and 1,237,000 motor vehicle thefts ( U.S. Census Bureau 2007 , 191 ) .
The governments of the United States have taken the peoples liberties if you dont think so , you need to spend more time reading U.S. Statutes at Large and the Code of Federal Regulations , not to mention your state and local laws and ordinances but wheres the protective quid pro quo ?
They broke the egg of our liberties , without a doubt , but wheres the bloody omelet of personal protection and social order ?
Suppose , if only for purposes of discussion , we conceded that the initial establishment of the state reduces the degree of social disorder .
The obvious question , however seldom philosophers may have asked it , then becomes , What happens next ?
Does the degree of social disorder remain constant at D - S( 0 ) ?
Everything we have discovered in theory and by observation flies in the face of such constancy .
In fact , the likely progression over time is : D - S( 0 ) < D - S( 1 ) < D - S ( 2 ) , and so forth .
Under state domination , social disorder tends to increase .
This tendency exists because the state attempts in countless ways to compel people to act against their perceived self - interest , and the people respond by resorting to all sorts of evasions , black markets , and crimes .
Consider , for example , what happened when the state ordered people not to make , sell , possess , or consume alcoholic beverages or certain narcotics black markets and crime galore , including countless assaults and murders .
Of course , the states orders to pay stipulated taxes or fees have given rise to manifold evasive measures , some of them carrying violence against persons or the destruction of property in their train .
Perhaps equally important , the states concentration of its police forces on tax collection , enforcement of victimless crimes , and other measures at odds with the peoples perceived self - interest , diverts those forces from making any more than a token attempt to prevent such everyday crimes as murder , rape , robbery , and fraud , whose prevention the people actually value .
Over time , the social misallocation of the states protective resources grows , as the state itself shifts more and more resources toward the enforcement of laws adverse to the peoples genuine interests and as the people make moving targets  of themselves in ways that augment the degree of social disorder ( on the moving targets  of government economic policies , see Shultz and Dam 1977 , 8 - 10 ) .
If the degree of social disorder in a society under the state tends to increase , then , even if the initial establishment of the state did reduce disorder , a time ( t ) will come when the degree of social disorder will exceed that of the society with no state : that is , in my notation , D - S ( t ) > D - NS ( 0 ) .
If so , then ―momentarily taking for granted the myth of a social contract ―the initial bargain the people struck will come to be seen as a pact with the devil , a bargain that held , at best , advantages in the short term but proved to be a disappointing deal all - around in the longer term .
Moreover , for compelling reason , the inequality stated in the preceding can be generalized as follows : D - S( t ) > D - NS (t ) , for t sufficiently large .
This more general condition will exist not only because with the state , social disorder tends systematically to increase , but also because without the state , social disorder tends systematically to decrease .
The latter tendency reflects the progressive , mutually advantageous solution of social problems characteristic of a spontaneous order .
We have had three centuries of instruction in the workings of the spontaneous order of a free society , stretching from Bernard de Mandeville , Adam Ferguson , and Adam Smith in the eighteenth century to Carl Menger in the nineteenth century to F. A. Hayek and Murray Rothbard in the twentieth century to their numerous followers in the early twenty - first century ( Horwitz 2001 ) .
Unlike the forced exchanges and coerced arrangements enforced by the state , the protective and productive innovations of a spontaneous nonstate order can achieve acceptance only voluntarily , which is to say , only when all who participate in them expect them to produce net benefits .
Consider , for example , the householder who keeps a watchful eye on his neighbors property when the owner is away , just as the neighbor will watch his property when he is away , and contrast this simple , effective cooperative form of protection with the faux protection of the states police officer , who occupies himself at great public expense driving about aimlessly , harassing citizens pointlessly , or loitering in the doughnut shop .
Neighborliness spreads naturally and beneficially , whereas state protection spreads cancerously and harmfully .
The one preserves liberties , the other destroys them .
Thus , reverting to the notation of table 3 , we have ample grounds for statement of the following inequalities :
D- NS( 0 ) > D - NS ( 1 ) > D - NS ( 2 ) , and so forth ,
and
L - S(0 ) > L - S( 1 ) > L - S( 2 ) , and so forth .
The latter inequalities , of course , merely state in abstract symbols what Thomas Jefferson stated more eloquently in words when he wrote ,  The natural progress of things [ in society under a state ] is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground . 
Thus , although the ( mythical ) people entering into a social contract might have considered their sacrifice of liberties to the state at that time a price they were willing to pay , they could scarcely have suspected that with the passage of time , their remaining liberties also would be paid ,  one after another , notwithstanding that the social order they initially received from the state in return would systematically diminish .
Does Anarchy Entail Poverty ?
Arguments have been advanced , of course , that a society without a state must necessarily remain very poor , that , however gloriously free the peoples life might be without the state , the opportunity cost of anarchy is unacceptably high .
Thus , Olson ( 2000 ) advances the following propositions :
Some of the labor in an anarchic society will be devoted to taking or stealing rather than producing .
( 63 )
The output forgone when less productive but theft - resistance forms of production are used is , of course , an implicit cost of anarchy . ( 64 ) Anarchy not only involves loss of life but also increases the incentives to steal and to defend against theft , and thereby reduces the incentive to produce . ( 64 )
[ Therefore ]
If a population acts to serve its common interest , it will never choose anarchy . ( 65 )
The character of these arguments is reminiscent of the character of those advanced by the market - failure school of neoclassical welfare economics : having identified flaws in the freely chosen arrangement , the analyst leaps immediately to the conclusion that a state - dominated arrangement must necessarily be superior .
As Harold Demsetz famously characterized it , this sort of argumentation falls victim to the Nirvana Fallacy .
It finds the free arrangement worse than an unattainable blackboard ideal that it assumes the government can implement perfectly and costlessly , but it does not compare the actual free arrangement with the actual government solution . 
Returning to Olsons list of anarchys flaws , one has only to ask : does substitution of the state for anarchy avoid these flaws ?
The answer in every case is that not only does it not avoid them , but it actually exacerbates them and adds new problems on top of the old ones it purports to be solving .
So , considering Olsons first proposition , we may readily admit that without a state some of the labor . . . will be devoted to taking or stealing rather than producing .
Yet , one might argue , with a state almost all of the labor expended by state functionaries and much of the labor of other people also will be devoted to taking or stealing rather than producing .
Although the state may produce some goods and services of genuine valueabsent an expression of voluntary individual choice , such as freely made purchases , we have no persuasive evidence of such value or of its magnitude it seems perfectly obvious that a great deal of state production  creates either nothing valuable at all or , worse , outputs that many taxpayers despise and would gladly pay to avoid .
These obnoxious outputs are produced nonetheless because state functionaries and their cronies in the so - called private sector with whom they contract are , in effect , taking or stealing rather than producing ,  owing to their exercise of the states coercive power .
Moreover , as Gordon Tullock and other public choice analysts have demonstrated repeatedly , the state encourages enormous social waste as real resources are committed to a competition for state privileges of all sorts : social waste incurred in the process of seeking what is itself wasteful for those from whom resources are extracted to prop up the state and all its schemes ( Tullock 1967 is the article that launched a thousand papers about rent - seeking ) .
In sum , Olsons first proposition about anarchy versus society under the state is almost ludicrously backwards .
His second proposition fares no better .
Yes , without a state , output is forgone when less productive but theft - resistance forms of production are used ,  but in truth we may say the same thing about a society with a state .
Obviously , people constantly adjust the form of their production to avoid taxes and regulations , that is , to avoid the states robbery , oppression , and violation of their natural rights .
Neoclassical economists have produced countless articles and books about how the state can reshape behavior by the appropriate design and enforcement of its taxes , subsidies , laws , and regulations .
When people abandon their otherwise - most - valued forms of production in reaction to these state sanctions , socially valued outputs are lost .
When the state comes to be engaged in the economy as pervasively as it is now in all of the economically advanced countries , we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that the scale of these losses must be immense , because people are being diverted from the socially most valued forms of production at nearly every turn .
In sum , Olsons second proposition about anarchy versus society under the state is almost ludicrously backwards .
We can also readily agree with Olsons third proposition : anarchy not only involves loss of life but also increases [ relative to the nirvana level ] the incentives to steal and to defend against theft , and thereby reduces the incentive to produce .
But is the situation in these regards any better under the state ?
Certainly , as I have argued already , the loss of life must have been immensely greater with the state than without it .
Since its maturation in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , the modern nation - state has functioned as a veritable killing machine .
It defies reason to suppose that people left to their own individual devices would have killed hundreds of millions of people , as states did in the twentieth century alone .
Following public choice analysis , we can make a similar statement about stealing and defending against theft .
Because the state is a standing invitation to ( legal ) theft for all who can gain a grip on any of its many levers of power , it constitutes a constant menace against which one and all must devote time , energy , and resources in defense , lest they be subjected to utter spoliation .
Unfortunately , once the stampede for control of state power gets under way widely in society , almost everybody comes to view his own attempt to engage in legal plunder as essentially defensive : the state is going to tax and regulate me no matter what I do ; unless I get something back via state action , I will be a chump , a sucker , a net loser .
The wonder is that under a state , people produce anything at all .
Their production may eventually diminish , however , as state power continues its seemingly inexorable expansionindeed , if the state is going to strip you naked , why produce at all ?
Any ship , even a magnificent economy , can be sunk if enough people continue to poke holes in it , even though each individual hole is a small one .
In sum , Olsons third proposition about anarchy versus society under the state is almost ludicrously backwards .
Concluding Thoughts
In view of the foregoing arguments , we might well restate Olsons ultimate economic conclusion on anarchy as follows :
If a population acts to serve its common interest , it will never choose the state .
In reaching this conclusion , we need not deny the countless problems that will plague the people living in a society without the state ; any anarchical society , being peopled in normal proportion by vile and corruptible individuals , will have crimes and miseries aplenty .
But everything that makes life without a state undesirable makes life with a state even more undesirable .
The idea that the anti-social tendencies that afflict people in every society can be cured or even ameliorated by giving a few persons great discretionary power over all the others is , upon serious reflection , seen to be a wildly mistaken notion .
Perhaps it is needless to add that the structural checks and balances on which Madison relied to restrain the governments abuses have proven to be increasingly unavailing and , bearing in mind the expansive claims and actions under the present U.S. regime , are now almost wholly superseded by a form of executive caesarism in which the departments of government that were designed to check and balance each other have instead coalesced in a mutually supportive design to plunder the people and reduce them to absolute domination by the state .
My arguments in support of self - government , as opposed to society under a state , may have little point , of course : if people do not choose the state , but , as I think , simply have it imposed on them , then it makes no practical difference that the state is unnecessary to solve any particular kind of problem and that life without the state would be superior ( Holcombe 2004 ) .
Life without cancer would be superior , too , but so far we have not found a way to get rid of it , and we have no guarantee that we ever will find a way , so we can only strive to make the best of a bad situation .
We need also to consider the likely outcome if our society had no state but another society did , and that state had the capacity to harm us greatly and , for whatever reason , sought to do so .
I am not convinced that this particular problem is insoluble , and indeed I believe that the states defenders may have blown it out of proportion , but I do not dismiss it entirely .
The Irish monks may have had the better argument , but it availed them little when Henry VIII decided to rip the roof off the monastery .
Here , however , I have tried only to show how we may think more clearly about the choice between a society under the state and a society composed of self - governing individuals .
Assuming that we really had such a choice , the better option seems to me fairly obvious .
If the reader takes anything away from my arguments here , however , I hope that it will be an appreciation of how highly warranted is an application of the precautionary principle in choosing between anarchy and the state .
Fire has proven to be a magnificent aid to human beings , but a fire that cannot be contained portends our utter destruction , and the state is precisely such a fire .

These days , it seems like everyone ’s trying to build a flying car ( or taxi ) — which usually means a design with four or more small , computer - controlled rotors , much like the drones you can buy for aerial photography .
But there ’s a much simpler , safer , and lower - tech design for a small aircraft .
It sounds like a joke :
What do you get if you cross an airplane and a helicopter ?
But the answer is n’t “ aircopter ” or “ heliplane , ” it ’s “ autogyro ” — or , sometimes , “ gyroplane . ”
This peculiar type of aircraft , which was the forerunner of the modern helicopter , was once extremely well known .
Although it never caught on as a widespread commercial design , the autogyro is beginning to make a comeback , especially among hobbyists and amateur aviators .
An Uplifting Story
First , a word or two of aeronautical review .
A conventional , fixed - wing airplane gets thrust from propellers or jet engines and lift from the wings , but that lift can only be generated when the wing is moving fast enough ( and , of course , in the right direction ) .
When an airplane is moving too slowly for its wings to provide adequate lift to keep it airborne , it is said to stall , which is perfectly fine if you happen to be landing the plane , but not so good otherwise .
Helicopters , on the other hand , get both thrust and lift from one or more narrow , propeller - like rotors turned by an engine .
Rotor blades are thus essentially moving wings .
The speed and direction of the craft ’s movement are determined by the angle at which the rotor is positioned ; in most helicopter designs , a vertically mounted tail rotor counteracts the main rotor ’s rotation and prevents the helicopter ’s body from spinning .
An autogyro has a rotor much like that of a helicopter , with one crucial difference : it is unpowered .
A propeller provides thrust , just as on an airplane , while the lift comes from the spinning blades of the rotor .
But wait a minute — did n’t I just say that the rotor is unpowered ?
That ’s where the “ auto ” part comes in .
The rotor must spin to provide lift , but that spin comes from the forward motion of the entire craft .
If that sounds confusing , think about maple ( or elm or ash ) trees .
The seeds are encased in little winglike structures that twirl as they fall to the ground .
Those casings are called samaras ( though , in the case of maples , some botanists refer to them as schizocarps because they form in pairs that split apart ) .
Because of the samara ’s unique shape and balance , the force of the air blowing past it as it falls to the ground causes it to spin ; that spinning is known as autorotation .
And if you could somehow put a very tiny engine and propeller on a samara to give it some forward momentum , that would generate enough air movement to keep it spinning — and in turn , keep the whole thing aloft .
That ( on a somewhat larger scale ) is how an autogyro works .
Because the rotor is not spinning under its own power , there ’s no need for a tail rotor — the craft itself ca n’t spin .
Autogyros tend to look rather goofy : either like airplanes with a giant rotor where wings should be , or like stunted helicopters missing their tails .
They generally can’t fly as fast or as far as fixed - wing airplanes , and they ca n’t hover or maneuver like helicopters .
( Some designs , however , do provide power to the rotor temporarily to facilitate a vertical or near - vertical takeoff and landing . )
If those trade - offs sound like the worst of both worlds , though , consider that unlike airplanes , autogyros are virtually stall - proof , no matter how slow they ’re going .
If the engine gave out , the rotor would keep spinning , and the craft — if controlled carefully by the pilot — could simply float to the ground .
All this does not necessarily mean that autogyros are safer than other aircraft ; numerous other considerations come into play .
But in certain circumstances , with proper design and a well - trained operator , they can sometimes be safer .
Air Apparent
A Spanish engineer named Juan de la Cierva developed a hinged rotor design in early years of the 20th century that would serve as the basis for all future rotary wing aircraft .
Cierva built his first stable autogyro in 1923 .
After a long series of improvements , he began to license his design to aircraft manufacturers in other countries , including the United States .
Legendary pilot Amelia Earhart was quite fond of autogyros .
In 1931 , she set a record for highest altitude in an autogyro — 18,415 feet ( about 5,600 m ) ; later that year , she was also the first person to fly an autogyro from coast to coast in the United States .
Autogyros were used for rooftop - to - rooftop urban mail delivery , and a few autogyros were even put to military use during World War II .
But despite these scattered successes , the autogyro concept basically fizzled out by the mid-1940s , having been supplanted by fixed - wing airplanes for some applications , and helicopters for others .
Cierva , ironically , died in 1936 in a plane crash .
In recent years , however , small , kit - built aircraft of all kinds have increased in popularity — everything from ultralights to gliders to biplanes to mini-helicopters .
And along with this trend has come a renewed interest in autogyros : they ’re less complex to build and operate than helicopters , and require a lot less runway space than fixed - wing airplanes .
Autogyros are also being used increasingly in law enforcement , nature observation , sightseeing , and other recreational flying .
A one - person autogyro will still cost you more than most cars , but at least it ’s guaranteed not to stall .

Richardson 's gambit
Just weeks after Hillary and Obama were dragged into a pair of tougher anti-war votes than they 'd ever taken , Bill Richardson is criticizing them for those votes -- on the grounds that they were n't anti-war enough .
Richardson has been stressing the distinct on that he'd leave no forces in Iraq other than the Marines at the embassy , while some others would leave " residual " forces .
His alternative : " An all - Muslim peacekeeping force . "
" This is the fundamental difference : how many troops each of us would leave behind , " he said .
He promised , " No airbases , no troops in the Green Zone , no embedded soldiers training Iraqi forces – because we all know what that means – it means our troops will still be out on patrol , with targets on their back . "
He criticized Clinton and Obama by name for , he said , indicating they 'd leave some troops behind , and criticized Edwards for supporting Reid - Feingold , despite its " loopholes , " which would allow the president to keep troops behind for training Iraqis and protecting other soldiers .
" Clearly my colleagues in this campaign think it ’s responsible to have an ongoing military role in Iraq , " he said .
" They voted for it twice . "

Back to the Constructing our lives package
On the 25th of May 1997 an unmanned cargo ship named Progress crashed into the Russian space station Mir , tearing a hole into Mir 's side and sending it hurtling through space .
In his desperate attempt to save Mir and its crew , NASA astronaut Michael Foale had no choice but to get right down to the maths that governs space flight .
Crunch
The space station Mir , manned by NASA astronaut and scientist Michael Foale , Flight Engineer Alexander " Sasha " Lazutkin and Commander Vasily Tsibliev , had been put in orbit around Earth to test for the first time the feasibility of long - term human habitation in space .
On this particular day in May 1997 , the unmanned cargo ship Progress , orbiting Earth a few kilometres away from the station , was due to dock with Mir , under remote - control by Mir 's crew .

But this was n't a routine docking manoeuvre .
" What was so different and dangerous about that particular day , " says Michael Foale , " was that we had been given orders to disconnect the antennae systems on the Progress , so that the Progress did not know how fast it was coming into the space station or how far away it was .
All we had was a view from a camera , mounted on the Progress , coming in towards Mir .
This amounted to flying a cargo rocket weighing seven tons , with very , very weak thrusters , and a two - second time delay between inputting commands at the controls and the Progress 's reaction .
" Why were we taking this risk ?
At the time , the cash situation of the Russian space programme was very critical .
The equipment controlling the automatic guidance systems that would allow the two space vehicles to come together was produced in the Ukraine , which , after the split of the Soviet Union , was no longer linked to Russia .
The Ukrainians demanded a lot of money for this equipment , so Russia wanted to see if we could do all this manually . "

If you imagine guiding a seven ton truck into a narrow parking slot by remote control , only with the help of a small black - and - white monitor and subject to a time delay , you get some idea of the difficult task that was facing Vasily Tsibliev , who was to execute the docking manoeuvre .
But there was another complication : viewing the world from the Mir was very different to viewing it from the Progress .
To understand this , think of a plane starting from London and aiming straight at Perth in Australia .
If the plane was to roll over the surface of the Earth along the straight line between London and Perth , it would eventually arrive .
As soon as it takes to the air , however , it leaves the Earth 's frame of reference .
While it is flying into the prescribed direction , the Earth underneath it rotates , causing the plane to miss its target .
From the point of view of someone on Earth , the plane has flown along a curve , as if it had been diverted from its original path by some external force .
This fictitious force — fictitious because it is only a result of our viewpoint — is called the Coriolis force .
The same difficulty applies in space : sitting within a space station you are in what is called a rotating frame of reference .
Any space vehicle thrusting towards you is not part of this frame of reference and will feel the Coriolis force .
You have to take account of this force when guiding the vehicle — or miss your target .
" Vasily had not been trained on this .
This was a poorly planned experiment , one which was going to affect our safety quite critically , " says Michael .
The Progress was moving in at about six metres per second , meaning that Vasily could not really ascertain its speed until the very end .
" It all happens in the last few seconds , " says Michael , " then suddenly the angles open up and the speed of the Progress becomes apparent .
But when your thrusters are very small , as they are on the Progress , then you need to brake for a long time to take away your speed .
Vasily 's recognition of the Progress 's speed came too late . "
Sasha Lozutkin , who had seen through one of Mir 's windows that disaster was imminent , had time to shout out a warning — and then the Progress crunched straight into Mir 's side .
" I did n't feel the crunch because I was not touching anything , but I could see our equipment shake and hear a big bang , " says Michael .
" That 's when I thought ' this could be the moment we all die ' .
The de-pressurisation alarm went off and this meant that there really was a hole in the station .
I felt the pressure fall in my ears .
I started heading for the Soyuz , Mir 's only life boat . "

But meanwhile Sasha , who had seen the impact , had other plans .
The Mir is made up of a central node to which five different modules attach by hatchways .
The Progress had hit one of these modules , rather than the central node , and so Sasha had decided to simply close off the damaged module .
As precious minutes and air were trickling away , the crew set about cutting eighteen thick cables which were preventing them from closing the door to the damaged module .
Sparks flying , the last cable finally gave in and the hatchway 's door could be lifted into position .
" I could immediately hear the door being sucked into place , " says Michael " and about a minute later I could feel the pressure stabilise .
At this point the emergency was over . "
Silence
The emergency was over , but Mir and its crew were far from safe .
What they had just done was disconnect thirty per cent of the station 's power supply , which came from the solar arrays attached to the damaged module .
" Within twenty to thirty minutes after the collision , every single piece of equipment on the station went dead , " says Michael .
" It was a completely silent station .
It 's quite eerie to be in a station in space where there is no sound except for your own breathing .
And then it started to get cold .
Really , really cold . "
There still were functional solar arrays attached to the undamaged modules , and with some exposure to the Sun , these arrays could provide sufficient power to keep operations going .
But exposure to the Sun was precisely the problem .
Before the impact , Mir had been orbiting Earth all the while maintaining the same attitude towards the Sun .
Its solar panels had been facing straight into the Sun , slowly turning to keep track whenever Mir moved over the Earth 's sunny side .
But Progess 's impact had knocked Mir out of its attitude to the Sun .
Worse , it had also set it spinning about its own centre of gravity at a rate too fast for the solar arrays to keep up .
There was only one way to save the station : the lifeboat called Soyuz , still attached to the station , had its own power and thrusters .
Using these thrusters it might be possible to counteract Mir 's tumble and to manoeuvre it into a position that allowed its solar arrays to find the Sun .
A risky plan , as Michael explains : " Remember , this is our life boat .
It carries the fuel to take us back to Earth .
We could n't afford to use our fuel up .
But at the same time , we had no communications with the ground , because the station was dead , and we did n't seem to be getting into a better situation .
We had already gone a few orbits without power .
So in the end the three of us agreed to give it a go . "

Rule of thumb
The initial attempts to halt Mir's bad spin were a trial - and - error affair involving much shouting of commands and floating about the station .
Without communications with the ground , the only way to ascertain how Mir was spinning was , quite literally , by rule of thumb : " I knew that the Moon was about half a degree in angular width .
My thumb covered the Moon about three times , making one and a half degrees . "
Stretching his thumb out against the stars and watching the stars drifting past it , Michael managed to get a rough idea of the rate and direction of Mir 's spin .
Based on his thumb measurements , Michael shouted instructions to Vasily who was controlling the Soyuz 's thrusters .
After four and a half hours and some nerve - wrecking failed attempts , they finally saw a result .
The Mir 's spin slowed and the station 's position became relatively stable with respect to the Sun .

But this was n't the end of the problem .
For a space station to keep facing the Sun in more or less the same way while it orbits Earth , powerful control mechanisms are needed .
Once the power is down , these mechanisms stop functioning .
The minutest tugs and pulls will cause the station to start drifting again and over the course of just a few hours it will lose its stable attitude toward the Sun — unless you put the right spin on it .
The maths behind the spin
As you can see in the image above , the space station Mir is quite a symmetrical object .
It is set out along three axes , each perpendicular to the other two , with its centre of gravity located roughly at its central node .
The crucial component of Mir 's movement was not its orbit around Earth , but the way it revolved about its own centre of gravity , as this was making it hard for the solar arrays to pick up energy .
So for simplicity , imagine , for the moment , this centre of gravity being fixed in one place .
The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler showed in the 18th century that any movement of a rigid body that keeps one of its points fixed must be a rotation about an axis going through the fixed point .
In other words , when Mir was set spinning , its initial movement was a rotation about an axis passing through its centre of gravity .
However , in general such a rotation is not stable : as the object spins about one axis , it may start rotating about other axes too .
In Mir 's case , this meant that a spin about an arbitrary axis afforded practically no chance of a stable attitude toward the Sun .
Euler 's equations of rotational motion describe exactly how the movement of a rotating body evolves over time , and capture how this movement changes if you apply certain external forces .
His equations show that every body possesses three very special axes , and that the body 's movement is crucially determined by three numbers called the principal moments of inertia .
Euler 's equations of motion Euler 's equations describing the rotational motion of a rigid object in the absence of external forces are : I 1 dω 1 ( t ) / dt - ω 2 ω 3 ( I 2 - I 3 ) = 0 ,
I 2 dω 2 ( t ) / dt - ω 3 ω 1 ( I 3 - I 1 ) = 0 ,
I 3 dω 3 ( t ) / dt - ω 1 ω 2 ( I 1 - I 2 ) = 0 .
Here , I 1 , I 2 and I 3 are the principal moments of inertia .
The ω 1 , ω 2 and ω 3 are functions of time and together describe the motion the body has performed after time t.
There are similar equations describing the motion when external force , or torque , is applied .
When you set an object spinning about an axis , you need to apply a certain amount of force to get it going in the first place .
This amount depends on the way in which the object 's mass is distributed with respect to the axis : a wheel , for example , is harder to spin when most of its mass is located around its rim , than when it is concentrated close to the centre .
Mathematicians use a number to measure the resistance of the object to being spun , and this number is called a moment of inertia .
Each axis has its own moment of inertia .
Euler noticed that , no matter which object you are spinning , whether it's a space station , a potato or an elephant , the same basic pattern always occurs .
The axis that gives you the smallest moment of inertia ( the least resistance to being spun ) is perpendicular to the axis giving you the greatest moment of inertia .
These two axes , together with the line that is perpendicular to both of them , are known as the object 's principal axes of inertia .
When an object has some symmetry , the principal axes often coincide with the symmetry axes , and this is the case for Mir : its principal axes of inertia are exactly the x , y and z - axes shown in the image below .
What Euler 's equations also show — and what Michael Foale knew — is that the two axes associated to the smallest and the largest moment of inertia give rise to stable rotations : spin Mir around one of these axes and it will keep on spinning nicely in the same direction .
A spin about the third axis , however , is not stable .

The right spin
A spin around one of Mir 's stable axes could be Mir 's saviour , but it could also spell doom .
If the axis was oriented so that the solar arrays face into the Sun whenever Mir passes on the Earth 's sunny side , then a stable spin would allow it to recharge its battery continually .
If , however , the axis was oriented so that the solar arrays can't ever pick up the Sun , then the station would be lost : a lot of energy would be required to brake out of the stable spin and energy was precisely what Mir did n't have .
Mir would be locked into the bad spin forever and , as Michael says , " that would be it , we would have to abandon the station . "
So which of Mir 's principal axes were stable ?
Unfortunately , Michael and his colleagues did not know .
Neither did ground control in Moscow , as it turned out later .
Using a cracked and broken model of the Mir , and supplementing it with torches taped to its ends , Michael eventually ascertained that their best bet lay with the y - axis .
The Soyuz 's thrusters , because of their position , were unable to induce a rotation about the x-axis , and rotation about the z - axis would not have allowed the functioning solar arrays to pick up the Sun .
" The best thing we could do was to rotate about the y - axis and hope that it was stable .
Moments of inertia and stable spins
To demonstrate how a body spins about its three principal axes , take a box - shaped object , for example an empty cereal box .
Its three principal axes are the ones shown in the figure below .
If you throw the box up in the air giving it a spin about the axis marked a in the figure , you will find that the box keeps spinning in that direction until it falls to the floor .
The same happens if you give it a spin about the axis marked c .
These two axes have the smallest and largest moment of inertia and they are stable .
But if you give the box a spin about the axis marked b , then the box will do a wobble and a flip in mid-air .
This axis has the middle moment of inertia — it is unstable .
" Eventually , we managed to get a rough spin about the y - axis and to orient it in what we thought was the direction of the Sun .
We could not know for sure because at the time we were passing the dark side of the Earth .
But then we saw the rim of the Earth go blue , then red , and then the Sun popped out — and low and behold it was roughly in the direction of the y - axis . "
Almost safe
" At that point we managed to charge the station 's batteries continually while the Mir passed on the Earth 's sunny side , which takes about an hour .
That was enough to bring the station back to life and to bring up communications with the ground .
With Moscow 's help we could get accurate control of our orientation .
After 30 hours we could finally relax , get some sleep and start dealing with other consequence of the collision . "
The y - axis , as it turned out , was not stable .
" I noticed that our rotation was stable for only about one and a half hours .
Then the Mir would do a flip and the solar arrays were pointing exactly in the opposite direction .
What we had discovered was that the y - axis was the one with the middle moment of inertia . "
Luckily though , with batteries charged and communications to the ground re-established , this did not turn out to be a major problem .

But still , Michael 's adventure was far from over .
After the accident , he remained on Mir for another three and a half months until a space shuttle came to get him in October .
" After the initial emergency , we lost control again two or three times , because in rescuing Mir we had made its control systems very vulnerable .
During this time my worst fear was that we would somehow get locked into a bad spin about the z - axis , which would n't allow us to recharge our batteries . "
So , using a laptop with shaky batteries , Michael set about trying to solve Euler 's equations once and for all to get an accurate idea of the Mir 's rotation dynamics .
He never quite finished until he got back to Earth , where he finally published is work .
If you are ready to brave the equations , you can read his paper in The Mathematica Journal .
The paper includes a computer model of the rotating Mir , which Michael created using the program Mathematica .
This whole incident holds many lessons for space craft design .
But the clearest message is one that rarely gets mentioned : it 's the important role of maths .
" Mathematics is everywhere in space flight , " says Michael .
" When I think about a space craft in orbit , I always think in terms of the underlying maths and physics .
I did n't suddenly turn on my ability to think about maths when the accident happened ; it was a continuation of my usual , mathematical way of thinking .
You can not be an effective mission designer , astronaut , flight controller or engineer if you do n't know maths . "

CAN YOU NAME A FEATURE that plain old telephone service ( POTS ) has that voice over Internet protocol ( VoIP ) telephone service does not ?
It 's pretty easy to do it in reverse .
VoIP service has caller ID , voicemail , conference calling , call forwarding , etc. , etc .
But there is one feature that POTS lines have that most people are not paying attention to -- it 's power .
POTS service is , for all intents and purposes , self - powered .
In other words , when you plug a good old - fashioned telephone into a classic RJ11 telephone socket , the phone gets all the power it needs from the telephone line itself .
There 's no additional power required to make or receive a call .
This is not obvious to people who have replaced their older telephone instruments with newer electronic phones , nor is it obvious to businesspeople who work with key - systems everyday .
All of these sophisticated systems need external power to operate .
But , if the lines coming into the building are POTS lines , you can plug anything from a 1950s vintage Western Electric handset to a pink Princess telephone into the wall jack and still make and receive all the telephone calls you want .
On the other hand , all VoIP phone systems not only need AC power to operate the handsets , they need AC power to operate the router and the modem that enables them to reach the Internet .
In fact , even the service provider needs power near your home or business to run the system .
During a power failure , your battery back - up wo n't help you -- because the VoIP router in the street needs power too !
On most days , and for most people , this is a non-issue .
After all , how often does the power go out ?
And when it does , do you really need your telephone to work ?
This is one of those transitional times when we just do n't have enough real - world data to make a declarative statement .
But we should have enough common sense to think through the problem .
During a power outage triple play ( video , voice and data ) , customers lose everything .
( They also lose everything when the cable lines are down , but that 's for another column ) .
We can all live without television for a little while and dinner by candlelight can be fun on those special power - outage occasions , but nobody in America is used to losing telephone service for extended periods in times of crisis .
Working with local governments , the VoIP community has worked hard to make their IP - provisioned telephone systems 911 compatible .
This is all well and good -- right up until the power goes out .
Then , it 's right out of a movie ...
EXT .
NIGHT .
AN ISOLATED HOUSE ON A MOONLESS NIGHT SHEDS A WARM GLOW ON THE RURAL LANDSCAPE .
MEDIUM CLOSE UP OF BOLT CUTTERS CLIPPING A POWER LINE .
CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF THE HOUSE GOING COMPLETELY DARK ...
We all know how this scene ends .
Seriously , we know how the real - life scene will end as well .
What will happen when someone needs emergency medical care during a power outage in a triple - play household that is outside of cell phone range ?
How many people will be injured or die before POTS telephone service starts its comeback ?
Local telephone companies are thinking about how to replace their lost access lines with television subscribers using a fiber - optic version of the triple play .
( How they rationalize this line of thought is also for another column ) .
Perhaps what they should be doing to save themselves is to tell America that POTS telephone service is the Volvo of telephone services .
Nothing will keep you and your loved ones safer than the power of POTS .
At some point in the near future , Americans are going to figure this out for themselves -- as will the lawyers and the politicians .
This power struggle may sound like it's about power , but it 's actually about public safety .
Come on phone guys , step up and tell America about POTS ' only unique selling principle -- you might save some lives !

CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) --
As thousands of students marched in the streets in support , a Venezuelan television channel denied accusations that it was inciting violence against the government .
President Hugo Chavez 's administration shut down one station that was critical of him , and has opened an investigation into the remaining opposition station , Globovision .
Globovision 's director , Alberto Ravell , was unimpressed .
" We are not going to change our editorial line that we are not afraid of the threats from this government , " he told CNN .
In a news conference and a posting Monday on the government 's Web site , Minister of Communication Willian Lara described two incidents he said were provocative .
First , Globovision 's " Citizen " program on Sunday followed an interview with the outgoing director general of the opposition station , Radio Caracas Television , with video showing images of the attempted 1981 assassination in the Vatican of Pope John Paul II .
As the video played , Ruben Blades could be heard singing , " This does n't end here . "
" The television company , in that specific fragment of its programming , committed the crime of inciting to assassinate -- in the person of the chief of state of Venezuela , " Lara said , referring to Chavez .
" That was the objective . "
The program aired on Globovision .
RCTV had the nation 's widest audience , counting 10 million of Venezuela 's 26 million people as viewers of its programming , which included soap operas as well as news .
In a written statement directed to Globovision , Chavez said , " They have accused me of fascism .
Well , it is they that I accuse of fascism .
They are trying to make this seem as if the world has ended .
They do n't know , the poor things , that they are the ones being manipulated . "
Chavez announced in January that the government would not renew RCTV 's license .
He accused the station of supporting the failed 2002 coup against him and violating broadcast laws .
RCTV , which had been broadcasting for 53 years , was replaced by a state - run station -- TVes -- on Monday .
Thousands of students from four colleges took to the streets of Caracas on Monday and Tuesday to make their complaints public .
( Watch police turn water cannons on protesters after RCTV was shut down )
The U.S. State Department objected to the actions against news outlets .
" Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right , " said State Department spokesman Tom Casey in a written statement .
" It is an essential element of democracy anywhere in the world .
And we certainly call on the government of Venezuela to abide by its commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Inter - American Democratic Charter and to reverse these policies that they 're pursuing to limit freedom of expression . "
CNN networks also criticized
Lara also criticized the U.S. - based CNN family of networks for broadcasting video showing anti-government demonstrations followed by images from Acapulco , Mexico , that showed protests against the death of a Mexican journalist and for juxtaposing Chavez to video showing the body of an alleged al Qaeda leader and protests in China .
" CNN lies to Venezuela , " he said , adding that he worries that journalism is being used " to present political propaganda under the guise of news , in a systematic manner . "
In a joint written statement , CNN en Español and CNN International said they " categorically deny " the accusations .
" The reality is that upon being made aware of the video mix - up , CNN en Espanol aired a detailed correction and expressed regret for the involuntary error , " the statement said .
About the complaint that CNNI tried to link Chavez to al Qaeda and China protests , CNN International Executive Vice President Tony Maddox denied , in a letter to the Venezuelan government , " any intention of associating President Chavez with al Qaeda or the China story , " the network said .
" Unrelated news stories can be juxtaposed in a given program segment just as a newspaper page or a news Web site may have unconnected stories adjacent to each other . "
Sunday night , police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds protesting the government 's decision .
( Full story )
Eleven policemen were wounded , eight of them seriously , Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez said .
" To refuse to grant a new license for the most popular and oldest television channel in the country because the government disagrees with the editorial or political views of this channel , which are obviously critical to Chavez , is a case of censorship , " said Jose Miguel Vivanco , executive director of Human Rights Watch .
" We have arrived at totalitarianism , " said Marcel Granier , president of Empresas 1BC , which owns RCTV .
Granier accused Chavez of being " afraid of free thought , of opinion , of criticism . "
CNN 's Harris Whitbeck contributed to this report .
Protection
He works in the southern sector of Africa ’s oldest reserve , the 8,000 sq km Virunga National Park , in eastern DR Congo .
Of the 700 mountain gorillas left in the world , 320 are in Uganda and the remainder are in the Virunga Mountains which also cross into Uganda and Rwanda .
But former Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey has testified that Justice Department lawyers were balking at recertifying the program early in 2004 and that he thought Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card rushed to the hospital to persuade Mr. Ashcroft , who was not at full capacity , to overlook his own objections to the program .
Mr. Mueller said that after receiving a call from Mr. Comey he went to the hospital , arriving shortly after Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card left , and that after he spoke with Mr. Ashcroft he understood that the N.S.A. program was indeed the focus of the dramatic bedside encounter .
There have been repeated instances in which lawmakers have questioned Mr. Gonzales ’s competence and his recollection of events .
But today ’s developments seemed to mark a shift toward suggestions that he actually committed crimes in testifying before Congress .
The four senators who sought a special counsel are all members of the Judiciary Committee .
They urged Solicitor General Paul D. Clement in a letter to name an independent counsel from outside the Justice Department .
“ It has become apparent that the attorney general has provided at a minimum half - truths and misleading statements , ” the senators wrote .
While the four were asking for a special counsel , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont , announced that a subpoena was being issued to Karl Rove , President Bush ’s chief political adviser , to provide information on the firings last year of nine federal prosecutors .
The White House has asserted executive privilege in resisting Congressional demands for testimony by present and former presidential aides .
The request that the solicitor general name a special counsel to investigate Mr. Gonzales marked a new stage in the long - running controversy over his stewardship of the Justice Department .
Mr. Gonzales ’s most outspoken critics suggested today that the attorney general might have committed crimes , including perjury and obstruction of justice , when he testified about President Bush ’s domestic - surveillance program and the dismissal of the nine United States attorneys .
The four senators — Charles E. Schumer of New York , Dianne Feinstein of California , Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island — zeroed in today on Mr. Gonzales ’s testimony that there had been no internal dissent over the president ’s warrantless eavesdropping program and that an emergency meeting at the White House in March 2004 concerned subjects other than the secret eavesdropping operation .
Linus on GPLv3 and ZFS
[ Kernel ] Posted Jun 12 , 2007 17:12 UTC ( Tue ) by corbet
For the curious , here 's a recent posting from Linus Torvalds on Sun 's motivations and GPLv3 .
" So to Sun , a GPLv3 - only release would actually let them look good , and still keep Linux from taking their interesting parts , and would allow them to take at least parts of Linux without giving anything back ( ahh , the joys of license fragmentation ) .
Of course , they know that .
And yes , maybe ZFS is worthwhile enough that I 'm willing to go to the effort of trying to relicense the kernel .
But quite frankly , I can almost guarantee that Sun wo n't release ZFS under the GPLv3 even if they release other parts .
Because if they did , they 'd lose the patent protection . "

Illustration by Eddie Guy __ For months , Michael Donnelly __had been hearing all about the fantastic opportunities in Second Life .
As worldwide head of interactive marketing at Coca - Cola , Donnelly was fascinated by its commercial potential , the way its users could wander through a computer - generated 3 - D environment that mimics the mundane world of the flesh .
So one day last fall , he downloaded the Second Life software , created an avatar , and set off in search of other brands like his own .
American Apparel , Reebok , Scion — the big ones were easy to find , yet something felt wrong : " There was nobody else around . "
He teleported over to the Aloft Hotel , a virtual prototype for a real - world chain being developed by the owners of the W .
It was deserted , almost creepy .
" I felt like I was in The Shining . "
Yet Donnelly decided to put money into Second Life anyway .
He 's no digital naïf :
When he joined Coke last summer , the company was being ridiculed for its huffy response to a spate of Web videos showing the soda geysers that erupt when you drop Mentos into Diet Coke .
Within weeks , Donnelly had Coke and Mentos sponsoring a contest on Google Video that 's gotten more than 5.6 million views .
But Second Life was different .
" Many places you go , there 's still nobody there , " he concedes .
That 's certainly the case with Coke 's Virtual Thirst pavilion , where you can long linger without encountering another avatar .
" But my job is to invest in things that have never been done before .
So Second Life was an obvious decision . "
As with Donnelly and Coca - Cola , so with David Stern and the National Basketball Association .
Stern , who 's been NBA commissioner since 1984 , was introduced to Second Life in July 2006 , at the annual media and technology retreat hosted by New York investment banker Herbert Allen in Sun Valley , Idaho .
Second Life 's creator , Philip Rosedale , was one of the presenters , as was Chad Hurley , cofounder of YouTube , another company Stern had never heard of .
" My initial impression was , ' Do n't people have better things to do with their lives ? '
Then I said , ' Stupid !
You 're not the audience . ' "
Stern left Sun Valley convinced he 'd seen the future , and he was about half right .
YouTube has become a powerful tool for pro basketball .
The site 's NBA channel , launched in February , has already garnered some 14,000 subscribers ; users have posted more than 60,000 NBA videos , which have been viewed 23 million times .
But over at Second Life , where an elaborate NBA island went up in May , the action has been a bit slower .
" I think we 've had 1,200 visitors , " Stern reports .
" People tell us that 's very , very good .
But I can't say we have very precise expectations .
We just want to be there . "
Coke and the NBA are hardly alone .
Adrift in the uncharted sea that is Web 2.0 — YouTube , MySpace , social networking , user - generated content , virtual worlds — corporate marketers look at Second Life and see something to grab onto .
At least 50 major companies have ventured into the virtual world to date , spending millions in the process .
IBM has created a massive complex of adjoining islands dedicated to recruitment , employee training , and in - world business meetings .
Coldwell Banker has opened a virtual real estate office .
Brands like Adidas , H&R Block , and Sears have set up shop .
CNET and Reuters have opened virtual bureaus there .
It 's as if the moon suddenly had oxygen .
Nobody wants to miss out .
Ever since BusinessWeek ran a breathless cover story titled " My Virtual Life " more than a year ago , reporters have been heralding Second Life as the here - and - now incarnation of the fictional Metaverse that Neal Stephenson conjured up 15 years ago in Snow Crash .
( Wired created a 12 - page " Travel Guide " last fall . )
Unfortunately , the reality does n't justify the excitement .
Second Life partisans claim meteoric growth , with the number of " residents , " or avatars created , surpassing 7 million in June .
There 's no question that more and more people are trying Second Life , but that figure turns out to be wildly misleading .
For starters , many people make more than one avatar .
According to Linden Lab , the company behind Second Life , the number of avatars created by distinct individuals was closer to 4 million .
Of those , only about 1 million had logged on in the previous 30 days ( the standard measure of Internet traffic ) , and barely a third of that total had bothered to drop by in the previous week .
Most of those who did were from Europe or Asia , leaving a little more than 100,000 Americans per week to be targeted by US marketers .
Then there 's the question of what people do when they get there .
Once you put in several hours flailing around learning how to function in Second Life , there is n't much to do .
That may explain why more than 85 percent of the avatars created have been abandoned .
Linden 's in - world traffic tally , which factors in both the number of visitors and time spent , shows that the big draws for those who do return are free money and kinky sex .
On a random day in June , the most popular location was Money Island ( where Linden dollars , the official currency , are given away gratis ) , with a score of 136,000 .
Sexy Beach , one of several regions that offer virtual sex shops , dancing , and no-strings hookups , came in at 133,000 .
The Sears store on IBM's Innovation Island had a traffic score of 281 ; Coke 's Virtual Thirst pavilion , a mere 27 .
And even when corporate destinations actually draw people , the PR can be less than ideal .
Last winter , CNET 's in - world correspondent was conducting a live interview with Anshe Chung , an avatar said to have earned more than $ 1 million on virtual real estate deals , when Chung was assaulted by flying penises in a griefer attack .
One of the things you never see in Second Life is a genuine crowd — largely because the technology makes it impossible .
In Stephenson 's Metaverse , corporations established their presence along a bustling , almost infinitely long street that residents could cruise at will .
Second Life is different .
Created by an underfunded startup using a physics engine that 's now years out of date , Second Life is made up of thousands of disconnected " regions " ( read : processors ) , most of which remain invisible unless you explicitly search for them by name .
Residents can reach these places only by teleporting into the void .
And even the popular islands are never crowded , because each processor on Linden Lab 's servers can handle a maximum of only 70 avatars at a time ; more than that and the service slows to a crawl , some avatars disappear , or the island simply vanishes .
" It 's really the software 's fault , " says Andrew Meadows , Linden Lab 's senior developer .
" Way back when , we used to say , ' This is not going to scale . ' "
Blank new world : Desolate corporate headquarters in second life .
* Illustrations by Eddie Guy * __And yet , so eager __are corporate marketers to get in that a small industry has sprung up to help .
Business appears to be good — very good .
" We have basically not made any sales calls , " says Sibley Verbeck , founder and CEO of the Electric Sheep Company , which has built in - world presences for such clients as AOL , Major League Baseball , the NBA , Nissan , Pontiac , and Sony BMG Music .
" We would like to .
But we can hardly keep up with the Fortune 500 companies that are contacting us . "
From an obscure background in computational linguistics , Verbeck has emerged as perhaps the world 's leading evangelist for Second Life business opportunities .
Dressed in blue jeans and a flannel shirt , his long , dark hair flowing from beneath a wide - brimmed black hat , he looks like a diminutive New Age lumberjack .
But Verbeck is also oddly charismatic , with an almost messianic belief in the potential of virtual worlds .
Electric
Sheep launched with the mission of promoting Second Life by developing software to make the experience less clunky and off - putting .
Bringing in big corporations was a way of generating money and adding new in - world attractions .
Marketers were n't interested at first , but that changed after the May 2006 BusinessWeek story and Rosedale 's appearance at Sun Valley a couple of months later .
" By September , it was crazy , " says Giff Constable , an investment banker who joined Electric Sheep after falling in love with Second Life .
" A lot of people who missed MySpace said , ' You know what ?
We should n't let that happen again . ' "
What do marketers want when they call Electric Sheep ?
" They do n't know , " Verbeck says .
" Mostly it 's ' We 've been reading about virtual worlds — is there anything there for us ? ' "
Almost inevitably , the answer is yes .
The cost varies greatly : A company can stage an in - world speaking event for as little as $ 10,000 , but hiring Electric Sheep or one of its competitors to create a full - time presence , with a private island and a lot of virtual construction , could run several hundred thousand dollars a year .
( Linden Lab leases virtual land to cover its server costs but does n't take a cut of what companies spend establishing their presence there . )
Opt for a really elaborate build , hold frequent events to keep people coming back , and hire an employee or two to keep things running , and the budget could easily hit $ 500,000 a year .
Joseph Jaffe , the marketing consultant who advised Coke on its in - world presence , dismisses the notion that such efforts might not be worthwhile .
" The learning is now , " Jaffe says .
" You are a pioneer , and with that comes first - mover advantage " — that chestnut from the Web 1.0 boom .
And the paltry numbers ?
" This is not about reach anymore .
This is about connecting .
It 's about establishing meaningful , impactful conversations .
So when people ask , ' Why Second Life ? '
I ask ' Why not ? ' "
Jaffe logs on to show off Coke 's Virtual Thirst pavilion , which was created by Millions of Us , a Bay Area company that does in - world builds .
He 's a close match for his avatar , Divo Dapto , a trim little figure clad in roll - up jeans and a red - on - white Virtual Thirst T - shirt .
" You never know who you 're going to meet , " Jaffe says as Dapto soars toward the Virtual Thirst pavilion .
The Coke build is expansive , elaborate , and of course empty .
But Coca - Cola has a plan .
It 's sponsoring a contest to create a Virtual Thirst vending machine that it hopes will become ubiquitous in Second Life , just as Coke machines are everywhere in real life .
Jaffe professes to be overwhelmed by the number of entries , which he characterizes as " well north of 100 . "
Suddenly , another avatar materializes .
" Ah , there you go , " Jaffe exclaims .
" Someone 's just arrived !
I think she 's from Japan . "
As he speaks , Dapto starts air - typing in the weird way that Second Life avatars do , trying to chat up the new Japanese girl .
She looks around , then teleports someplace else .
__You might wonder __what Coke is doing in such a place .
" It had a lot to do with hype , " admits Michael Donnelly .
Still , despite isolated reports of corporate dissatisfaction with Second Life , the influx continues .
Electric
Sheep claims to be turning away business .
IBM has set up a virtual worlds business unit .
Millions of Us , which has also built corporate presences for Intel , Microsoft , Sun , and — full disclosure — Wired , is constructing a virtual Hollywood Hills for show business companies .
What 's behind this stampede is not that hard to divine .
" A terror has gripped corporate America , " says Joseph Plummer , chief research officer at the Advertising Research Foundation , an industry think tank .
Plummer has been around Madison Avenue since the early ' 60s , when modern advertising techniques materialized .
" The simple model they all grew up with " — the 30 - second spot , delivered through the mass reach of television — " is no longer working .
And there are two types of people out there : a small group that 's experimenting thoughtfully , and a large group that 's trying the next thing to come through the door . "
Second Life appeals to the latter — the ones who are afraid of missing out , who do n't consider half a million dollars to be a lot of money , and who have n't figured out ( or do n't want to admit ) that Second Life is less than the bold new frontier it appears to be .
" For people who 've grown up in analog , Second Life is not that hard to understand , " says Rishad Tobaccowala , CEO of Denuo , a consulting arm of the global ad giant Publicis Groupe .
" I have a store in the real world ; I have a store in the virtual world . "
In contrast , the kind of digital marketing that actually works requires a conceptual leap .
Successful online marketing is targeted and specific , like direct mail — but it 's direct mail in a fun house , where the recipients can easily seize control of what the mail says , where it goes next , and how it gets there .
You need to know how to buy up keywords to maximize search returns , how to make the most of recommendation engines , how to use the viral potential of Web video , how to monitor what 's being said in blogs and message boards , how not to blow it by trying to be deceptive .
Building a corporate pavilion in Second Life does n't require any of these things .
It 's simple and it 's obvious .
Virtual worlds will evolve , of course .
It 's easy to imagine targeted in - world advertising , for example , or a 3 - D version of MySpace .
Although it wo n't comment officially , IBM is understood to be working to create a " virtual universe " by building software that will allow avatars to leap from Second Life to World of Warcraft as easily as we now move from Google to Yahoo .
The Internet will eventually be full of such 3 - D environments ; Second Life might even be one of them .
But in the meantime , it 's just slurping up corporate dollars and delivering little in return .
" Companies say , ' It 's an experiment ' — but what are they learning ? " Tobaccowala asks .
" Basically , they 're learning how to create an avatar and walk around in Second Life . "
Which is fine if that 's what you want to do .
Just do n't expect to sell a lot of Coke .

Even as Rudy Giuliani emerges from his campaign ’s first real rough patch , a number of conservative Catholic organizations are in the process of rolling out potentially broad - reaching “ viral ” initiatives with the common aim of denying him the Republican nomination .
A conservative Catholic P.A.C based in a key swing state is planning an anti-Giuliani “ multimedia effort ” for a June debut .
A national network of politically savvy Catholic activists is creating a heavy - hitting Web site — patterned after the controversial Catholics Against Kerry effort in 2004 — scheduled to appear around the same time .
And earlier this month , a disabled vet working out of his home in Blytheville , Ark. , launched an invitation - only “ Stop Rudy ” social - networking site , where Giuliani - haters from across the nation have begun to meet and coordinate real - world planning from behind the protection of a members - only log - in .
“ We ’re not going to hide , ” said Joseph Cella , executive director of the conservative Catholic advocacy group Fidelis .
“ We just want to influence the conversation . ”
The emergence of the groups at this point in the campaign seems to have been motivated in equal parts by Mr. Giuliani ’s worst moment as a Presidential candidate and his best .
His painfully equivocal answer to a question about Roe v. Wade at a May 3 Republican debate angered them .
His subsequent dramatic recovery at the next debate on May 15 — at which the former Mayor turned in a winningly aggressive performance on the subject of Sept. 11 — scared them into action .
Fidelis America , the political - action committee of Fidelis , is arguably the best - established of the anti-Rudy organizations , and it ’s certainly the most open about its overall strategy .
A Michigan - based Catholic organization cleverly designed to navigate the tangle of federal campaign - spending restrictions , the group ’s various arms have been registered as political - action committees , independent - expenditure committees and nonprofits .
The organization , whose executive director previously headed the Ave Maria List , a nonprofit political entity founded by Domino ’s Pizza magnate Thomas Monaghan , is perhaps best known for alleging bias when CNN refused to run one of their issue ads featuring Mother Teresa , but later ran a spot by the pro-choice group NARAL .
Fidelis promptly launched an e-mail campaign that crashed the network ’s servers within hours .
Fidelis also claims credit for spearheading the development of WithdrawMiers.org , a site that registered more than two million hits during the ideologically moderate former White House counsel ’s failed bid for a Supreme Court slot .
Mr. Cella says that the organization will try to provide a comprehensive , Web - based “ clearinghouse ” of issue - based opposition research , and that it will also engage in the distribution of more traditional negative literature , as when the group recruited a handful of volunteers to network and pass out its anti-Rudy materials at the South Carolina debate earlier this month .
“ More is afoot — not just from us , but others , ” said Mr. Cella , who has also served as an editor at the popular conservative Web site Redstate.com .
“ It will be edgy .
Creative .
Hard - hitting . ”
A separate effort from another group of Catholic activists — to operate under the admirably straightforward title of Catholics Against Rudy — will also take aim at Mr. Giuliani ’s record on social issues .
It ’s the brainchild of Georgia lawyer Steve Dillard , best known as the formerly anonymous voice of Southern Appeal , a conservative Catholic legal blog that drew a wide - ranging , fiercely loyal audience until Mr. Dillard outed himself and subsequently retired the site five months ago .
Mr. Dillard , along with other bloggers , commentators and activists who are planning to participate in the effort , are modeling their project on the headline - grabbing Catholics Against Kerry site that targeted the Democratic nominee three years ago .
( Organizers say that none of the individuals involved in that operation are principals in the new effort . )
“ It ’s not a vast right - wing conspiracy , ” said Mr. Dillard , “ but if you ’re active on these issues , you build up networks of people who share your concerns , who are very involved , and who have very significant followings .
These are n’t just ‘ likely voters ’— these are very serious , die - hard activists .
And they all have readers and supporters . ”
Visitors to the new site , he said , will find themselves at a one - stop shop of anti-Rudy messaging , material and merchandise , including anti-Rudy bumper stickers , T - shirts and other assorted items .
( They will be sold at cost to avoid any kind of potential profit — and the F.E.C. scrutiny that would undoubtedly bring . )

May 17 , 2007  -- World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz has resigned his post , effective June 30 .
An internal panel tasked with investigating the lucrative pay and promotion package Wolfowitz arranged in 2005 for girlfriend Shaha Riza found him guilty of breaking bank rules .
The committee also found that he tried to hide the salary and promotion package from top ethics and legal officials within the bank .
The report added that there is a " crisis in the leadership " at the World Bank .
Wolfowitz is the first World Bank president to ever leave the bank under a cloud of scandal .
Wolfowitz : Girlfriend ' Angry and Upset '
Wolfowitz lost the fight to keep his job after months of controversy surrounding his involvement with securing his girlfriend a pay raise and promotion .
The controversy set off a media firestorm , with questions swirling about the current status of Wolfowitz 's relationship with girlfirend Shaha Riza , and it 's unclear whether they are still together .
Wolfowitz has defended the pay package , telling the bank 's investigative committee he was trying to avoid a potential lawsuit from Riza .
" Ms. Riza was extremely angry and upset about being required to take an external placement , " Wolfowitz wrote in a May 11 statement to the World Bank investigative committee .
Riza had been a World Bank employee for eight years , promoting women and democracy in the Middle East , when Wolfowitz was named president of the institution in 2005 .
The Bank 's ethics committee determined Riza needed to leave the bank when Wolfowitz took control to avoid a conflict of interest .
" I was not given a choice to stay , and against my personal and professional interests , I agreed to accept an external assignment , " said Riza in an April 30 written statement to the bank panel investigating her raise and promotion package .
" The irony of my working to ensure women 's participation and rights through the work of the World Bank and [ was ] stripped of my own rights by this same institution , " Riza wrote .
Under a lucrative compensation package that Wolfowitz arranged with the vice president of human resources at the World Bank , Riza was moved to the State Department and given a promotion to communications specialist , but the World Bank still retained her on its payroll .
Her income jumped from $ 133,000 to $ 193,590 in just two years -- more money than Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice makes before taxes .
" I was ready to pursue legal remedies . …
I only acquiesced to signing the agreement so as not to cause turmoil at the bank , " Riza wrote in the April 30 statement to bank officials .
' Architect ' of Iraq War
At several points in the scandal , the Bush administration insisted Wolfowitz stay on as bank president .
" Wolfowitz has acknowledged mistakes and apologized for them , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto told ABC News Tuesday morning .
" We do n't believe that actions warrant a change of leadership at the World Bank . "
But just hours later a senior White House official told ABC News that " all options are on the table " regarding Paul Wolfowitz 's future and that " it is an open question " whether he should should remain as president of the World Bank .
" If you do n't have board support and you do n't have staff support , it is hard to get anything done , " the official told ABC News .
In his daily briefing , White House spokesman Tony Snow , who had previously called Wolfowitz 's actions " not a firing offense , continued to publicly proclaim White House support for Wolfowitz Wednesday but deflected questions on whether the administration would object if the embattled World Bank president resigned .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. placed calls to their counterparts in Europe to defend Wolfowitz .
Vice President Dick Cheney also spoke highly of Wolfowitz this week in an interview on Fox News from Jordan , calling him " one of the most able public servants I 've ever known . "
Wolfowitz worked in former President George H.W. Bush 's administration as undersecretary for defense policy from 1989 to 1993 under then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney .
He played a key role in reshaping U.S. military strategy after the end of the Cold War and reviewing strategy for the Gulf War in Iraq .
Dubbed the " architect " of the Iraq War , Wolfowitz was deputy secretary of defense from 2001 to 2005 .
Responsible for Iraq
War planning , he , along with a group of fellow neo-conservatives , advocated the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq following the Sept. 11 attacks .
World Bank Turmoil
The scandal has topped a long list of complaints within the World Bank about Wolfowitz 's managerial style .
Some of the institution 's top managers have openly called for Wolfowitz to resign in recent weeks .
Highlighting the souring relationship between Wolfowitz and the World Bank board of directors , his top aide , Kevin Kellems , resigned May 7 .
Kellems moved with Wolfowitz from the Pentagon to the World Bank , serving as a senior adviser and director of external relations strategy at the bank .
Critics said Kellems and another top Wolfowitz aide , Robin Cleveland , were considered by bank staff to be more loyal to Bush administration policy than to the international development mission of the bank .
In a statement to the press , Kellems cited poor working conditions inside the bank for his departure .
" Given the current environment surrounding the leadership of the World Bank Group , it is very difficult to be effective in helping to advance the mission of the institution , " Kellems ' statement read .
Taking on the job in 2005 , Wolfowitz vowed to rid developing countries receiving World Bank aid of government corruption by bypassing their administrations .
But when the scandal broke , critics said Wolfowitz 's anti-corruption message was hypocritical and called for his resignation .
" The orchestrated leaks of false , misleading , incomplete and personal information about me and Ms. Riza are all part of a conscious campaign to undermine my effectiveness as president and derail important programs of the bank to aid the poor , especially in Africa , " read an April 30 statement by Wolfowitz .
European Countries Pressured for the Removal of Wolfowitz
Before Wolfowitz 's run as World Bank chief , a coalition of leading European countries mounted a campaign to stop the practice of allowing the United States to select the World Bank president .
The U.S. government is given control over who serves as president to the World Bank , because it gives the bank the most money for its financing .
However , European officials indicated to the Bush administration in early May that they would allow the United States to choose the bank 's next chief if Wolfowitz would step down .
The selection of Wolfowitz in 2005 as president drew criticism from European officials , however France and Germany went along , hoping to heal the rifts left from their opposition to the Iraq War .
However in April , Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel , as European Union chief , called for Wolfowitz to resign , saying she needed to reflect the majority view of European countries .
Many of Wolfowitz 's early critics were dismayed that an official so closely tied to the Iraq War would lead the world 's anti-poverty institution .
Activists Urged World Bank to Fire Wolfowitz
An international activist group staged a rally outside the World Bank on May 9 , demanding the development institution let Wolfowitz go .
Unfurling a banner that read " World to Bank : Fire Wolfowitz , " about two dozen activists from Avaaz.org chanted " Unless he quits , fire Wolfowitz ! "
At a nearby park , World Bank employees on their lunch break watched the rally and voiced their feelings about the controversy .
Everybody is demoralized , we all want a swift resolution , " said Mark , a World Bank employee who refused to give his last name .
" He 's been standing on this pillar about anti-corruption and governance and it's kind of hypocritical , " said another employee .
Some employees pinned blue ribbons to their briefcases and purses ; the ribbons were given to them by their staff association to signify that " good governance " was still a key principle at the bank .

On a humid afternoon , an hour or two after lunch , Nadi al - Attar , 12 , set off on a donkey - drawn cart with his grandmother Khariya and two of his young cousins to pick figs from a small orchard near their home in northern Gaza .
Ahmed , 17 , one of the cousins , remembers the moment when the shell struck , but pauses as he tells his story to nervously rub the muscles at the top of his thighs .
The shell that hit their cart that afternoon sliced off his left leg just above the knee and his right leg halfway up his calf .
He still has an aching pain in his bandaged stumps .
They had stopped the cart and two of the boys jumped off .
" They went to collect something , some metal bars , and then they came back to the cart , " he said .
The boys hoped to sell the strips of metal for scrap .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) later determined that the metal came from a launcher for a Qassam , one of the crude rockets launched by Palestinian militants from Gaza into Israel .
Qassams had been fired from the area that morning , though the militants had since left .
" Then the shell struck .
I saw my mother [ Khariya ] dead and Nadi killed .
I saw them dead on the ground , " Ahmed said .
" I looked down and then I saw my legs were cut away . "
Human rights field workers believe an artillery shell , fired from an Israeli military position not far away at the border with the Gaza Strip , hit the cart .
Several were fired that day , July 24 - one day in a long and damaging Israeli military operation .
" I think it happened because of the metal we were collecting , " Ahmed said .
" But we were just going to the farm . "
He was taken to hospital with another cousin , Shadi , who was wounded in the stomach by shrapnel .
Nadi and Khariya , 58 , were killed instantly .
" We had lunch together , " said Nadi 's father , Habib , 36 .
" Then he went with his grandmother and never came back . "
The deaths are not an isolated case .
For the past two months , while the world 's attention in the Middle East has been focused on the conflict in Lebanon , the Israeli military has led a wave of intense operations along the length of the Gaza Strip .
It began after the capture of an Israeli soldier , Corporal Gilad Shalit , by Palestinian militants on June 25 .
The Israeli military said its operations were intended to free Cpl Shalit and to halt Qassam rocket fire .
Early on the Israelis bombed Gaza 's only power plant and they have kept Gaza 's crossing points to Israel and Egypt closed for most of the time .
Since the start of the operation , codenamed Summer Rain , at least 240 Palestinians have been killed .
One in five were children .
According to the PCHR , which has investigated each case , 197 of the dead were civilians and the vast majority were killed in Gaza .
Among them were 12 women and 48 children .
Yesterday an Israeli military spokesman said his forces did not target civilians .
" Our actions are targeted only at terrorist organisations , terror activities and infrastructure , " he said .
" It can happen that innocent people are hit .
But the responsibility does not lie with the Israeli army , but rather with the terror groups who are working within civilian populations without any regard to the danger they are causing . "
More than two months into the Gaza operation Israel has still not secured the release of Cpl Shalit or stopped Qassam rocket fire .
" We believe that the whole offensive against the Gaza Strip is characterised by being an act of revenge and retaliation in which civilians are paying the price , " said Hamdi Shaqqura , a founder member of the PCHR in Gaza City .
" They have demonstrated total disregard for the rights of innocent Palestinian civilians .
There has been an excessive use of force , a disproportionate use of force in civilian areas , and that explains the high toll of death . "
Mr Shaqqura also condemned the Palestinian militants for launching the Qassams and for firing them from civilian areas .
" This is illegal and we have called on them to stop , " he said .
Many relatives of those killed by the Israelis in Gaza have been equally critical of the rocket attacks .
" We get nothing out of it , " said Muhammad al - Attar , 23 , another of Nadi 's cousins .
" After they launch rockets we get killed and they destroy our farms . "
A few hours after the donkey cart was hit a shell was fired into Beit Hanoun , another district of northern Gaza .
It killed Khitam Tayeh , 11 , who was on her way to the shops after school with her sister Nuha , 12 .
Nuha was hit by a piece of shrapnel in her left thigh , but survived .
Khitam had a severe head injury and died in hospital .
" I carried her in from the ambulance and took her to the operating room in my arms , " said her father , Muhammad 48 .
" Then she died .
They could n't do anything . "
He showed several framed photographs of his daughter , with long dark hair and wide brown eyes .
Two bright stars had been superimposed in the background .
Mr Tayeh has collected a box of shrapnel from the scene , a couple of dozen sharp , rigid shards of metal , each three or four inches long , and talks of bringing a legal case against the Israeli military .
Like many , a year ago he had hoped that life in Gaza would improve when Israeli settlers were withdrawn , in what seemed a ground - breaking move .
" People expected it would get better , but it 's been the opposite , " he said .
" Do n't tell me they withdrew .
It 's like they did n't leave .
They are everywhere . "
On the eastern side of Gaza , in Shujaiya , Hussam al - Sirsawi , 12 , was with his friends standing on the street watching Israeli troops fighting against militants in the distance on August 27 .
He was badly injured by a piece of shrapnel and died three days later .
" You know how children are when they hear something happen .
They want to go and see , " said his uncle Nasser al - Sirsawi , 37 .
" I can't say why the Israelis killed him .
These army people are full of hatred .
Maybe these kids went to watch some resistance people and they were in the wrong place .
To kill a child like this is not natural . "
On the wall opposite his cloth shop there is graffiti dedicated to his nephew .
" Hussam , " it says , " we swear to God you won . "
" Of course , " said his uncle , " he 's a martyr . "
Two days later there was another incident in Shujaiya , when again a group of children were watching the fighting .
Either a tank shell or a large chunk of shrapnel flew at them and hit Muhammad al - Ziq , 14 , on the head .
He died instantly .
" I think sometimes they just want the Palestinians to pay , " said his uncle , Ziad al - Ziq , 36 .
" He was with children wanting to see what was happening .
There was no excuse for what happened . "
All of the dead and most of the injured pass through the Shifa hospital in Gaza City .
Staff photograph the bodies of the dead - they call the victims " martyrs " - and document their injuries .
Juma 'a al - Saqqa called up a picture on his computer screen of Muhammad al - Ziq , an appalling image of the boy lying on his side on a metal morgue table , the side of his head sliced away .
In the past two months the hospital 's doctors have dealt with 1,280 injured from the military operations , a third of whom were children .
The doctors performed 60 amputations .
Dr Saqqa flicks through the photographic record , images of bodies charred beyond recognition , flesh no longer human in form .
Many of the figures were young children , at least one in a shredded blue school uniform .
" We have passed through the worst situation we have ever come across in our years of work , " he said .
" But this is our situation .
What can we do ?
We raised our voices to the world , but nobody moves . "
My previous entry , Twitter : Service vs. Platform , was widely misunderstood .
I suppose I only have myself to blame , so I 'll try to clarify with another example .
Consider Reddit .
The Reddit development team switched from Lisp to Python late in 2005 :
If Lisp is so great , why did we stop using it ?
One of the biggest issues was the lack of widely used and tested libraries .
Sure , there is a CL library for basically any task , but there is rarely more than one , and often the libraries are not widely used or well documented .
Since we 're building a site largely by standing on the shoulders of others , this made things a little tougher .
There just are n't as many shoulders on which to stand .
On that note , if you have been considering writing a web application in Lisp , go for it .
It will be tough if you 're not already a Lisper , but you will learn a lot along the way , and it will be worth it I am sure .
Lisp is especially great for projects where the end goal is unknown because it 's so easy to steer in different directions .
Lisp will never get in your way , although sometimes the environment will .
Language performance is a red herring .
That 's especially true when we 're comparing dynamic languages like Ruby , Lisp , and Python that will never be known for their high octane , nitro burnin ' performance levels .
I assumed Alex Payne knew that when he chose to specifically call out Ruby language performance , but maybe I assumed wrong .
When you choose a language , like it or not , you 've chosen a platform .
And as Steve so patiently and calmly explained to all the Lisp enthusiasts , the platform around the language , more than the language itself , sets the tone for your development experience .
The availability of common , popular libraries and the maturity of the development environment end up trumping any particular significance the language holds .
That 's why the Reddit switch makes good business sense : they did n't change languages ; they changed platforms .
At the point which your choice of platform starts to jeopardize your service , you switch platforms , exactly as Reddit did .
Your users do n't give a damn what framework and language you 're using .
The only people who care about that stuff are other software developers .
And God help you if your users are software developers ; then you 're really in trouble .
But things are n't all roses in Python - land either .
The Reddit developers initially used a Rails - like web application framework , with decidedly mixed results :
The framework that seems most promising is Django and indeed the authors of reddit initially attempted to rewrite their site in it .
I was curious about their experience , so I carefully followed them along , trying to help them out .
Django seemed great from the outside : a nice - looking website , intelligent and talented developers , and a seeming surplus of nice features .
The developers and community are extremely helpful and responsive to patches and suggestions .
And all the right goals are espoused in their philosophy documents and FAQs .
Unfortunately , however , they seem completely incapable of living up to them .
While Django claims that it's " loosely coupled " , using it pretty much requires fitting your code into Django 's worldview .
Django insists on executing your code itself , either through its command - line utility or a specialized server handler called with the appropriate environment variables and Python path .
When you start a project , by default Django creates folders nested four levels deep for your code and while you can move around some files , I had trouble figuring out which ones and how .
Django 's philosophy says " Explicit is better than implicit " , but Django has all sorts of magic .
Database models you create in one file magically appear someplace else deep inside the Django module with a different name .
When your model function is called , new things have been added to its variable - space and old ones removed .
( I 'm told they 're currently working on fixing both of these , though . )
Note that any analogies I 'm drawing between Rails and Django here are purely intentional .
Not that there 's anything wrong with adopting a web application framework .
But at least in Python you have a choice of web application frameworks .
Instead of investing in the Django worldview , the Reddit team decided that the lighter weight web.py better suited their needs .
Similarly , some ASP.NET developers reject the entire page lifecycle model , preferring to write their own HttpHandlers and HttpModules for finer - grained control over what 's happening on their website .
And that 's fine ; the ASP.
NET platform accommodates both camps of developers .
It 's true that Twitter represents an extreme case , but it sure looks like the Twitter developers could benefit from a choice of web application frameworks , too .
In the end , it 's about choice and flexibility .
Not just in the language , but in the platform that inevitably comes along with any language .
FIVE MILLION e-mails were lost by the White House according to a just released report from CREW called " WITHOUT A TRACE : The Missing White House Emails and the Violations of the Presidential Records Act . "
FIVE MILLION ... that 's insane .
As I explained in the post below , Bush staffers have been already been using separate RNC e-mail accounts to conduct official business in order to avoid the law and hide evidence .
How ?
Because White House officials are supposed to use White House email accounts and White House Blackberrys to conduct official business ( this is required under federal law and under the White House 's own explicit rules ) .
That 's because under federal law every single electronic communication of a White House official must be recorded and kept in the federal archives .
That makes such communications subpoenable if and when those employees break the law .
By using the RNC email system and the RNC Blackberrys the White House thought they were hiding their potential crimes , and in so doing were violating federal law .
We learned only yesterday that the White House admitted that their employees destroyed countless emails .
Now we know that by countless they meant 5 fricking million .
While nothing should shock us about the Bush administration anymore , this is shocking .
No wonder the Bush people can't run the country and can't come up with a plan for the war .
They can't even figure out their own e-mail system ( of course , they knew darn well what they were doing , they were destroying the evidence ) .
They even knew it was a problem , but did n't bother to fix it .
You know that a lot of those missing e-mails are things they do n't want us to ever see .
What a coincidence that they started losing those e-mails in March of 2003 , right when the Iraq war was starting .
FIVE MILLION .
He is truly the worst , and now most corrupt , president ever .
He 's even worse than any of us could have dreamed up .
ARE WE A NATION of irrational wimps ?
Rudy Giuliani thinks so .
On Tuesday , he claimed that if we elect a Democrat to the presidency , we should expect more 9/11 - style attacks .
This , he assumes , is enough to scare the pants off the voting public and send them scurrying frantically off to support Republicans such as ... well , Rudy Giuliani .
Giuliani ’s line of argument -- though “ argument ” is too generous a word -- is n’t new .
Since 9/11 , our political leaders have proceeded on the assumption that Americans are cringing , cowardly souls more than ready , when we hear the word “ terrorism , ” to suspend our critical capacities , mortgage our futures and jettison our civil liberties and our principles -- all for impossible assurances of “ safety . ”
The awful thing is , many of us obediently conformed to this condescending stereotype .
The United States is the most prosperous and powerful nation in the world , but after 9/11 , many of us started to act as if we ’re in danger of imminent extinction .
We ’re not .
The 9/11 attacks were appalling and tragic , but they did not threaten the survival of the nation .
The year 2001 aside , total deaths ( not just of Americans ) caused by international terrorism worldwide have never exceeded -- or even approached -- 2,000 a year .
Sept. 11 was an outlier :
On 9/11 , a group of brutal , extremist Islamic thugs got very lucky .
Even Osama bin Laden could n’t have imagined that the Twin Towers would collapse , killing nearly 3,000 people .
Advertisement
Of course , 3,000 dead is 3,000 too many .
But keep it in perspective .
As a nation , we have survived far worse .
We lost more than 100,000 Americans in World War I , more than 400,000 in World War II , 37,000 in Korea , 58,000 in Vietnam -- all without allowing our national character to turn into quivering jelly .
Every year , we also lose millions of Americans to preventable accidents and disease .
We ’re more likely to die on the road than as a result of Al Qaeda ’s machinations .
Annually , we lose some 43,000 people to auto accidents .
For the grieving families , that ’s 43,000 deaths too many .
But , although we surely could reduce auto fatalities if we chose to make it our top national priority , the Bush administration has yet to announce a “ War on Highway Deaths . ”
After 9/11 , the Republican line was that all future terror attacks on U.S. soil must be prevented at any cost .
That ’s the line Giuliani was parroting this week , but its effectiveness hinges on our collective willingness to let fear swamp our capacity to reason .
Contrast the Republican response to 9/11 with the Republican response to the Virginia Tech massacre .
After the shootings , when many commentators suggested that we might consider tighter gun control regulations , most GOP leaders were outraged :
The right to bear arms is sacred !
The massacre did n’t occur because guns are easy to obtain but because the shooter was mentally disturbed , and if he had n’t had access to guns , he ’d have found some other way to kill people !
No legislation can completely protect us against maniacs !
Advertisement
In a way , they ’re right .
Not about every detail -- their interpretation of the 2nd Amendment is dubious , and stricter gun regulations might at least reduce the frequency of mass shootings .
But they ’re right to say that the cost of eliminating some harms may be just too high .
And in the end , not every harm can be prevented .
We probably could reduce school shootings by making schools resemble “ supermax ” prisons , but is that what we want ?
Anyway , then homicidal maniacs would just start shooting up shopping malls instead .
Take away the guns , and sooner or later someone may well decide to make a Molotov cocktail .
To quote Donald Rumsfeld , “ Stuff happens . ”
Giuliani ’s right ; if we elect a Democrat to the presidency , there will likely be future terrorist attacks on the United States .
But there will likely be attacks under Republicans as well .
There will always be people who want to hurt us , and some of them will succeed .
We can take sensible , clearheaded precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks , but we need to coolly assess the trade - offs and recognize that we can’t entirely eliminate all risk .
Ironically , just as Giuliani was suggesting that presidents should be evaluated on their ability to keep terrorist attacks down to zero , President Bush was insisting on the opposite principle -- at least when it comes to Iraq .
Expressing frustration with those who see the continued bombings in Iraq as evidence of administration failures , he insisted that some level of violence is “ acceptable . ”
When the interviewer asked if he was saying that “ zero violence ” is an unattainable goal , Bush agreed : " [ I ] f the standard of success is no
George and Rudy , you guys really need to talk .

How Does The Hacker Economy Work ?
It 's a murky world of chat rooms , malware factories , and sophisticated phishing schemes .
Here 's a look inside .
When retailer TJX disclosed Jan. 17 that the computer systems that store data related to credit card , debit card , check , and merchandise return transactions had been broken into , it said it had discovered the hack in December .
But security officials at Visa had been seeing an increase in fraudulent activity on credit and debit cards related to TJX properties , such as T.J. Maxx , Marshalls , and HomeGoods stores , since mid-November .
That means it 's possible the purloined consumer data has been floating around the Internet , available for purchase on black market Web sites and chat rooms , for at least two months , maybe longer .
Hacking is n't a kid 's game anymore .
It 's big business .
Online black markets are flush with stolen credit card data , driver 's license numbers , and malware , the programs that let hackers exploit the security weaknesses of commercial software .
Cybercriminals have become an organized bunch ; they use peer - to - peer payment systems just like they 're buying and selling on eBay , and they 're not afraid to work together .
While the independent hacker still exists ( pardon us , but in this story , we 'll refer to " hacker " in the layman 's sense ) , the FBI sees true organized crime in parts of the hacking community , particularly in Eastern Europe , says special agent Chris Stangl , who works in the bureau 's cybercrime division , the agency 's third largest behind counter - terrorism and intelligence .
" You 'll have hackers cracking the machines , individuals collecting the data , and individuals selling for profit , " Stangl says .
Getting a clear picture of the hacker economy is n't easy .
It 's a murky underground about which few people are willing to talk on the record .
But the general outlines can be gleaned from inside and outside sources .
It 's not a crime to point out vulnerabilities on the Net , making malware hard to prosecute , says eEye 's Maiffret .
Some hackers take the direct approach .
Ransom scams -- in which a criminal infects a company 's systems with malware that encrypts data and then demands money to provide the decryption key - - are common in Russia .
Uriel Maimon , a researcher with the consumer division of RSA , a security vendor now owned by EMC , says he 's seen a half - dozen of these scams over the past five months .
But in the scheme of things , those kinds of scams are n't all that common because they 're risky -- they require " a direct financial connection between the victim and the author or proprietor of the malware , " says David Dagon , a researcher with the Georgia Tech Information Security Center .
More omnipresent is the thriving black market in data .
Online sites abound where credit and debit card numbers , cardholder names , and the card verification value , a three - or four - digit code that 's used to verify a card 's authenticity , can be bought and sold .
Jeff Moss , who goes by the handle " The Dark Tangent " and is the founder of Black Hat , a security research and training firm ( owned by Information Week parent CMP ) , says he knows of one European cyberattacker who makes nearly a half - million dollars annually buying and selling databases and customer lists .

Story Highlights • California 's outspoken governor takes aim at Rush Limbaugh on " Today Show "
• Limbaugh has said Arnold Schwarzenegger lacks right leadership skills
• " Irrelevant " comment could indicate Limbaugh 's power and influence is fading
Adjust font size :
SACRAMENTO , California ( CNN ) -- Rush Limbaugh likes to call himself " The Most Dangerous Man in America " because critics have long worried about how his powerful radio show shapes the political landscape .
And then came California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who frankly told " The Today Show " Tuesday that " Limbaugh is irrelevant . "
" I 'm not his servant , " Schwarzenegger said .
" I am the people 's servant of California . "
( Watch Schwarzenegger say Limbaugh is unimportant )
It was a shot aimed at Limbaugh 's loaded term for Schwarzenegger -- " closet liberal . "
" I do n't know what happened to Arnold , " the conservative talker said on his radio show .
" He obviously did n't have the leadership skills to articulate conservative principles and win over the public as Reagan did . "
Some political observers said Schwarzenegger 's smackdown is a sign Limbaugh is not the dominant force he once was .
Back in the day , his was the only conservative voice on the airways .
Now he 's one of many .
But others say Limbaugh 's power has always been a myth .
" For all of his power and all of his fame , Rush Limbaugh , during his ascent in the '90s , bashing Bill Clinton on a daily basis , hours on the radio every day coast to coast , was not able to un-elect Bill Clinton , " said Michael Harrison of Talkers Magazine , a trade magazine for talk radio .
Conservatives credit Limbaugh for the Republican takeover of congress in ' 94 .
But , Harrison said , Limbaugh is struggling now that his party has lost power to the Democrats -- and because there is no leading Republican candidate he can tout wholeheartedly on his radio show .
" They 're good guys , they 're Republicans , but they 're not conservatives , " Limbaugh said of the candidates .
" I happen to be a conservative , and I happen to be oriented toward conservative triumph , and conservatism wo n't triumph if we water it down and dilute it and say that people are 60 percent conservative or whatever , happen to be the definition of new conservative . "
None of this means you 'll hear any Republican running for president disrespecting Limbaugh -- they 're still in the business of not offending anyone with as wide a following as Limbaugh has .
Although he 's a Republican , Schwarzenegger -- who can't run for president because of the Constitution 's ban on foreign - born presidents -- is free to say what he pleases .
Jason Hickner , a DIY 'er with possibly more " time " on his hands than most , has created a clock which is not very easy to read , but a lot of fun to look at .
Using a Propeller chip ( as featured in the XGS Hydra ) and what appears to be a oscilloscope ( but is actually a wild old Sony TV ) , Mr. Hickner has hard - coded a Space Invaders timepiece .
The clock uses the attacking aliens to represent minutes , and the extra lives in the left - hand corner for the hours .
It 's unclear whether or not shooting the aliens produces any type of time - dampening or reversal effect , but since this is based around the Propeller chip , it seems likely .

Gonzales ' no confidence ' vote set for June in Senate David Edwards
Published : Friday May 25 , 2007 Print This Email This After President Bush backed his beleaguered Attorney General again on Thursday , Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee announced that they would be scheduling a " no- confidence " vote on Alberto Gonzales in mid-June .
" It is the sense of the Senate that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and of the American people , " the measure sponsored by Senators Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) and Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) reads .
At a Thursday press conference , Schumer said , " I think we hoped that it would never come to this .
We would have liked the attorney general to have stepped down on his own .
But the rule of law has been trampled .
Confidence in the Department of Justice has been shattered , and leadership is virtually nonexistent .
It 's one of the most important agencies our government has .
The rule of law is what our democracy is all about .
And when people lose their ultimate faith in those , something has to change , and it is our obligation to do everything we can to bring that change about . "
While Schumer admitted that " we have n't done a whip count , " he said he did n't " know of a single Democrat who is not voting for it . "
And noting that six Republican senators have called on Gonzales to resign , Schumer said there was a " good chance " the " no- confidence " measure might get sixty votes .
The following May 24 video is from The Associated Press .
RAW STORY provided additional coverage of the Thursday press conference , including the text of the Senators ' resolution , as well .
Full transcript of press conference announcing the measure : # SEN .
SCHUMER : Good afternoon , everybody .
I 'm proud to be joined by my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee : Senator Feinstein and Senator Whitehouse .
And we 're here today to announce that we have talked to Senator Reid and that there will be a vote of no confidence in the attorney general that will take place after the conclusion of the debate on the immigration bill .
I think we hoped that it would never come to this .
We would have liked the attorney general to have stepped down on his own .
But the rule of law has been trampled .
Confidence in the Department of Justice has been shattered , and leadership is virtually nonexistent .
It 's one of the most important agencies our government has .
The rule of law is what our democracy is all about .
And when people lose their ultimate faith in those , something has to change , and it is our obligation to do everything we can to bring that change about .
Yesterday Monica Goodling 's testimony before the House only intensified the need for a new attorney general .
Former FEMA
Director Mike Brown used to be the symbol of the administration 's lack of competence and credibility , but now , unfortunately , there 's a new one .
I know the president thinks Attorney General Gonzales is doing " a heck of a job , " but nobody else seems to agree .
Let me recap very briefly what we learned yesterday .
First we learned , by Miss Goodling 's own admission , that the Justice Department under Attorney General Gonzales 's watch inappropriately weighed political considerations in hiring career attorneys .
That is unethical .
It 's possibly illegal .
And now we have proof positive that Attorney General Gonzales 's Justice Department was improperly politicized .
Second , we learned from Miss Goodling , who reaffirmed Mr. Sampson 's testimony , that the attorney general made inaccurate public statements about the U.S. attorney purge .
And third and most troubling , we learned from Miss Goodling that Attorney General Gonzales may have misled the Congress when he testified that he did n't talk to witnesses about the issue .
I believe he was asked that in the Judiciary hearings by Senator Grassley .
Miss Goodling testified that the attorney general ran through his events -- sorry .
Miss Goodling testified that the attorney general ran through his version of events in mid-March and asked her for her reaction to it .
That made her , quote , " uncomfortable " -- those are her own words -- in a conversation that appears to have been inappropriate with regard to an ongoing investigation .
Day by day , more lawmakers are coming forward and calling for the attorney general 's resignation .
Republican senators have already expressed little or no confidence in the attorney general 's leadership .
And we cannot allow a few people to be the fall guys when we know by all accounts that the attorney general was directly involved in the process himself .
We fully intend to bring this to a vote .
We believe it will pass .
And for the good of the Justice Department and the rule of law in America , we believe sincerely , firmly , strongly , unwaveringly that this is the right thing to do .
Some have suggested this is about politics .
That is not fair .
That is not right .
That is not answering the issues .
I was at the airport the other day .
Two young people came over to me .
They said , " We are new U.S. attorneys in an office in this country . "
They said , " Thank you for doing what you 're doing .
Our whole office is behind you . "
If new recruits serving their country are greatly worried about the future of the Justice Department which they 've agreed to serve , then we all should be .
( Audio break ) -- that first , here 's what our resolution will say .
It has no preamble .
We do n't want to get into the whys and whereases and we just want it to be straightforward .
It says , quote : " Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , it is the sense of the Senate that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and of the American people . "
It 's unfortunate that it has come to this .
And I will say this : I hope , as our colleague and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has suggested -- Senator Specter , that is -- that the attorney general will realize that stepping down is the right thing to do and will do so before we have to cast our vote .
But make no mistake about it ; we are moving forward .
When a situation becomes so serious that there is a crisis in leadership of this magnitude , a Congress not only has the right to weigh in , we have a responsibility to take action , and we will .
Senator Feinstein .
SEN .
FEINSTEIN : Thank you very much , Chuck .
Five months ago I first went to the Senate floor to raise the specter that a certain number of United States attorneys had been fired without cause .
At that time we had only an inkling that something was amiss .
Why were they fired ?
We did n't know .
Was the Bush administration trying to replace them without going through the Senate confirmation process ?
We did n't know .
Were there more ?
Was it political ?
Was it related to corruption investigations ?
How much did the attorney general know ?
Well , we 've uncovered much over these past five months , and what we 've learned is deeply troubling .
Whether it was the testimony of Monica Goodling before the House yesterday , a young , 33 - year - old woman with no law enforcement experience , interviewing and making political judgments about career hires for the Justice Department .
Whether it was Ms. Goodling relating a story about how the attorney general described his recollections of what had occurred in a way that made her feel uncomfortable and that was inappropriate .
Whether it was firing without cause a minimum of nine U.S. attorneys , not for performance deficiencies , as was originally stated , but for improper reasons .
Whether it was the firing of U.S. attorneys for failing to pursue voter fraud cases immediately prior to an election -- contrary to department policies .
This morning for the first time I read the Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses , the Sixth Edition , the rules of the Justice Department , and I want to read one sentence to you .
" Most " -- and this is underlined on page
61 -- " Most , if not all .
investigations of an alleged election crime must await the end of the election to which the allegation relates . "
That 's a direct quote .
Or whether it was James Comey pointing out the poor judgment and questionable actions of Alberto Gonzales participating in an attempt to pressure the very sick attorney general , who was in intensive care , to reverse a judgment that had been made that the Terrorist Surveillance Program was illegal -- it has now become clear that the Department of Justice has been subject to political manipulation , and that the attorney general does not have the fortitude to lead the nation 's top law enforcement agency .
This must not be allowed to continue .
The attorney general does not know who selected U.S. attorneys to be fired or why , nor has he taken responsibility for the decisions that went into the compilation of the list ; rather he limits his regrets to not handling the process well .
We 've learned that there was a pervasive politicization of the hiring practices of the Department of Justice .
We 've learned that the attorney general did not have a firm grasp of what his aides were doing .
But it 's more than that .
The Senate has been stonewalled , the Senate has been misled , and the Senate has n't gotten straight answers .
The simple truth is , Attorney General Gonzales has lost the confidence of many of us in the United States Senate .
He is clearly not a strong leader in control of this large and critical department .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Senator -- SEN .
FEINSTEIN : Oh , I -- may I just -- SEN .
SCHUMER : Please .
Please .
SEN .
FEINSTEIN : I have one more thing I 'd like to say .
I 'd like to ask everyone to consider the following editorials .
And they 've cropped up in newspapers all across the country .
San Jose Mercury News , May 23rd .
" Alberto Gonzales 's credibility hits bottom . "
Salt Lake Tribune , May 21st .
" Just go : AG Gonzales too discredited to continue . "
Albuquerque Tribune , May 22nd .
" Time for Gonzales to resign or be fired . "
Pittsburgh -- Petersburg Times , May 20th .
" Attorney general 's exit is long overdue . "
Sacramento Bee , May 18th .
" Gonzales tactics are another disgrace . "
Like Chuck Schumer , I wish it could be otherwise .
I wish that the American people could have faith in our attorney general .
I wish we did n't need to be here today .
But we do , and we 're offering this very simple and straightforward resolution .
It should be passed .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Senator Whitehouse .
SEN .
WHITEHOUSE : First let me salute Senator Schumer and Senator Feinstein for their conduct of this investigation .
As a new senator , it 's been an extraordinary lesson to me to see the bold , determined , astute and wise leadership of Senator Schumer and to see Senator Feinstein , who is so well - prepared at every juncture and so passionate .
It has been a great lesson for me in how to go about being a United States senator , and I 'm really proud that they asked me to join them .
There are traditions at the Department of Justice that this administration has set out to degrade or destroy :
The tradition of homegrown U.S. attorneys from the local district , who have to go back to the district when they 're done and are therefore responsive and accountable .
The tradition of a strict fire wall on discussions about cases between the White House and the Department of Justice .
The tradition of a prestigious honors program run by career officials outside of partisan considerations .
A tradition of nonpartisan hiring of career staff .
And an important tradition of leaving capable U.S. attorneys in place to do their jobs without influence or interference .
And of course also a tradition of truth .
When I spoke to Attorney General Gonzales about this some time ago , I said , " You know , you can't have a Department of Justice unless you first have a department of truth . "
They have told us that these firings were performance - related ; that was not true .
They have told us that the attorney general was not involved in and did n't discuss the firings plan ; that was not true .
They told us the White House was not involved ; that was not true .
They told us that the EARS evaluations are n't pertinent ; that was not true .
They told us that they did n't try to dodge the Senate confirmation process ; that was not true .
They have told us that the attorney general did n't discuss the substance of this with other witnesses during the investigation ; that was not true .
And when the news first came out about the threatening calls to the U.S. attorneys who were going to discuss this matter , they denied that those calls had taken place , and as we found out , that was not true , either .
From my experience in the department , there were also what I would call little smelly telltales of things gone wrong .
One is the sickening degree of deference that some of these e-mails have revealed required of the United States attorneys -- having to tell the department that you 're a company man -- ( chuckles ) -- that should never happen ; having to inform the deputy attorney general that you promise you will be pleasant and respectful in order to get a meeting with the deputy ?
That should never happen .
And the standards that the attorney general has set as to what is improper -- and they say it over and over again -- it had three elements .
One is an attempt to interfere or influence ; two , with a particular case ; three , for an improper partisan purpose .
If that standard rings a bell , it should , because it tracks the elements for criminal obstruction of justice .
And when the Department of Justice , through the attorney general , sets the bar that low for their own conduct , something is seriously wrong .
The Department of Justice is a great institution in American life .
People who love and respect it from many administrations , Republican and Democrat , have expressed concerns over what has happened .
It needs to be put back on its feet again , and it can't be put back on its feet again while Attorney General Gonzales is in charge .
So I 'm very pleased to join with my senior colleagues who have led this investigation in asking that this resolution be passed .
Thank you .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Ready for your questions .
Q Senator , so when will the vote be held , after Memorial Day recess ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Yes .
It 'll be after -- it 'll be right after the immigration bill .
Q ( Off mike ) -- SEN .
SCHUMER : It 's probably the second week we 're back .
Q
Do you have 60 votes to -- SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , we have n't done a whip count , but I do n't know of a single Democrat who is not voting for it .
I have n't done each one , but I 've probably talked to all but a handful .
There are six Republicans who have called for the resignation .
There are about a dozen others who have said quite negative things , so .
Look , you can't announce a vote or count your chickens before they hatch , but I think it 's a very good chance we 'll get the 60 votes .
I do n't know if Dianne or you have a -- SEN .
FEINSTEIN : No , I agree with you .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Yeah ?
Q
Given that your investigation appears to have a long way to go , why bring this to the floor now instead of waiting for its conclusion ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Because justice is precious , because the Justice Department is clearly not being run , because the head of the Justice Department has not really leveled with Congress or the American people , because of everything both my colleagues said .
We 're going to keep -- there are two issues here .
One is the investigation , and that will keep going under Senator Leahy 's leadership with -- you know , we will be at his side .
The second , though , which has already been established , and that is in terms of competence , in terms of credibility .
This nation needs a new attorney general , and it can't afford to wait because justice is too important .
Q Senator Coburn has already -- he announced -- to ( Gonzales ' face ? ) he should resign , but he then announced a new -- ( off mike ) .
He would offer a ( n ) amendment of no confidence of Congress -- ( off mike ) .
Is n't it highly likely that it turns into some sort of political football , each side starts offering amendments , and that you end up with just a -- ( off mike ) ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : If somebody else wants to make this a political football , that 's their business ; to us , it is not .
Those two young U.S. attorneys who came to me , I did n't know if they were Democrats , Republicans , liberals , conservatives , I do n't know what office they worked in .
But this is serious stuff .
We have a resolve in our caucus to pursue it , and we will get a vote on this .
Q ( Off mike . )
SEN .
SCHUMER : We have not yet .
Q ( Off mike . )
SEN .
SCHUMER : It 's because we 're , you know , going to let things settle over the next two weeks and see where people come down .
We did not put in all these " whereas " clauses because we just want to come to the answer .
People may have different ways to get to that answer .
Q Senator , can I ask you about the story that Monica Goodling told yesterday about her meeting in the attorney general 's office that made her uncomfortable ?
Does that rise to the level of witness tampering or any other crime ?
SEN .
FEINSTEIN : Do you want to respond to that ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : We 'll let former U.S. Attorney
Whitehouse answer that one .
SEN .
WHITEHOUSE : I do n't know enough about what actually took place to characterize it .
But it is surprising how often a whiff of obstruction of justice has reared its head in the course of this investigation .
It happened first when I asked the four U.S. attorneys at the hearing what they would have done if a witness of theirs had been approached in the way that the Department of Justice staffer approached Cummins and them about their testimony in Congress .
And they said , well , what we would do is , we would open investigations .
And I said , well , what kind ?
And they said , well , into this conduct .
And I said , you know , for what law ?
And they said , well , obstruction of justice .
The standard of impropriety that Kyle Sampson and the attorney general and the Department of Justice , through its public spokesman , have defined is in effect -- tracks almost exactly the standard for criminal obstruction of justice .
So if we were to look more into the specifics of that conversation , and we found that it was again in the area of obstruction of justice , it would come as no surprise .
There 's been the cloud of that hanging over this entire investigation .
SEN .
FEINSTEIN : I wanted to add one thing :
Why now ?
What I see , and those editorial headlines , I think , illustrated it , was a diminishing credibility of the Department of Justice .
Now if this were some small , out - of - the - way department , that would n't make a difference .
This is a huge department .
And when you see what 's happened with the U.S. attorneys , this is major in scope .
A federal prosecutor is untrammeled in his power , his or her power .
They bring the big federal cases of this nation , the big drug cases , the big mafia - type corruption cases , the big fraud cases .
They have enormous powers .
And once you come to the conclusion that these firings were political in nature or for reasons that are not acceptable reasons , you have to do something about it .
You can not sit by , I believe , and see United States attorneys fired for the wrong reasons , because it deteriorates the entire quality of U.S. attorneys all over this country .
So that 's the reason , in my view , we 're doing it now .
I think all of us have reached the conclusion that these firings were improper .
And we cannot find the smoking gun yet , but they were not done because of performance .
And some of us -- and I do n't know if you were there , Bill , but you were there , Chuck , I was there -- when Mr. McNulty came and briefed us in camera , he clearly said the reasons were performance , and he went through performance reasons for each individual .
These were bogus .
Now , how can one listen to this -- and I think they did this because they did n't think we would ever see these EARS reports , these evaluations .
But we did see the evaluations .
And Bill can tell you , these evaluations are not done by one or two people , they are done by outside teams that come in and evaluate an office .
When all of the performance is excellent -- you heard Mr. Comey , who supervised these attorneys , saying they had excellent performance -- and they 're fired without cause ?
What does this do to U.S. attorneys all across this nation ?
SEN .
WHITEHOUSE : Actually , if you look at Mr. Margolis 's testimony , you actually see that on previous occasions , when this Department of Justice had concerns about the performance of United States attorneys , their first response , when it was genuinely performance related , was actually to call in a special EARS evaluation in order to determine what the real facts were .
So the fact that they are trying to walk away from that in this case is just another thing that -- it just does n't add up .
Q Senator
Whitehouse , you were talking about the elements of an obstruction case .
In addition to the obstruction case , you now have Monica Goodling accusing Paul McNulty of delivering not - fully candid testimony .
Is there a point at which some sort of criminal investigation would be launched , and if not now , what would be that point , from your experience ?
SEN .
WHITEHOUSE : I 'm not sure that I can say .
From my position here as a new senator , what 's important for us to do is to use the powers of Congress to continue to get to the bottom of this so that we can find out truly what happened , so that we can identify the damage that 's been done to the department , so we can assure that that damage is repaired and the department is restored to its former standing .
One of the awkwardnesses about this is that with the attorney general still in place , there is -- I believe he 's appointed the solicitor general to make those determinations in his stead , so the ordinary channels , anyway , for making that kind of a prosecutive determination are not there .
I suspect that the Office of Attorney General -- sorry , the Office of Inspector General report may very well be the sort of key document in the Department of Justice 's determination whether to open a formal criminal investigation .
SEN .
SCHUMER : This is the -- Q Could Senator Schumer answer that question ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Yeah .
Just one other thing I -- Q
You 've called for special counsel before .
SEN .
SCHUMER : I have called for special counsels before .
It 's something I would n't take off the table .
But we want to finish this investigation first , or let it go further .
Our first obligation , as Sheldon said , is to get the Justice Department running again so that people who work in the department and people who are affected by the department , just about every American , has faith in that department again .
There is very little faith in that department right now It 's no reflection the tens of thousands of hard - working men and women in the department .
It is a reflection on the top , where you 've had more than half the top people step down , where the attorney general is not -- has lost his credibility and respect as an attorney general .
And so that 's our first job .
But there will be a time when we 'll have to examine the question of what you do about criminal proceedings when the attorney general may be the wrong person to be in charge of any criminal investigation that might go forward .
Q
Was there anything else in yesterday 's hearing -- SEN .
SCHUMER : This will be the last question .
Q -- any testimony that sparked your interest or makes you more resolute in thinking that there is wrongdoing and it ought to be pursued ?
There was -- SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , look .
Q
There was a conversation she had with the attorney -- SEN .
SCHUMER : Look .
What Monica Goodling testified to , which was using political considerations to determine how new assistant U.S. attorneys are determined , is possibly criminal .
It 's possibly criminal .
And when you ask yourself , well , why did she seek immunity and why did she take the Fifth Amendment -- which is a question people have been asking -- that may well be an explanation .
Thank you .
SEN .
WHITEHOUSE : And do n't forget that George Bush 's deputy attorney general , John Ashcroft 's deputy attorney general , Jim Comey , said that that strikes at the core of the Department of Justice .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Thank you everybody .

Flash drives are getting smaller and smaller , and at the same time their capacity keeps getting bigger and bigger .
All of this means the chances of losing your flash drive , and of that loss being disastrous , keeps rising .

Also , does bowling with the ball compromise the integrity of the data ?
Posted by : Tom at November 26 , 2006 04:36 PM
Of course now you have a USB extension cable to lose !
( Assuming you really use this and it's not " art " )
Posted by : Chris Holt at November 26 , 2006 05:38 PM
You 're not a very creative person , are you Sam ?
You take a USB extension cord , and connect it .

Posted by : Jeff at November 26 , 2006 08:13 PM
I 'd love to see that connected to a Laptop =]
Posted by : Greg at November 26 , 2006 08:19 PM
Simple , you just plug it in , let go , and watch as it rips the USB port from your computer .
Posted by : Trevor at November 26 , 2006 08:47 PM
Works best if your computer is a ball return .
Posted by : Bob at November 26 , 2006 08:51 PM
Ya thats a gr8 idea but whn u want to conect it u need to use one more cable
Posted by : M L B at November 26 , 2006 09:58 PM
What is the capacity of that thing ?
A few terabytes at least ( compared to the size to a thumb - drive ) full of crappy ideas like this one , it would have been cheaper to insert your usb drive into a 16lb stone , and probalby cooler .
Posted by : bowl - a- crap at November 27 , 2006 03:20 AM
But , does it hook ?
Posted by : Kingpin at November 27 , 2006 06:46 AM
Im interested in the capacity of this thing .

Nice pool in your backyard ...
Posted by : PJ at November 27 , 2006 12:25 PM
It would have been better if the jack was flush mounted .
Then you could still use the ball or possible find a small retractable usb cable .
Posted by : Jim at November 27 , 2006 02:23 PM
You really should install TWO flash drives for the finger holes and ONE drive for the thumb hole .
Then it would confuse everyone when the ball is sitting on the ball return during the bowling tourney .
Posted by : Sterling Augustine at November 27 , 2006 02:31 PM
To everybody being critical of this , please lighten up .
This was not meant to be a practical solution , it is funny because of its absurdity .
Any critics of this probably never laughed at the move Airplane or Monty Python .
It is absurdly funny , nothing else .
So for all of you brainiacs whining about having another cable to lose , you miss the point .
Thanks for the laugh Chris o-)
Posted by : Sean at November 27 , 2006 02:33 PM
the sad thing is , is that the bowling ball is probably worth ten times as much as the USB key
Posted by : mcintyrep36 at November 27 , 2006 02:34 PM
here 's an idea , take a flash drive and connect one of those retractable usb cables to it .
Embed the whole thing far enough into the ball to not stick out but with a slot for the cable to pull back into , then you can actually bowl with it and you have your cable to make attaching to a computer easy .

What I want to know is if you have tried bowling a game with it .
Posted by : austonian at November 27 , 2006 02:55 PM
Doesnt this defeat the purpose of having a portable flash drive handy .
This is the backwards thinking that plagues people with low intelligence .
You bought the flash drive to be small portable data and then kept loosing it so embed it in a bowling ball defeating the purpose of buying it in the first place .

Wow ... that is the most pointless thing I 've seen in a while ... You must have quite a bit of free time to be doing stuff like this .
For God 's sake just wear it on a cord around your neck ... That just defeated the whole purpose of decades of work , trying to make these things smaller .

Posted by : soopafly at November 27 , 2006 03:52 PM
so what happens when it rolls over and squashes the head of the usb connecter ?
Posted by : josh at November 27 , 2006 04:11 PM
Huge problem .. the port is above the surface .
If you roll it the plug will snap off leaving your data stranded inside !

It hooks exactly the way that 's been said four times above your comment ...
Poster : Dunno who you are but that gets props for being an entirely useless mod .

Posted by : Chris at November 27 , 2006 04:15 PM
Why oh why did n't you recess the connector enough to actually be able to bowl with it too ?
Posted by : Pete at November 27 , 2006 04:22 PM
Might as well surgically implant one in your body , ( under your skin or sumem ) , you ’ll never lose it again !
Posted by : blacklabelrum at November 27 , 2006 04:35 PM
Unlike your other critics , I can see only one problem .
Why does the USB connector protrude ?
Surely you could have recessed it , and included a screw or bayonet fitted cover .
Otherwise , how do you still use it as a bowling ball ?
Other than that small engineering issue , it looks very , very cool .
And silly .
And very much a funny hacker solution to a common issue .
Posted by : Rob Masters at November 27 , 2006 04:39 PM
But will it BLEND ?
That is the question .
Posted by : Deviouster at November 27 , 2006 05:08 PM
If this thing gets knocked over and starts rolling say goodbye to the end of that usb drive ...
Still pretty cool though .
It would have been cool to attach one to a large ball and chain .
Posted by : ATony at November 27 , 2006 05:31 PM
It would be cooler if the bowling ball were transparent and the USB Drive was illuminated with some neon color !
Posted by : Judas at November 27 , 2006 05:33 PM
i just wish , it will roll , and fall down from your desk on to your foot , that would be the coolest , unless you put it under the desk which is unlikely , because you can't show you innovation off to others
Posted by : canyo at November 27 , 2006 05:46 PM

FOR THE INCREDIBLE HULK !#!@#!!

I want to see a flash drive permamently attached to your right hand 's thumb and forefinger .
You can then demonstrate by making the shape of the letter ' L ' against your forehead .
Posted by : chunder at November 27 , 2006 07:13 PM
So if the ball ROLLS off it 's holder there , it destroys your Flash card .
Sounds inGenious !
Posted by : thud at November 27 , 2006 09:06 PM
It looks like that might roll over and crush the usb connector .
Posted by : mbm at November 27 , 2006 09:18 PM

You can buy the smallest flash drive and yet have to attach a long obvious cord so as not to lose the flash drive .

Great idea .
Off course it is impractical .
Thats the whole idea !
Get a sense of humor , folks !
And off course the drive should not be flush with the ball :
An USB drives connector allways protrudes , otherwise you can't connect it to your PC ( cables is SO impractical ) .
It should have a cap though : May i suggest you make a cap from ANOTHER bowling ball :o ) / Rob
Posted by : Rob at December 19 , 2006 02:31 AM

Posted by : Kevin at January 23 , 2007 11:55 AM
Actually , I went to a bowling pro shop and had them drill the hole .
They have a big -ass drill press that can hold a bowling ball rock solid .
He only charged me $ 15 .
MUCH easier than trying to do it with a hand - held power drill !

Two balls , side by side .
In the middle , between them , they are connected ; one ball a flash drive , and one ball a cap .
Then , truly this computer would have 16 pound balls .

does the bowling ball still work ?
Posted by : bowler at May 20 , 2008 06:19 AM
To celebrate the movie 's 30th anniversary here are 30 facts and figures related to the film which influenced a new generation of film - makers .
THE MAKING OF STAR WARS
1 . The first trailer for the film hit cinemas six months before it was to open - with tag lines such as " the story of a boy , a girl and a universe " and " a billion years in the making " - as executives hoped to drum up some interest in a film they had little faith in .
George Lucas struggled to make people understand his vision
3 . It was originally called The Star Wars , but " the " was dropped fairly early on in the creative process .
4 . The full title Star Wars : Episode IV : A New Hope first appeared when the film was re-released in 1981 .
5. Director George Lucas originally had a contract with Fox for $ 150,000 ( £ 75,941 ) for writing and directing Star Wars .
But he cannily insisted on total control and 40 % of merchandising - something the studio agreed to because they had no idea of what a phenomenon Star Wars would become .
6 . The famous - and often imitated - opening crawl for Star Wars was co-written by Brian De Palma , the director of Scarface .
It begins " It is a period of civil war .
Rebel spaceships , striking from a hidden base , have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire . "
7. Sir Alec
Guinness made a ton of money from the film having recognised its potential success and negotiating a deal for two per cent of box office takings .
He also refused to do any promotional work for the film .
8. Anthony Daniels as C - 3PO and Kenny Baker , who played R2 - D2 , are the only actors credited with being in all six Star Wars films .
9. Harrison Ford was far from George Lucas ' first choice to play Han Solo as the director had wanted completely new faces for Star Wars .
Ford had already starred in Lucas ' American Graffiti .
10 .
The original release date was set for Christmas 1976 but major delays in filming saw it pushed back .
The Fox studio had threatened to close down production when filming over - ran by more than two weeks .
INSPIRATION
11 . Ralph McQuarrie created the paintings which were used to illustrate how the Star Wars universe could look .
He started out as a technical illustrator for Boeing .
The Stormtroopers
12 . The Wookiee Chewbacca was inspired by George Lucas ' beloved dog Indiana - an Alaskan malamute .
13 . Lucas once said that the shape of the Millennium Falcon was based on a hamburger .
14 . George Lucas based the character of Han Solo on his friend Francis Ford Coppola .
15 .
The droids R2 - D2 and C - 3PO are said to be based on the 1958 Akira Kourosawa film Kakushi toride no san akunin ( The Hidden Fortress ) .
Other characters in Star Wars were also drawn from the film including Han Solo and Ben Kenobi .
MARKETING AND MERCHANDISING
16 . Cinemas in the US were press - ganged into buying the film after few took up the option , with the threat that they would n't get The Other Side of Midnight - a widely - anticipated adaptation of a Sidney Sheldon novel .
The Other Side of Midnight , starring Susan Sarandon , was a box office flop .
17 . Publicity supervisor Charles Lippincott was aware of the power of the sci - fi fan , going along to conventions to talk about Star Wars and what audiences could expect .
He was largely credited with bringing in huge opening day audiences .
Sir Alec Guinness became very rich off the back of Star Wars
18 . The merchandise for the film was not in place to accommodate the demand for the first Christmas rush after the film 's release .
Lucas and merchandise company Kenner Toys hit upon a novel idea with the introduction of early bird certificate boxes .
These were basically empty boxes that promised the receiver they would get the figures once they had been made .
They sold for $ 16 at the time and the actual figures arrived two months later .
Limited edition packs were re-released in 2005 .
19 .
More than 250 million small action figures were shipped in the eight years after the first film , going to countries across the world .
In the first year alone 42 m were sold .
AWARDS
20 . Composer John Williams won an Oscar for his score for Star Wars .
The music was later named by the American Film Institute as the greatest film score of all time .
21 . A New Hope was the only one of the six films in the franchise to be nominated in the Academy Awards best picture category .
It lost out to Woody Allen 's Annie Hall .
MISHAPS AND MISCELLANEOUS
22 . Mark Hamill , who played Luke Skywalker , was involved in a car accident following primary shooting .
His face was damaged making reshoots impossible .
Hamill later said he only broke his nose and reports that his face was reconstructed were wide of the mark .
23 . Anthony Daniels was injured during his first outing as C - 3PO when a leg piece fell off his gold - coloured costume and shattered - stabbing him in the foot .
24 .
On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia , the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years and a rest day had to be called .
25 .
When filming moved to Elstree it was hoped the earlier problems encountered in the desert would be finished .
But a new problem arose in the shape of the strict British working conditions adhered to on set .
Lucas says that filming had to close at 5.30 pm on the dot , unless he was in the middle of a shot - when he could ask workers to stay for an extra 15 minutes .
Darth Vader was played by British actor Dave Prowse
26 .
One of the most famous bloopers from the film is when stormtroopers burst into a room and one of them hits his head on the door frame .
Fans of Star Wars and the blooper have spotted hundreds of " mistakes " throughout the Star Wars franchise but many can only be spotted by the most eagle - eyed viewer .
27 . Peter Mayhew , who played Chewbacca , worked as a hospital orderly in London before being cast as the Wookiee .
He was said to have got into character by copying the mannerisms of animals he visited at the zoo .
28 . David Prowse , the 6ft 7ins actor who plays Darth Vader , had problems filming lightsaber scenes as he kept breaking the poles that were used as stand - ins for the weapons .
In the sequels , fight co-ordinator Bob Anderson stepped into the costume to film the lightsaber scenes .
29 . George Lucas wanted his sets to look worn and scuffed but the studio cleaning service continually cleaned and tidied up after a day 's filming - much to the director 's dismay .
30 . Lucas ' stress levels reached such a height that he thought he was having a heart attack .
He was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and told to rest - something the punishing schedule would not allow .
A professional author spends months , or even years crafting a single bestselling novel .
A magazine or newspaper journalist needs a few weeks to compose a feature story .
The entire history of writing shows that good writing takes time .
Yet , according to Technorati , most popular blogs are updated on a daily basis , often multiple times .
What are we to make of this ?
Is that accepted wisdom , that successful blogs are built on great content , supported by any factual evidence ?
Nope .
Lessons From Hamburger University
The world ’s most popular bloggers accept this truth : the online marketplace does not value , and will not support high quality content .
So , instead of writing great posts and bearing the high costs associated with creating them , these bloggers deliver barely adequate content on a timely and consistent basis .
This is a proven strategy .
McDonald ’s used it to become the # 1 fast - food chain in the world , with over 30,000 restaurants on six continents .
They did not reach this position by making the world ’s best cheeseburger , or even attempting to do so .
Aspiring A - list bloggers should learn from their example …
Be cheap .
If you do n’t have much to say , then you should n’t need many words to convey it .
This is convenient , because nobody has time to read it anyway .
Be fast .
“ Fast food ” is fast because it is n’t cooked to order ; it is prepared in advance and placed under a heat lamp to await a hungry consumer .
Creative bloggers can use this same technique :
Prepare a set of “ blogging points ” that can be applied to almost any breaking news story .
Immediately after a story hits the wire , type up a 50 - word summary , append your blogging points , and hit the Publish button .
While slower bloggers are contemplating the relevant details and composing a thoughtful response , you ’ll be scoring all the traffic !
This technique works particularly well for political blogs , but with a little ingenuity , it can be applied to almost any niche .
Example :
Associated Press , January 29 , 12:05 am
Microsoft has just released Windows Vista to the public …
MacLuver27 ’s Blog , January 29 , 12:07am
Micro$oft ?
Hated it !
Be bland .
When choosing a position on a controversial topic , always follow the Rule of Chipotle :
If it sounds exotic , they ’ll buy it once .
If it tastes exotic , they ’ll never buy it again .
Start your posts with a bold premise , to attract a broad spectrum of readers .
End your posts by embracing the conventional wisdom , thereby upsetting nobody .
This article is all in fun , of course …
Great content is obviously the foundation of all successful and popular blogs…or is it ?

THE PANOPTICON WHITE HOUSE ….
There ’s nothing wrong with the fact that Dick Cheney is a powerful vice president .
Jimmy Carter began the transformation of the vice presidency decades ago when he gave Walter Mondale more than just the veep ’s usual ribbon cutting and funeral attendance duties , Bush Sr. continued the transformation , and Al Gore took it up yet another notch when he was Bill Clinton ’s vice president .
That ’s all fine .
Since the vice president is the guy who takes over the country if the president dies , we ’re all better off if the VP is deeply involved in the operations of the executive .
The Washington Post ’s series on Dick Cheney , however , describes a man who ’s not just involved , but nearly pathological .
The most telling moment comes in a passage that involves Condoleezza Rice , back when she headed up the National Security Council , and her top lawyer , John Bellinger .
The subject is Cheney ’s belief that the Geneva Conventions do n’t apply to the war on terror :
At the White House , Bellinger sent Rice a blunt — and , he thought , private — legal warning .
The Cheney - Rumsfeld position would place the president indisputably in breach of international law and would undermine cooperation from allied governments .
Faxes had been pouring in at the State Department since the order for military commissions was signed , with even British authorities warning that they could not hand over suspects if the U.S. government withdrew from accepted legal norms .
One lawyer in his office said that Bellinger was chagrined to learn , indirectly , that Cheney had read the confidential memo and “ was concerned ” about his advice .
Thus Bellinger discovered an unannounced standing order : Documents prepared for the national security adviser , another White House official said , were “ routed outside the formal process ” to Cheney , too .
The reverse did not apply .
The article does n’t explain how this process happens , but it ’s astonishing that even the NSC director and her top aides are not allowed to exchange private memos in the Bush / Cheney White House .
Apparently the West Wing has been transformed into a panopticon for the benefit of Dick Cheney and his staff : they can watch you , but you ca n’t watch back .
Jeremy Bentham ’s passion for “ invisible omniscience ” must have struck a chord with them .
As occured during the 1980's in the case of EPA Administratior Ann Gorsuch , where the DOJ refused to persue a Contempt Citation against an Administration Official where the President had exerted executive priviledge .
the Office of Legal Counsel issued an Opinion concluding that the statute is unconstitutional to the extent it requires a U.S. Attorney to prosecute a contempt action where the noncompliance is based on the President 's assertion of executive privilege :
In OLC 's view , a U.S. Attorney thus " is not required to refer a contempt citation in these circumstances to a grand jury or otherwise to prosecute an Executive Branch official who is carrying out the President 's [ executive privilege ] instruction . "
8 Op. O.L.C. 101 , 102 .
From current reports the vote by the full house on Contempt will not occur until after the August recess - which means this issue has some time to simmer fully before it boils over .
Once that vote occurs there are two primary courses of action which can be taken by the House , once is to go to the courts and seek to force the President to prove the legitimacy of his Executive Priviledge claims .
The other option , rather than allowing the Administration to continue to run out the clock is for the House to invoke Inherent Contempt , and have Miers and Bolten brought by in their Sargeant at Arm to either testify or rot in the Houses own detention until deciding to do so .
Some would argue that jurisdiction would limit the ability of the House Sargeant at Arms from bringing Meirs and Bolten into custody - " They could stand across the street from the Capitol and still be safe " - but history has shown that not to be the case .
The Supreme Court has affirmed Congressional power to frog - march witnesses before the bar of Congress .
In McGrain v. Daugherty , a recusant witness ( the AG's brother ) refused to comply with issued subpoenas .
The Senate issued a warrant authorizing its sergeant at arms to take custody of the witness and bring him before the bar of the Senate to answer questions .
The deputy sergeant at arms went to Cincinnati , Ohio to pick up the uncooperative witness to place him in custody .
The witness objected by filing habeas corpus , but the Supreme Court upheld Congressional legal authority to use its own process to compel persons to appear and testify on issues needed to enable Congress to exercise its Constitutional legislative function .
If the House can have the Attorney General 's brother arrested in Cincinnati , they can go get Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten in Virginia .
Oh , and irony of having Meirs or Bolten file Habeaus Motions against their detention would be most delicious .
One other matter which should n't be ignored concerning the Gorsuch case - she eventually did provide the information Congress was looking for .
After legal cases and a Court dismissal of the Executive Branch 's suit , the parties reached an agreement to provide documents .
Not only that EPA Official Rita Lavelle served jail time .
Indicted for lying to Congress ; convicted ; sentenced to 6 months in prison , 5 years probation thereafter , and a fine of $ 10,000
If the Bush Administration is looking to repeat the path followed by Reagan , when he attempted to hide abuse of the Superfund program and they ended up on the losing side of established case law , he 's headed down a road that they are n't likely to survive without serious injuries .

Peter Singer is routinely described as " the most influential living philosopher " and occasionally as " the most dangerous man in the world , " so it 's with much giddiness that we introduce him for a second time as a contributor to Jewcy .
The background : Jewcy Senior Editor Joey Kurtzman recently paid enthusiastic tribute to his own $ 1000 contribution to the anti-poverty campaign Idol Gives Back , and railed against the expectation that charity should be given quietly and anonymously .
Joey claimed this was " destructive nonsense " and " insufferable twaddl e " foisted upon us by Jesus , Maimonides , et al .
Instead , charity ought to be given publicly and " with a sneer at the lowly neighbors , " because extreme poverty can be whipped if middle - class people would come to regard charitable contributions as a source of status and an opportunity for " conspicuous consumption . "
The response was mixed .
" What a pretentious douchebag ! " observed one commenter .
" Hope you get a brain tumor and die while spasming and foaming at the mouth uncontrollably , " noted another .
But Singer was more sympathetic to Joey 's argument .
He weighs in now .
Joey Kurtzman has made a significant point in his post titled “ I Donated $ 1000 to American Idol .
But You , You 're Trash . ”
Many of us already know that more than 10 million children die every year from avoidable , poverty - related causes .
( That ’s 27,000 a day , almost ten times the number of casualties in the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . )
Some of us might even be dimly aware , when we ponder what type of iPod to buy , that a billion people have less to live on for an entire year than we are contemplating spending more on a totally frivolous consumer toy .
Yet widespread extreme poverty is not inevitable .
A UN task force led by Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs recently estimated the cost of achieving the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000 .
On that occasion , the largest gathering of world leaders in history jointly pledged to meet , by 2015 , a list of goals that include :
Reducing by half the proportion of the world ’s people in extreme poverty ( defined as living on less than the purchasing - power equivalent of one U.S. dollar per day ) .
Reducing by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger .
Ensuring that children everywhere are able to take a full course of primary schooling .
Ending sex disparity in education .
Reducing by two - thirds the mortality rate among children under 5 .
Reducing by three - quarters the rate of maternal mortality .
Halting and beginning to reverse the spread of H.I.V./ AIDS and halting and beginning to reduce the incidence of malaria and other major diseases .
Reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water .
The cost , according to his Sachs and his colleagues , is between $ 121 billion and $ 189 billion per year between now and 2015 .
Since there are roughly a billion affluent people in the world , the math is not too difficult .
If we each gave $ 200 a year , we could pull it off .
Unfortunately , we are not doing that .
Is n’t that just plain morally wrong ?
How can we defend spending money on luxuries for ourselves when that same money could save the lives of sick kids , get a few years schooling for children who otherwise will have none , and help women to control their fertility so that they can give all of their children a decent shot at a good life ?
The problem is that we do n’t see it as wrong to give nothing or next to nothing to NGOs working for poverty relief .
Somehow we think morality is all about how truthful we are , how good a friend or partner we are , maybe who we sleep with , or what substances we put into our bodies , and not about how many kids we save from dying of malaria or diarrhea .
So Joey is right to point out that if this situation is ever going to change , we need to start talking openly about it .
It ’s time to stop being so reverential towards those remarks of Jesus and Maimonides about giving anonymously or not blowing our own trumpet .
Sure , we do n’t want to humiliate those to whom we give , or make them feel that they are indebted to us , but the world has got so much bigger than it was when Jesus and Maimonides were around , so that ’s not really a problem any more .
At the moment , many people would feel strange about giving away , say , 10 percent of their income to fight global poverty .
Talking about it may make that seem a more normal thing to do , and would encourage others to do the same .
It may also make people realize that it ’s not really a sacrifice .
You probably will enjoy life just as much with a little less money – in fact you will probably enjoy it more , because you will feel good about yourself and what you are doing .
That ’s not to say we have to be distastefully boastful about it … but yes , if you are living comfortably while others are hungry or dying from easily preventable diseases , and you are doing nothing about it , there is something wrong with your behavior .
Jon Stewart patiently explains what YouTube is to CNN David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 25 , 2007 Print This Email
This " We 're devoting the entire show to last night 's Democratic debate on CNN , " announced Jon Stewart on Tuesday 's Daily Show .
" This debate was co-sponsored by YouTube .
In this debate , candidates would be asked video questions voters submitted on the Web .
If that just sounds like a town hall meeting , only without any human interaction -- dude , you just do n't get it . "
Stewart devoted much of the segment to CNN 's inability to use its technological gimmickry effectly .
" That 's got to be like one of them twelve - foot monitors , is it not ? " he said of the debate 's enormous on - stage screen , which showed a webpage of which the questioner 's YouTube video occupied a small corner , making it difficult for the home television audience to see .
" You Tube itself actually has a lot of features , " Stewart explained patiently to CNN .
" For instance , there 's a little button on the screen of YouTube .
You know what it does there ?
It 's called -- what do you call it there ?
-- Full Screen Mode .
Is that so hard ? "
" Let me explain to you why video size is so important to the debate , " he continued .
" See , a lot of the young folks you 're looking to draw in are probably going to end up watching the debate on -- I do n't know -- YouTube . "
As Stewart continued poking fun at the debate , Jason Jones came on to complain , " Who gives a rat 's ass about my thoughts , Jon .
I 'm just a professional political correspondent .
I 'm not a ' real people . ' "
When Stewart objected that " some of the people asked really good questions , " Jones retorted , " Sure , it 's easy to ask those questions when you 're Joe Schmo ...
Everything is easy for the schmoes .
But they do n't have to see these people the next day at the reporter - candidate friendship brunch . "

Beyonce : do her hips make her attractive ?
An hourglass figure has long been perceived to be the ideal figure for a woman to have .
But New York University researchers have found that to be found attractive , a woman had to move in a feminine way - swaying her hips .
Men , the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences paper found , were more attractive if they moved with a " shoulder swagger " .
The waist - hip ratio has long been thought to be key to Western perceptions of attractiveness , with a small waist and bigger hips the ideal combination .
Marilyn Monroe , and now Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez are famous examples of women with that figure .
Its popularity may be down to media images , or because Western women do not need to have strong and muscular bodies in order to carry out manual labour , unlike women in developing countries .
But the US research , which was also published in the journal Psychological Science , suggests they would never have achieved their sex symbol status if they did not move in the right way .
Not just measurements
The team carried out a series of studies involving over 700 participants who were shown a variety of animations and videos of people moving .
Some showed shadow figures , where it was not possible to see if it was a man or a woman , while others obviously showed a man or a woman .
No matter which format was being used , the participants rated women or " female " figures as more attractive if their hips swayed as they walked , while men were more attractive if they had the characteristic shoulder movement .
The research also confirmed the waist - hip ratio assumption , with women 's attractiveness being rated higher if their waist - hip ratio was small and men's being higher if their ratio was large .
The ideal waist - hip ratio for women is to have a waist measurement which is no more than 70 % of their hip measurement .
But Kerri Johnson and Louis Tassinary who led the research , say their work shows attractiveness is not as simple as the difference between two measurements .
Writing in PNAS , the researchers said : " The body 's shape and motion provoke basic social perceptions , biological sex and gender - ie masculinity or femininity respectively .
" The compatibility of these basic precepts predicts perceived attractiveness . "
The team say their findings only apply to Western cultures , and other societies will judge attractiveness depending on their most prized feminine and masculine traits .
Dr George Fieldman , principal lecturer in psychology at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College said : " This is quite plausible .
" It 's the movement which attracts , and not just the waist - hip ratio per se . "
He added : " It would be interesting to see what the ideal combination of measurements and wiggle is . "
Turkey : Constitutional Court stops presidential election
By Justus Leicht
3 May 2007
Following a thinly veiled threat of a coup by the military , the Turkish Constitutional Court issued a ruling on Tuesday halting the country ’s presidential election .
The head of the government , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , immediately responded by proposing new parliamentary elections .
The Constitutional Court declared that the first round of the presidential election held last Friday was illegal , because less than the necessary two thirds of all parliamentary deputies were in attendance for the vote .
This judgement is politically motivated .
There is no basis for such a decision in the Turkish constitution .
According to the media , even the judge responsible for writing the decision advised against issuing it on the grounds that it lacked any legal foundation .
The only candidate for the office of president is Abdullah Gül , the current Foreign Minister , co-founder of the ruling moderate Islamic AKP ( Party for Justice and Development ) and a close friend of Erdogan .
In the first round of voting , Gül narrowly failed to win the necessary two - thirds majority of the parliament , ( i.e. , 367 deputies ) , since the AKP has only 353 seats .
Nevertheless ,
Gül ’s victory in the third ballot , which requires just a simple majority , was regarded as certain .
The only opposition party , the Kemalist CHP ( Republican People ’s Party ) , had deliberately boycotted the first round of the presidential election and then called upon the Constitutional Court to declare it null and void .
The CHP has close links to the military , which had delivered an unusually sharp warning to the AKP on Friday evening .
The statement by the general staff declared : “ The Turkish armed forces observe the situation with concern .
Attacks on the basic values of the Republic , in particular secularism , have escalated and developed into an open challenge to the state .
In part this is happening with the knowledge and the permission of the government authorities .
The Turkish armed forces are against these discussions .
They regard themselves as the guardians of the secular order and will openly make their position clear if necessary .
Nobody should be in any doubt about this . ”
The statement continues by saying that the armed forces are absolutely determined to fulfil their legally embodied obligation of protecting the constant basic values of Turkey .
Whoever opposes the slogan of Kemal Atatürk , “ ‘ How happy is the one who says , I am a Turk , ’ are enemies of the Republic of Turkey , ” it added .
The Turkish general staff have often proved in the past that they have no compunction about using brutal force in order to defend their power .
The Turkish military has carried out no fewer than three coups in recent history - in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 .
In 1997 , it forced the resignation of the Islamic head of government Necmettin Erbakan in a cold putsch .
The coup d’état of 1980 was especially brutal , with 650,000 arrested .
Many were subjected to cruel torture , often with deadly consequences .
Tens of thousands were forced into exile and robbed of their nationality .
The current threats by the military , therefore , must be taken extremely seriously .
The military high command and the CHP have sought to stoke up fears of an “ Islamisation ” of Turkish society if a member of the AKP ( which already controls the government ) takes over the post of president .
The elected Turkish president , whose tenure lasts seven years , has considerable power .
Not only can he block laws and the appointment of officials — powers repeatedly employed against the AKP by the previous president , Ahmet Necdet Sezer , an independent Kemalist — he is responsible for the appointment of the judges of the Constitutional Court , the highest - ranking state lawyers and military judges .
The president is also commander in chief of the armed forces , presides over the national security council , can impose a state of emergency and appoints the members of the Higher Education Board , as well as university rectors .
In fact , the main priority for the Kemalist establishment is the defence of the posts and privileges they enjoy within the discredited state and military bureaucracy , which is allied to the country ’s major banks and big business .
On Sunday , April 29 , hundreds of thousands took to the streets of Istanbul waving Turkish flags and bearing portraits of Atatürk to demonstrate against Gül ’s candidacy and call for the resignation of the government .
A similar demonstration was held two weeks earlier in the capital , Ankara .
Anti-US slogans were also raised , as well as those opposing Turkey ’s proposed entry into the European Union .
The threats by the military had obviously shocked many of the demonstrators .
“ We want neither Sharia [ Islamic law ] nor another coup , but a democratic Turkey , ” was one of the slogans .
As was the case two weeks previously , the protest was largely made up of the better educated and middle class , but sections of working class and small farmers , who have greatly suffered from the free market policies of the AKP government , were also in attendance .
The Turkish prime minister and head of the AKP , Erdogan , indicated he was unimpressed with the protests , hinting that the AKP could mobilise 10 times as many people in the streets if it sought to do so .
His government spokesman , Justice Minister Cemil Cicek , denounced the statements by the general staff in unusually sharp tones and declared that , according to the constitution , the army is subordinate to the prime minister .
In a democratic constitutional state , it is “ inconceivable ” that the general staff declare itself against the government .
He also accused the army of trying to influence the judiciary .
Abdullah Gül also affirmed that as president he would preserve the secular order and would under no circumstance withdraw his candidacy .
The Constitutional Court has evidently given way to pressure from the military in making its thoroughly dubious decision .
The Court is anything but neutral .
Seven of the 11 judges of the court were appointed by the outgoing president Sezer , who has joined the campaign against the AKP government .
Prior to becoming president , Sezer was also a constitutional judge and owes his legal career to the military putsch of 1980 .
The parliamentary opposition , the main Turkish business federation TÜSIAD and most newspapers have declared their preference for new elections .
The decision by the Constitutional Court creates a precedent , which allows a parliamentary minority to declare elections and majority votes invalid and force the dissolution of parliament .
Erdogan has now responded by dissolving the parliament and calling new elections .
The AKP is reckoned to have good chances of retaining a majority .
Sezer will remain in office as president until the new round of parliamentary elections is completed and the new parliament determines his successor .
The conflict over the future Turkish president has now lasted for weeks .
It was long assumed that Erdogan himself would stand for the highest public office , and the military had repeatedly expressed its opposition to his candidacy .
At a press conference held two weeks ago , the head of the general staff , Yasar Büyükanit , declared that he hoped the future president would be someone who respects the basic principles of the Republic instead of just paying lip service to them .
Then , shortly before the deadline , Erdogan announced the candidacy of Gül , a move that was seen by the Western media as a concession to the Kemalist establishment .
It was only a concession , however , to the extent that Erdogan did not stand himself .
In the preceding weeks , there had been much speculation over a compromise candidate .
Possible candidates were the Secretary of Family Affairs , Nimet Cubukcu , and Defence Secretary Vecdi Gönül .
Cubukcu is the only woman in Erdogan ’s cabinet and does not wear a headscarf .
Gönül is more of a right - wing nationalist than an Islamist .
As former governor in Ankara and Izmir and the former president of the highest audit office and state undersecretary in the Interior Ministry , he enjoys relatively good relations with the established bureaucracy .
His wife also does not wear a headscarf .
Kemalists regard any woman with a headscarf in the presidential palace as an intolerable provocation , while the hardliner wing of the AKP led by parliamentary president Bülent Arinc is not prepared to accept a woman who does not wear a headscarf .
Gül ’s wife wears a headscarf and even lodged legal action against Turkey with the European Court of Human Rights to protest the ban on headscarves in public buildings .
She only withdrew the court order when her husband entered the government .
Like Erdogan , Gül represents a layer of the Turkish bourgeoisie , which mainly comes from the province of Anatolia and in the name of Islam is seeking to break the political dominance of the Kemalist bureaucracy in Ankara and Istanbul and the latter ’s alliance with the country ’s banks and big business .
On this issue , they are in agreement with international finance circles , which are seeking to open up Turkey ’s economy .
Gül ’s father , a craftsman in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri , was active in the Islamic movement and stood as a candidate for the MSP led by Necmettin Erbakan .
This was also the first political home of Abdullah Gül .
The son studied economics and completed his doctorate in Britain .
He was already active in the Islamist movement as a student in the 1970s and was briefly arrested following the putsch of 1980 .
In the 1980s , he worked for the Islamic Development Bank in Saudi Arabia .
In 1991 , he returned to Turkey and was elected to parliament as a deputy for Erbakan ’s Welfare Party .
In 1993 , he became the party ’s vice chairman .
Following Erbakan ’s rise to the post of prime minister in 1996 , Gül took over as his government spokesman with a cabinet position .
In 1997 , the government was ousted by the military in a “ cold putsch , ” and the Welfare Party was banned .
Gül also played a leading role in the successor organisation , the Virtue Party , and was portrayed as a so - called “ renewer , ” advocating a more pragmatic , pro-Western and less sharply defined Islamic line .
Following the prohibition of the Virtue Party , Gül then went on to develop the AKP together with Erdogan and complete his break with Erbakan .
After the election victory of the AKP in November 2002 , Gül temporarily assumed the post of prime minister after Erdogan had been prevented from taking part in the election because of a previous conviction .
Following a by - election in March 2003 , Erdogan then took over as prime minister .
Under pressure from the IMF , the AKP government continued the previous administration ’s policy of neo-liberal reforms , although the AKP had won the election on the basis of its promises of more social justice .
Along with his economic policies , Gül also implemented some limited political reforms aimed at defusing the country ’s long - standing Kurdish conflict , reining in the influence of the military , and securing Turkish membership of the European Union .
Shortly after taking office , Gül pushed through parliament two legislative packages complying with some EU - recommended reforms .
The decision by the Turkish parliament on March 1 , 2003 , to refuse the US use of Turkish bases for its war against Iraq is believed to be a result of Gül ’s influence .
Together with Erdogan , the army leadership and President Sezer , Gül favoured a pro-US solution to the issue , which would have involved sending 10,000 Turkish troops into Kurdish - dominated northern Iraq .
But against a background of public opposition and fears of split in his party , Gül refused to dictate a decision to his parliamentary group .
The ordinary membership of the AKP was virtually unanimous in its opposition to the Iraq war .
Many AKP deputies therefore voted against the line of their own government .
The extreme right wing in the Turkish establishment , and particularly in the army — as well as the Bush administration — has never forgiven the AKP for its stance at that time .
The former deputy US Defence Secretary and current head of the World Bank , Paul Wolfowitz , openly accused the Turkish military of failing to intervene in the political process to impose its own position against the elected government .
Gül has also incurred the wrath of Turkish nationalists in his role as Foreign Minister .
He called for a compromise in the Cyprus conflict in order to further Turkey ’s plans to join the European Union .
The Turkish army has a large concentration of troops in northern Cyprus , which is of considerable strategic and ideological importance .
European Union circles have reacted with alarm to the threats of a coup by the Turkish military .
The EU council presidency — currently held by Germany — expressed its expectation , “ that the elections and the Constitutional Court would not be subject to outside influence . ”
According to a spokesman in Berlin , the development of Turkey is being followed “ with a great deal of attention . ”
All those with political responsibility must do their part to ensure that the presidential election is carried out “ according to democratic and constitutional rules , ” he added .
EU expansion commissioner Olli Rehn explained : “ It is important that the military leaves the task of democracy to the democratically elected government . ”
The secretary - general of the European parliament , Terry Davis , called upon the Turkish army to remain in its barracks .
In Washington , the response was more restrained and comments were restricted to lower - ranking personnel : “ We hope and expect that the Turks will work out these political issues in their own way , in a way that ’s consistent with their secular democracy and constitutional provisions , ” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Dan Fried told Reuters .
Relations between Washington and the AKP government in Ankara are regarded as good , while the US has its own tensions with the Turkish military , particularly over the Kurdish question .
The Turkish military is exerting pressure for cross - border operations against camps of the Kurdish Worker ’s Party ( PKK ) in northern Iraq — a move that is rejected by the US out of respect for its Kurdish allies in Iraq .
Foreign Minister Gül prefers diplomatic pressure on the Baghdad government and the Iraqi Kurds .
Despite its nationalist rhetoric , Washington still looks to the Turkish military as a reliable prop for US interests on a long - term basis .
It has supported the earlier military coups in Turkey and regards the Turkish army as a reliable ally due to its dependence on NATO .

I ’ll have to wait a day or two and then break their keygen again , since this time at least one of them actually does show up on Goooogle .
In the spirit of sticking it to pirates everywhere , I heartily support the # 1 Google result for “ Bingo Card Creator serial “ , which is SharewareConnection ’s excellent page on the subject .
I think every download site should implement similar language ( check the waaaay bottom of the page for why that page ranks for those search terms ) , because doing so would make it impossible to find the needle in the haystack .
After all , its not like anyone is hotlinking the Bingo Card Creator keygen directly .

The House of Representatives today failed to override President Bush ’s veto of the Iraq War Spending Bill :
The House of Representatives today sustained President Bush ’s veto of an emergency war spending bill , as the White House and lawmakers turned their attention to negotiating new legislation to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The 222-203 vote to override Bush ’s veto fell far short of the two - thirds needed , effectively killing the $ 124 billion supplemental appropriations bill .
After the vote , congressional leaders from both parties met with Bush at the White House to start the process of negotiating a new bill .
Afterward , the lawmakers said the meeting had been positive .
Before conferring with them , Bush told reporters : “ Yesterday was a day that highlighted differences .
Today ’s a day where we can work together to find common ground . ”
He said he was naming White House Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten , National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman to work with members of both parties to reach agreement on a new funding bill .
Given that the original bill had a bare partisan majority when it passed , this outcome was hardly surprising .
Now that the Democrats have accomplished their political goal , though , everyone has to figure out what to do next .
As I ’ve said before , I do n’t think the Democrats are going to let themselves be in a position where no funding bill at all is passed .
Cutting off funds for the war has too much potential to turn into a political victory for the Bush Administration and risks alienating voters who want the Iraq war to end , but do n’t want the troops left hanging in the lurch .
At the same time , though , I think that a time is coming soon when Republicans , even the Bush Administration , will finally see the handwriting on the wall and quietly accept the idea that disengagement from Iraq is the right thing to do .
Here ’s what I think might happen .
The Bush Administration will never accept deadlines for withdrawal , so what I expect to see are benchmarks set for the Iraqi Government to meet in order for US military and economic aid to continue .
In conjunction with this , I would expect to see the Bush Administration take a harder line with the Malki Government in Baghdad .
If , and probably when , those benchmarks are not met , the United States will begin the gradual process of letting the Iraqi people commit national suicide .
A plan like this would satisfy Democratic ( and Republican ) opponents of the war , and it would provide the Bush Administration the cover it needs to get out of this quagmire .
Instead of saying that America abandoned Iraq , the official line will be that Iraq failed to live up to it ’s promises .
It sounds cynical , but this is politics .
Exclusive to STR
I submit that the United States we call home has long ago become an authoritarian form of government .
According to Wikipedia , democracies rarely exhibit much authoritarian behavior , except in transition to / from authoritarian states or when martial law is imposed ( during war , for example ) .
Many ( if not most ) citizens of authoritarian states do not perceive their state as authoritarian until late in its development .
Authoritarian regimes grant wide powers to law enforcement agencies ; in the extreme , this leads to a police state .
Authoritarian regimes may or may not have a rule of law .
In the former case , laws are enacted , and though they may seem intrusive , unjust or excessive , they are applied to common people .
Consider the Merriam - Webster New Collegiate Dictionary definition of authoritarian : 1 . of , or relating to , or favoring blind submission to authority .
2 . of , relating to , or favoring a concentration of power in a leader or elite not constitutionally responsible to the people .
An elite , not constitutionally responsible to the people .
So I have a benchmark to go by .
We do have a Constitution , and a Bill of Rights .
Our leaders are oft described as elite .
Let me see . . . .
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .
Patriot Act 2 would terminate court - ordered limits on political spying by local and state police .
Religious and secular organizations that take controversial political positions could face infiltration and surveillance , whether or not they have any connection to terrorism or other crime ( Sec. 312 ) .
The people rely on a free press to be able to make wise decisions .
The bill would deny the press , and the public , access to the following important information : arrests of terrorism suspects who have not been charged with a crime ( Sec. 201 ) , which might include material witness detainees , immigration detainees , or American citizens or others labeled " enemy combatants " by the President ; grand jury proceedings in connection with a terror investigation ( Sec. 206 ) , and public information about health and safety hazards of chemical and other plants ( Sec. 202 ) .
This is a minor but important abridgement of freedom of the press .
Free Speech Zones are a new form of control as well .
Besides , it is hard to ' redress government ' if your free speech zone is far away from your intended audience .
A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed .
We have n't been free to keep and bear arms uninfringed .
We are infringed .
Period .
Amendment III
No soldier shall , in time of peace be quartered in any house , without the consent of the owner , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by law .
I do n't know that this has been violated .
Yet .
One for three so far . . . .
Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the FBI to order any person or entity to turn over " any tangible things , " so long as the FBI " specifies " that the order is " for an authorized investigation . . . to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities . "
Section 215 vastly expands the FBI 's power to spy on ordinary people living in the United States , including United States citizens and permanent residents .
The FBI need not show probable cause , nor even reasonable grounds to believe , that the person whose records it seeks is engaged in criminal activity .
The FBI need not have any suspicion that the subject of the investigation is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power .
The FBI can investigate United States persons based in part on their exercise of First Amendment rights , and it can investigate non-United States persons based solely on their exercise of First Amendment rights .
No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia , when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .
The Patriot Act II states quite clearly that you simply need to engage in civil disobedience ( Sec. 501 ) to lose your citizenship .
THEN you can be classified as an enemy combatant .
THEN you can be subject to extraordinary rendition .
Furthermore , draconian drug laws have made private property taken for public use without compensation a multi-million dollar business .
Amendment VI
In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense .
Under the Patriot Act , any individual or group that breaks the law with the intent of influencing the government can be labeled a terrorist if their activities are " dangerous to human life . "
Under that definition , diverse " direct- action " organizations , including Operation Rescue or the World Trade Organization protestors , could be labeled " terrorist organizations . "
The right to a speedy and public trial has been relinquished quite effectively in the new Patriot Acts .
Extraordinary rendition , Habeus Corpus suspension , its all gone , folks .
This is a new era in our system of government .
Amendment VII
In suits at common law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved , and no fact tried by a jury , shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States , than according to the rules of the common law .
Not being an expert in common law , I 'll relent here -- perhaps two for seven now . . . .
Amendment VIII
Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .
Waterboarding , sleep deprivation , yada yada yada . . . all cruel and unusual until 9/11 .
Not considered cruel and unusual now .
This goes great with extraordinary rendition .
Still , only two for eight thus far .
The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .
We retain these rights , supposedly , and rights beyond these , according to this .
Since we do n't have the original ten above ( two for eight still ) , I must heartily assume we do n't have this either .
I 'm an all or nothing kind of guy .
Read into it what you like .
( Now two for nine ) .
Amendment X
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people .
People have rights beyond these enumerated powers , or did at one time , or perhaps never did , but they look nice written on that hemp paper !
So we get left with two of ten rights .
Hey , great !
I feel free already !
Ahhh , just bask in the warmth of that freedom !
Being a biker , and having traveled the country , I can say that it is still quite livable ; we still have plenty of vestiges of freedom left in this country .
However , we are on the brink of no longer being a constitutional republic , and we may never be again .
The police state is growing exponentially , and our greatest industry may turn out to be the prison industry in the future .
I remain pro-individual liberty , and anti-authoritarian .
Civil disobedience just could get you in quite a bit of trouble today .
So if you do n't like what is going on , how does a person redress their masters properly ?
From far away -- and quietly .

Symantec Sues Microsoft , Seeks To Block Distribution Of Windows Vista
Symantec claims Microsoft improperly included its intellectual property in Windows Vista and wants to block distribution until Microsoft changes the software .
Microsoft denies the charges .
Symantec on Thursday sued Microsoft for what it said was improper inclusion of its intellectual property in Windows Vista and asked a federal court in Seattle to block distribution of Vista until Microsoft changes the software .
Microsoft said the claim was without merit and that its actions are " proper and fully consistent " with a contract it signed with Veritas Software , which Symantec acquired last year .
The dispute centers on software technology that allows an operating system to store and manipulate large amounts of data and recreate files after a disk storage failure .
Symantec claims Microsoft violated terms of a 2004 contract , under which Microsoft licensed this type of software from Veritas , by using it to develop competing products .
Symantec said technology in Microsoft 's upcoming Windows Vista operating system , due next year , misappropriates trade secrets found in its Volume Manager product , which it gained when it bought Veritas .
Symantec went to court to stop Microsoft from developing or distributing Vista until Microsoft removes the intellectual property .
Microsoft in its statement said it had " worked hard " to resolve the dispute with Symantec and has " gone to great lengths " to ensure that its volume management technology works " side by side " with Symantec's .
Symantec and Microsoft have become sharper competitors of late , as Microsoft acquires and builds more network security functions into its products .
The lawsuit comes amid a charged atmosphere for intellectual property litigation .
A Supreme Court ruling this week in favor of online auction company eBay in a patent infringement case could make it more difficult for litigants in intellectual property cases in the technology industry to gain injunctions to block distribution of other companies ' competing products .
In addition , a New Zealand actor moved the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reconsider the patent it granted to Amazon.com for its one - click shopping feature .

See how much the landscape of the lake has changed
Enlarge Image
When park rangers patrolled the area in the Magallanes region in March , the two - hectare ( five - acre ) lake was its normal size , officials say .
But last month they found a huge dry crater and several stranded chunks of ice that used to float on the water .
One theory is that an earthquake opened up a fissure in the ground , allowing the lake 's water to drain through .
" In March we patrolled the area and everything was normal , " said Juan Jose Romero from Chile 's National Forestry Corporation , Conaf .
" We went again in May and to our surprise we found that the lake had completely disappeared .
All that was left were chunks of ice and an enormous fissure . "
Geologists and other experts are being sent to the area , which is some 2,000 km ( 1,250 miles ) south of the capital , Santiago , to investigate .
The region is shaken by frequent earth tremors and one idea is that a strong quake which hit the neighbouring region of Aysen in April opened up the fissure in the bottom of the lake .
A glacier specialist , Andres Rivera , told Chilean newspaper La Tercera that the lake 's disappearance seemed to be part of the continual reforming of the landscape .
The Magallanes area " has seen interesting changes in the last few decades , " he said , noting that the lake itself had not been there 30 years ago .
Courts Tell Prez : You 're Not Above the Constitution Posted by Pile ( 5751 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
President George W. Bush 's broad assertions of power in his war on terrorism are under assault by U.S. judges who have rejected his indefinite imprisonment of enemy combatants and the domestic spying program .
A pair of recent rulings , one from military judges and the other from a U.S. appeals court , delivered new legal setbacks for Bush 's tactics in dealing with terrorism suspects held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , or in the United States .
" In case after case , this nation 's judicial branch has told the administration that it may not trample on fundamental rights in the name of national security , " said Hina Shamsi of the New York - based group Human Rights First .
A federal appeals court panel in Virginia ruled 2 - 1 on Monday that Bush could not declare civilians in this country to be enemy combatants and have the military hold them indefinitely .
The ruling said Bush overstepped his authority in the case of a Qatari national and suspected al - Qaeda operative , Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , who has been held in military custody for four years without any charges .
Human rights and civil liberties groups said the decision underscored the importance of judicial review as a check on Bush 's executive power .
" Once again , the courts have stepped in to rein in the executive and restore the rule of law , " said Jennifer Daskal , U.S. advocacy director of Human Rights Watch .
The ruling came a week after military judges dismissed all charges against the only two Guantanamo prisoners facing trial , saying they had been designated only as " enemy combatants , " and not " unlawful enemy combatants " as required by a 2006 law .

If that sounds like wild , lunatic fantasy , it is - for the Middle East at any rate .
But something very much like it is happening before our eyes in Northern Ireland .
In Sharon 's place is Ian Paisley , the octogenarian embodiment of Unionist intransigence , whose Democratic Unionist party is likely to emerge as the largest single party in today 's elections for the Northern Ireland assembly .
For Ismail Haniyeh , read Martin McGuinness who will serve as deputy first minister .
That 's right : McGuinness , widely famed as a former IRA commander , will team up with Paisley , who made a reputation denouncing the IRA as bloodthirsty , murdering bastards whose only place was frying in the fires of hell .
At Paisley 's side , as education minister , we may well see Gerry Kelly , a former hunger striker jailed for his part in the IRA bombings of the Old Bailey and Scotland Yard .
And yes , one of the big issues before the Paisley administration will be the price of Northern Irish water .
Of course , the analogy is not perfect .
( Last time I deployed it , several readers shot back that the IRA never rejected Britain 's right to exist , in contrast with Hamas 's position on Israel . )
But it helps convey the scale of the transformation now underway in Northern Ireland .
A place that was riven by violent conflict - euphemistically referred to as the Troubles - is striding towards normality .
And those who are crafting this peace are the very same people who made the war .
It makes for some eye - popping transitions .
The new general secretary of Sinn Féin , set to be charged with governing Northern Ireland , is officially wanted in Northern Ireland for the shooting of a British soldier 30 years ago .
When Sinn Féin 's conference recently discussed the party 's policy on climate change , the debate was led by one James Monaghan .
He 's wanted in Colombia , where he skipped bail after allegedly aiding Farc " narco- terrorists " .
Now he talks about carbon emissions .
The people of Northern Ireland have had a few years to get used to all this , but for those outside it can still come as a delightful shock .
You only have to imagine the equivalent changes in Israel - Palestine to see how far the province has come .
As Paisley himself put it this week : " The political landscape has been transformed in a way that ... many said was impossible . "
Among the " many " were Unionism 's cheerleaders in Britain , in the Conservative party and in the commentariat .
I remember columnists Stephen Glover , Charles Moore and Michael Gove all insisting that the IRA was irredeemably bent on war , that negotiations with republicanism were a treachery doomed to fail .
They were all wrong .
Of course , things can unravel .
The adrenaline junkies who serve as Northern Ireland 's politicians tend to take things to the wire and they still might hesitate .
Their deadline for forming a power - sharing executive is midnight on March 26 .
Expect negotiations to be still underway , both sides trying to extract the best possible deal , at 11.55 pm .
But it 's hard to see what grounds they would have for failing to do the business now .
Unionists have got what they never expected : an IRA declaration that their war is over and the verified decommissioning of their weapons .
In January Sinn Féin removed the last obstacle in the way , by agreeing to back policing arrangements for the province .
There 's not much Paisley can ask for that he has n't already got .
One British official says that if Paisley does not go ahead and form a government it will be because the old warhorse simply " bottled it " .
And so the campaign in Northern Ireland has not been about bombs and bullets , or the great national question , but about the humdrum stuff of normal politics .
The biggest Belfast rally of recent months was about that increase in water charges .
What 's more , the parties have fought an oddly consensual campaign .
They differ on education - nationalists tend to oppose selection , Unionists support it - but on the rest there is a striking uniformity .
" You can not put a bus ticket between them , " says Mick Fealty , of the indispensable Slugger O'Toole blog .
That 's no coincidence .
The DUP and Sinn Féin , along with the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP , have spent months hammering out what will , in effect , be the programme for the new devolved executive .
They know that , whatever votes are cast today , they will all be in government .
Those are the rules of the game , as laid out in the Good Friday agreement : a " mandatory coalition " in which every party with a serious number of seats gets a place at the governing table .
The result is a kind of hyper - normality , in which there can be no real policy disagreements because everyone is going to end up on the same side , governing together .
It means Northern Ireland is about to jump from civil war to soggy consensuality , without ever passing through democratic , adversarial politics .
And yet the national question is not going away .
It 's just being resolved in a new way - with not a shot , nor even an argument , being heard .
The driving force is the economic success of the Irish republic , a surge in prosperity which the north wants a part of .
All the main parties are calling on London to reduce Northern Ireland 's rate of corporation tax , for example , to bring it into line with the investment - attracting south .
Even Ian Paisley is in favour of this little piece of all - Ireland harmonisation .
Meanwhile , the secretary of state Peter Hain won plaudits when he demanded mobile phone companies drop their " roaming " charges across the Irish border , replacing them with one rate for the entire island .
He 's also legislated for a single electricity market covering north and south .
Indeed , Hain has said that a single , Northern Irish economy is unsustainable , that only an " island of Ireland economy " makes sense .
Paisley heard that as a pro-nationalist message and called for Hain 's resignation .
But when business leaders backed Hain , Paisley quietly dropped it .
Gradually and through economics rather than politics - still less armed struggle - Ireland is moving towards a kind of de facto unification .
There are plans for a new road linking Dublin to Derry .
The Irish government has announced that the north is eligible to compete for a share of Dublin's € 1bn national development fund .
Each year that passes , the border separating north and south will come to look more obsolete .
It will not be Semtex and Armalites that erase it , but the slower , subtler suasions of wealth and convenience .
Normality is coming to Northern Ireland - but it 's taken a damn strange route .

NEWPORT BEACH , Calif . — Stephen E. Abraham ’s assignment to the Pentagon unit that runs the hearings at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , seemed a perfect fit .
A lawyer in civilian life , he had been decorated for counterespionage and counterterrorism work during 22 years as a reserve Army intelligence officer in which he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel .
His posting , just as the Guantánamo hearings were accelerating in 2004 , gave him a close - up view of the government ’s detention policies .
It also turned him into one of the Bush administration ’s most unlikely adversaries .
In June , Colonel Abraham became the first military insider to criticize publicly the Guantánamo hearings , which determine whether detainees should be held indefinitely as enemy combatants .
Just days after detainees ’ lawyers submitted an affidavit containing his criticisms , the United States Supreme Court reversed itself and agreed to hear an appeal arguing that the hearings are unjust and that detainees have a right to contest their detentions in federal court .
Some lawyers say Colonel Abraham ’s account — of a hearing procedure that he described as deeply flawed and largely a tool for commanders to rubber - stamp decisions they had already made — may have played an important role in the justices ’ highly unusual reversal .
That decision once again brought the administration face to face with the vexing legal , political and diplomatic questions about the fate of Guantánamo and the roughly 360 men still held there .

Linux OS is not restrained by specific requirements of any kind of hardware .
Therefore , before throwing away your older and almost useless computers and computer parts , give them a second chance .
The older computers can be easily used by installing lightweight Linux OS .
Lightweight Linux OS will give breathe life into these older models .
Lubuntu , Puppy Linux , Bodhi Linux , Linux Lite , Tiny core , are good examples of Linux OS for older computers .
There is no bigger injustice than throwing away something that can be used .
Install a lightweight Linux OS and use the computer without any problems .
The next terrorist threat may come from the deep .
In recent years , several homeland security alerts have focused on the danger of scuba - equipped terrorists targeting docked Navy vessels or ocean - side nuclear plants .
Now the U.S. military is quietly developing a new generation of underwater weaponry capable of warding off undersea trespassers with liquid bullets .
It 's a revival of an underwater arms race that was hot during the Cold War , when Western scientists sometimes struggled to match Russian technology .
The Soviet threat was estimated to include some three thousand Special Forces frogmen – an opponent virtually impervious to traditional arms .
Normal guns will work underwater , but the drag slows bullets right down .
" I have tried it myself in our pool , " says Scott Greenbaum , a Certified Glock Armourer and webmaster at GlockFAQ.com .
" The bullets only traveled about 15 feet . "
In addition to the drag , firing underwater is hazardous :
Some types of ammunition can burst the gun , and the shockwave from the muzzle blast can cause permanent hearing damage .
The Glock 17 is one of the few weapons that can be customized to fire underwater , with the aid of maritime spring cups , which stop water from impeding the firing pin .
But the amphibious glock is designed to be carried , not used , under water .
" I 've never heard of anyone actually shooting a shark , or fish , or person , or anything , " says Greenbaum .
So in 1970 the U.S. Navy introduced a special weapon for the job : a chunky six - shooter called the Underwater Defense Gun , or UDG .
Instead of firing bullets , the UDG " fired a stiletto - type dart that could provide range , accuracy and lethality underwater , " says Tom Hawkins of the nonprofit Naval Special Warfare Foundation .
To reduce shockwaves , a pusher piston sealed the barrel after firing .
Each barrel could only fire once , hence the need for six separate barrels and the weapon 's chubby profile .
The effective range was about 30 feet .
As a bonus , the subsonic projectile and sealed firing system made the gun virtually silent above water .
" The weapon worked quite well , " says Hawkins , " but it was bulky and heavy and the men never warmed up to it .
It was also a signature controlled item – as in signing your name to check it out – and administratively a burden to the operational units . "
At around the same time , another approach surfaced in the privately developed Gyrojet pistol , a James Bond weapon that fired miniature rockets ( Bond even uses one in You Only Live Twice ) .
Unlike bullets , rockets accelerate after firing and experience less drag .
But the Navy found the underwater rockets inaccurate , only hitting a human - sized target half the time at 30 feet .
It was not adopted .
Steve Ritter , a weapons designer and Gyrojet expert , believes the testing was unfair .
" Accuracy was an issue , but it appears that most of this problem was an ammunition quality - control problem . "
Meanwhile , on the other side of the Iron Curtain , Russian engineer Ivan Kasyanov of the Klimov Institute had found a revolutionary solution to the problem : a projectile which he called a “ flying nail . ”
It had twice the range of the U.S. equivalent , its secret being a blunt tip instead of a stiletto - point .
Underwater , a blunt projectile forces the water away on either side of it .
At a high enough velocity , this causes such low pressures that a cavity forms .
This cavitation decreases the drag on the rest of the projectile .
Supercavitation , in which the entire projectile apart from the tip is enclosed by the cavity , hit the headlines in the '90s with the advent of the Russian 200 - mph Shkval rocket torpedo .
But the smaller projectile had already been around for years .
The SPP - 1 flying - nail pistol came into service in 1971 .
It is more compact than the Underwater Defense Gun and half the weight , and even now is standard issue for Russian combat divers , including a section of the Presidential Security Service that patrols the flooded sewers connecting the Kremlin to the Moskva River .
An even more formidable flying - nail weapon followed in 1975 , called the APS or Special Underwater Assault rifle .
" The APS is a lot like a Kalashnikov actually , " says Russian defense analyst Viktor Litovkin .
" It has a rate of 500 rounds per minute . "
The APS has an underwater range of a hundred feet , the practical limit of visibility in good conditions .
The latest Western technology in use is the Heckler & Koch P11 , which appeared in 1976 , and is wielded by U.S. , British and German special operations forces .
Contrary to rumor , it does officially exist , but the technical details are kept secret , even more than 30 years after the gun was first issued .
" The pistol P11 is a classified weapon according to regulations of the NATO and the German government , " Marc Roth of Heckler & Koch told Wired News .
" Due to this we are not authorized to reveal or confirm any technical data of this weapon . "
What is known is that the P11 fires a heavy projectile at fairly low velocity , with an effective range similar to the Russian SPP - 1 .
It seems likely that the bullets are cavitating , as Germany has long been a leader in this area .
Today , the first line of defense against underwater terrorists – should they emerge – will be sonar and depth charges , rather than armed frogmen standing guard .
But anyone tangling with combat divers will find them very well armed , and U.S. scientists are developing the next generation of underwater weapons .
Much of their work relates to larger projectiles for mine or torpedo defense , but is also applicable to small arms .
Chris Weiland of the Advanced Experimental Thermofluid Engineering Research Laboratory in the mechanical engineering department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute is looking at new ways of achieving cavitation by injecting pressurized gas into the path of the projectile .
" Natural cavitation only takes place at very high speeds , " says Weiland .
" This can be dramatically reduced . "
Once a supercavitation bubble is established it can be maintained by venting rocket exhaust into it ( " ventilated cavitation " ) , a system employed by the Russian Shkval torpedo .
Developers of a modern Gyrojet pistol could use this method to give it greater range and power than any existing underwater weapon .
Perhaps the most intriguing hint of where the underwater arms race is headed comes from a 2005 U.S. patent granted to Thomas J. Gieseke , a Navy scientist at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center .
The patent proposes a " high - velocity underwater jet weapon " that fires a stream of high - velocity liquid " bullets " – fine grains of metal or sand that form a cavity more efficiently than solid rounds .
Gieseke declined to comment on the research , which gives a whole new meaning to the term " water pistol . "
He is kidding , right ?
Lecturing Putin about derailing democracy ?
Sorry , Mr. Bush , but Putin is doing exactly what you and Cheney and the Republicans have been doing in our country over the past six years .
When the going got tough , you threw democracy under the bus .
You and the Republicans are fair - weather democrats .
You only believe in democracy when the going gets easy .
When terrorists strike , when you fear for your nation ’s safety , you are the first to roll back democracy , to spy on your own citizens , to take away their rights to a fair trial , to try them in secret courts – just like the Soviets used to .
Remember that cute little phrase that the Republicans in the Senate all liked to quote in order to justify revoking our democratic liberties at home ?
You have no constitutional rights if you ’re dead .
Here is the former Republican chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Pat Roberts , the guy who was in charge of making sure the Bush administration did n’t violate our democracy by illegally spying on us just like the communists do on their own citizens :
“ I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment , the Fourth Amendment and civil liberties , ” Senator Pat Roberts ( R - Kansas ) remarked at yesterday ’s Hayden confirmation hearings , “ but you have no civil liberties if you are dead . ”
Just a fluke ?
Hardly .
Here are two more GOP Senators in the past year or two :
GOP Senator Jeff Sessions referring to the rightness of Bush ’s domestic spying after 9/11 declared melodramatically : “ Over 3,000 Americans have no civil rights because they are no longer with us . ”
… Senator John Cornyn , a Texas Republican , said on December 20 , 2005 : “ None of your civil liberties matter much after you ’re dead . ”
What they mean is , what ’s the point of upholding the Constitution ’s rights if we end up dying as a result ?
Well , I suspect Putin would argue that you have no fledgling democratic reforms if you ’re all dead .
So spare us the lectures directed at Russia , Mr. Bush , a country that has suffered the same kind of terrorism that America faces , and actually suffers from greater instability than we do by far ( they ’ve even got a serious separatist movement ) .
That certainly does n’t excuse Russia rolling back democratic reforms – I do n’t believe that any country should roll back democracy for any reason .
It ’s not as if the Framers of the Constitution , the guys who signed the Declaration of Independence , were living during stable and secure times .
Yet it was during times of trouble , times of uncertainty , times of danger that the founders of our country penned those very freedoms that Bush and Putin now believe are n’t required during times of danger .
George Bush and the Republicans do n’t believe in democracy .
They have no right to lecture Putin for doing exactly what they would do , exactly what they have done .
Welcome men ( and women ) .
So you or your partner is having a hard time lasting in bed .
Weather its a severe case of premature ejaculation or you ’d just like to add a few extra minutes to your lasting time there are no shortage of people , products and web pages claiming to offer the best method of curing premature ejaculation for you .
It ’s tough to weed through all those brash claims and promises to find a solution that will work for you .
So here I give you the ultimate list of premature ejaculation treatment methods .
We have tried to be as independent as possible and have listed the strengths and weaknesses of each treatment or method .
While we do n’t consider premature ejaculation to be a medical issue in the vast majority of cases , there are a few instances where it has a genuine medical cause .
In these cases it is important that you consult you medical professional .
If you ’d like to skip straight to the most effective way to stop premature ejaculation here ’s a 9 step blueprint to get you started .
Training Course
This approach will be the best way for most men to get started .
The key is to find a good program such as Beyond Delay written by an expert .
Do n’t make the mistake of following a program based on one guys story .
What works for one man does not always work for the best so you ’ll need a range of training methods and techniques to have the best change of eliminating premature ejaculation .
Stop and Start Method
The stop and start method was originally devised by a team of researches called Masters and Johnson and marked one of the earliest documented attempts at treating premature ejaculation through exercises .
It can be completed either on your own or with a partner and is an exercises that involves stimulation the male until just before the point of orgasm .
At this point
Premature Ejaculation Pills ( natural )
We have talked in detail about the herbal kind of premature ejaculation pill and what you can expect from them .
There are quite a few brands of premature ejaculation pills sold on line with some looking more dubious than others .
But the most important thing is what ’s in them , and what this ingredient can do to help you last longer in bed .
Let ’s take a look .
After checking out the 5 most popular brands of premature ejaculation tablets , most contained at least 3 of the following ingredient .
Folic Acid
L- Arginine
Pyrodoxine
Chrysin
Griffonia simplicifolia extract
Piper nigrum extract
Also present in most of these pills is a large amount of filler ingredient .
Usually a combination of 2 or more of the following ingredeince
Rice flour
Gelatin
Magnesium Stearate
Silicone
Dioxide
Starch
None of the active ingredient of these pills has been proven to work on any evidence based test .
There are quite a few anecdotal reports online about the effectiveness of these pills , however most are on Affiliate websites who make large commissions by recommending these pills so are likely to be fudged and fake .

Premature Ejaculation Coach
This is probably the most effective way to treat premature ejaculation .
The trick is to find a good coach .
The problem is that they are very few and far between .
Premature Ejaculation Medication
Disclaimer : I am an expert on premature ejaculation , but I ’m not a doctor .
If you are considering this route , or if you feel that your premature ejaculation is caused by a genuine medical issue you should talk to a trusted medical practitioner .
To date there have been no specifically designed drugs or medication to treat premature ejaculation
Yet in some cases specialists will prescribe SSRI ( also known as anti-depression ) medication .
In trials some men did report an extended duration of intercourse after using a course of this medication .
While the results were not overly conclusive .
While premature ejaculation is almost always a non medical issue there are some cases where it is so severe
Kegels Exercises
Kegels is the name given to pelvic floor exercises that were originally developed to assist pregnant women prepare for childbirth .
The logic behind Kegels excises as a method to treat premature ejaculation is pretty straight forward .
Kegels work the pelvic floor muscles around the prostate .
These are the same muscles that trigger ejaculation in men .
So it seems to make sense that exerting these muscles would be beneficial to men who can last in bed .
The problem with this assumption is that there is a big difference between strengthening these muscles and gaining control over their state .
These are actually one of the hardest muscles in the body to control and while kegels may strengthen this area , it will not lead to increased control unless done in a highly focused way and in combination with other ejaculatory control methods .
Some men have reported that kegels have made their premature ejaculation problem worse so make sure to get some qualified advice before starting an exercise regime to target your premature ejaculation
Premature Ejaculation Books
There are a few books and courses that can help men last longer in bed naturally , but some are much better than others .
Beyond Delay is obviously the best around and I recommend grabbing that if you are effected by premature ejaculation .
But will you need any other books during your quest to last longer ?
Premature Ejaculation Sprays
Recently there ’s been a few large companies who have been heavily marketing a numbing spray as a premature ejaculation treatment .
While there is nothing new about this approach to last longer in bed , it does seem to be becoming a popular way to go for some men looking for a quick fix .
We ’ve discussed these sprays for premature ejaculation previously and as with so many of the “ quick fix ” methods of treating premature ejaculation it falls well short of many men ’s expectations .

Premature Ejaculation Book
While not as effective as a practical course and training program and book on premature ejaculation can help you know more about what is occurring .
The Distraction Method
At the other end of the spectrum comes the distraction method as featured in collage movies , locker rooms and online forums .
You might be surprised to learn that this is one of the worst things you can do if you want to permanently last longer in bed .
Mike discusses this in chapter 6 of the Beyond Delay training course where he shows men how to get in the zone during intercourse .
He teaches some killer techniques but he also starts of the chapter by explaining why turning in and not out is the best way avoid the perception on an overly sensitive penis .
Positives of The Distraction Method

Kegels Exercises
There ’s a lot of people promoting kegels exercises as a treatment for early ejaculation , however you ’ll have to be careful to do them the right way .
Last Longer Condoms
Another approach along the “ desensitizing ” line , is to use a so called “ Last longer condom ” .
These condoms have a small amount of anesthetic on the inside which deadens your genital sensation in much the same way as premature ejaculation sprays do .
This approach has many of the same drawback as all other numbing products .
There is also a higher chance of inadvertently applying some of the active ingredient to your partner which will lead to a lack of sensitivity for her , likely making it next to impossible for her to reach orgasm .

Premature Ejaculation Training Courses
While there have been some very average books and training courses sold online as a treatment for premature ejaculation in the past , this analysis will use the Beyond Delay premature ejaculation method as the benchmark for this treatment method .
Most men do n’t really know what to expect when they first here about a “ premature ejaculation training program ” .
They may envisage a range of weird and awkward exercises , or grueling training but the reality is quite different .
The key for a good premature ejaculation training system to work is to focus on improving a range of skills and areas that a known to contribute to premature ejaculation .
Beyond delay does incorporate some of the exercises based treatments discussed here ( such as kegels and stop and start ) , albeit a much more advanced method using them .
But the real trick is to combine that with a range of other skills .
And that leaves us to the problem with many of the treatments for premature ejaculation discussed here .
They are just to singular .
The only attack the problem from one angle .
The real key to lasting longer is to use a multi pronged approach and work on improving all these skills at once .
Make sure you are using correct breathing techniques before and during sex
Know visualization , and meditative methods to relax your mind and body before and during intercourse

It ’s important for you to decide what you want .

Do you just want a quick fix or are you prepared to put some work in and train yourself .
If you feel there may be a problem within your prostate area it ’s important to get it checked out by a qualified medical practitioner .
A virtual land dispute in Second Life will be resolved in federal court after a judge 's ruling .
A lawsuit filed in May of 2006 by Pennsylvania attorney Marc Bragg accused Linden Lab and its CEO Philip Rosedale of wrongfully seizing his virtual land and unilaterally shutting down his Second Life account — intellectual property that Bragg says is worth thousands of ( real - life ) dollars .
Linden Lab filed two motions to dismiss the suit , arguing that Bragg came into possession of his land wrongfully , but the Pennsylvania judge denied those motions .
Linden Lab has long maintained that virtual " property " owned by its residents in Second Life belongs to the players .
Therefore , things like virtual clothing , buildings , and land all legitimately belong to the residents who created or purchased them , and the burgeoning trade of such is legitimate .
Linden Lab sells " land " to residents directly — which translates in real life to server space for the land and things that are built on it — and does so through online auctions .
Bragg purchased the land in question through an auction offered by the company , which he argues is the company 's fault for selling it to him if he was n't supposed to have it .
" I am reaching out to you that wish to help support this case and assist me in deflecting some of the substantial costs that could arise from these acts , " pleaded Bragg on his law office 's web site .
" The issues being litigated are important to many people participating in Second Life , as well as MMORPGs generally , and they should not be abandoned simply because the Defendants succeed by stretching the financial resources of a single man . "
But Bragg did n't win the auction in the same way that most people do .
The auction was n't publicly available yet and was not posted on Linden Lab 's main auction page , but he was able to access it by changing out the ID number in a URL for an auction that was public for one that was n't .
He was then able to purchase the land for far below ( virtual ) market value and complete the sale automatically before the auction ever officially started .
Linden Lab and Rosedale made a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction and another motion to compel arbitration .
The West Chester judge , however , denied both motions and said that while Linden Lab 's terms of service — which Bragg admits to agreeing to — say that disputes must be carried out in California , Second Life is ultimately a business that operates across multiple states by virtue of operating on the Internet , and therefore the complaints can be heard outside of California 's law system .
Bragg is demanding roughly $ 8,000 in restitution from Linden Lab , and it appears as if this will be the first case over virtual land to make it all the way to court .
Some believe that the outcome of the case could affect how the ownership of virtual property is treated in relation to games like Second Life and World of Warcraft , where users often buy and sell items with both virtual and real money .
However , the case may never address the topic of virtual property , as the dispute centers mostly around Second Life 's terms of service and how the company 's insecure auction result should be handled .
Linden Lab made a mistake , and a player managed to take advantage of it .
The sweet smell of success may be the kiss of death for men who hope to get hitched , according to psychologists .
When it comes to marriage material , women are wary of good - looking high - fliers , and are drawn to less successful men instead , they claim .
The subtle shift in women 's preferences emerged during psychological tests at the University of Central Lancashire .
The researchers behind the studies believe women may subconsciously steer clear of attractive , high - status men because they fear they are either more likely to be unfaithful or will devote too little time to the relationship and future family .
To test the influence of a man 's status on his marriage potential , Simon Chu and his colleagues created fictional personal ads , accompanied by pictures of men previously ranked as either unattractive , moderately attractive or very attractive .
The adverts included common phrases from lonely hearts columns and information about the men's careers , using Office of National Statistics criteria to assign jobs of high , medium or low status .
The highest status jobs included company directors and architects , medium status jobs included teachers and travel agents , while waiters and postmen were among the lowest status jobs .
The adverts were shown to classes of 186 women who were asked to rank the men according to their appeal as a long - term partner .
While better looking men fared better than uglier ones , the most successful and handsome men did not come out tops .
Instead , women ranked them as low as the poorest men , preferring instead men with more modest jobs .
The psychologists believe the women may see good - looking , successful men as too good to be true .
" Given a choice between the attractive males , there does appear to be a rather subtle preference on the part of the females for males of a lesser status and likelihood of infidelity or desertion , " the researchers write in the journal Personality and Individual Differences .
" Females may be slightly adjusting their preferences away from males who are potentially more likely to cheat . "
An alternative explanation , they add , is that high - fliers might be viewed as less willing to put effort into a relationship and family .
" Having a partner who is able to spend time raising children is clearly an advantage , " they say .

There have been 11 negative studies on nanotech 's effect on health and the environment , and they 're coming from DuPont and NASA and major universities , not from Greenpeace .
Meanwhile , products with nanomaterials are slipping through FDA loopholes and making it to market without proper testing .

It 's always dangerous to take early studies and try to make generalizations .
Nanotech is certainly not completely new or unnatural .
Natural nanomaterials are released in the environment - through forest fires , volcanic eruptions , diesel exhaust .
Once we figure out what 's analogous to current systems , we 'll find that we have already done a lot of the work of testing .

Scientists analysed the sediment - rich base of the ice cores
DNA extracted from ice cores shows that moths and butterflies were living in forests of spruce and pine in the area between 450,000 and 800,000 years ago .
Researchers writing in Science magazine say the specimens could represent the oldest pure DNA samples ever obtained .
The ice cores also suggest that the ice sheet is more resistant to warming than previously thought , the scientists say .
" We have shown for the first time that southern Greenland , which is currently hidden under more than 2 km of ice , was once very different to the Greenland we see today , " said Professor Eske Willerslev from the University of Copenhagen , Denmark , and one of the authors of the paper .
" What we 've learned is that this part of the world was significantly warmer than most people thought , " added Professor Martin Sharp from the University of Alberta , Canada , and a co-author of the Science paper .
Ice - locker
The ancient boreal forests were thought to cover southern Greenland during a period of increased global temperatures , known as an interglacial .
Temperatures at the time were probably between 10C in summer and - 17C in winter .
When the temperatures dropped again 450,000 years ago , the forests and their inhabitants were covered by the advancing ice , effectively freezing them in time .
SAMPLE SITES
Dye 3 : 2 km long ice core Greenland Ice Core Project ( GRIP ) : 3 km long ice core John Evans Glacier ( JEG ) : Control site Kap Kobenhavn : Previously youngest known Greenland forest
Studies suggest that even during the last interglacial ( 116,000 - 130,000 years ago ) , when temperatures were thought to be 5C warmer than today , the ice persevered , keeping the delicate samples entombed and free from contamination and decay .
At the time the ice is estimated to have been between 1,000 and 1,500 m thick .
" If our data is correct , then this means that the southern Greenland ice cap is more stable than previously thought , " said Professor Willerslev .
" This may have implications for how the ice sheets respond to global warming . "
Research by Australian scientists has suggested that a 3C rise in global temperatures would be enough to trigger the melting of the Greenland ice sheet .
In 2006 , research conducted by researchers at Nasa suggested that the rate of melting of the giant ice sheet had tripled since 2004 .
While in February 2006 , researchers found that Greenland 's glaciers were moving much faster than before , meaning that more of its ice was entering the sea .
And in 1996 , Greenland was losing about 100 cubic km per year in mass from its ice sheet ; by 2005 , this had increased to about 220 cubic km .
A complete melt of the ice sheet would cause a global sea level rise of about 7 m ; but the current picture indicates that while some regions are thinning , others are apparently getting thicker .
Plant-life
The new results were obtained from the sediment rich bottom of ice cores .
The 2 km - long Dye 3 core was drilled in south - central Greenland , whilst the 3 km - long Greenland Ice Core Project ( GRIP ) core was taken from the summit of the Greenland ice sheet .
Greenland heats up
Enlarge Image
Samples from other glaciers , such as the John Evans Glacier on Ellesmere Island , in northern Canada , were used as a control , to verify the age of the samples and to confirm that the DNA was from plants that grew in southern Greenland , rather than from plant matter carried by wind or water from elsewhere in the world .
Although the ice contained only a handful of pollen grains and no fossils , the researchers were able to extract DNA from the organic matter held in the silt .
Comparisons with modern species show that the area was populated by diverse forests made up of alders , spruce , pine and members of the yew family .
Living in the trees and on the forest floor was a wide variety of life including beetles , flies , spiders , butterflies and moths .
The discovery pushes forward the date when the last forests were known to exist in Greenland by nearly two million years .
Previously , the youngest fossil evidence of a native forest in the region came from fossils found in the Kap Kobenhavn Formation in northern Greenland .
There , the fossils date from around 2.4 m years ago .
The study paves the way for scientists to probe beneath the ice in other parts of the world .
" Given that 10 % of the Earth 's terrestrial surface is covered by thick ice sheets , it could open up a world of new discoveries , " said Dr Enrico Cappellini of the University of York , UK .

Historical Origins
In 1991 , Sun Microsystems created a research project that was code named Green .
The project 's purpose was to create a language that could run intelligent consumer electronic devices ( set top boxes ) .
The project resulted in an object - oriented ( C - and C++ based ) language that it 's creator , James Gosling , called Oak .
He called it Oak after an oak tree outside his office window .
It turned out that there was already another computer language named Oak .
As a result , the new name of Java arose when a group of Sun employees went to a local coffee shop .
The marketplace for intelligent consumer devices was not going well at the time , and the Green project was almost cancelled .
Fortunately , the world wide web exploded in popularity in 1993 , and the advantages of using Java as a web programming language became apparent .
The first public release of Java was Java 1.0 in 1995 .
Java 2.0 was released in 1998 , and there were different editions for different platforms .
JSEE was the enterprise edition , JSSE was the standard edition , and JSME was for mobile applications .
In May 2007 , Sun made all of Java 's core code free / open source , except for a small portion , which they did not rights to .
Key Features
Java was designed to use small amounts of memory Java has an automatic " garbage collection " process that releases memory when it is no longer needed .
Java is an object - oriented language Java uses an intermediate language called bytecode to make it platform independent A Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) has been designed for most operating systems .
The Java Virtual Machine translates the intermediate bytecode to the native machine language for that operating system .
There are various methods of executing Java
The same Java code can run on a stand - alone computer , a browser client , or a web server .
Java code is called an " application " when it runs on a stand alone computer .
It is called an " applet " when it runs in a client 's browser , and it is called a " servlet " when it runs on the server .
Java Server Pages ( JSP ) are like Active Server Pages .
They carry out commands to process data and build web pages on the fly .
Java is different from JavaScript .
JavaScript is a just scripting language – it is not a full - blown language like Java .
Java is compiled into bytecode , but JavaScript is not .
JavaScript is embedded into static HTML pages to make them appear more dynamic .
For example , JavaScript might be used to create a pull - down menu or a pop - up screen .
Although Java applications and applets have experienced some success , Java 's real strength lies on the server side .
Java is the most popular language for communicating across the network , and Sun 's J2EE enterprise model has become the application server standard .

Smoking will be banned in workplaces from 30 April
Firms could be fined up to £ 2,500 if smokers are caught on their premises .
The Federation of Small Businesses said owners will need to be vigilant and staff will have to be trained to deal with people flouting the ban .
FSB spokesman Harry McGimpsey said enforcing the regulations would prove a challenge for its members .
" We represent over 6,000 businesses , many of which are pubs , clubs , cafes and restaurants , whose owners will feel the full force of the ban , " he said .
" While we support the health reasons behind it , which will on the whole benefit small businesses , some of the proposals will have cost implications for our members in terms of the signage required and preparing outside areas for customers who wish to smoke . "

As everyone has heard by now , Ann Coulter was a guest on Chris Matthews ’ Hardball on Tuesday the 26th , and as you ’d expect , she was obnoxious .
However , there was a surprise that put Coulter on the defensive even more than she normally is .
As she was randomly spewing forth with her usual venom , Matthews informed her that Elizabeth Edwards had called the show and said that she would like to talk to her .
Twitching in her seat , Coulter nevertheless put on her “ bring it ” front .
Edwards told Coulter that she ’d welcome her input on the issues , but that she needed to stop the personal attacks on her husband , and she also needed to quit talking about her deceased son .
In the recent past , Coulter called John Edwards a " f*g " and remarked that he was so shallow and so willing to advance his presidential candidacy that he had placed a bumper sticker on the back of his car that read , “ [ a ] sk me about my dead son ” .
Coulter came back with the feeble argument that the attacks were ultimately justified as the Edwards campaign was now using Coulter ’s prior statements about Edwards as a fundraising prompt .
What better to compel the generosity of the left than Ann Coulter ?
A Coulter sycophant lurking in Hardball ’s “ special outdoor audience ” that was gathered to get a glimpse of their queen asked , “ [ w ] hy is n’t John Edwards making this call ? ” Elizabeth Edwards responded that it was she who was the mother of the boy who died , and that defending her husband and her child ’s memory was basically on her .
This is a concept that Coulter probably does not grasp at all .
That the wife of a public figure , a candidate for president , could act spontaneously and independent of her husband or his handlers is possible , as Coulter has no point of reference .
Every move she makes is for effect , and she is lucratively rewarded for her undeniable abilities as a provocateur who considers no one and no ramifications .
No longer confined to outlets like Fox , her mean spirtedness is on display as a one - woman itinerant freak show that the mainstream media built .
It was on Harball last year that she called Al Gore a “ total f*ggot ” in the context of a conversation about a previous statement she made in which she remarked that “ Bill Clinton is gay ” , and if there is any doubt at all folks , to Ann Coulter it appears that being gay is the absolute worst insult she can inflict .
She seems to be fixated on the sexuality of others in a way that seems pathological , and her undoubtedly homophobic admirers eat it up .
Others too seem to be unable to turn away from this bad girl , no holds barred act hoping that if she makes news she ’ll do it on their shows .
Throughout Coulter ’s appearance on Hardball , Matthews transparently feigned a combination of fear and regret at having her as his guest for a second time , as she might “ get him into trouble ” , even though everyone knows she would not have been there if he had n’t wanted her to be .
Coulter ’s appearances on MSNBC seem particularly ironic as immediately after the Imus firing , the network made a short - lived attempt at a “ public conversation ” that was on the surface about race , but underlying that topic the dialogue was billed as one that was meant to examine what was in general , acceptable content for public consumption .
Examining the confusion of defamation and free speech via government regulated airwaves should be an equal opportunity pursuit .

Newsweek has once again issued its list of America ’s Best High Schools .
They ’re using the same goofy formula as before : the number of students from a school who show up for AP or IB exams , divided by the number who graduate .
Just showing up for an exam raises your school ’s rating ; graduating lowers your school ’s rating .
As before , my hypothetical Monkey High is still the best high school in the universe .
Monkey
High has a strict admissions policy , allowing only monkeys to enroll .
The monkeys are required to attend AP and IB exams ; but they learn nothing and thus fail to graduate .
Monkey High has an infinite rating on Newsweek ’s scale .
Also as before , Newsweek excludes selective schools whose students have high SAT scores .
Several such schools appear on a special list , with the mind - bending caption “ Newsweek excluded these high performers from the list of America ’s Best High Schools because so many of their students score well above the average on the SAT and ACT . ”
Some of these schools were relegated to the same list last year – and still , they ’re not even trying to lower their SAT scores !
Newsweek ’s FAQ tries to defend the formula , but actually only argues that it ’s good for more students to take challenging courses .
True , but that ’s not what Newsweek measures .
They also quote some studies , which do n’t support their formula [ emphasis added ] :
Studies by U.S. Department of Education senior researcher Clifford Adelman in 1999 and 2005 showed that the best predictors of college graduation were not good high - school grades or test scores , but whether or not a student had an intense academic experience in high school .
Such experiences were produced by taking higher - level math and English courses and struggling with the demands of college - level courses like AP or IB .
Two recent studies looked at more than 150,000 students in California and Texas and found if they had passing scores on AP exams they were more likely to do well academically in college .
Worst of all , if parents pay attention to the Newsweek rankings , schools will have an incentive to maximize their scores , which they can do in three ways : ( 1 ) force more students to show up for AP / IB exams , whether or not they are academically prepared , ( 2 ) avoid having high SAT scores , ( 3 ) lower the school ’s graduation rate , or at least do n’t try too hard to raise it .
When asked why they publishing rankings at all , the FAQ ’s answer includes this :
I am mildly ashamed of my reason for ranking , but I do it anyway .
I want people to pay attention to this issue , because I think it is vitally important for the improvement of American high schools .
Like most journalists , I learned long ago that we are tribal primates with a deep commitment to pecking orders .
As Monkey High principal , I agree wholeheartedly .
“ People are not willing to admit it , but Israel has reached the wall , ” Avrum Burg says .
STEVE BRODNER
The self - regard of Israelis is built , in no small part , around a sense of sang - froid , and yet few would deny that the past year was deeply unnerving .
Last July , Israel launched an aerial attack on Lebanon designed to destroy the arsenal of the radical Islamist group Hezbollah , the Party of God , and force its leader , Hassan Nasrallah , to return two kidnapped soldiers and end its cross - border rocket attacks .
“ If the soldiers are not returned , ” Dan Halutz , the Israeli Army ’s chief of staff , said at the time , “ we will turn Lebanon ’s clock back twenty years . ”
Israel bombed the runways of the Beirut airport , the Beirut - Damascus highway , and numerous towns , mainly in the south ; Hezbollah , from a network of guerrilla installations and tunnel networks worthy of the Vietcong , launched some four thousand rockets , mainly Katyushas , at cities in northern Israel .
Israel degraded Hezbollah ’s military capabilities , at least temporarily , but there was no victory .
Hezbollah survived and , in the eyes of the Islamic world , in doing so won ; Nasrallah emerged as an iconic hero ; and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran , one of his sponsors , called yet again for the elimination of Israel from the map of the Middle East .
Halutz , who had dumped all his stocks on the eve of the war , resigned , and Ehud Olmert , the Israeli Prime Minister , saw his approval rating fall to as low as two per cent .
More recently , Hezbollah ’s ideological ally in Palestine , Hamas — the Islamic Resistance Movement — led a violent uprising in the Gaza Strip , overwhelming its secular rival , Fatah .
Suddenly , Israel , backed by the United States , found itself propping up the Fatah leadership , in order not to lose the West Bank to Hamas as well .
Not even the ceremonial office of the Israeli Presidency was immune from the year ’s disasters : a few weeks ago , President Moshe Katsav agreed to plead guilty to multiple sexual offences and resign , lest he face trial for rape .
Despite a resilient , even booming economy , peace and stability have rarely seemed so distant .
In this atmosphere of post - traumatic gloom , Avraham Burg , a former Speaker of the Knesset , managed to inflame the Israeli public ( left , right , and center ) with little more than an interview in the liberal daily Ha’aretz , promoting his recent book , “ Defeating Hitler . ”
Short of being Prime Minister , Burg could not be higher in the Zionist establishment .
His father was a Cabinet minister for nearly four decades , serving under Prime Ministers from David Ben-Gurion to Shimon Peres .
In addition to a decade - long career in the Knesset , including four years as Speaker , Burg had also been leader of the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency for Israel .
And yet he did not obey the commands of pedigree .
“ Defeating Hitler ” and an earlier book , “ God Is Back , ” are , in combination , a despairing look at the Israeli condition .
Burg warns that an increasingly large and ardent sector of Israeli society disdains political democracy .
He describes the country in its current state as Holocaust - obsessed , militaristic , xenophobic , and , like Germany in the nineteen - thirties , vulnerable to an extremist minority .
Burg ’s interlocutor for the Ha’aretz article was Ari Shavit , a writer well known in Israel for his confrontational interviews and his cerebral opinion articles .
( His Profile of Ariel Sharon , “ The General , ” appeared in these pages in January , 2006 . )
Shavit ’s interviewing style is aggressive and moralistic — not so distant , at times , from Oriana Fallaci ’s in her prime .
Politically , he is left of center , but , in the view of some to his left , he has seemed apocalyptic of late , warning darkly of the “ existential ” threats against Israel .
In the preface to the interview , Shavit declared himself “ outraged ” by Burg ’s book : “ I saw it as one - dimensional and an unempathetic attack on the Israeli experience . ”
The Israeli political world is unfailingly intimate .
Shavit , who is forty - nine , and Burg , who is fifty - two , met twenty - five years ago , when they were both protesting against Israel ’s first war in Lebanon .
After the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Israel ’s allies among the Christian Phalangists in 1982 , Burg gave a powerful speech before four hundred thousand people at an anti-war demonstration in Tel Aviv — the biggest rally in the history of Israel .
This was his entrance into public life .
“ Because Avrum was a lefty and a religious Jew who wore a kippa , he really stood out among the left - wing speakers , ” Shavit told me .
“ That gave him a very specific role in our society , and he played it extremely well . ”
Whatever remained of the relationship between Burg and Shavit frayed badly when they met for their interview .
After Burg described Israel as a perpetually “ frightened society , ” the discussion quickly grew tense :
S**HAVIT : You are patronizing and supercilious , Avrum .
You have no empathy for Israelis .
You treat the Israeli Jew as a paranoid .
But , as the cliché goes , some paranoids really are persecuted .
On the day we are speaking , Ahmadinejad is saying that our days are numbered .
He promises to eradicate us .
No , he is not Hitler .
But he is also not a mirage .
He is a true threat .
He is the real world — a world you ignore .
B** URG : I say that as of this moment Israel is a state of trauma in nearly every one of its dimensions .
And it ’s not just a theoretical question .
Would our ability to cope with Iran not be much better if we renewed in Israel the ability to trust the world ?
Would it not be more right if we did n’t deal with the problem on our own but , rather , as part of a world alignment beginning with the Christian churches , going on to the governments and finally the armies ?
Instead , we say we do not trust the world , they will abandon us , and here ’s Chamberlain returning from Munich with the black umbrella and we will bomb them alone .
Burg has a fairly standard left - leaning view of the Palestinian question : even now , with Hamas in control of Gaza , the longer Israel delays in coming to terms with a sovereign Palestinian state , the more Palestinian society will radicalize and embrace maximalist , jihadi ideologies , and the more Israeli society will lose its moral sense .
But some of the views that Burg expressed in the interview were far from standard .
He told Shavit that civil disobedience would have been preferable to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto and that Israel should give up its nuclear weaponry in exchange for an unspecified “ deal ” with its Arab neighbors .
Israel ’s “ law of return , ” which allows any Jew around the world to immigrate and become a citizen , was “ dynamite ” in the Arab world , he said , and needed to be reëvaluated .
One subject that especially infuriated Shavit , and provoked countless letters to the editor , e-mail screeds , and editorial - page rebuttals , was Burg ’s depiction of the European Union as an almost irresistibly attractive “ biblical utopia ” and his flouting of the fact that he holds a French passport , because his wife is French - born , and voted in the recent French elections .
When Shavit asked Burg if he recommended that all Israelis acquire a second passport , Burg replied , “ Whoever can ” — a moment of determined cosmopolitanism .
Shavit sarcastically called Burg “ the prophet of Brussels . ”
He went on :
People always love to make fun of Microsoft for its borrowing of other companies ’ ideas .
Sometimes they ’re right , and many other times , they ’re wrong .
In fact , it ’s amazing how many times I ’ll hear people say that Microsoft ’s products are blatant rip - offs of Apple ideas .
Many times this is not true .
In fact , usually Apple is the one that copies other companies ( such as copying Konfabulator , now known as Yahoo !
Widgets , and taking its original MacOS interface from old Xerox ideas ) .
Microsoft often just follows suit , not because it loves to copy ideas , but because the ideas are good and worthy additions to Microsoft products .
As a result of my annoyance with people ’s love to claim foul at Microsoft ’s copying , I got kick out of loading up my personalized Google search page tonight .
Google has offered its users a personalized homepage for some time now , with its main draw being that you can see your favorite RSS feeds on your Google search page , in addition to a preview of your email and the local weather forecasts .
This interface , however , has always been fairly basic ( and arguably ugly ) .
I never really cared too much for this interface , but I was impressed with Microsoft ’s approach .
Since its launch , I ’ve been using Windows Live ( just recently out of beta ; previously known as start.com ) .
I ’ve always been impressed with Windows Live because of its sleek interface and handy options , such as the ability to have many pages through the use of tabs .
When I loaded up my Google search page , I was stunned to see that Google had done the unthinkable – it had copied Microsoft ’s Windows Live !
In a manner almost exactly like Windows Live ’s tabs , users are now able to have multiple pages for gadgets and RSS feeds on their Google personalized page .
Also , an " edit " function can now be found to the left of every X at the top right of each feed and gadget .
Windows
Live has an option just like this in the same location in its interface , except in the case of Windows Live , it ’s " Edit " .
Now , I do n’t think that the " edit " similarity is a very big deal , but the addition of tabs to Google ’s page is a blatant rip - off of Microsoft ’s sleek Windows Live .
The mighty Google has copied the " evil " Microsoft .
Nice move , Google .
Now we ’ll just have to wait and see how long it takes Google - lovers to proclaim that Google created tabs for search homepages .
I ’m sure it wo n’t take long , because , after all , Microsoft is always the company at fault , or so it would seem to many people .
Microsoft , keep up the great work .
After all , imitation is the highest form of flattery .
Google , you can keep your new tabbed interface .
I ’m sticking with Windows Live .

Once state - of - the - art mental healthcare facilities , Kirkbride buildings have long been relics of an obsolete therapeutic method known as Moral Treatment .
In the latter half of the 19th century , these massive structures were conceived as ideal sanctuaries for the mentally ill and as an active participent in their recovery .
Careful attention was given to every detail of their design to promote a healthy environment and convey a sense of respectable decorum .
Placed in secluded areas within expansive grounds , many of these insane asylums seemed almost palace - like from the outside .
But growing populations and insufficient funding led to unfortunate conditions , spoiling their idealistic promise .
Within decades of their first conception , new treatment methods and hospital design concepts emerged and the Kirkbride plan was eventually discarded .
Many existing Kirkbride buildings maintained a central place in the institutions which began within their walls , but by the end of the 20th century most had been completely abandoned or demolished .
A few have managed to survive into the 21st century intact and still in use , but many that survive sit abandoned and decaying — their mysterious grandeur intensified by their derelict condition .

Corruption within the Department of Interior may have allowed oil companies to improperly save billions at the expense of the taxpayers .
The Department ’s Inspector General has already made at least two criminal referals to the FBI and the Justice Department , and Congressional Democrats have launched several investigations and introduced new legislation to fix the problem .
In a nutshell , oil companies leasing federal land to drill for oil are required to pay the government royalties based on a percentage of their sales .
But under the Royalty - in - Kind program , the companies can pay in the form of oil and gas instead of cash .
The problem is that oil prices have increased more than the value of the oil and gas royalty revenues being recieved , meaning that the oil companies are managing to withhold a growing amount of their profits from Uncle Sam .

EARNINGS inequality has been increasing in rich countries , says the OECD .
From 1995 to 2005 the rise in earnings of the best - paid ten percent outpaced that of the worst - paid ten percent in 18 out of 20 countries .
Inequality is highest in Anglo - Saxon , entrepreneurial economies .
Hungary and Poland are exceptions , where large increases followed liberalisation after the collapse of communism .
Nordic countries , with their large welfare states and high taxation see most equality .
Inequality is often blamed on globalisation , which some argue has helped to depress the wages of the lower skilled .
However , top earners have also been gaining ground against middle earners .
This suggests that advances in information technology , which reward the highly skilled and eliminate many middle - ranking administrative jobs , may be the likelier suspect .
The OECD said this week that trade has contributed only modestly to the upward trend in inequality .

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania 's School of Medicine have discovered that common inhaled anesthetics increase the number of amyloid plaques in the brains of animals , which might accelerate the onset of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's .
Roderic Eckenhoff , MD , Vice Chair of Research in the University of Pennsylvania 's Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care , and his co-authors , report their findings in the Neurobiology of Aging .
Every year over 100 million people undergo surgery worldwide , most under general anesthesia with an inhaled drug .
These drugs clearly affect cognitive ability at least in the short term , but the growing concern is that inhaled anesthetics may affect a person well beyond the perioperative period , even permanently .
Several factors appear to play a role in this subtle loss of cognitive ability , most notably age .
A specific effect of these drugs on dementias like Alzheimer 's disease , though suspected for many years , has only been recently supported by data .
In 2003 , Eckenhoff 's group showed that the inhaled anesthetics enhance the aggregation and cytotoxicity of the amyloid beta peptide .
Just last month , a study reported that these drugs also enhance the production of amyloid beta in isolated cells .
But these protein and cell culture studies are a long way from showing that an effect occurs in vivo .
This new study provides the first evidence that the predicted effect occurs in animals .
" This animal study data suggests that we have to at least consider the possibility that anesthetics accelerate certain neurodegenerative disorders , " said Eckenhoff .
" In the field of Alzheimer 's research , most effort is focused on delaying , not curing the disease .
A delay in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease of only three to five years would be considered a success .
Therefore , if commonly used drugs , like anesthetics , are accelerating this disorder , even by a few years , then a similar success might follow even small changes in the care of the operative patient . "
Mice do n't naturally get Alzheimer 's , so the animals in this study were genetically engineered to express the human protein responsible , called amyloid beta .
" These mice develop a syndrome with many features of the human disease , " explains Eckenhoff .
Post - doctoral fellow and first author Shannon Bianchi , MD , exposed " middle - aged " Alzheimer mice to anesthetics at low to moderate concentrations for two hours a day over a total of five days , not unusual for a clinical scenario .
The cognitive abilities of the mice were then analyzed using standard behavioral tests , and their brains were examined for plaque and cell death .
" Compared to controls , the anesthesia did not appear to worsen cognitive ability , which was already considerably compromised at this age , but it did accelerate amyloid beta aggregation and plaque appearance , " said corresponding author Maryellen Eckenhoff , PhD .
" We need to test whether anesthetic at earlier , presymptomatic stages , might accelerate both cognitive loss and plaque . "
This is the main cause of concern because a large fraction of clinical patients receiving inhaled anesthetics during surgery are older , but presymptomatic individuals .
Are there anesthetics that do not accelerate plaque ?
" We think so , but far more research is necessary to show this with any confidence .
We have to take this one step at a time -- a problem has still not been demonstrated in humans " .
It is important to remember that this effect is likely to be subtle , especially with brief surgical procedures , so the risk of not having needed surgery may exceed any potential risk from this still unproven effect .
But this latest study adds a little urgency to the effort to find out .
" If inhaled anesthetics are contributing to the rise and early onset of this devastating disease then we need to know , and soon , " concludes Eckenhoff .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp. took another blow with Nintendo Co. ’s
Wii game console outselling its PlayStation 3 by more than five to one in Japan last month , raising doubts over Sony ’s nascent earnings recovery .
Nintendo President Satoru Iwata speaks at an earnings news conference in front of a screen showing the company 's Wii game console in Tokyo in this April 27 , 2007 file photo .
Nintendo Co.'s
Wii game console outsold Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 by more than five to one in Japan last month , Japanese game magazine publisher Enterbrain said , casting a shadow over a turnaround in Sony 's game business .

Sony ’s game division posted an operating loss of 232 billion yen ( $ 1.91 billion ) in the year ended March 31 due to hefty start - up costs of the PS3 , dragging down Sony ’s overall profitability .
There are investor concerns that a turnaround in its electronics division , led by robust sales of Bravia - brand flat TVs , could be offset by continued losses at the game unit .
In the latest step in its electronics operations , Sony said on Wednesday it would spend 60 billion yen over the next three years to boost its capacity to make image sensor chips , which are used in cellphones and digital cameras -- Sony ’s cash cow .
Sony sold 45,321 units of the PS3 in May , compared with 251,794 units of the Wii .
In April , the ratio was four to one in favor of the Wii , according to Japanese game magazine publisher Enterbrain .
Nintendo , known for such game characters as Mario , Donkey Kong and Pokemon , launched the Wii in November .
The device features a motion - sensitive controller that allows users to direct on - screen play by swinging it like a tennis racket or wielding it like a sword , opening a new avenue of game playing .
Rival Sony also started selling the PS3 late last year , but has seen slow demand so far due to its high price tag and limited availability of attractive software titles .
“ If there were half a dozen good titles people wanted to play on the PS3 , I ’m sure it would actually be doing quite well , ” KBC Securities analyst Hiroshi Kamide said .
Sony ruled the $ 30 billion global game industry over the past decade with the original PlayStation and PlayStation 2 .
“ We are only less than a year into the new ( console ) cycle .
It is wrong to say Nintendo has won and Sony has lost ...
It ’s not game over , but it ’s not very encouraging . ”
Sony aims to ship 11 million units of the PS3 in the current business year to March 2008 , up from 5.5 million a year earlier .
Hitting that target seems “ rather difficult ” , Kamide said .
In the United States , the Wii was the top - selling new console for the fourth month in a row in April , with Nintendo selling 360,000 units , while Sony sold 82,000 units of the PS3 and Microsoft Corp. sold 174,000 Xbox 360 machines .
Analysts say Sony may also face an uphill battle in its planned expansion in its sensor chip operations .
With the planned 60 billion yen investment , Sony will boost its output capacity of CMOS censor chips , which are more power efficient than CCDs -- the other type of major sensor chips .
Since Sony is relatively new to the CMOS market , it will likely need to offer its products at aggressive prices to compete with established makers such as Micron Technology Inc. and Toshiba Corp. , hurting its profitability , said Yoshihisa Toyosaki , president of research firm j - STAR Global Inc .
Nintendo shares closed up 0.5 percent at 42,800 yen , while Sony was up 0.4 percent at 6,870 yen .
Nintendo ’s stock nearly quadrupled over the past two years , initially driven by strong demand for its DS handheld players and then by popularity of the Wii , far outperforming Sony shares , which gained 75 percent .
Ahh , print publications .
Remember those ?
You'd go to the store , open a magazine , await the avalanche of cards that would fall out , fish one card out of the pile , fill it out , send it in , then camp out by the mailbox awaiting your first issue .
Jim T participated in an internship on the IT staff for a popular magazine in Chicago .
I know what you 're thinking , but no , it 's not a nature magazine , though bunnies are involved .
Subtlety !
Anyhow , he was tasked with interfacing his magazine 's site with a fulfillment house 's site , allowing people to subscribe online .
Everything was in place , so it could n't be simpler .
See , all he had to do was make a link to the fullfillment house 's site where the subscription form could be filled out , then redirect the user back to the magazine 's site .
" But wait , " cried the powers that be , " we ca n't allow users to leave our site ! "
The magazine wanted to own all rights to the content and the ability to update it at will .
Fortunately , the fulfillment house had a CGI app that Jim could post form data to .
It 'd only make sense that an application like this would accept the data and a redirect url , then data would be passed back to the provided url .
Parse the data , populate the page , and you 're done .
Easy .
But no , a single number was returned by the script .
You then had to manually look up whether it worked or not .
The developer that made the script was long gone and the fulfillment house was no help .
Jim was also concerned about transmitting payment data - specifically , credit card information .
Sure , there 's encryption , but honestly , who needs the hassle ?
The proposed solution ?
Hire a fleet of temps .
Yes , they proposed a solution similar to the " make a document in Office , set it on a table , take a picture , upload the picture , put it on a web site " approach .
Specifically :
Save data locally to the server .
At the end of each week , print out all of the data .
Fedex the data to the fulfillment office .
Hire temps at the fulfillment office to rekey the data into their systems .
Several protruding - veined , blue - faced arguments later , IT was able to deploy an alternate solution , which sadly still sucked .
Just not as bad .
Data is still stored locally .
The fulfillment house can grab the data via secure FTP .
The fulfillment house would have someone manually run the file through a utility each week .
This person would run it with their fingers crossed , hoping that all payment data was correct .
Since this was a weekly , manual process , the response time to the user was that of manually filling out an old - fashioned subscription card .
The user would find out if payment was successful in six to eight weeks , depending on whether the first issue actually arrived .
The day after Republicans blocked Democratic efforts to set a timetable for our troops withdrawal from Iraq , refusing to hold an up - or - down vote on something 70 % of the American people favor , the White House began a PR push to keep their lapdogs in line .
About 200 lawmakers were invited to the Pentagon for a classified question - and - answer session on Thursday with Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador there .
The two men were expected to brief lawmakers via satellite from Baghdad .
The officials were expected to make the case that some progress has been made in Iraq since Bush ordered the deployment of some 30,000 extra troops earlier this year .
The officials also were expected to argue it is too early to tell whether the strategy is working , and that members of Congress should hold off on demanding change until at least September .
The briefings cap off a week of contentious Senate debate on the war and a public relations blitz by the administration to shore up GOP support .
And in other news :
A Task Force Marne Soldier was killed by small arms fire July 19 near Rushdi Mullah .
The Soldier ’s name is being withheld pending notification of the next of kin .
Four Multi-National Division - Baghdad Soldiers and an Iraqi interpreter were killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near their patrol during combat operations in an eastern section of the Iraqi capital July 18 .
The deceased Soldiers ’ names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin and release by the Department of Defense .
... bringing the total of U.S. troops killed this month to 49 , along with the 1130 reported Iraqi civilian deaths .
But there 's progress , really , just give the administration a couple of more months to prove it .

BBC News , Jerusalem
The groups drew on the testimony of 73 Palestinians
The two groups said detainees were held in appalling conditions , and were sometimes tortured .
They said the maltreatment was intended to " break the spirit " of those who were being interrogated .
Israel 's justice ministry rejected the report - which was published on Sunday - as unrepresentative and inaccurate .
The report lists a number of techniques the two groups , B'Tselem and the HaMoked Centre for the Defence of the Individual , say are deployed by the Israeli Security Agency .
They range from preventing detainees from contacting their lawyers , to painful shackling to a chair , threats and intimidation , beating and sleep deprivation .
The groups drew on the testimony of 73 Palestinians detained over a six - month period .
International law
International law is clear in prohibiting ill - treatment or torture , and it allows for no extenuating circumstances .
However , the human rights groups point to a more ambiguous ruling from the Israeli High Court .
It decreed that members of the security service who abused detainees may be exempted from criminal liability , if they believed that the people they were interrogating had information about an imminent terrorist act .
The human rights campaigners also say that of more than 500 complaints about the behaviour of security service agents , not one criminal investigation has been opened .
The Ministry of Justice said the report was " fraught with mistakes , groundless claims and inaccuracies " .
In a statement , the ministry also said that over the past few years , information obtained by security service agents - sometimes through interrogation - had saved the lives of many civilians .
In a recent post , Dave Shea documented his love / hate relationship with the pixel grid :
Here 's the caveat though -- high resolution displays .
At 100dpi , ClearType wins out , but we 're not going to be stuck here much longer .
Give it a few years , let 's do this comparison again when 200dpi is standard .
I suspect the pixel grid wo n't matter nearly so much then .
I was somewhat curious about Dave 's claim that in " a few years " displays with 200 DPI will be standard fare .
So I did some research to document how far we 've come in display resolution over the last twenty years .
I used the Tag studios Monitor DPI calculator to arrive at the DPI numbers in the above table .
I could n't quite figure out what the actual displayable area of those early CRT monitors were , so I estimated about 5 % non-displayable area based on the diagonal measurement .
Regardless , it 's sobering to consider that the resolution of computer displays has increased by less than a factor of two over the last twenty years .
Sure , displays have gotten larger -- much larger -- but actual display resolution in terms of pixels per inch has only gone up by a factor of about 1.6 .
I can't think of any other piece of computer hardware that has improved so little since 1984 .
Some manufacturers do make high resolution displays , but they 're far from common , and very few get anywhere close to 200 DPI .
Here 's one model ViewSonic was demonstrating in 2002 :
This 22.2 - inch LCD panel being sold by Viewsonic uses the same panel developed and marketed by IBM last year ( T220 / T221 ) .
The difference is that IBM charged nearly $ 20,000 for its version ; Viewsonic plans on selling this one for around $ 8,000 .
That 's still pretty pricey -- what makes this panel so special ?
Try 9.2 million pixels , for one thing .
This 16x9 aspect panel has a native resolution of 3840x2400 pixels .
That translates to roughly 200 dots per inch .
In fact , you have to put your nose up to the screen to really notice the pixels .
Scanned topographical maps could be easily read , even down to the smallest typeface .
The monitor is targeted towards specialized image processing and CAD applications , and offers a 400:1 contrast ratio .
Driving 9.2 megapixels requires a graphics card with twin TMDS transmitters .
High pixel density monitors are far outside the mainstream .
The large versions are prohibitively expensive ; the small versions can't justify their price premium over the lower - resolution competition with larger physical size .
It 's telling that today , in 2007 , the Apple store does n't even sell a single standalone LCD offering over 100 DPI .
Nor can I find a single high resolution LCD of any type on newegg .
I have no doubt that if I had $ 10,000 burning a hole in my pocket , I could buy a 200 DPI display somewhere , but at consumer prices and through consumer outlets , high resolution displays simply do n't exist .
Most of the time , you see high resolution display options on laptops , where the notebook form factor physically precludes the display from getting any larger .
Manufacturers are forced to pack more and more pixels into a LCD panel of a fixed size :
When I purchased my notebook I had a choice of three monitor resolutions - the standard 1200 x 800 , 1680 x 1050 , and 1920 x 1200 .
The diagonal screen size is 15.4 " giving me the three corresponding pixel densities of 98 , 129 , and a whopping 147 ppi !
It 's hard to see this choice of display resolutions as anything other than a side - effect of laptop size restrictions .
If notebook vendors could somehow fit a folding 30 " LCD panel into a laptop , they absolutely would .
But even at 147 DPI , we 're only halfway to our goal .
To reach 200 DPI , that same 15.4 " laptop display would have to pack in 2560 x 1600 pixels .
Imagine a 30 " Apple Cinema HD display shrunken by half , and you 'll get the idea .
Short of some kind of miraculous technological breakthrough , I can't see computer displays reaching 200 DPI in " a few years " .
It 's unlikely we 'll even get there in ten years .
I 'd love to be proven wrong , but all the evidence of history -- not to mention typical consumer " bigger is better " behavior -- is overwhelming .
Christianity neither is , nor ever was a part of the common law .
In every country and in every age , the priest has been hostile to liberty .
He is always in alliance with the despot , abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own .
Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him [ Jesus ] by his biographers , I find many passages of fine imagination , correct morality , and of the most lovely benevolence ; and others again of so much ignorance , so much absurdity , so much untruth , charlatanism , and imposture , as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being .
And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus , by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerve in the brain of
History , I believe , furnishes no example of a priest - ridden people maintaining a free civil government .
I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ' make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , ' thus building a wall of separation between church and State .
Millions of innocent men , women and children , since the introduction of Christianity , have been burnt , tortured , fined and imprisoned ; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity .
The kidnapping of 23 South Korean aid workers last week on one of Afghanistan 's major highways is the latest evidence that the Taliban is extending its reach closer to the capital , Kabul .
The insurgency , which has blossomed in provinces bordering Pakistan – where the Taliban is widely believed to receive support – is spreading inland .
The bus load of South Korean aid workers was taken in Ghazni Province , which has no border with Pakistan yet has become the " kidnapping capital of the country , " according to Nic Lee , director of the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office ( ANSO ) in Kabul .
By his count , 60 people have been kidnapped in the southern province since April 1 .
Also last week , two German aid workers were kidnapped in Wardak Province , which borders Ghazni and is even further removed from Pakistan .
One has died , though the circumstances of his death remain disputed .
It suggests that the Taliban have consolidated enough power in border provinces to strike farther north , with an eye toward ringing Kabul from the south .
Few analysts say that Kabul itself is in danger of direct attack , and none say it is in any danger of falling .
But the situation echoes what happened to the Soviets two decades ago , when they maintained control of the cities and little else .
" Ghazni is important as the gateway to Kabul , and control of that road is very important , both symbolically and practically , " says Joanna Nathan , a Kabul - based security analyst for the International Crisis Group .
The Taliban had set a deadline of 7 p.m. local time ( 10:30 a.m. Eastern time )
Monday for authorities to meet their demands – the swap of Taliban prisoners for hostages .
On Monday , the deadline was extended by 24 hours .
The Afghan National Army says it has surrounded the area where the hostages are being held and is ready to act .
But South Korean negotiators , who have flown into the country , and Afghan elders are pressing hard for a peaceful settlement .
Their task has been made more difficult by the precedent set by the release of Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo , experts say .
He was kidnapped earlier this year , then set free in exchange for several high - ranking Taliban hostages .
In Wardak , one of the two Germans kidnapped last week has been confirmed dead .
The Taliban says it executed both men Saturday ; German officials say one remains alive and the other died from the stress of his detainment .
The German government has refused to bow to the captors ' demands : the removal of its 3,000 troops from Afghanistan .
South Korea , however , has banned any citizen from traveling to Afghanistan , with penalties that reach as high as one year in jail or a $ 3,200 fine .
It had already decided to withdraw its troops by year - end , even before the kidnapping .
South Korea , according to the Associated Press , has 210 troops ( including 150 in a medical unit ) that have been stationed at the US Bagram air base since 2002 .
Experts agree that the Korean aid workers ( 18 women and five men who are members of an evangelical Christian church doing medical and education work ) made several key errors in judgment .
It is widely known that the highway they were traveling is not secure for foreigners .
Yet despite their obviousness as foreigners , they chartered a private bus for the seven - hour trip to Kandahar , in the heart of the insurgency .
Despite the increased attention on kidnapping in Afghanistan , those who are caught remain those who make basic mistakes , says Mr. Lee of ANSO : " They make really poor security decisions . "
The Ghazni seizure is believed to be the largest single kidnapping in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
Yet it falls into the same pattern of other kidnappings here , which focus largely on targeting anyone seen to be working on behalf of the Western - backed government – be they aid workers , security personnel , or politicians .
There appears to be no obvious trend beyond that , Lee says :
No one group – foreign or local – seems to be targeted more than another .
The increasing instability on Kabul 's southern doorstep is a concern for President Hamid Karzai 's government and its allies .
The insurgency has always been centered in the south , where the Taliban was born from ultraconservative Pashtun tribes .
But it is creeping northward and farther from Pakistan .
" It is getting farther away from the border , " says Ms. Nathan .
" What was cross - border is becoming local . "
In recent months , suicide bombings in the far north – in Badakhshan and Kunduz – also suggest an attempt to widen the theater of combat , at least superficially .
The attempt is more deeply rooted in Ghazni , where the Taliban can attempt to marshal support from a disaffected local populace made up largely of conservative farmers .
Local Taliban have been reinforced by Taliban from the deeper south , says Lee .
This does not necessarily suggest growing sympathy for militant Islam .
Rather it indicates that some Afghans have lost their patience with the government and are turning against it .
The effect has been to constrict the flow of trade on roads south of Kabul , cutting it off from a major trading partner , Pakistan .
" I do n't think there is any plan to assault Kabul ; they just need to isolate it , " says Lee .
" Attacking a main supply route in a war is just what happens . "
Yesterday my Amazon Fire TV and game controller arrived via UPS , and after spending a few hours with it , I wanted to write up my first impressions of the device .
The Setup
First off the packaging is nicely minimal and unboxing went smoothly and was quite easy .
Then I realized they could pull that off because Amazon designed the device , the service it runs , the site I bought it from , and finally the packing and shipping of the item .
The people at UPS were the only only non-Amazon hands that ever touched my device ( and Amazon drones could have prevented it :) .
That kind of complete end - to - end control from soup - to - nuts on devices is something very few companies on earth can do , so it 's worth mentioning that Amazon capitalized on it by making some nice simple packaging that was easy to get into and get rid of .
Setup was a cinch , with just a plugged in cable from an existing HDMI port on my A/V unit .
The first thing it needed to do was connect to my WiFi network , and then we were off .
It was a bit of a downer to see even though the device was less than 48 hours past the announcement / launch , it required a lengthy software update as soon as I powered it up .
It took about 15 minutes on my very fast fiber line to download a patch and then install it .
Following the install , a nice little animated how - to video played to teach you how the controller worked and how Voice Search operated .
Voice search works a lot like Siri on an iPhone and tested well .
Convenience , at a price ?
The most surprising aspect to me during setup was I did n't have to tell the device who I was by logging into Amazon ( which is a pain since I use a password manager and would have to look up and enter a 20 - digit mis-mash of characters ) .
All my recent Prime Video plays were shown , and I checked the Settings screen to see that in fact the Fire TV knew I was Matt Haughey and I was already logged into my account and it knew I already had Amazon Prime .
I 'm flat - out impressed that the device shipped to me with me logged in already .
During setup , I was asked about " Parental Controls " on purchasing ( it would require a PIN ) and I skipped it , not thinking much about it , until later when testing out purchasing , I noticed buying a show / game is the most painless true one - click experience .
It just says something may cost " $ 4.99 " and you click it , and it is downloading .
No confirmation , no " are you sure ? " just one click and sold .
Now I understand why Parental Controls were presented earlier .
It 's easy to imagine my young daughter accidentally clicking any show she wants without realizing she is racking up a bill for me , as my AppleTV requires a confirmation even if you store your password permanently on it .
The Content
As you can guess , the content that is offered for free Amazon Prime streaming is a hodge - podge of various shows and movies that are mostly older and reminds me of the first time I logged into a new Netflix account and could n't find any recent movies I wanted to see .
Despite trying out nearly every set - top and streaming device , I 've never owned a recent Roku device so this is the first easy way I have on my TV to watch Amazon Video , which is why I purchased this device .
I usually only search for things on Amazon Prime Video when I 'm sure they can't be streamed on Netflix or Hulu Plus .
The biggest failing is that end users ( that 's us ! ) do n't get a truly Universal Search .
If you search for " Bob 's Burgers " ( arguably the best network animated comedy show today ) on Amazon 's Fire TV , you get results that you can buy any single episode from their 4 season run for $ 1.99 each or a full season for $ 29.99 .
I 'm a member of Hulu Plus and Netflix as well , and installed the apps on the Fire TV , but there 's no mention of them in the search results or even after clicking the " more ways to watch " button .
On Netflix , you can stream the first couple seasons of Bob 's Burgers for free .
On Hulu , you can watch the latest episodes from the current fourth season for free as well .
Now , I know Amazon is in the business of making money and would of course want you to buy the episodes from them , but Amazon 's CEO Jeff Bezos got famous for putting a customer 's needs first ( The Bezos Doctrine ) before profits .
Of course , Apple does n't offer this kind of search on AppleTV either , but if anyone would have been crazy enough to give free streaming options before paid downloads , I would have hoped that Amazon Fire TV could be the first , but sadly it 's not .
The Gaming
I was curious enough to see what Amazon Fire TV 's gaming was going to be like that I sprang for the extra $ 40 controller to find out .
Overall after having played just a handful of games I 'd say it 's a pretty nice port of an Android game store to a TV .
It 's fast and fun and reminds me of the Ouya gaming device , but much more slick and faster to buy , download , and play .
You can use the default remote on simple games and it worked fine for turn - based board games that only require a button and direction input .
I played a few rounds of the racing game Asphalt 8 and was impressed with the speed , graphics , and playback .
There was no stuttering and the graphics look and feel as good as maybe a Playstation 2 game from several years ago .
The controller is pretty close to a Xbox360 controller , with plenty of buttons ( almost too many ) and there 's no lag on the controller or the screen .
Does it Blend ?
Overall , it 's a pretty slick , simple device that I 'll use to stream stuff when I can't find it anywhere but Amazon Prime streaming video , but I wish it were a little cheaper and I 'm frankly a bit surprised it was n't priced way below AppleTV or similar Roku devices .
I 'll probably try out the games a bit more , but I can't see it becoming a huge platform I 'd play for hours at a time .
Yet another “ Only in Japan ” story , but we just had to delve deeper into this one !
According to many of the foreign press outlets this week , hundreds , possibly thousands of Japanese women have been conned into buying baby lambs , which they thought were in fact poodles .
Coming from a background where an annual highlight is Christmas lamb , this story tested my limits .
But this is Tokyo , and anything is possible .
This astonishing discovery was made on prime time TV , where actress Maiko Kawakami ( 川上麻衣子 ) was proudly showing off pictures of her new pet poodle .
When she wondered out loud why her short - cut , cute new puppy would neither bark , nor eat dog food , members of the panel amusingly pointed out that it was perhaps not a puppy , but in fact a common sheep !
According to the reports , the police subsequently fielded thousands of calls from distressed women , who suddenly realized that their dogs “ bark ” only made it to “ ba … ”
Once my ribcage recovered from the hilarity and bizarreness of this supposed situation , I got on to scouring the Japanese news sites to verify this , because could it really be true ?
I could not find a single reference in the Japanese news .
And no , it was not April 1st , but fool on anyone who throws a poodle in the pot for Christmas .
The only evidence exists at the source .
Maiko Kawakami writes a daily diary on her website , the entry is here , which contains one line , nonchalantly saying “ I have had emails from people who have also heard of toy poodles which have actually turned out to be lambs .
But they have not heard what happened to them since , which is worrying . ”
A single comment on her blog states that this incident was shown on CNN News , but they stressed that this was only “ something that Kawakami had heard about ” .
A search for images of “ toy poodle ” brought up pictures of many breeds of dog , a couple of rabbits , kittens , and even a budgy , but alas , no sheep .
Despite this though , the Japanese authorities have reported to the foreign press that they have shut down at least one company , which has imported from Australia and sold over 2,000 lambs as poodles , for over 150,000 yen each .
This is about half the cost of a purebred non -sheep poodle in Japan .
Maiko Kawakami , born in Sweden , is now 41 .
Her first hit drama series in 1979 was called Kizuna , and then the high school drama ” 3 - nen B - kumi - Kinpachi Sensei ” , which is still shown on reruns 28 years later .
Then , 4 years later , at 17 , she was launched further into stardom appearing in a provocative “ photographic essay ” called “ Atsui Kuni , Yume no Kuni , Umareta Kuni ” ( A hot country , a country of dreams , the country I was born ” ) , shot by the well - known photographer Kishin Shinoyama .
These days , Kawakami is a famous actress , appearing often on TV talk shows , as well as a number of Japanese movies and drama series per year , including the current Usuwashiki - Oni drama series .
[ youtube ] Se8OP5RKPA8 [ / youtube ]
Despite the popularity of Usuwashiki - Oni , we were not so surprised that the Japanese media decided that one of the main stars having the wool pulled over their eyes in such a fashion was not worth mentioning .
No doubt Kawakami will be sheepish in returning to prime time TV …
We would love to hear from anyone who actually saw this on TV .
Please leave your comments below !
By the way , the “ Urban Legends ” site has classed this story as FALSE , but lets not let that get in the way of a good yarn … !
Coroutines in C
by Simon Tatham Introduction
Structuring a large program is always a difficult job .
One of the particular problems that often comes up is this : if you have a piece of code producing data , and another piece of code consuming it , which should be the caller and which should be the callee ?
Here is a very simple piece of run-length decompression code , and an equally simple piece of parser code :
/* Decompression code */ while ( 1 ) { c = getchar ( ) ; if ( c == EOF ) break ; if ( c == 0xFF ) { len = getchar ( ) ; c = getchar ( ) ; while ( len - -) emit( c ) ; } else emit( c ) ; } emit( EOF ) ; /* Parser code */ while ( 1 ) { c = getchar ( ) ; if ( c == EOF ) break ; if ( isalpha ( c ) ) { do { add_to_token ( c ) ; c = getchar ( ) ; } while ( isalpha ( c ) ) ; got_token ( WORD ) ; } add_to_token( c ) ; got_token ( PUNCT ) ; }
Each of these code fragments is very simple , and easy to read and understand .
One produces a character at a time by calling emit ( ) ; the other consumes a character at a time by calling getchar ( ) .
If only the calls to emit ( ) and the calls to getchar ( ) could be made to feed data to each other , it would be simple to connect the two fragments together so that the output from the decompressor went straight to the parser .
In many modern operating systems , you could do this using pipes between two processes or two threads .
emit( ) in the decompressor writes to a pipe , and getchar ( ) in the parser reads from the other end of the same pipe .
Simple and robust , but also heavyweight and not portable .
Typically you do n't want to have to divide your program into threads for a task this simple .
In this article I offer a creative solution to this sort of structure problem .
Rewriting
The conventional answer is to rewrite one of the ends of the communication channel so that it's a function that can be called .
Here 's an example of what that might mean for each of the example fragments .
int decompressor ( void ) { static int repchar ; static int replen ; if ( replen > 0 ) { replen --; return repchar ; } c = getchar ( ) ; if ( c == EOF ) return EOF ; if ( c == 0xFF ) { replen = getchar ( ) ; repchar = getchar ( ) ; replen --; return repchar ; } else return c ; } void parser ( int c ) { static enum { START , IN_WORD } state ; switch ( state ) { case IN_WORD : if ( isalpha ( c ) ) { add_to_token ( c ) ; return ; } got_token ( WORD ) ; state = START ; /* fall through */ case START : add_to_token( c ) ; if ( isalpha ( c ) ) state = IN_WORD ; else got_token ( PUNCT ) ; break ; } }
Of course you do n't have to rewrite both of them ; just one will do .
If you rewrite the decompressor in the form shown , so that it returns one character every time it 's called , then the original parser code can replace calls to getchar ( ) with calls to decompressor ( ) , and the program will be happy .
Conversely , if you rewrite the parser in the form shown , so that it is called once for every input character , then the original decompression code can call parser ( ) instead of emit ( ) with no problems .
You would only want to rewrite both functions as callees if you were a glutton for punishment .
And that 's the point , really .
Both these rewritten functions are thoroughly ugly compared to their originals .
Both of the processes taking place here are easier to read when written as a caller , not as a callee .
Try to deduce the grammar recognised by the parser , or the compressed data format understood by the decompressor , just by reading the code , and you will find that both the originals are clear and both the rewritten forms are less clear .
It would be much nicer if we did n't have to turn either piece of code inside out .
Knuth 's coroutines
In The Art of Computer Programming , Donald Knuth presents a solution to this sort of problem .
His answer is to throw away the stack concept completely .
Stop thinking of one process as the caller and the other as the callee , and start thinking of them as cooperating equals .
In practical terms : replace the traditional " call " primitive with a slightly different one .
The new " call " will save the return value somewhere other than on the stack , and will then jump to a location specified in another saved return value .
So each time the decompressor emits another character , it saves its program counter and jumps to the last known location within the parser - and each time the parser needs another character , it saves its own program counter and jumps to the location saved by the decompressor .
Control shuttles back and forth between the two routines exactly as often as necessary .
This is very nice in theory , but in practice you can only do it in assembly language , because no commonly used high level language supports the coroutine call primitive .
Languages like C depend utterly on their stack - based structure , so whenever control passes from any function to any other , one must be the caller and the other must be the callee .
So if you want to write portable code , this technique is at least as impractical as the Unix pipe solution .
Stack - based coroutines
So what we would really like is the ability to mimic Knuth 's coroutine call primitive in C .
We must accept that in reality , at the C level , one function will be caller and the other will be callee .
In the caller , we have no problem ; we code the original algorithm , pretty much exactly as written , and whenever it has ( or needs ) a character it calls the other function .
The callee has all the problems .
For our callee , we want a function which has a " return and continue " operation : return from the function , and next time it is called , resume control from just after the return statement .
For example , we would like to be able to write a function that says
int function ( void ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) return i ; /* wo n't work , but would n't it be nice */ }
and have ten successive calls to the function return the numbers 0 through 9 .
How can we implement this ?
Well , we can transfer control to an arbitrary point in the function using a goto statement .
So if we use a state variable , we could do this :
int function ( void ) { static int i , state = 0 ; switch ( state ) { case 0 : goto LABEL0 ; case 1 : goto LABEL1 ; } LABEL0 : /* start of function */ for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) { state = 1 ; /* so we will come back to LABEL1 */ return i ; LABEL1 : ; /* resume control straight after the return */ } }
This method works .
We have a set of labels at the points where we might need to resume control : one at the start , and one just after each return statement .
We have a state variable , preserved between calls to the function , which tells us which label we need to resume control at next .
Before any return , we update the state variable to point at the right label ; after any call , we do a switch on the value of the variable to find out where to jump to .
It 's still ugly , though .
The worst part of it is that the set of labels must be maintained manually , and must be consistent between the function body and the initial switch statement .
Every time we add a new return statement , we must invent a new label name and add it to the list in the switch ; every time we remove a return statement , we must remove its corresponding label .
We 've just increased our maintenance workload by a factor of two .
Duff 's device
The famous " Duff 's device " in C makes use of the fact that a case statement is still legal within a sub - block of its matching switch statement .
Tom Duff used this for an optimised output loop :
switch ( count % 8 ) { case 0 : do { * to = * from ++ ; case 7 : * to = * from ++ ; case 6 : * to = * from ++ ; case 5 : * to = * from ++ ; case 4 : * to = * from ++ ; case 3 : * to = * from ++ ; case 2 : * to = * from ++ ; case 1 : * to = * from ++ ; } while ( ( count -= 8 ) > 0 ) ; }
We can put it to a slightly different use in the coroutine trick .
Instead of using a switch statement to decide which goto statement to execute , we can use the switch statement to perform the jump itself :
int function ( void ) { static int i , state = 0 ; switch ( state ) { case 0 : /* start of function */ for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) { state = 1 ; /* so we will come back to " case 1 " */ return i ; case 1 : ; /* resume control straight after the return */ } } }
Now this is looking promising .
All we have to do now is construct a few well chosen macros , and we can hide the gory details in something plausible - looking :
# define crBegin static int state=0 ; switch ( state ) { case 0 : # define crReturn ( i , x ) do { state=i ; return x ; case i : ; } while ( 0 ) # define crFinish } int function ( void ) { static int i ; crBegin ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) crReturn ( 1 , i ) ; crFinish ; }
( note the use of do ... while ( 0 ) to ensure that crReturn does not need braces around it when it comes directly between if and else )
This is almost exactly what we wanted .
We can use crReturn to return from the function in such a way that control at the next call resumes just after the return .
Of course we must obey some ground rules ( surround the function body with crBegin and crFinish ; declare all local variables static if they need to be preserved across a crReturn ; never put a crReturn within an explicit switch statement ) ; but those do not limit us very much .
The only snag remaining is the first parameter to crReturn .
Just as when we invented a new label in the previous section we had to avoid it colliding with existing label names , now we must ensure all our state parameters to crReturn are different .
The consequences will be fairly benign - the compiler will catch it and not let it do horrible things at run time - but we still need to avoid doing it .
Even this can be solved .
ANSI C provides the special macro name __LINE__ , which expands to the current source line number .
So we can rewrite crReturn as
# define crReturn(x ) do { state=__LINE__ ; return x ; \ case __LINE__ : ; } while ( 0 )
and then we no longer have to worry about those state parameters at all , provided we obey a fourth ground rule ( never put two crReturn statements on the same line ) .
Evaluation
So now we have this monstrosity , let 's rewrite our original code fragments using it .
int decompressor ( void ) { static int c , len ; crBegin ; while ( 1 ) { c = getchar ( ) ; if ( c == EOF ) break ; if ( c == 0xFF ) { len = getchar ( ) ; c = getchar ( ) ; while ( len - -) crReturn ( c ) ; } else crReturn ( c ) ; } crReturn ( EOF ) ; crFinish ; } void parser ( int c ) { crBegin ; while ( 1 ) { /* first char already in c */ if ( c == EOF ) break ; if ( isalpha ( c ) ) { do { add_to_token ( c ) ; crReturn ( ) ; } while ( isalpha ( c ) ) ; got_token ( WORD ) ; } add_to_token ( c ) ; got_token ( PUNCT ) ; crReturn ( ) ; } crFinish ; }
We have rewritten both decompressor and parser as callees , with no need at all for the massive restructuring we had to do last time we did this .
The structure of each function exactly mirrors the structure of its original form .
A reader can deduce the grammar recognised by the parser , or the compressed data format used by the decompressor , far more easily than by reading the obscure state - machine code .
The control flow is intuitive once you have wrapped your mind around the new format : when the decompressor has a character , it passes it back to the caller with crReturn and waits to be called again when another character is required .
When the parser needs another character , it returns using crReturn , and waits to be called again with the new character in the parameter c .
There has been one small structural alteration to the code : parser ( ) now has its getchar ( ) ( well , the corresponding crReturn ) at the end of the loop instead of the start , because the first character is already in c when the function is entered .
We could accept this small change in structure , or if we really felt strongly about it we could specify that parser ( ) required an " initialisation " call before you could start feeding it characters .
As before , of course , we do n't have to rewrite both routines using the coroutine macros .
One will suffice ; the other can be its caller .
We have achieved what we set out to achieve : a portable ANSI C means of passing data between a producer and a consumer without the need to rewrite one as an explicit state machine .
We have done this by combining the C preprocessor with a little - used feature of the switch statement to create an implicit state machine .
Coding Standards
Of course , this trick violates every coding standard in the book .
Try doing this in your company 's code and you will probably be subject to a stern telling off if not disciplinary action !
You have embedded unmatched braces in macros , used case within sub - blocks , and as for the crReturn macro with its terrifyingly disruptive contents . . .
It 's a wonder you have n't been fired on the spot for such irresponsible coding practice .
You should be ashamed of yourself .
I would claim that the coding standards are at fault here .
The examples I 've shown in this article are not very long , not very complicated , and still just about comprehensible when rewritten as state machines .
But as the functions get longer , the degree of rewriting required becomes greater and the loss of clarity becomes much , much worse .
Consider .
A function built of small blocks of the form
case STATE1 : /* perform some activity */ if ( condition ) state = STATE2 ; else state = STATE3 ;
is not very different , to a reader , from a function built of small blocks of the form
LABEL1 : /* perform some activity */ if ( condition ) goto LABEL2 ; else goto LABEL3 ;
One is caller and the other is callee , true , but the visual structure of the functions are the same , and the insights they provide into their underlying algorithms are exactly as small as each other .
The same people who would fire you for using my coroutine macros would fire you just as loudly for building a function out of small blocks connected by goto statements !
And this time they would be right , because laying out a function like that obscures the structure of the algorithm horribly .
Coding standards aim for clarity .
By hiding vital things like switch , return and case statements inside " obfuscating " macros , the coding standards would claim you have obscured the syntactic structure of the program , and violated the requirement for clarity .
But you have done so in the cause of revealing the algorithmic structure of the program , which is far more likely to be what the reader wants to know !
Any coding standard which insists on syntactic clarity at the expense of algorithmic clarity should be rewritten .
If your employer fires you for using this trick , tell them that repeatedly as the security staff drag you out of the building .
Refinements and Code
In a serious application , this toy coroutine implementation is unlikely to be useful , because it relies on static variables and so it fails to be re-entrant or multi-threadable .
Ideally , in a real application , you would want to be able to call the same function in several different contexts , and at each call in a given context , have control resume just after the last return in the same context .
This is easily enough done .
We arrange an extra function parameter , which is a pointer to a context structure ; we declare all our local state , and our coroutine state variable , as elements of that structure .
It 's a little bit ugly , because suddenly you have to use ctx -> i as a loop counter where you would previously just have used i ; virtually all your serious variables become elements of the coroutine context structure .
But it removes the problems with re-entrancy , and still has n't impacted the structure of the routine .
( Of course , if C only had Pascal 's with statement , we could arrange for the macros to make this layer of indirection truly transparent as well .
A pity .
Still , at least C++ users can manage this by having their coroutine be a class member , and keeping all its local variables in the class so that the scoping is implicit . )
Included here is a C header file that implements this coroutine trick as a set of pre-defined macros .
There are two sets of macros defined in the file , prefixed scr and ccr .
The scr macros are the simple form of the technique , for when you can get away with using static variables ; the ccr macros provide the advanced re-entrant form .
Full documentation is given in a comment in the header file itself .
Note that Visual C++ version 6 does n't like this coroutine trick , because its default debug state ( Program Database for Edit and Continue ) does something strange to the __LINE__ macro .
To compile a coroutine - using program with VC ++ 6 , you must turn off Edit and Continue .
( In the project settings , go to the " C/ C + + " tab , category " General " , setting " Debug info " .
Select any option other than " Program Database for Edit and Continue " . )
( The header file is MIT - licensed , so you can use it in anything you like without restriction .
If you do find something the MIT licence does n't permit you to do , mail me , and I 'll probably give you explicit permission to do it anyway . )

SHIBUSHI , Japan —
The suspects in a vote - buying case in this small town in western Japan were subjected to repeated interrogations and , in several instances , months of pretrial detention .
The police ordered one woman to shout her confession out a window and forced one man to stomp on the names of his loved ones .
In all , 13 men and women , ranging in age from their early 50s to mid-70s , were arrested and indicted .
Six buckled and confessed to an elaborate scheme of buying votes with liquor , cash and catered parties .
One man died during the trial — from the stress , the others said — and another tried to kill himself .
But all were acquitted this year in a local district court , which found that their confessions had been entirely fabricated .
The presiding judge said the defendants had “ made confessions in despair while going through marathon questioning . ”
The Japanese authorities have long relied on confessions to take suspects to court , instead of building cases based on solid evidence .
Human rights groups have criticized the practice for leading to abuses of due process and convictions of innocent people .
From Associated Press :
Sampson then drew up an elaborate five - step plan to replace the targeted prosecutors with as little political fallout as possible , which he sent in a Nov. 15 , 2006 , e-mail to Miers , deputy White House counsel William K. Kelley and McNulty .
" We 'll stand by for a green light from you , " Sampson wrote to Miers and Kelley .
Upon getting their approval , Sampson wrote , he asked that they " circulate it to Karl 's shop " — which officials confirmed was a reference to Karl Rove , Bush 's top political adviser and deputy chief of staff .
White House approval came a month later .
" We 're a go for the US Atty plan , " Kelley wrote in a Dec. 4 , 2006 , e-mail to Sampson and Miers .
" WH leg , political , communications have signed off and acknowledged that we have to be committed to following through once the pressure comes . "
Again , this is really , really simple .
The whole White House gave the go - ahead on a plan to use provisions of the anti-terrorism Patriot Act to circumvent the authority of Congress in confirming replacements for U.S. Attorneys the White House was forcing out .
It was purely , rawly political -- they did it because they could , and they did it because it meant that their new appointees -- some of them deeply controversial -- would n't have to go through the confirmation process .
Did n't have a damn thing to do with terrorism .
First they planned it .
Then they did it .
Oh , and here 's Gonzales lying through his teeth about it in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee :
[ O ] n Jan . 18 , Gonzales stated , “ I think I would never , ever make a change in a United States attorney for political reasons or if it would in any way jeopardize an ongoing serious investigation .
I just would not do it . ”
Well , considering that he did do it , that 's now been proven false .
Rather obscenely so , in fact .
So what happens now ?
State Dept. erases all references to top official who quit over DC Madam list Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 9 , 2007 Print This Email
This The State Department and the US Agency for International Development have instructed employees to remove all references in publications and other materials to a top official who resigned after his name turned up as a former client of " DC Madam " Deborah Jean Palfrey .
The news appears in Wednesday morning 's edition of the " In The Loop " column at the Washington Post .
Randall Tobias , the USAID Administrator and a Deputy Secretary of State , quit suddenly on April 27 after being contacted by ABC News and admitting that he had " gals come over to the condo to give me a massage , " which he compared to ordering a pizza .
Subsequently , Al Kamen writes , USAID ordered all references to Tobias purged .
" On April 30 , a couple days after Tobias 's stunning resignation , we got this e-mail from Steve Tupper , a senior official in AID 's bureau of legislative and public affairs , " Kamen notes .
" As you go about your daily activities on behalf of your Bureau or Office , please be alert to the need to remove all picture and statements from Ambassador Tobias in light of his resignation dated as of April 27 , 2007 , " Tupper orders in the note .
The instructions include deleting references to Tobias in " Websites , reception room walls , printed publications , brochures , PowerPoints , newsletters , etc . "
The order may create some headaches for USAID staff .
" All projects that have been reviewed previously and approved by LPA in the last several months but that are still in the production process must be immediately stopped and re-submitted if they contain articles , statements , or pictures of Tobias , " Tupper added .

A House subcommittee has approved legislation banning all forms of online gambling in the United States .
To strike at offshore gambling sites , the panel authorized law enforcement officials to stop credit card and other forms of electronic payments to those sites .
Violators would be subject to up to five years in prison .
" Virtual betting parlors have attempted to avoid the application of United States law by locating themselves offshore and out of our jurisdictional reach , " bill sponsor Bob Goodlatte ( R - Va. ) said in a statement .
" These offshore , fly - by - night Internet gambling operators are unlicensed , untaxed and unregulated and are sucking billions of dollars out of the United States . "
The legislation now moves to the House Judiciary Committee .
Under current federal law , the Wire Act , passed by Congress in the early 1960s , prohibits making sports gambling wagers over the telephone .
It is not legally clear if the Wire Act actually applies to the Internet , a situation that Goodlatte 's bill hopes to correct .
The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act , H.R. 4777 , amends the Wire Act to make it clear that the prohibitions include Internet gambling and the use of other new technologies .
" Gambling on the Internet has become an extremely lucrative business , " said Goodlatte .
" Numerous studies have charted the explosive growth of this industry , both by the increases in gambling websites available , and via industry revenues . "
Internet gambling is now estimated to be a $ 12 billion industry , with approximately $ 6 billion coming from bettors based in the U.S .
Goodlatte has twice before introduced similar legislation but was unable to garner enough support to pass the bill .
In April , banking representatives testified against the legislation .
" Our concern is that the added burden of monitoring all payment transactions for the taint of Internet gambling will drain finite resources currently engaged in complying with anti-terrorism , anti-money laundering regulations and the daily operation of our bank , " Samuel Vallandingham , representing the Independent Bankers of America , said .
The legislation allows states to continue to regulate gambling within their borders .
" Offshore online gambling Websites are cash cows and the greed that propels these companies leads them to solicit bettors in the U.S. , despite the fact that the Department of Justice already believes this activity is illegal , " said Goodlatte .

NRCAT Affirms the Sacred Value of Black Lives On June 5 , 2020 , the NRCAT staff issued this statement :
The staff of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture affirms the sacred value of Black lives and condemns the anti-Black violence we have collectively mourned in recent days with the murders of Mr. George Floyd and Ms. Breonna Taylor by the police .
Our experience working to end torture in U.S. policy , practice and culture teaches us that such acts of state violence are not isolated incidents but rather expose a culture of violence against people of color .
This same state violence also pervades U.S. prisons , jails , and detention centers , where on any given day tens of thousands of people , disproportionately adults and youth of color , are held in conditions of solitary confinement , a practice considered a form of torture by the United Nations , medical professionals and other developed countries . >>
Read the full statement Contact your Governor Join NRCAT in calling on your Governor to take steps to ensure that incarcerated people and corrections staff are protected during the COVID - 19 pandemic .
Our sisters and brothers behind bars who are incarcerated and those who work in facilities that house them , deserve protection , dignity and care . >>
Write to Your Governor Today NRCAT calls on Governors :
To take concrete steps to release the highest number of people possible from all jails and state prisons , beginning with the most vulnerable .
To ensure that all people who live and work in correctional facilities have access to adequate testing and personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of COVID in these spaces .
This includes increased access to hygiene products .
To ensure correctional leaders do not respond punitively , potentially discouraging the sick from reporting their symptoms .
This includes ensuring correctional leaders never use solitary confinement as a containment strategy for COVID - 19 .
The Report The Hollywood film The Report , starring Adam Driver and Annette Bening , tells the story of U.S. Senate staffer Dan Jones leading an investigation into the CIA 's torture program .
As Jones uncovers the truth – that torture was not only brutal and immoral , but also ineffective – the CIA works to prevent his findings from ever being made public .

Nadine Laporte , WHRC
THE world 's forests are disappearing and Africa 's are vanishing faster than those of any other continent .
A report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation published in March reckoned that between 2000 and 2005 the continent with about 16 % of the world 's forests accounted for 55 % of the total losses .
But reliable numbers are hard to come by .
That is why a set of data pieced together by Nadine Laporte and her colleagues , of Woods Hole Research Centre , in Falmouth , Massachusetts , is so applauded by conservationists and local governments alike .
Dr Laporte and her colleagues have put together information from more than 300 satellite images .
The conclusions they draw were published in Science on Friday June 8th .
These data track the progression of logging roads in a region covering 4 m square kilometres of central Africa between 1976 and 2003 .
No one has attempted anything so ambitious before in Africa .
And those who have applied similar techniques to Latin America 's forests have tended to use complicated algorithms to measure vegetation changes .
These run in sophisticated computers .
Dr Laporte wanted something simple , robust and cheap that anyone could use .
On mapping the results an awkward patchwork of polygons emerges .
The logging roads branch within the forest , in places just 1 km apart .
They are most dense in the Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea , where selective loggers have moved through most of the countries ' forest at least once , creaming off the most valuable species .
It is Congo - Brazzaville , though , that has suffered the most rapid road construction of late .
The rate of road - building has roughly quadrupled over 30 years .
Most forestry experts , however , are watching the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Although still troubled by sporadic outburst of violence after a long civil war the country is now as peaceful as it has been for some time .
The civil war was widely portrayed as having been financed by rampant timber harvest .
In fact annual timber production fell to about a sixth of its level in 1960 .
Two - thirds of the forest that still remains in the region is in Congo .
Now that the protective cover of war has lifted it is here that loggers are likely to seek new bounty and other foes of the forest will move in .
Dr Laporte 's methods can help to track their progress
In central Africa selective logging — the removal of a few choice specimens — rather than complete deforestation is the usual method of earning cash from the trees .
But Dr Laporte fears that Congo has a high enough population density to drive deforestation in the name of bagging more land for agriculture .
As logging roads grant better access to the forest she expects people to move in , and eventually to do so in droves .
At least the opportunity to exploit Congo 's forests is handed out fairly , on paper anyway .
In 2002 , the World Bank pushed through reforms that threw out speculative concessions .
These were generally gifted to a privileged and corrupt few that had enough influence or cash to get them .
These days companies are supposed to implement management plans and half of tax revenues are supposed to find their way to local communities .
In reality , few can be bothered with the former , nor do companies pay the proper rent on the land .
And almost all of what is paid remains in the central government 's coffers .
Still , the policies in place today are a great improvement on the World Bank 's ideas of old .
During structural adjustments of the early 1990s , it halved the value of the CFA franc , the currency used in much of the region .
That halved the costs for foreign logging companies operating in central Africa , promoting wanton degradation by operators who promptly left at the first sign of regulation .
Dr Laporte has yet to look for this pattern in the new data , but she has found it in less comprehensive pools of numbers .
The study usefully illuminates the effects of both illegal and legal logging over time .
Depressing reports of how quickly the world 's forests are disappearing are commonplace .
Ones that may give a clue to better policy are rarer , and welcome .

The unfortunate death of a respected Congresswoman from California has opened up a seat in the House of Representatives in a strongly Democratic District which will be filled by special election on June 26th .
Impeach for Peace does not endorse candidates , but we do strongly support H Res. 333 , as introduced by Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and only one candidate running for this vacant seat in Long Beach publicly agrees with us – Peter Mathews .
On his campaign website , Mathews for Congress , it states : “ Mathews will investigate and move on Impeachment and supports HR 333 . ” ( Actually H Res. 333 )
Here is a local article about the race :

Lesser Knowns Trying To Break Out Of Pack
By Kurt Helin – Editor
The conventional wisdom is that the Democratic candidate who gets the most votes in the June 26 special election will eventually represent the 37th District in the House of Representatives .
That ’s because this is a heavily Democrat district in terms of registered voters .
It also explains why 11 Democrats jumped into the race for the seat .
The 37th District covers about 80 % of Long Beach ( although not the eastern part of the city such as Belmont Shore ) .
The seat became open when Congresswoman Juanita Millender - McDonald died in April .

Fines And Felony Charges For Letting Your Car Run On Restaurant Vegetable Oil ?

There have been numerous stories recently about people converting their cars to run on leftover vegetable oil from restaurant kitchens .
Many restaurants need to get rid of that oil anyway , and are more than happy to give it away for nothing or next to nothing ( though , obviously that would change as demand grows ) .
While this seems like a great example of one way that people can help take a step away from the oil addiction the government is apparently afraid of , it seems that ( oops ) the government is n't going to make it very easy for people .
Yehuda Berlinger points us to the bureaucratic insanity faced by a retired couple in Illinois who simply want to drive their vegetable oil - fueled car , but now face huge fines and possible felony charges for doing so .
The details sound like they 're right out of a bad movie .
They 've owned the car for while and they fuel it up using leftover restaurant cooking oil .
However , earlier this year , two officials knocked on their door from the Illinois Department of Revenue , telling the couple that they were violating the law by not paying an additional motor fuel tax .
The couple did the calculations on how much tax they needed to pay , and while annoying , it was n't outrageous .
However , in order to pay , they first needed to get approved for a license as a " special fuel supplier " or " receiver . "
Except ... the process to become approved for such a license requires a $ 2,500 bond , and the forms are designed for businesses not individuals .
The couple then received a letter saying they needed to stop being a special fuel supplier or receiver until they were licensed to be such -- but the details of how you qualify to be either a special fuel receive or supplier showed that they qualified as neither .
Yet , the state still insisted that they had to get such a license , because otherwise they had no way to collect the tax .
They then noted that operating as a special fuel supplier or receiver without the necessary license was a felony .
The government says that it 's trying to make the process easier , but the whole concept seems ridiculous .
As the guy notes , based on these arguments , should n't Toyota Prius drivers also have to pay a special motor fuel tax for the times when it 's driving using electricity rather than fuel ?
After all , what 's the real difference between powering the car with electricity generated by the vehicle compared to powering it with leftover vegetable oil ?
As for the government making the process easier , it 's not like this is an entirely new concept .
Over in Wales there was nearly an identical situation about five years ago that actually resulted in police impounding the vegetable oil - powered cars .
It 's difficult to see how you move people away from an addiction to oil when you make it impossible to actually stop using oil cost effectively .

Ex -Gonzales no. 2 describes boss 's attempted power grab Michael Roston
Published : Thursday June 7 , 2007 Print This Email This
The former Deputy Attorney General to John Ashcroft and later Alberto Gonzales described an attempt by the current , embattled Attorney General to centralize power within his office as he began his term at the Justice Department .
James Comey , who served as Deputy Attorney General from 2003 through 2005 , described Gonzales ' plan to reduce the independence of Comey 's office when he became the Attorney General at the beginning of President George W. Bush 's second term in office .
The plan was presented to him by Kyle Sampson , the ex-Chief of Staff to Gonzales .
" Mr. Sampson explained to me a vision for the operation of the Attorney Generals office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General that would involve operating those respective staffs as essentially one staff , " Comey wrote in responses to questions for the record submitted by members of the House Judiciary Committee .
The responses were sent to RAW STORY .
Comey went on to explain how Gonzales 's plan to merge his office with Comey 's would have eliminated a layer of oversight on the Attorney General 's decision - making .
" I think such an arrangement risks elimination of the separate vetting and advice function of the DAG and his or her staff .
There is great value in having that office  called ODAG -- available to make decisions that need not reach the Attorney General or to review and advise on matters headed to the Attorney General for decision , " the former top government attorney wrote .
" The risk inherent in combining the staffs is that the separate review and advice function is lost , which would not be in the interest of the Attorney General or the Department . "
The full answers to questions for the record can be downloaded at this link .
Comey 's statement came to light after apparently contradictory remarks offered by Attorney General Gonzales about the role of Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty in the firing of the 8 US Attorneys .
" Looking back , things that I would have done differently ?
I think I would have had the deputy attorney general more involved , directly involved , " Gonzales said in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April .
But in a May 15 press conference , Gonzales appeared to reverse himself and pin most of the responsibility for the firing of the US Attorneys on McNulty .
" The one person that I would care about would be the views of the deputy attorney general , because the deputy attorney general is the direct supervisor of the United States attorneys .
And in this particular case , Mr. McNulty was a former colleague of all of these United States attorneys , and so he would probably know better than anyone else about the performance and the qualifications of these -- of our United States attorney community , " Gonzales said .
He went on , " My understanding was was that Mr. Sampson 's recommendations reflected a consensus view of the senior leadership of the department , in particular the deputy attorney general . "
Comey was answering questions that were prompted by an account in a May 20 edition of US News that described the effort to merge his office with Gonzales's .
" Soon after Gonzales became attorney general , his then chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , told Comey that Gonzales 's ' vision ' was to merge the deputy 's office with Gonzales 's own office , " wrote Chitra Ragavan .
Raghavan quoted Comey as saying that he opposed the move .
" You may want to try that with the next deputy attorney general .
But it 's not going to work with me , " he reportedly told Gonzales 's ex-Chief of Staff Sampson .
Comey also addressed questions about the hospital room visit of Attorney General Ashcroft in 2004 by then - White House Counsel Gonzales to sign off on the legality of a domestic spying program operated by the National Security Agency .
He told House investigators that while John Ashcroft 's wife was in the room for the discussion , and did not have a security clearance , he did n't know if any classified information had been discussed .
" I did not discuss classified information , " he said .
" I do not recall whether Mr. Gonzales mentioned any aspects of the matter that would be considered classified , including the name of the program  which was itself classified , as I recall  when addressing Mr. Ashcroft . "
Comey also noted that Ashcroft 's hospital room had not been cleared as a secure location where classified subjects could be discussed .
What 's it all about ?
On March 9 2006 the Guardian 's Technology supplement carried an article called " Give us back our crown jewels " .
The argument is simple : government - funded and approved agencies such as the Ordnance Survey and UK Hydrographic Office and Highways Agency are government - owned agencies ; they collect data on our behalf .
So why can't we get at that data as easily as we can Google Maps or the Xtides program ?
Even though OS and the UK Hydrographic Office are designated as trading funds ( which means that they operate as self - contained commercial entities receiving no direct tax funding ) , substantial parts of their income - up to 50 % in the case of OS - comes from the public sector ; meaning , in effect , they are part - paid by taxes .
Yet they charge for that data , with onerous copyright restrictions that prevent the re-use of the data .
That restricts innovation and artificially restricts the number and variety of organisations that can offer services based on that most useful data - which our taxes have helped to collect .
Making that data available for use for free - rather as commercial companies such as Amazon and Google do with their catalog and maps data - would vastly expand the range of services available .
It can not make any sense that Google , an American organisation , is presently more popular with people aiming to create new map applications .

In an excellent use of Google Earth , someone living near the scene of action has begun documenting where military actions have occurred on both sides of the Israel - Lebanon conflict .
This shows how GE ’s ability to tie information to location can be a powerful tool for visualization .
This collection of placemarks shows the locations of the military actions based on news reports .
Each placemark contains details on the action which occurred at the location and the casualties or damage resulting , and allows you to view the aerial photos and see what it looked like before the conflict .

LOSING HURTS MORE than winning feels good .
This simple maxim applies with equal power to virtually all areas of human interaction : sports , finance , love .
And war .
Defeat in war damages societies quite out of proportion to what a rational calculation of cost would predict .
The United States absorbed the loss in Vietnam quite easily on paper , for example , but the societal effects of defeat linger to this day .
The Afghanistan debacle was an underrated contributor to Soviet malaise in the 1980s and a factor in perestroika , glasnost and eventually the dissolution of the Soviet Union .
Defeats can have unintended , seemingly inexplicable consequences .
And as any sports fan can tell you , the only thing that feels worse than a loss is an upset .
An upset demands explanation and requires that responsible parties be punished .
The endgame in Iraq is now clear , in outline if not detail , and it appears that the heavily favored United States will be upset .
Once support for a war is lost , it is gone for good ; there is no example of a modern democracy having changed its mind once it turned against a war .
So we ought to start coming to grips with the meaning of losing in Iraq .
The consequences for the national psyche are likely to be profound , throwing American politics into a downward spiral of bitter recriminations the likes of which it has not seen in a generation .
It will be a wedge that politicians will exploit for their benefit , proving yet again that politics is the eternal enemy of strategy .
The Vietnam syndrome divided this country for decades ; the Iraq syndrome will be no different .
The battle for interpretation has already begun , with fingers of blame pointed in all directions in hastily written memoirs .
The war ’s supporters have staked out their position quite clearly : Attacking Iraq was strategically sound but operationally flawed .
Key decisions on troop levels , de-Baathification , the disbanding of the Iraqi army and the like doomed what otherwise would have been a glorious war .
The American people seem to understand , however — and historians will certainly agree — that the war itself was a catastrophic mistake .
It was a faulty grand strategy , not poor implementation .
The Bush administration was operating under an international political illusion , one that is further discredited with every car bombing of a crowded Baghdad marketplace and every Iraqi doctor who packs up his family and flees his country .
The only significant question still hanging is whether Iraq will turn out to have been the biggest strategic mistake in U.S. history .
Vietnam was a much greater moral disaster , of course , and led to far more death and destruction .
But , just as the war ’s critics predicted in the 1960s , Vietnam turned out to be strategically irrelevant .
Saigon fell , but no dominoes followed ; the balance of Cold War power did not change .
Iraq has the potential to be far worse .
One of the oft - expressed worst - case scenarios for Iraq — a repeat of Lebanon in the 1980s — may no longer be within reach .
Lebanon ’s simmering civil war eventually burned itself out and left a coherent , albeit weak , state in its ashes .
Iraq could soon more closely resemble Somalia in the 1990s , an utterly collapsed , uncontrollable , lawless , failed state that destabilizes the most vital region in the world .
Hopefully at some point during the recriminations to come , the American people will seize the opportunity to ask themselves a series of fundamental questions about the role and purpose of U.S. power in the world .
How much influence can the United States have in the Middle East ?
Is its oil worth American blood and treasure ?
Are we really safer now that Iraq burns ?
Might we not be better off just leaving the region alone ?
Perhaps at some point we will come to recognize that the United States can afford to be much more restrained in its foreign policy adventures .
Were our founding fathers here , they would surely look on Iraq with horror and judge that the nation they created had fundamentally lost its way .
If the war in Iraq leads the United States to return to its traditional , restrained grand strategy , then perhaps the whole experience will not have been in vain .
Either way , the Iraq syndrome is coming .
We need to be prepared for the divisiveness , vitriol , self - doubt and recrimination that will be its symptoms .
They will be the defining legacy of the Bush administration and neoconservatism ’s parting gift to America .
At the stroke of midnight tonight , Southern California will mark a milestone that few are celebrating .
History will show that from July 1 of 2006 to June 30 of this year , only 3.21 inches of rain fell in downtown Los Angeles -- the lowest precipitation level since records started being kept in the 1880s .
Other cities around the region , including Pasadena , Culver City , Anaheim and Riverside , will also set all - time records .
As the record falls , firefighters around the region are bracing for a potentially disastrous run-up to July 4 as fireworks go on sale just as temperatures rise into the triple digits .
“ Human nature is we all love a new record , ” said Bill Patzert , a climatologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge .
“ But this one ’s on the hate list .
And it ’s a long list . ”

The unrelenting dry conditions have sapped moisture from plant life in hillsides and canyons , making them far more susceptible than normal to sparks from fireworks .
The latest studies of brush and grasslands by the L.A. County Fire Department found that the moisture level in plants is the lowest in 26 years .
And that does n’t count the large amount of brush that has already died .
Of equal concern to firefighters is the wind .
Typically , Southern California records 30 days of Santa Ana winds a year .
But over the last 12 months , the region saw more than 100 days of Santa Anas .
On Friday , the National Weather Service again issued a red flag fire warning for forest and mountain areas .
“ We ’ve never seen anything like this , ” said Burbank Fire Capt .
Ron Bell .
“ The Griffith Park and Hollywood Hills fires show that something that could normally be contained immediately could rage out of control with the wind .
Things are going to be bigger and worse than ever . ”

Bell ’s city took the extreme action of canceling its annual fireworks show this year because the conditions are just too dry .
Other fireworks shows are proceeding -- but with precautions .
In advance of the Rose Bowl display , fire retardant is being sprayed in the Linda Vista brush surrounding the stadium .
Other cities have enlisted police , firefighters and even volunteers to watch for signs of fireworks and to patrol hillsides that are prone to brush fires .
The Orange County Fire Authority is deploying firetrucks throughout the county in case they ’re needed for a quick response to blazes .
“ It ’s almost like gasoline out there with all the dead fuel , ” said Capt .
Stephen Miller .

Wenzel Likness , a 65 - year - old resident of Orange , said he has lived in his hillside home for 20 years and has never seen the fire danger so severe .
“ We ’ve plowed some fire breaks , ” he said , “ but I think that in these conditions , with so much dry fuel , some strong winds could easily overtake the measures we ’ve taken . ”
Fireworks -- including “ safe and sane ” ones -- are illegal in the majority of cities around Southern California , including Los Angeles .
But several dozen cities still sell them .
Firefighters worry that people will buy fireworks where they are legal but set them off during festivities at parks or in hillside areas where a spark and some wind can create a major brush fire .
“ Next week is not shaping up good for us , ” said Ventura County Fire Chief Bob Roper , whose agency is stepping up fireworks enforcement this weekend and through July 4 .
“ We ’re expecting triple digits in the inland valleys .

At a stand in Fillmore , Bill Shanks of Port Hueneme brought his 13 - year - old son , Scott , to pick out about $ 150 worth of fireworks .
His son has a friend who lives in Fillmore , Shanks said , and on July 4 they plan to set off the fireworks within the city , where it is legal .
Shanks said he is n’t worried about the pyrotechnics causing fires because those sold in Fillmore do n’t leave the ground .
“ What really scares me are the bottle rockets , ” he said .
“ Because once they ’re shot off , nobody knows where it goes . ”
Along Interstate 15 , the main artery that connects Nevada to Southern California , officials have cracked down on those who are bringing illegal fireworks into the state .
Bomb squad detectives and fire officials have staked out stores in Nevada , especially those near the border , and are tracking large vehicles when they enter California , where most fireworks are illegal .
Authorities recently arrested four people after finding more than 4,000 pounds of illegal fireworks in their trailer on I - 15 near Barstow .

On Thursday , a City Terrace man was arrested after authorities raided his home and found almost 2,500 pounds of illegal fireworks .
For weather experts , dangerous conditions have even taken the fun out of breaking the record .
Two years ago , forecasters were disappointed when downtown L.A. failed by a few inches to set an all - time rain record .
Patzert , the climatologist , later argued at a weather conference that moving the rain station from downtown proper to normally drier USC was the culprit -- and that L.A. really did break the record .
Patzert and others said they watched in amazement over the last year as rainstorm after rainstorm bounced away from Southern California .
Two high - pressure systems parked themselves in the region , deflecting the precipitation .

Michael Anderson , the state ’s climatologist , said the systems have “ basically said , ‘ No rain for you . ’ ”
Even Patzert admits that this dry season -- which breaks the previous record set in 2001 - 02 -- deserves a collective “ blech . ”
John Todd , fire chief of L.A. County ’s forestry division , agreed .
“ I wanted to be here for the wettest season in Los Angeles history , ” he said .
“ This record , I ’m less enamored with .
Yeah , I lived here through the driest winter in history , but this is n’t the kind of record you want . ”

Story Highlights • Sen. Craig Thomas , R - Wyoming , died Monday , says family spokesman
• He had been battling leukemia since November
• Thomas first came to Congress in 1989
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Republican Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming , who had been battling leukemia since November , died Monday night at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland , a family spokesperson told CNN .
He was 74 .
Reacting to the news of Thomas ' death , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell expressed his condolences , saying " the state of Wyoming and our nation are much better places because he was here . "
" Wyoming had no greater advocate , taxpayers had no greater watchdog and rural America had no greater defender than Craig Thomas , " McConnell said .
Thomas was elected to a third term last year .
The vacancy caused by his death will be chosen by Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal , a Democrat .
However , the seat will not switch parties because , under state law , Freudenthal is required to pick a new senator from a list of three candidates submitted by the GOP state central committee .
When he was re-elected in November with 70 percent of the vote , Thomas was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy for his leukemia .
After three weeks of treatment , he returned to work in the Senate in early December .
But the leukemia proved resistant to the treatment , forcing doctors to administer a second round of chemotherapy .
Earlier Monday , Thomas ' office had reported he was in serious condition , both from the leukemia and an infection .
Thomas first came to Congress in 1989 , when he won the Wyoming 's lone House seat in a special election after now - Vice President Dick Cheney resigned to become defense secretary .
In 1994 , he won an open Senate seat and easily won re-election in 2000 and 2006 .
A New Broom in Paris France to Pay Immigrants to Return Home

Update .
It seems that you can configure subversion to handle mime - types after all .
I ’m now serving all static content for this site from :
For popular libraries like Prototype and Dojo there is a huge benefit from serving cached and compressed JavaScript from Google ’s servers .
I was looking for a way to speed up the delivery of this site by moving all static content to code.google.com .
Unfortunately , all source material served from code.google.com is served with a mime - type of text - plain .
Most browsers ignore CSS and images served with that mime - type .
But they do n’t ignore JavaScript .

Comment : # 1 I recently switched jQuery over to using Amazon S3 .
I ’m actually quite pleased with the results .
It ’s solved a lot of request and server issues that we ’ve been having .
For example : http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
Granted , it ’s not free , like Google could be , but $ 0.15 / GB is an acceptable cost ( IMO ) .
Of course , if we could just get HGTV to stop hotlinking to jQuery directly then things would n’t be so bad to begin with
Comment : # 2 @ John – Dear God please do n’t pay for hosting something that you already give away !!
Move to Google quickly !

Comment : # 5 Ca n’t you just host your images / css / javascript on Google Pages and hotlink from there ?
( part of the google apps for your domain thingy )
Comment : # 6 Luckily , most browsers support text / plain for JavaScript .
Comment : # 7 @gslin – you ’re right .
I changed my subversion configuration .
It seems mime - types are supported .
Free hosting of static content for all !
Comment : # 8 Dean , this is a great find , but I would n’t get too used to it .
Not even Google has unlimited bandwidth — if enough people start doing this I ’m sure they ’ll “ fix ” it somehow .
I ’d love to have a single reliable place for Prototype that people can point their SCRIPT tags toward ( like Yahoo does with YUI ) .
I just do n’t think this is that long - term solution .
Comment : # 9 The Google Code Subversion server has been pretty slow , in my experience .
Not sure that it would make a good candidate for serving static files …
Comment : # 10 @ Manuzhai – I ’m using Google svn right now to serve CSS and images .
It seems pretty fast to me .
It was slow when google code was first launched but seems to have improved a lot .
Whatever , it has to be faster than my server .
Comment : # 11 Why not just use googlepages.com ?
I thought that allowed file uploading …
Comment : # 12 @dean – I have to agree with Andrew .
Google Code is too much of a wildcard ; especially for something that demands a high level of availability and use .
Although , I ’m seriously considering it for some of my other projects .
They do n’t provide as much as SourceForge , but I trust them a lot more .
I ’m kind of surprised that you ’re surprised that hosting is being paid for .
$ 0.15 / gb is a drop in the bucket for level of availability and reliability that S3 provides .
The latency is n’t as low as I would ’ve liked , but higher levels would be significantly more expensive .
Plus , it ’s something that ’s easy to programmatically access ( which makes for easy nightly update cronjobs ) .
I ’m also in the process of offloading the jQuery mailing list to Google Groups .
Again , it ’s an imperfect solution ( I would ’ve preferred a forum / mailing list solution that we host ourselves ) , but it ’s one that saves us from sending our current 4.5 m emails / month .
I contacted the OSUOSL a while back , but they did n’t have any more space available ; maybe their situation has changed .
I sure would love to have people , who know what they ’re doing , manage the site .
I only play a sysadmin on tv .
Comment : # 13 I was worried as to what http://deanedwards.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/nad-photo.jpeg was but it turns out to be entirely innocent I shall be interested to see if Google mind code .
google being used as an edge cache .
Personally , I think you ’re right and John ’s being far too kind not only running the jQ team but also paying for the privilege , but hey .
Gives me an excuse to donate
Comment : # 14 @ John – I ’m going to persist with google code for a while and see how it performs .
If it starts crapping out then I suppose I ’ll switch to Amazon too .
The thing is , we ca n’t really move major JS libraries to somewhere that requires payment .
That was the problem I was trying to solve here .
I assumed that google code servers were as reliable as the rest of their servers .
Comments here are starting to persuade me otherwise .
We shall see …
Comment : # 15 @dean –
That ’s understandable , Dojo has AOL , Prototype has 37 Signals , Yahoo !
UI has …
Yahoo .
I guess this is why services like OSUOSL exist , so open source projects do n’t have to worry about this sort of thing – without taking direct corporate sponsorship .
The biggest issue for us is n’t the amount of bandwidth ( we have tons ) , money ( donations cover everything ) , nor servers ( we ’ve got plenty ) , it ’s just that JavaScript Library development does n’t attract server side developers who are interested in contributing sysadmin skills to the project .
It ’s basically just me .
I mean , it ’s fine if there ’s a flux of JavaScript developers to the project , since the project itself breeds more developers who can help – not so with CMS projects ( for example ) .
I ’m not sure if that issue is unique to jQuery , or if its a larger issue amongst open source projects .
( Although , there are n’t many purely - open - source JavaScript projects that do n’t have Corporate sponsorship .
Mootools , Mochikit ? )
Comment : # 16 Would really be great if a big cooperation like google would host various versions and configurations of javascript libs .
I dont think this would cost that much , 2 or 3 server with a tera bandwith or something .
Great way to sponsor open source javascript community
Comment : # 17 Google Code is n’t made for this use , and it ’s probably not something Google wants you to do .
Comment : # 18
Yes I have often wondered why no one has stepped up to host all the javascript libraries .
I know there is huge bandwidth requirements , but someone like Google could do it with little effort I imagine .
It would benefit the internet greatly I think if we could point to one location for the same libraries everyone already uses on all their projects .
With proper caching , in time this would end up saving network traffic for many servers across the internet .
Anyone at Google reading this ?
Take it on as your personal project
Comment : # 19 @sil –
It ’s alright , it does n’t feel right taking in donations and not feeding it back into the project .
Right now , that money has just been going to paying for servers , bandwidth – and the “ jQuery Button Contest ” .
@pplante – I ’ve been talking with a number of people ( at Google , at Mozilla ) and the idea definitely seems to have legs .
I ’ll have to keep running the idea around until it sticks with someone and they take it somewhere .
I imagine that someone will provide generic hosting for JavaScript libraries , at some point ; just not sure who it is or when it will be .
I ’ll write a blog post concerning this and see if I can find someone who ’s willing to help all of us .
Comment : # 20 @ John , the bigger problem is not who will host the files but how to fall back if the primary host is not available .
This is a hard problem .
If it can be solved to everyone ’s satisfaction then we might see the beginning of centrally - hosted JavaScript libraries .
That ’s what I am researching right now .
Comment : # 21 @ John / sil – I ’m mostly thinking about the user ’s experience .
If everyone ends up with a cached version of Prototype / jQuery / YUI / Dojo on their hard disk then web apps will load with a snap that they currently lack .
Comment : # 22 @dean – Sure thing – I mean , Dojo and Yahoo already have source files that you can hotlink directly from your site , and they ’re hosted on massive backbones that can handle anything you throw at them ( and they expect you to ) .
For that reason , Dojo and Yahoo already have those solutions available , and ready ( making the user experience really good ) .
As far as I know , Prototype , Mochikit , and Mootools all do n’t have a single point that you can host your code from .
I ’m content to stick with S3 ; it can handle any number of hits that are thrown at it , and since jQuery is so small , we can serve about 55 k requests for about $ 0.15 .
I ’m about ready to promote the code.jquery.com URL as a definitive source of hotlinking , for jQuery .
I do n’t think the important thing is centralization , so much as it ’s important that there ’s a definitive URL for hotlinking the source code from .
Having a location to load the source from tends to show the level of dedication and strength of the open source projects associated with it .
All of that being said , having a centralized host for JavaScript libraries certainly can’t hurt .

You are probably right about hosting images and the like though .
I should probably stop doing that .

Comment : # 29 I believe this has potential and have therefore registered http://code.google.com/p/framework/ on Google Code for the purpose .
The main issue ( also mentioned here ) is concerns with server - up - time .
It would be perfect if we could come up with a fall - back solution .
Also it should be discussed what kind of update cycles should be used .
Currently , I am suggesting a third - digit version number auto - update that is defined by always being backward compatible – see more at the url above .
In addition to the issues discussed here this project could need more clarification , and possibly wiki descriptions of each framework .

Comment : # 30 Been doing this for a few months now with a little widget I created .

I noticed stylesheets failed when I tried adding them into the mix — which is how I ended up here .
Thanks for the tip on mime - typing .
Comment : # 31 Dean : is it an idea to start using tags in subversion for a release .
In that way , I could directly link in base2 in my code , without worrying if newer versions break my code .
Comment : # 32 @Doeke – yes , I ’ll do this eventually .
base2.DOM is still not officially released ( although it is not far away ) .
Comment : # 33 I had no idea you could that !
Very cool idea , I think they should allow a certain amount of static hosting , heck they have google pages now , and they already cache all of my content , so why not a little payback ?
Does n’t everyone want be your static content host now , ie youtube , flickr , etc anyway ..

Comment : # 36
If this ( pretty good ) idea makes it to the masses , Google will noticeable get slower – what will they do ?
Will they stop it … or will they sell your code
Comment : # 37 [ … ]
Update : I ’m not the first to think this , apparently .
Dean Edwards played around with making code.google.com serve up some static content , and the comments there confirm that others think this would be a great idea .
So what about it , Google ?
Can you spare some change ? [… ]
Comment : # 38 lol …
I thought of the same thing today , posted about it : http://www.tallent.us/blog/?p=7
… and then found this blog .
Google really could step up here , and all that is needed is static hosting and * very * high expiration dates .
Using folders for version numbers removes the compatibility issues of “ myapp- latest . * ” and the need for short - term expire headers .
I just started using Ext JS , and it ’s beautiful , but HUGE .
Same thing with TinyMCE and the dozens of famfamfam silk icons I use .
As Dean said , this is about the user experience : web apps being able to “ share ” the browser cache is a very good thing , and hosting on another domain offers HTTP pipelining benefits ( more parallel connections from the user ’s browser ) .
With proper expiration headers , the actual bandwidth cost is minimal , or at least scales as a function of * users * , not as a function of the number of applications .

Comment : # 40 There have been some suggestions of using Google Pages .
Unfortunately for me ( and probably some others ) is that Google Pages is blocked where I work .
Anytime there is a link to a Google Pages page , I ca n’t visit it .
I ca n’t even access hosting companies websites , ( including the one we are hosted with ) .
The host I use for my own site got through the filters though ( it is n’t a major host though ) .
Comment : # 41 secure sites would need the content coming from Google Code to be through https .
I ’m not sure it offers this at the moment .
Comment : # 42 @rainer – I do n’t agree that the hosting performance will deteriorate as more developers host their projects with them .
It is obvious that Google already know what to expect and have good scalability plans even before Google Code is opened to public .
This is something I have read from http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2006-07-27-n89.html
Google claims their hosting service is “ simple , fast , reliable and scalable , ” but also admits : Google Code will have lots of key features at launch , but we may not have all features you want or need for your project .
Rather than try to offer every possible feature , we have focused on doing the most important things really well .
More features will be added over time , but only when they are ready .
However , we will not offer the following any time soon : shell accounts , build farm , private projects , nested projects , or multiple alternatives for each type of hosted tool .
I guess this is something we should be happy for , irregardless of whether it is for hosting projects or static contents like images / other files .
Even paying a small fee is totally fine with me .
@ Sam – yes googlepages has been blocked in some country as well as several ISPs / hosts / companies .
Some even block them as personal …
Comment : # 43 Guys ,
We will soon start hosting JS libraries on a central location :
It will solve both the bandwith problem and caching problem .
Expect a launch in less than a week – sign up to be notified at http://www.hosted-js.com
Meanwhile you can write out what libraries you think should get hosted
Comment : # 44
My suggestions : 1 . Serve images via Flickr 2 .
Serve css / javascript via Googlepage
Comment : # 45
While I ’d love to be able to leverage Google ’s bandwidth and the increase in simultaneous http requests to my client ’s browsers , I still prefer the security of knowing where my data is ( and having the only key ) .
Can you imagine the potential damage / disaster that could come about with a code breach ?
Think about it .
We ’re talking about libraries that allow you to tie into each and every xmlhttp request … heck , every form for that matter as well .
Form.extend ( “ submit ” , ccPostToEvilURL ( ) ) .
How many websites use these libraries ?
Instead of tricking one or two users into revealing their passwords , they can now grab an entire website .
A compromised Prototype , for example , even for a few minutes , could still mean potentially millions of megs of hijacked data .
Give or take an order of magnitude .
I just started using Ext JS , and it ’s beautiful , but HUGE .
Same thing with TinyMCE and the dozens of famfamfam silk icons I use .
Shameless plug : I ’m a big fan of the famfamfam silk icons , too .
I made a reasonably cross - browser - friendly way to tile the entire icon set so you can drop icons into your HTML with happy - friendly classNames .
Like this : < span class=” icon-application_xp ” />
I say “ reasonably ” cross - browser friendly because of IE ’s notorious stupidity regarding PNGs .
While you ca n’t use background - position with their DirectX filter , you can put the image on a separate layer and then position that .
Then it ’s just a matter of writing the batch to generate the offsets !
Anyway , if you use them anywhere near as much as I do , you ’ll appreciate having them all in one place .

You should n’t use Google Code for this when you can use Google Libraries .
They have commonly used javascript ( like jQuery ) and you can use the API to request specific versions .
It ’s much easier to set up
If you want to server static files like images through Google ’s network you can use Google App Engine .

It was back in February that we first let you know about the Lily Allen capsule for New Look , and after much waiting the first photos of the ‘ Lily Loves ’ capsule have finally hit the net .
We ’re pleased to say that , for the most part , there are some great pieces in the range most keeping with the 2007 Spring / Summer ruffles trend and the mini-dress trend .
The range hits New Look stores in the United Kingdom on May 9 – though we ’re wondering if anyone will have any money left after the Kate Moss range hits TopShop .
150 years ago , we had pretty much settled on all of the protocols and conventions of the American democractic system .
We had figured out the steps and rules of electing a president .
Before radio , before TV .
Before planes or cars .
Before computers or voting machines .
Before YouTube .
Since mass democracy is essentially an exercise in communication and marketing , the fact that this essential process is frozen in time is a problem .
Here ’s a few why not questions :
Why not have six - hour long debates , and do them once a week on Cspan , with the highlights diced and sliced and put on any number of online or offline channels ?
Why not use a chess clock style timing device so that each candidate can be free to answer a question for as long as she likes , but each candidate enters the debate with exactly the same amount of time to allocate ?
Why not have the early state primary voters have the ability to vote for their four favorite candidates ?
It ’ll reward consensus candidates that have a better chance of winning the election .
Or , with a small upgrade to voting machines , why not let voters rank all the candidates ?
It ’s been shown to lead to better results .
Why not let us vote at ATM machines ?
Why not run the final elections over the course of a week , announcing the balloting results at the end of each day ?
It would certainly increase turnout .
Why rely on geography as the primary mechanism for districts and electoral college votes ?
Our issues are n’t farm - based any more .
Why not let me pick which ‘ state ’ I live in ?
If I ran a party and wanted to increase my chances of getting elected , I ’d figure out how to turn the primary process into something that was simultaneously more interesting and more likely to lead to large numbers of my party turning out to vote in the general election .
Instead , it ’s almost guaranteed to do the opposite .
The relevant lesson for you , even if you ’re not an active citizen or if you live elsewhere ?
Is your organization just as stuck ?
Are there marketing dynamics that you ’re not discussing , merely because there is n’t even a way to talk about them ?
Recognizing " Hinky " vs. Citizen Informants
On the subject of people noticing and reporting suspicious actions , I have been espousing two views that some find contradictory .
One , we are all safer if police , guards , security screeners , and the like ignore traditional profiling and instead pay attention to people acting hinky : not right .
And two , if we encourage people to contact the authorities every time they see something suspicious , we ’re going to waste our time chasing false alarms : foreigners whose customs are different , people who are disliked by someone , and so on .
The key difference is expertise .
People trained to be alert for something hinky will do much better than any profiler , but people who have no idea what to look for will do no better than random .
Here ’s a story that illustrates this :
Last week , a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology was arrested with two illegal assault weapons and 320 rounds of ammunition in his dorm room and car :
The discovery of the weapons was made only by chance .
A conference center worker who served in the military was walking past Hackenburg ’s dorm room .
The door was shut , but the worker heard the all - too - familiar racking sound of a weapon , said the center ’s director Bill Gunther .
Notice how expertise made the difference .
The “ conference center worker ” had the right knowledge to recognize the sound and to understand that it was out of place in the environment he heard it .
He was n’t primed to be on the lookout for suspicious people and things ; his trained awareness kicked in automatically .
He recognized hinky , and he acted on that recognition .
A random person simply can’t do that ; he wo n’t recognize hinky when he sees it .
He ’ll report imams for praying , a neighbor he ’s pissed at , or people at random .
He ’ll see an English professor recycling paper , and report a Middle - Eastern - looking man leaving a box on sidewalk .
We all have some experience with this .
Each of us has some expertise in some topic , and will occasionally recognize that something is wrong even though we can’t fully explain what or why .
An architect might feel that way about a particular structure ; an artist might feel that way about a particular painting .
I might look at a cryptographic system and intuitively know something is wrong with it , well before I figure out exactly what .
Those are all examples of a subliminal recognition that something is hinky — in our particular domain of expertise .
Good security people have the knowledge , skill , and experience to do that in security situations .
It ’s the difference between a good security person and an amateur .
This is why behavioral assessment profiling is a good idea , while the Terrorist Information and Prevention System ( TIPS ) is n’t .
This is why training truckers to look out for suspicious things on the highways is a good idea , while a vague list of things to watch out for is n’t .
It ’s why this Israeli driver recognized a passenger as a suicide bomber , while an American driver probably would n’t .
This kind of thing is n’t easy to train .
( Much has been written about it , though ; Malcolm Gladwell ’s Blink discusses this in detail . )
You ca n’t learn it from watching a seven - minute video .
But the more we focus on this — the more we stop wasting our airport security resources on screeners who confiscate rocks and snow globes , and instead focus them on well - trained screeners walking through the airport looking for hinky — the more secure we will be .
EDITED TO ADD ( 4/26 ) : Jim Harper makes an important clarification .
Posted on April 26 , 2007 at 5:43 AM • 72 Comments
After the discovery of dark energy , Perlmutter concluded that the next generation of dark - energy telescopes would have to include a space - based observatory .
But the search for financing for such an ambitious project can require as much forbearance as the search for dark energy itself .
“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen as much of Washington as I have in the last few years , ” he says , sighing .
Even if his Supernova Acceleration Probe did n’t now face competition from several other proposals for federal financing ( including , perhaps inevitably , one involving his old rival Riess ) , delays have prevented it from being ready to launch until at least the middle of the next decade .
“ Ten years from now , ” says Josh Frieman of the University of Chicago , “ when we ’re talking about spending on the order of a billion dollars to put something up in space — which I think we should do — you ’re getting into that class where you ’re spending real money . ”
Even some cosmologists have begun to express reservations .
At a conference at Durham University in England last summer , a “ whither cosmology ? ” panel featuring some of the field ’s most prominent names questioned the wisdom of concentrating so much money and manpower on one problem .
They pointed to what happened when the government - sponsored Dark Energy Task Force solicited proposals for experiments a couple of years ago .
The task force was expecting a dozen , according to one member .
They got three dozen .
Cosmology was choosing a “ risky and not very cost - effective way of moving forward , ” one Durham panelist told me later , summarizing the sentiment he heard there .
But even if somebody were to figure out whether or not dark energy changes across time and space , astronomers still would n’t know what dark energy itself is .
“ The term does n’t mean anything , ” said David Schlegel of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory this past fall .
“ It might not be dark .
It might not be energy .
The whole name is a placeholder .
It ’s a placeholder for the description that there ’s something funny that was discovered eight years ago now that we do n’t understand . ”
Not that theorists have n’t been trying .
“ It ’s just nonstop , ” Perlmutter told me .
“ There ’s article after article after article . ”
He likes to begin public talks with a PowerPoint illustration : papers on dark energy piling up , one on top of the next , until the on - screen stack ascends into the dozens .
All the more reason not to put all of cosmology ’s eggs into one research basket , argued the Durham panelists .
As one summarized the situation , “ We do n’t even have a hypothesis to test . ”
Michael Turner wo n’t hear of it .
“ This is one of these godsend problems ! ” he says .
“ If you ’re a scientist , you ’d like to be around when there ’s a great problem to work on and solve .
The solution is not obvious , and you could imagine it being solved tomorrow , you could imagine it taking another 10 years or you could imagine it taking another 200 years . ”
But you could also imagine it taking forever .
“ Time to get serious . ”
The PowerPoint slide , teal letters popping off a black background , stared back at a hotel ballroom full of cosmologists .
They gathered in Chicago last winter for a “ New Views of the Universe ” conference , and Sean Carroll , then at the University of Chicago , had taken it upon himself to give his theorist colleagues their marching orders .
“ There was a heyday for talking out all sorts of crazy ideas , ” Carroll , now at Caltech , recently explained .
That heyday would have been the heady , post - 1998 period when Michael Turner might stand up at a conference and turn to anyone voicing caution and say , “ Ca n’t we be exuberant for a while ? ”
But now has come the metaphorical morning after , and with it a sobering realization :
Maybe the universe is n’t simple enough for dummies like us humans .
Maybe it ’s not just our powers of perception that are n’t up to the task but also our powers of conception .
Extraordinary claims like the dawn of a new universe might require extraordinary evidence , but what if that evidence has to be literally beyond the ordinary ?
Astronomers now realize that dark matter probably involves matter that is nonbaryonic .
And whatever it is that dark energy involves , we know it ’s not “ normal , ” either .
In that case , maybe this next round of evidence will have to be not only beyond anything we know but also beyond anything we know how to know .
That possibility always gnaws at scientists — what Perlmutter calls “ that sense of tentativeness , that we have gotten so far based on so little . ”
Cosmologists in particular have had to confront that possibility throughout the birth of their science .
“ At various times in the past 20 years it could have gotten to the point where there was no opportunity for advance , ” Frieman says .
What if , for instance , researchers could n’t repeat the 1963 Bell Labs detection of the supposed echo from the big bang ?
Smoot and John C. Mather of NASA ( who shared the Nobel in Physics with Smoot ) designed the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite telescope to do just that .
COBE looked for extremely subtle differences in temperature throughout all of space that carry the imprint of the universe when it was less than a second old .
And in 1992 , COBE found them : in effect , the quantum fluctuations that 13.7 billion years later would coalesce into a universe that is 22 percent dark matter , 74 percent dark energy and 4 percent the stuff of us .
Germany has just passed a new law that adds more " anti-hacker " provisions to the German criminal code .
Although the new rules are meant to apply narrowly to hacking , critics are already complaining that they may prevent necessary security and network research .
The new rules tighten up the existing sanctions and prohibit any unauthorized user from disabling or circumventing computer security measures to access secure data ( see the law , section 202 [ in German ] ) .
Manufacturing , programming , installing , or spreading software that has the primary goal of circumventing security measures is verboten , which means that some security scanning tools might become illegal .
In theory , this applies only to illicit programs like trojans , but some groups worry about how the new criteria will be applied .
The Chaos Computer Club in Germany said of the decision , " Forbidding this software is about as helpful as forbidding the sale and production of hammers because sometimes they also cause damage . "
In addition , denial of service attacks are now explicitly illegal , even if they 're done as pranks .
People convicted under the new law could face ten years in prison and be held liable for monetary damages .
Chaos Computer Club spokesman Andy Mueller Maguhn said that " safety research can [ now ] take place only in an unacceptable legal gray area . "
The group is also concerned that the new legislation will make it easier for the police to obtain information by hacking — something that was outlawed by the courts a few months back .
Germany 's decision to tighten up the statutes against hacking come as the EU develops its own framework for dealing with cyber -crime .
The European Commission circulated a " communication " this week that seeks to start a dialogue on crafting a European - wide policy to fight cyber -crime .
That document suggests working first on international relations and cross - border police cooperation , but additional legislation might also be necessary on the national level .
DDoS attacks and botnets are both explicitly mentioned in the document , and the EU is no doubt worried about more than " traditional " cyber - crime in the wake of the massive DDoS attack against Estonia in the last few weeks .
After the long years of the Bush administration , the United States needs to elect a president in 2008 who can inspire the nation and call upon us to be the best Americans we can be .
In that light , I watched last week ’s Republican presidential debate with special interest .
The moment in the debate I found most revealing , most distressing , was when the moderator asked the ten Republican candidates to raise their hand if they believe gay and lesbian Americans should be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces of the United States .
Not one of them raised his hand .
At a time when our military is desperate to recruit qualified men and women , when more than eighty percent of Americans oppose discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , and when our national security depends on our international credibility as a nation dedicated to the values of tolerance , religious liberty , individual dignity , and equal justice , it is deplorable that candidates for the office of president still embrace and defend a policy that both excludes tens of thousands of qualified Americans from military service and denies patriotic gays and lesbians the right to serve their country unless they deny who they are , lie about their identity , and return to the darkness of the closet .
That sorrowful and degrading moment in the Republican presidential debate called to mind an earlier generation of American “ leaders ” : the generation of Orval Faubus , Ross Barnett , and Strom Thurmond .
Exactly half - a- century ago , Governor Faubus expressed his conception of “ American values ” by calling out the Arkansas National Guard to prevent nine African - American children from entering Little Rock ’s Central High School .
Several years later , Governor Ross Barnett rose to power in Mississippi by proclaiming that “ the Negro is different because God made him different to punish him . ”
A fierce defender of “ American values , ” Barnett ferociously opposed James Meredith ’s admission to the University of Mississippi , promising in 1962 that Mississippi would never “ surrender to the evil . . . forces of tyranny . ”
Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina came to national prominence when he stormed out of the 1948 Democratic National Convention after the party endorsed civil rights for African - Americans .
Thurmond declared that he would never “ admit the nigra race into our theaters , into our swimming pools , into our homes , and into our churches . ”
Racial segregation , he added , was red - white - and - blue American , for it was “ honest , open and aboveboard . ”
I do n’t know whether John McCain , Rudy Guiliani , Mitt Romney and the other Republican presidential candidates agree with General Peter Pace , who recently opined that gays should not be allowed to serve openly in the military because homosexuals are “ immoral . ”
Perhaps McCain , Guiliani , Romney , et al. do n’t share that belief .
Perhaps they are merely pandering to the extreme right - wing of the Republican Party .
I ’m not sure which is worse : a presidential candidate who sincerely holds beliefs forged at a time when men burned witches or a presidential candidate who is thoughtful and decent enough to know that such beliefs have no place in American society , but who is nevertheless so cynical that he is willing to endanger the nation and endorse indecency in order to mollify those extremists who still hold such beliefs .
I recognize , of course , that not everyone accepts the moral analogy between discrimination against blacks and discrimination against gays .
But those who fail to see the power of that analogy have simply blinded themselves to reason , in the same way that Strom Thurmond , Ross Barnett , and Orval Faubus blinded themselves ( or pretended to be blind ) to the moral connections between slavery , racial discrimination , and " separate but equal . "
Like racial , gender , age , disability , religious , and ethnic discrimination , discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is grounded in ignorance , intolerance , and immorality .
It is a deeply irrational policy that has no more place in American law than a rule forbidding Mormons , Italians , Aquarians , or people born on Friday the 13th from serving openly in the military .
Of course , there are those who thump their bibles and proclaim that their condemnation of homosexuality is rooted in their religious faiths .
That may be so .
But that is not a < em>legitimate < / em > basis for making public policy in the United States .
This nation is dedicated to the proposition that we are all “ created equal . ”
It embraces and celebrates the principles that we are all endowed with certain “ inalienable rights , ” that we are all entitled to “ equal protection of the laws , ” and that we are all deserving of equal dignity and respect .
We do not always live up to those commitments , but the history of our nation is one of progress toward a more tolerant , more open , more reasoned society .
It is a source of righteous pride that we Americans have overcome many of the prejudices , hatreds , and fears of those who came before us .
“ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” is not a policy that reflects true “ American values . ”
Like “ separate but equal , ” it was , at best , a transitional compromise with bigotry .
Perhaps , for a time , it was a necessary evil .
But by failing now to condemn that policy , the Republican presidential candidates have shamed themselves , their party , and their nation .
And they are on the wrong side of history .
Stephen Kotler , executive vice president of the division , said he expected business to increase by 15 percent again this year , based on the requests he has already received from banks , consumer - products companies and media firms .
Even though his clients can afford high rents , he said , they do not have many choices .
“ There ’s going to be limited inventory and a lot of demand , ” Mr. Kotler said .
“ There just has n’t been enough rental product built , ” he said , as , developers have said that the price of land and the costs of construction in the last few years have made it impractical to build rental buildings .
They have instead focused on condominiums .
Renters without high salaries have not been shut out of the market .
They are squeezing in extra roommates or making alterations as never before much to the frustration of landlords .
The rents for one - bedroom apartments in Manhattan average $ 2,567 a month , and two - bedrooms average $ 3,854 a month , according to data from Citi Habitats , a large rental brokerage company , but rents tend to be far higher in coveted neighborhoods like the Upper West Side and TriBeCa .
Because landlords typically require renters to earn 40 times their monthly rent in annual income , renters of those average apartments would need to earn at least $ 102,680 , individually or combined , to qualify for a one - bedroom and $ 154,160 to afford a two - bedroom .
Young people making a fraction of those salaries are doubling up in small spaces and creating housing code violations , said Jamie Heiberger - Jacobsen , a real estate lawyer with her own practice .
She is representing landlords in 26 cases that claim overcrowding or illegal alterations in elevator buildings in Murray Hill , the Upper East and Upper West Sides and the Lower East Side .
A year ago , she handled a half - dozen such cases .
Ms. Heiberger - Jacobsen said she was seeing the overcrowding not only in tenement - type buildings , but also in doorman buildings .
“ It really does create fire hazards , ” she said .
“ You ca n’t just have beds all over the place . ”
But more renters are finding that they cannot afford to stay in the city without resorting to less conventional living arrangements .
For the last five years , Mindy Abovitz , 27 , a drummer and graphic designer , has been living with four roommates in a 1,500 - square - foot loft with one bathroom in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , which has become a haven for young people , that rents for $ 2,600 a month .
The album cover – once a crucial part of any band 's identity – has been dying a slow death for decades .
For the most part , music fans put up with the shrinkage of album art from expansive vinyl records to hand - size plastic jewel cases .
But with the music experience moving almost exclusively online , album art has suffered another compression – this time all the way down to thumbnail images .
( Worse still – they 're missing from most of the music files we 've all ripped and downloaded . )
But music label designers are working to raise the album cover back up to an art form .
They 're experimenting with new tools and hatching plans to reinvent album art for the digital age , all while weathering the tectonic shifts that ultimately rule the music industry .
As things stand now , designers face challenges due to the size restrictions on album art images .
" Bands still have a romantic notion that their art is going to be 12 inches by 12 inches – a glossy LP , a glorious image , " says Maggie Fost , designer for Merge Records .
" But when I design an album cover , I come up with some design elements – and then zoom all the way out to 50 pixels by 50 pixels .
Because on blogs , on Amazon , on iTunes – everywhere people see it is the same ( small size ) . "
All this comes at a time when bands need good album art more than ever .
They 're playing in an increasingly crowded arena with less support from the labels .
In fact , Brian Stuhlmacher , president of cddesign.com ( a division of his DiscMasters company ) , points out that album art often helps fill the image - building vacuum left by labels , which are investing less in promoting artists .
" ( The major labels ) have broken away from something that they were extremely good at in the past , which was the development of their particular act or artist , " says Stuhlmacher .
" They now tend to sign ( a bunch of ) acts and throw them against the wall of radio and basically see what sticks . "
Places like cddesign.com are working with artists and labels to figure out the next phase of album design .
Some of the ideas ( like online contests that interact with music listeners ) sound straight out of a manual for advanced web design ; others ( like liner - note fly - throughs and DVD - style menus ) have the potential to offer more information in a more compelling way .
George White , Warner Music Group 's senior VP of strategy and product development , put together a digital packaging demo for Apple to re-imagine album artwork as more than a JPEG on an iPod .
" We 've been looking at a few technologies ( for digital album art ) , and have been trying to bring these to Apple , to encourage them to bring that level of experience to the iPod , " says White .
" A very simple demonstration that we 've done takes the Gnarls Barkley liner notes and does a fly - through ( using Adobe Flash Lite ) .
You 're actually moving through the lyrics and artwork .
It 's sort of like a theme park ride through the album .
It 's really , really cool - looking on an iPod . "
( Apple did not respond to questions about whether it 's considering any of Warner Music Group 's suggestions . )
White also pointed to Warner 's Wamo pack , which gave Japanese cell phone users digital albums with ringtones , video , full tracks and artist interviews .
Wamo packs are n't new – they launched overseas a year ago .
But White says Warner plans to produce more of these bundles .
He also mentioned that while Wamo packs use Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language , or SMIL , for their interactive menus , Adobe 's Flash Lite would be a better candidate for " the level of sophistication people expect from Warner Music Group 's artists . "
( Adobe confirmed that Warner 's iPod / Flash Lite demonstrations had taken place , but said that the company " has not announced any joint plans for Flash or Flash Lite to be used in next - generation digital albums . " )
Once digital artwork plays on computers and portables , White said , the next phase will involve the possibilities of home entertainment equipment .
" If you move that content over to your Xbox 360 , your PS3 , or your Wii , is there more that we can do in terms of interactivity ?
Is there better artwork ?
There 's certainly high - definition artwork that you can introduce at that point . "
Because of all the players involved , the future of album art depends on which digital packaging formats emerge as standards for computers , portable devices and televisions .
White thinks that when it comes to deploying new digital album packages , there 's no time like the present , and that an open standard will emerge on its own .
" There 's no reason why this stuff can't be scalable across the industry .
That 's what we'd like to push for ... by creating some really compelling content ....
Others will copy it , and a de facto standard will emerge , " White explains .
Fost agrees , adding that " the digital art issue will resolve itself probably within the next couple of years . "
But she worries about the indie labels .
For them , " It 's still an issue of design resources , " Fost says , especially because they already design about 15 versions of each album cover because of all the different formats and promotional materials .
Fans could fill in the gap by providing some of that content through contests and other collaborative efforts , of course .
" Hopefully , this will reach a point where the artist themselves can create multimedia experiences " to accompany a digital album , says Jadon Ulrich , designer for Saddle Creek Records .
Ultimately , digital packaging could reinvent the album cover , finally taking advantage of the digitization of music not for added convenience , but for advanced possibilities .
The MTV generation , which grew up deprived of large album covers , could get the last laugh after all .

IT seems like such a wonderful concept when you encounter it for the first time as a parent .
You go to a restaurant as a family , are seated and given menus , and the waitress cheerfully turns to your children and exclaims , “ And these are for you ! ”
Their own special menus — kids ’ menus !
Sometimes these are little laminated things , peewee facsimiles of what Mom and Dad are holding .
Sometimes these are placemats that not only tell you what foods are available but also contain mazes and word - search puzzles .
No matter what , the menu offers chicken fingers with French fries .
And typically , as you go down the list , macaroni and cheese , a hot dog , a hamburger , grilled cheese and some kind of pizza .
Early in my tenure as a parent , I thought children ’s menus were the greatest thing , a quantum leap forward in the human condition .
We did n’t have them when I was a child , at least not at restaurants where adults would be happy to dine .
( There were always “ family ” restaurants in the Friendly ’s - HoJo ’s idiom that offered junior sundaes and burgers . )
I was thrilled that someone had come up with this innovation , that civilization had advanced to the point where children at good restaurants were now immediately placated with children ’s food , so we adults could plunge worry - free into our adult business of drinking alcohol and eating things with tentacles .
But senators , for the most part , seemed unimpressed .
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont , the committee chairman , said the Bush administration had provided “ a series of shifting explanations and excuses and lack of accountability or even acknowledgment of the seriousness of this matter . ”
And Senator Specter said that while it was still not clear whether United States attorneys like Carol C. Lam in California or David C. Iglesias in New Mexico had been removed with the intention of affecting political - corruption investigations by their offices , the broader impact of the firings had been devastating .
“ It is generally acknowledged that the Department of Justice is in a state of disrepair , perhaps even dysfunctional , because of what has happened , with morale low , ” Mr. Specter said .
“ U.S. attorneys across the country do not know when another shoe may drop , whether they may be asked to resign for a bad reason . ”
Democrats in particular expressed deep doubt at Mr. Sampson ’s argument that politics were not involved in the dismissals .
“ In the last seven weeks , we ’ve learned that Attorney General Gonzales was personally involved in the firing plan , after being told that he was n’t , ” Mr. Schumer said .
“ We ’ve learned that the White House was involved , involved , after being told that it was n’t ; we ’ve learned that Karl Rove was involved , after being told that he was n’t , ” the senator said , alluding to the president ’s chief political adviser .
“ And we have learned that political considerations were very important , after being told that they were n’t . ”
Mr. Sampson opened with a prepared statement , parts of which had been obtained by the news media late Wednesday .
He argued that the list of United States attorneys to be fired had been compiled with the involvement of “ a number of senior Justice Department officials ” ; that the process , while not “ scientific , ” was also not “ random or arbitrary ” ; and that the United States attorneys had been appropriately judged by management skills , relationships with other officials and “ their support for the priorities of the president and the attorney general . ”
“ The distinction between political and performance - related reasons for removing a U.S. attorney is , in my view , largely artificial , ” Mr. Sampson said .
From fresh fruit to ready meals , from baby formula to sausages , the food we eat is getting sweeter .
Why ?
And should we be worried ?
Felicity Lawrence examines the sugaring of the British palate
Once , sugar was all delight : from the land of milk and honey to Shakespearean innocence - " white - handed mistress , one sweet word with thee ... honey , milk and sugar , there is three " .
But now it 's the devil incarnate ; or , at least , the new nicotine .
" Sugar is as dangerous as tobacco [ and ] should be classified as a hard drug , for it is harmful and addictive , " according to a recent article in the British Medical Journal .
Sugars in all forms are seen by many as dangerous to health and our food is packed full of them : not just sucrose ( plain sugar as we know it ) but other forms of refined sugars from cane , beet and corn .
Eat too much of them and you may become fat , sick and miserable .
Sugars rot your teeth and encourage a calorie - rich but nutrient - low diet that contributes to obesity - and obesity is a high - risk factor for heart disease , diabetes and certain cancers .
The rhetoric from the government 's food standards agency is more muted but the aim is the same : having waged a successful war against excess salt , next on the watchdog 's agenda is shifting the balance of our diets away from processed sugars and fats to less energy - dense and more nutritious foods .
It has begun the drawn - out process of consulting industry and health groups on what should be done and is expected to ratchet up the campaign over the next few months .
The watchdog is focusing on both sugar and fat because they are closely linked in food manufacturing : reduce one and the other has a tendency to go up .
The health - conscious have been reducing their fat consumption for a while , but if they 've been doing it by eating more reduced - fat products , such as low - fat yoghurts , or " lite " mayonnaise , or reduced - fat biscuits , then they will be eating more sugars instead .
But how have we become so devoted to sugar ?
And what has the sweetening of our diets done to our palates along the way ?
At East Malling research station in Kent , Vicky Knight is a raspberry plant breeder , Dave Simpson a strawberry expert and Ken Tobutt an apple , cherry and rootstock man .
I took them a bag of supermarket fruit and they used a Brix refractometer , an instrument used by industry to measure sweetness , to test the sugar content of my purchases .
Foods are definitely getting sweeter and our palates altering , say the East Malling plant breeders , but when it comes to fresh produce the change is more subtle than just upping the sugar content .
" Our perception of fruit varieties and their taste is affected by acid levels .
People tend to talk about things being sweeter but sometimes what 's actually happened is they 've become blander .
You can eat blander fruit in larger quantities , you come back for more of it than of the richer varieties , and that can increase sales , " Tobutt explains .
Apples and strawberries , for example , have been bred to taste sweeter by greatly reducing their acid levels .
The problem is that if acidity is too low , the fruit is left with little flavour at all - just sweetness .
Many breeds of raspberries are also a lot sweeter .
It used to be that it did n't matter that the fruit was sharp because sugar was added by consumers ( and a third of the crop went for jam ) .
But now most raspberries are sold fresh through supermarkets .
" A new variety , the Canadian Tulameen , was released in 1989 , " says Knight .
" It has a higher Brix score for sweetness than some older varieties , so all new varieties being tested for market are now compared with a sweeter standard than 10 years ago , and supermarkets will reject them if they are not sweet enough , " Knight says .
She crushes a handful of the raspberries I have brought in a pestle and mortar .
" There 's no smell at all , but a slightly bitter undertow to the taste as though you could be chewing the leaves of the plant . "
But they are sweet on the Brix measure , showing as 10 % sugars - about the same sweetness as a milkshake .
Next Knight casts her experienced eye over some apples in a plastic , cling - wrapped tray : British Cox , grown in Kent , sell - by date January 31 .
" They 'll be more than four months old now , picked mid-September , I guess , and kept in modified atmosphere storage to switch off the ripening mechanism . "
She sniffs .
" Zero aroma . "
The new variety , Pink Lady , sell - by date January 30 , has what breeders call good crunch , but it tastes unpleasantly sweet to me .
According to the Brix measure it is 12.5 % soluble sugars , high but not that high , but it probably tastes so sweet because there were few other flavours to counteract it .
The Cox tastes much less sweet but has more depth and complexity of flavour .
Its sugar levels are surprisingly higher on the Brix measure , at 16 % , but are balanced by greater acidity .
Red grapes turn out to be the sweetest of the fruits I take .
A new trademarked variety called Absolutely Pink from South Africa , these were indeed very more - ish , little explosions in the mouth of sweet liquid with no clearly identifiable flavour , more like a sweetened drink than a fruit .
" Ooh , they are absolutely tasteless , " Knight says , handing me the refractor for inspection .
" But look , they are staggeringly high on the Brix .
Twenty per cent soluble sugars .
Exactly what we said , all sugar and no real flavour . "
That 20 % compares with an average of 16 % sugars recorded in red grapes in 1940 in the official bible of food analysis , The Composition of Foods .
We are born with an attraction to sweetness , taking our first gulps of it in the womb , when we swallow amniotic fluid .
The evolutionary explanation is that this is how we learned to distinguish foods that are generally safe - since there is nothing in nature that is sweet and poisonous - from bitter edibles that may contain toxins .
Breast milk , too , is sweet .
But flavours from the mother 's diet during pregnancy and after birth are transmitted both to the amniotic fluid and to breast milk , so that breast - fed babies experience not only sweetness but a wide range of tastes from sour to spicy .
This early exposure to a varied diet makes them more likely than bottle - fed babies to try a range of new flavours later .
Sugar , say its fans , helps make new foods palatable .
East Malling Research 's chief executive , Colin Gutteridge , worked for Cadbury Schweppes for 23 years before joining the research station and can see a " taste evolution " .
" I remember being presented with yoghurt for the first time when I was nine .
It was acidic and I thought it was repulsive .
If there is a trend over the past 100 years it is taking products that are marginal in taste and making them more acceptable to a wider range of people by adding in sweetness .
Does any of this matter ?
Personally , I do n't think so .
Without it I would never have enjoyed yoghurt . "
A whole science has grown up to try to understand how our early taste preferences are formed and how these may affect the way we eat later , with much of the cutting - edge research being conducted at The Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia , a research establishment that is part - sponsored by the food and drink industry .
" Babies around the world can detect sweet tastes at birth and can distinguish between different types of sugar , " says researcher Dr Julie Mennella .
Mennella has also shown that sweet tastes can act as analgesics and reduce the sensation of pain in children .
" The heightened taste for sweetness occurs during periods of maximum growth and does n't diminish until after adolescence , suggesting we crave sweetness when we have the greatest need for density of calories . "
Bitter tastes , on the other hand , are learned .
Before mass industrialisation of the diet , culinary traditions helped in the process of getting young children used to foods that are not sweet but are valuable sources of vitamins and minerals .
The problem now is that there is a mismatch between our food supply and our biology .
Weaning on manufactured baby foods means that we take our palates in a different direction .
Before the 1970s few parents used processed baby foods , but now they are regularly served up by a large numbers of parents as their confidence in what is wholesome and safe has disappeared .
Although few baby - food manufacturers supplying Europe add sucrose to their products these days , they are often very sweet , making use of concentrated fruits such as apple and sweet vegetables such as sweet potato .
A 213ml jar of junior baby food apple and blueberry has 33g of sugars , for example - that 's the equivalnent of 11 sugar cubes .
Baby vegetable purees are noticeably sweet - 12g of sugars in a 213 ml jar of sweet potato , for example ; meat dishes have an underlying sweetness too : beef and spaghetti has 4g of sugar per jar .
The way baby foods are processed plays a part too , according to Gerrie Hawes , who used to work for a leading baby - food maufacturer and now runs her own baby - food company , Fresh Daisy .
" Nearly all are long - life products .
The process involves cooking the food once , putting it in jars and then cooking it again in the jar under pressure to 121C or more for up to 40 minutes .
The high temperature achieves the desired sterilisation of the food but also changes the taste , texture and colour ; it caramelises the sugars in fruit and vegetables .
Babies acquire a taste for that caramelised flavour .
Home - cooked food is different , it has a graininess and mix of flavours even when pureed that manufactured food does not . "
The food industry , of course , is reluctant to surrender the power this sweetness has over its young customers .
Global standards for foods are set by the international Codex Alimentarius Commission and these are increasingly used as benchmarks in World Trade organisation meetings .
At the last meeting of Codex in November 2006 , the Thai government introduced a proposal to reduce the levels of sugars in baby foods from the existing maximum of 30 % to 10 % , as part of the global fight against obesity .
The proposal was blocked by the US and the EU .
Patti Rundall , policy director of Baby Milk Action group , is convinced such early exposure to refined sugars is how babies get hooked on sweetness at the point at which they would otherwise be weaned off it .
" You are altering the taste profile and palate of babies .
Follow - on formulas are often incredibly sweet , and can contain 60 % more sugars than regular milk . "
She points out that several research studies have shown correlations between bottle feeding and subsequent obesity .
" A bottle - fed baby consumes 30,000 more calories over its first eight months than a breast - fed one .
That 's the calorie equivalent of 120 average chocolate bars .
It 's hugely important to obesity . "
For a palate trained this way it is only a short step to sweetened snack foods and to foods claiming to be healthy that are anything but .
Fruit - flavoured yoghurts have not simply had their sourness reduced , they can be sweeter than a chocolate mousse and be up to a fifth sugar .
A " light " strawberry yoghurt may be virtually fat - free but it is 7 % sugars , with not only added fructose but extra artificial sweetening too .
Even salty snacks are sweetened - Pringles Originals are flavoured with dextrose ; some children 's crisps are sweetened with aspartame ; while upmarket crisps may be sugared with " sea salt and black pepper flavouring " that contains the milk sugar lactose , or with " sea salt and west country cider flavouring " that contains not a hint of west country cider but milk sugar , sugar and flavouring instead .
A whole new marketing language has been created to signal sweetness in supposedly savoury foods : spicy Moroccan , Thai sweet chilli , caramelised onion , balsamic vinegar .
The staples are not immune either .
Look at the nutritional label on a traditionally - made cheese and the line for sugars will read zero .
Pick up a cheese spread or processed children 's cheese and you can find it contains 6 % sugars , thanks to the milk sugars in the skimmed milks powders from which it is manufactured .
Pizzas , buns for burgers , sausages and ready meals all get sweetened .
Beer is the same : learning to like the bitter taste of ale is no longer an adult rite of passage .
" Industrial global beer brands are being dumbed down .
They are not necessarily sweeter but they are less bitter and blander .
Manufacturers use fewer hops and rather than using malt , bulk them out with brewing sugars , " says the Campaign for Real Ale 's research manager , Iain Loe .
Campaigners think it does matter .
" We are raising our current generation in the sweet shop , " says Neville Rigby , director of policy at the International Obesity Taskforce .
" Sweets themselves are ubiquitous but the food industry also has some 30,000 varieties of chemical powder to tweak their artificial ingredients in other products to make them sweet .
Why do they add sugars to savoury products ?
Presumably because their research tells them children like it , and it sells . "
The reason all these sugars are both attractive and pernicious is that our physiology is geared to eating food in its whole , natural state rather than concentrated form .
Refined sugars , and highly refined carbohydrates generally , are converted very rapidly to blood sugar which gives you a burst of energy and a high - rapidly followed by a low as the pancreas releases insulin to reduce blood - sugar levels , leaving you hungry for yet more sugars .
Moreover , if up to a quarter of your calories are coming from the empty calories of refined sugars , the sugars inevitably displace fresh food with vitamins and minerals .
You simply do n't get enough nutrition .
" The blood sugar curves are quite different with whole foods .
They give you a feeling of satiety and fullness and are metabolised slowly so that energy is released steadily over a longer period , " says Aubrey Sheiham , emeritus professor of public health at University College , London .
" But as you expose yourself to sugar , your liking for it increases , and your taste threshold changes .
You start needing more .
Manufacturers have exploited that . "
Intriguing evidence is also beginning to emerge that explains why high sugar consumption becomes quite so addictive .
In animal experiments at Princeton University , Carlo Colantuoni has shown that rats that have been fed large amounts of sugar in their food and then have it removed show signs of opioid withdrawal .
" The indices of anxiety and other symptoms were similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine , " he reports in the journal Obesity .
The industry will have none of this .
It still maintains through its trade organisations such as the Food and Drink Federation that all calories are equal ; the developed world 's obesity epidemic is , it says , the result of too many calories consumed compared with the number of calories expended through physical activity .
British Sugar , which controls 60 % of the UK domestic market , follows the typical line on its website : " Sugar is a natural carbohydrate ... a source of glucose , the vital fuel for the brain and body ... an essential part of an active lifestyle . "
If our palates have indeed been sweetened , you would expect to see it in consumption figures .
But the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs cheerfully announced last month that the latest statistics from the official Expenditure on Food and Drink survey show that fruit and vegetable intake was 7 % up year on year for 2005 - 6 , while confectionery purchased for the household was down 6 % , and our total intake of added sugars also fell , albeit only a fraction of a per cent .
Sadly , it looks as though we may all be telling something less than the truth .
The EFS data is collected from self - reported diaries .
Research at the Medical Research Council 's human nutrition unit in Cambridge has shown that people under - report their consumption by up to 34 % .
Market analysts Taylor Nelson Sofres , by contrast , collects its statistics from till receipts of what has actually been sold .
Their figures for the year to December 2006 shows that sales of small bottles and cans of drink were up 34 % , cakes were up 2 % , chilled juices and juice drinks were up 30 % , and chocolate biscuit bars were down 9 % , but that fall was made up more than three times over by a rise in chocolate confectionery sales , which were up 5 % , from £ 1.6bn in 2005 to £ 1.7bn in 2006 .
Sales of sweetened soft drinks overall have fallen slightly in the past couple of years , as fresh fruit juice sales have risen , but they remain far higher than a decade ago .
In 1992 we drank 1.5l of soft drinks per person per week ; that rose to about 1.8l in 2003 / 4 , and dipped down to about 1.7l in 2004 / 5 .
( Most of this , 1.4l , is sugared , not low - calorie . )
And even the fruit juice seems to be getting sweeter .
Sainsbury 's has started selling a fresh pressed , not from concentrate , red merlot grape juice that is delicious but contains a breathtaking 44g of sugars per modest serving .
That is more than in a can of cola , albeit in a different form .
A traditional pressed apple juice next to it on the shelf has 27g of sugars per serving .
Accurate figures on how consumption patterns have changed over a longer period are hard to come by , because the way data is collected has been changed .
But Barry Popkin at the University of Carolina has looked at more than 100 countries going back to 1962 .
In his report The Sweetening of the World 's Diet , he shows that as the gross national income per capita of a country goes up with industrialisation , so too does consumption of sugars .
As populations have become urbanised and dependent on processed foods , the number of calories they get from sugars has increased by a third .
It has been on the increase for some time .
At the beginning of the 18th century , per capita consumption of sugar in England was still only about 4lbs - less than two of today 's packets of sugar ; by the beginning of the 19th century consumption had soared to 18 lbs per person per year .
Sugar , produced by slaves and imported from the colonies , fuelled the industrial revolution .
In the form of sweetened tea and jam , it fed the factory workers of the 19th century .
By the 1890s , the price greatly reduced after the abolition of slavery by the removal of free - trade barriers , it had become a necessity in the labouring diet : consumption touched 90 lbs per person per year .
Today , boys and girls in this country get 16 - 17 % of their daily calories from processed sugars when the maximum recommended by experts , if you want to avoid diet - related diseases , is 10 % .
( There is no physiological need to eat any refined sugars at all . )
By the age of seven children are eating an average of half a kilo of sugary foods a day .
By the age of 15 boys typically have a habit of nearly 80 lbs per year , the equivalent of 1,000 cans of cola or 11,800 sugar cubes , and that 's only counting what gets owned up to in food diaries .
Taking into account under - reporting , they are matching or exceeding the consumption of impoverished manual workers of the 19th century whose requirement for calories was determined by 14 hours or more of physical labour a day .
For the food industry , cutting back on sugar is far tougher than dealing with salt .
Sugars have so many functions , quite apart from sweetening .
They add cheap bulk .
They draw off moisture , prolonging shelf life .
They are so valuable to the economics of the business , in fact , that far from reducing sugars , a new class of additives has been developed to disguise them .
" Sweetness modifiers " , which may be labelled as " flavouring " , prevent the taste receptors in the mouth registering sweetness .
They are recommended in trade catalogues for processed foods such as cheese , meat and salad dressings where sugars are being added at levels that " taste wrong " , even to our bamboozled senses .
The guilt associated with the pleasure of sugar used to arise from slavery - " When we work in the sugar mills and catch our finger in the millstone , they cut off our hand ; when we try to run away , they cut off our leg ... it is at this price that you eat sugar in Europe , " says the native of Surinam in Voltaire 's Candide .
Today there is a different kind of guilt , at the possibility that we might be harming ourselves - without knowing how .

Thanks !
This page shows you real ways you can get hit and real ways to avoid them .
This is a far cry from normal bicycle safety guides , which usually tell you little more than to wear your helmet and to follow the law .
But consider this for a moment : Wearing a helmet will do absolutely nothing to prevent you from getting hit by a car .
Sure , helmets might help you if you get hit , but your # 1 goal should be to avoid getting hit in the first place .
Plenty of cyclists are killed by cars even though they were wearing helmets .
Ironically , if they had ridden without helmets , yet followed the advice on this page , they might still be alive today .
Do n't fall for the myth that wearing a helmet is the first and last word in biking safety .
In truth , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure .
It 's better to not get hit .
That 's what real bicycle safety is about .
TIP : The Uninsured Motorist clause on your auto insurance may pay if you 're hit & runned while bicycling .
Check your policy .
The next most common bike safety advice after " wear a helmet " is " follow the law , " but most people are already aware that it 's stupid to race through a red light when there 's cross traffic .
So the " follow the law " advice is n't that helpful because it 's too obvious .
What you 'll find here are several scenarios that maybe are n't that obvious .
The other problem with the " follow the law " message is that people may think that 's all they need to do .
But following the law is not enough to keep you safe , not by a long shot .
Here 's an example :
The law tells you to ride as far to the right as is practicable .
But if you ride too far to the right , someone exiting a parked car could open their door right in front of you , and you 'll be less visible to motorists pulling out of driveways and parking lots , and motorists coming from behind may pass you way too closely in the same lane because you did n't make them change lanes .
In each of these cases you were following the law , but you made it easier for yourself to get hit .
This page does n't focus on the law , it focuses on how to not get hit by cars .
Now let 's see how to avoid getting hit .
Ten Ways to Not Get Hit Collision Type # 1 : The Right Cross permalink
This is the most common way to get hit ( or almost get hit ) . ( source1 , source2 )
A car is pulling out of a side street , parking lot , or driveway on the right .
Notice that there are actually two possible kinds of collisions here :
Either you 're in front of the car and the car hits you , or the car pulls out in front of you and you slam into it .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Get a headlight .
If you 're riding at night , you absolutely should be using a front headlight .
It 's required by law , anyway .
Even for daytime riding , a bright white light that has a flashing mode can make you more visible to motorists who might otherwise Right Cross you .
Look for the new LED headlights which last ten times as long on a set of batteries as old - style lights .
And headlamps ( mounted on your head or helmet ) are the best , because then you can look directly at the driver to make sure they see your light .
2 . Wave .
If you can't make eye contact with the driver , wave your arm .
It 's easier for them to see your arm going left and right than it is for them to see a bicycle coming straight towards them .
You could also use a loud horn ( like the Air Zound ) to get drivers ' attention .
If it looks like the driver is about to pull out without seeing you , yell " Hey ! "
You may feel awkward waving or yelling , but it 's better to be embarrassed than to get hit .
Incidentally , many countries require bells on bicycles , but the U.S. does n't .
3 . Slow down .
If you can't make eye contact with the driver ( especially at night ) , slow down so much that you 're able to completely stop if you have to .
Sure , it 's inconvenient , but it beats getting hit .
Doing this has saved my life on too many occasions to count .
4 . Ride further left .
You 're probably used to riding in the " A " line in the picture , very close to the curb , because you 're worried about being hit from behind .
But take a look at the car .
When that driver is looking down the road for traffic , he 's not looking in the bike lane or the area closest to the curb ; he 's looking in the middle of the lane , for other cars .
The farther left you are ( such as in " B " ) , the more likely the driver will see you .
There 's an added bonus here : if the motorist does n't see you and starts pulling out , you may be able to go even farther left , or may be able to speed up and get out of the way before impact , or easily roll onto their hood as they slam on their brakes .
In short , it gives you some options .
Because if you stay all the way to the right and they pull out , your only " option " may be to run right into the driver 's side door .
Using this method has saved me on three occasions in which a motorist ran into me slowly as they hit their brakes and I was n't hurt , and in which I definitely would have slammed into the driver 's side door had I not moved left .
You might worry that moving left makes you more vulnerable to cars coming from behind .
But the stats say you 're far more likely to get hit by a car at an intersection ahead of you that can't see you , than from a car behind you which can see you clearly .
So while both positions have risk , you generally reduce your risk by riding a little farther left .
Your actual lane position depends on road conditions .
On fast roadways with few cross streets ( and thus less chances to get hit at intersections ) , you 'll ride farther to the right .
On slow roads with many cross streets , you 'll ride farther left .
See lane position for more about this .
Collision Type # 2 : The Door Prize permalink A driver opens his door right in front of you .
You run right into it if you can't stop in time .
This kind of crash is more common than you might think :
It 's the second - most common car - bike crash in Toronto , ( source ) and the # 1 crash Santa Barbara .
( source )
We 've compiled a huge list of cyclists killed by running into open car doors .
How to avoid this collision : Ride to the left .
Ride far enough to the left that you wo n't run into any door that 's opened unexpectedly .
You may be wary about riding so far into the lane that cars can't pass you easily , but you 're more likely to get doored by a parked car if you ride too close to it than you are to get hit from behind by a car which can see you clearly .
Collision Type # 3 : The Crosswalk Slam permalink
You 're riding on the sidewalk , you cross the street at a crosswalk , and a car makes a right turn , right into you .
Drivers are n't expecting bikes in the crosswalk , and it's hard for them to see you because of the nature of turning from one street to another , so it 's very easy for you to get hit this way .
In fact , this collision is so common we 've lost track of the number of people who 've told us they were hit this way , such as Ray John Ray .
One study showed that sidewalk - riding was twice as dangerous as road riding , and another study said it 's even more dangerous than that .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Get a headlight .
If you 're riding at night , a headlight is absolutely essential .
It 's required by law , anyway .
2 . Slow down .
Slow down enough that you 're able to stop completely if necessary .
3 . Do n't ride on the sidewalk in the first place .
Crossing between sidewalks is a fairly dangerous maneuver .
If you do it on the left - hand side of the street , you risk getting slammed as per the diagram .
If you do it on the right - hand side of the street , you risk getting slammed by a car behind you that 's turning right .
Sidewalk riding also makes you vulnerable to cars pulling out of parking lots or driveways .
And you 're threatening to pedestrians on the sidewalk , who could get hurt if you hit them .
These kinds of accidents are hard to avoid , which is a compelling reason to not ride on the sidewalk in the first place .
In addition , riding on the sidewalk is illegal in some places .
Some special sidewalks are safe to ride on .
If the sidewalk is really long ( no need to frequently cross streets ) , and free of driveways and peds , then there 's little risk to you and others .
Just make sure when you do cross a street or driveway that you slow down considerably and that you check the traffic in all directions , especially behind you if you 're riding with the flow of traffic .
Collision Type # 4 : The Wrong - Way Wreck permalink
You 're riding the wrong way ( against traffic , on the left - hand side of the street ) .
A car makes a right turn from a side street , driveway , or parking lot , right into you .
They did n't see you because they were looking for traffic only on their left , not on their right .
They had no reason to expect that someone would be coming at them from the wrong direction .
Even worse , you could be hit by a car on the same road coming at you from straight ahead of you .
They had less time to see you and take evasive action because they 're approaching you faster than normal ( because you 're going towards them rather than away from them ) .
How to avoid this collision :
Do n't ride against traffic .
Ride with traffic , in the same direction .
Riding against traffic may seem like a good idea because you can see the cars that are passing you , but it 's not .
Here 's why : Cars which pull out of driveways , parking lots , and cross streets ( ahead of you and to the left ) , which are making a right onto your street , are n't expecting traffic to be coming at them from the wrong way .
They wo n't see you , and they 'll plow right into you .
How the heck are you going to make a right turn ?
Cars will approach you at a much higher relative speed .
If you 're going 15 mph , then a car passing you from behind doing 35 approaches you at a speed of only 20 ( 35 - 15 ) .
But if you 're on the wrong side of the road , then the car approaches you at 50 ( 35+15 ) , which is more than twice as fast !
Since they 're approaching you faster , both you and the driver have lots less time to react .
And if a collision does occur , it 's going to be at a faster relative speed .
Riding the wrong way is against the law and you can get ticketed for it .
One study showed that riding the wrong way was three times as dangerous as riding the right way , and for kids , the risk is seven times greater .
( source )
Nearly one - fourth of crashes involve cyclists riding the wrong way .
( source )
Some readers have challenged this , saying if 25 % of crashes are from going the wrong way , then riding the right way is more dangerous because it accounts for 75 % of crashes .
That idea is just wrong .
First off , only 8 % of cyclists ride the wrong way , yet nearly 25 % of them get hit -- meaning wrong - way cyclists really are three times more likely to get hit than those who ride the proper way .
Second , the problem with wrong - way biking is that it promotes crashes , while right - way biking does not .
For example , cyclists running stop signs or red lights is 17 % of their crashes .
( source )
But do we therefore conclude that not running signals causes 83 % of crashes ?!
( Hint : No. ) Collision Type # 5 : The Red Light of Death permalink
You stop to the right of a car that 's already waiting at a red light or stop sign .
They can't see you .
When the light turns green , you move forward , and then they turn right , right into you .
Even small cars can do you in this way , but this scenario is especially dangerous when it's a bus or a semi that you 're stopping next to .
An Austin cyclist was killed in 1994 when he stopped to the right of a semi , and then it turned right .
He was crushed under its wheels .
How to avoid this collision :
Do n't stop in the blind spot .
Simply stop behind a car , instead of to the right of it , as per the diagram below .
This makes you very visible to traffic on all sides .
It 's impossible for the car behind you to avoid seeing you when you 're right in front of it .
Another option is to stop at either point A in the diagram above ( where the first driver can see you ) , or at point B , behind the first car so it can't turn into you , and far enough ahead of the second car so that the second driver can see you clearly .
It does no good to avoid stopping to the right of the first car if you 're going to make the mistake of stopping to the right of the second car .
EITHER car can do you in .
If you chose spot A , then ride quickly to cross the street as soon as the light turns green .
Do n't look at the motorist to see if they want to go ahead and turn .
If you 're in spot A and they want to turn , then you 're in their way .
Why did you take spot A if you were n't eager to cross the street when you could ?
When the light turns green , just go , and go quickly .
( But make sure cars are n't running the red light on the cross street , of course . )
If you chose spot B , then when the light turns green , DON'T pass the car in front of you -- stay behind it , because it might turn right at any second .
If it does n't make a right turn right away , it may turn right into a driveway or parking lot unexpectedly at any point .
Do n't count on drivers to signal !
They do n't .
Assume that a car can turn right at any time .
( NEVER pass a car on the right ! )
But try to stay ahead of the car behind you until you 're through the intersection , because otherwise they might try to cut you off as they turn right .
While we 're not advocating running red lights , notice it is in fact safer to run the red light if there 's no cross traffic , than it is to wait legally at the red light directly to the right of a car , only to have it make a right turn right into you when the light turns green .
The moral here is not that you should break the law , but that you can easily get hurt even if you follow the law .
By the way , be very careful when passing stopped cars on the right as you approach a red light .
You run the risk of getting doored by a passenger exiting the car on the right side , or hit by a car that unexpectedly decides to pull into a parking space on the right side of the street .
Collision Type # 6 : The Right Hook permalink A car passes you and then tries to make a right turn directly in front of you , or right into you .
They think you 're not going very fast just because you 're on a bicycle , so it never occurs to them that they can't pass you in time .
Even if you have to slam on your brakes to avoid hitting them , they often wo n't feel they 've done anything wrong .
This kind of collision is very hard to avoid because you typically do n't see it until the last second , and because there 's nowhere for you to go when it happens .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Do n't ride on the sidewalk .
When you come off the sidewalk to cross the street you 're invisible to motorists .
You 're just begging to be hit if you do this .
Keith Vick was killed this way in Austin , TX in Dec. 2002 .
2 . Ride to the left .
Taking up the whole lane makes it harder for drivers to pass you to cut you off or turn into you .
Do n't feel bad about taking the lane : if motorists did n't threaten your life by turning in front of or into you or passing you too closely , then you would n't have to .
If the lane you 're in is n't wide enough for cars to pass you safely , then you should be taking the whole lane anyway .
Lane position is discussed in more detail below .
3 . Glance in your mirror before approaching an intersection .
( If you do n't have a handlebar or helmet mirror , get one now . )
Be sure to look in your mirror well before you get to the intersection .
When you 're actually going through an intersection , you 'll need to be paying very close attention to what 's in front of you .
Collision Type # 7 : The Right Hook , pt. 2 permalink
You 're passing a slow - moving car ( or even another bike ) on the right , when it unexpectedly makes a right turn right into you , trying to get to a parking lot , driveway or side street .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Do n't pass on the right .
This collision is very easy to avoid .
Just do n't pass any vehicle on the right .
If a car ahead of you is going only 10 mph , then you slow down , too , behind it .
It will eventually start moving faster .
If it does n't , pass on the left when it 's safe to do so .
When passing cyclists on the left , announce " on your left " before you start passing , so they do n't suddenly move left into you .
( Of course , they 're much less likely to suddenly move left without looking , where they could be hit by traffic , then to suddenly move right , into a destination . )
If they 're riding too far to the left for you to pass safely on the left , then announce " on your right " before passing on the right .
If several cars are stopped at a light , then you can try passing on the right cautiously .
Remember that someone can fling open the passenger door unexpectedly as they exit the car .
Also remember that if you pass on the right and traffic starts moving again unexpectedly , you may suffer # 3 , the Red Light of Death .
Note that when you 're tailing a slow - moving vehicle , ride behind it , not in its blind spot immediately to the right of it .
Even if you 're not passing a car on the right , you could still run into it if it turns right while you 're right next to it .
Give yourself enough room to brake if it turns .
2 . Look behind you before turning right .
Here 's your opportunity to avoid hitting cyclists who violate tip # 1 above and try to pass you on the right .
Look behind you before making a right - hand turn to make sure a bike is n't trying to pass you .
( Also remember that they could be coming up from behind you on the sidewalk while you 're on the street . )
Even if it 's the other cyclist 's fault for trying to pass you on the right when you make a right turn and have them slam into you , it wo n't hurt any less when they hit you .
Collision Type # 8 : The Left Cross permalink A car coming towards you makes a left turn right in front of you , or right into you .
This is similar to # 1 , above .
Austin cyclists hit this way include Dr. Lee Chilton , John Howell ( former president of the Austin Cycling Association ) , and Janne Osborne .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Do n't ride on the sidewalk .
When you come off the sidewalk to cross the street , you 're invisible to turning motorists .
2 . Get a headlight .
If you 're riding at night , you should absolutely use a front headlight .
It 's required by law in most countries , anyway .
3 . Wear something bright , even during the day .
It may seem silly , but bikes are small and easy to see through even during the day .
Yellow or orange reflective vests really make a big difference .
Reflective leg bands are also easy and inexpensive .
4 . Do n't pass on the right .
Do n't overtake slow - moving vehicles on the right .
Doing so makes you invisible to left - turning motorists at intersections .
Passing on the right means that the vehicle you 're passing could also make a right turn right into you , too .
5 . Slow down .
If you can't make eye contact with the driver ( especially at night ) , slow down so much that you 're able to completely stop if you have to .
Sure , it 's inconvenient , but it beats getting hit .
Collision Type # 9 : The Rear End permalink
You innocently move a little to the left to go around a parked car or some other obstruction in the road , and you get nailed by a car coming up from behind .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Never , ever move left without looking behind you first .
Some motorists like to pass cyclists within mere inches , so moving even a tiny bit to the left unexpectedly could put you in the path of a car .
Practice holding a straight line while looking over your shoulder until you can do it perfectly .
Most new cyclists tend to move left when they look behind them , which of course can be disastrous .
2 . Do n't swerve in and out of the parking lane if it contains any parked cars .
You might be tempted to ride in the parking lane where there are no parked cars , dipping back into the traffic lane when you encounter a parked car .
This puts you at risk for getting nailed from behind .
Instead , ride a steady , straight line in the traffic lane .
3 . Use a mirror .
If you do n't have one , get one from a bike shop or an online shop right now .
There are models that fit on your handlebars , helmet , or glasses , as you prefer .
You should always physically look back over your shoulder before moving left , but having a mirror still helps you monitor traffic without constantly having to look behind you .
4 . Signal .
Never move left without signaling .
Just put your left arm straight out .
Be sure to check your mirror or loo behind you before signaling ( since a car passing too closely can take your arm out ) .
Collision Type # 10 : The Rear End , pt. 2 permalink A car runs into you from behind .
This is what many cyclists fear the most , but it 's actually not very common , comprising only 3.8 % of collisions .
( source )
However , it 's one of the hardest collisions to avoid , since you 're not usually looking behind you .
The risk is likely greater at night , and in rides outside the city where traffic is faster and lighting is worse .
The three cyclists killed when hit from behind in Austin in 96 - 97 were all riding at night , and at least two of them did n't have lights on their bikes .
( source )
The best way to avoid getting Rear - Ended is to ride on very wide roads or in bike lanes , or on roads where the traffic moves slowly , and to use lights when biking at night .
How to avoid this collision : 1 . Get a rear light .
If you 're riding at night , you absolutely should use a flashing red rear light .
Bruce Mackey ( formerly of Florida , now head of bike safety in Nevada ) says that 60 % of bike collisions in Florida are caused by cyclists riding at night without lights .
In 1999 , 39 % of deaths on bicycles nationwide occurred between 6 p.m. and midnight .
[ USA Today , 10 - 22-01 , attributed to the Insurance Institute for highway safety ]
Bike shops have red rear blinkies for $ 15 or less .
These kind of lights typically take two AA batteries , which last for months ( something like 200 hours ) .
I can't stress this item enough :
If you ride at night , get a rear light !
2 . Wear a reflective vest or a safety triangle .
High quality reflective gear makes you a lot more visible even in the day time , not just at night .
I had a friend ride away from me while wearing one during the day , and when she was about a quarter mile away , I could n't see her or her bike at all , but the vest was clearly visible .
At night the difference is even greater .
Bike shops have vests and triangles for $ 10 to $ 15 .
Also , when you hear a motorist approaching , straightening up into a vertical position will make your reflective gear more noticeable .
3 . Choose wide streets .
Ride on streets whose outside lane is so wide that it can easily fit a car and a bike side by side .
That way a car may zoom by you and avoid hitting you , even if they did n't see you !
4 . Choose slow streets .
The slower a car is going , the more time the driver has to see you .
I navigate the city by going through neighborhoods .
Learn how to do this .
5 . Use back streets on weekends .
The risk of riding on Friday or Saturday night is much greater than riding on other nights because all the drunks are out driving around .
If you do ride on a weekend night , make sure to take neighborhood streets rather than arterials .
6 . Get a mirror .
Get a mirror and use it .
If it looks like a car does n't see you , hop off your bike and onto the sidewalk .
Mirrors cost $ 5 - 15 .
Trust me , once you 've ridden a mirror for a while , you 'll wonder how you got along without it .
My paranoia went down 80 % after I got a mirror .
If you 're not convinced , after you 've used your mirror for a month , take it off your bike and ride around and notice how you keep glancing down to where your mirror was , and notice how unsafe you feel without it .
7 . Do n't hug the curb .
This is counter - intuitive , but give yourself a little space between yourself and the curb .
That gives you some room to move into in case you see a large vehicle in your mirror approaching without moving over far enough to avoid you .
Also , when you hug the curb tightly you 're more likely to suffer a right cross from motorists who can't see you .
From HaskellWiki
Haskell I/O has always been a source of confusion and surprises for new Haskellers .
While simple I/ O code in Haskell looks very similar to its equivalents in imperative languages , attempts to write somewhat more complex code often result in a total mess .
This is because Haskell I/O is really very different internally .
Haskell is a pure language and even the I/ O system can't break this purity .
The following text is an attempt to explain the details of Haskell I/O implementations .
This explanation should help you eventually master all the smart I /O tricks .
Moreover , I 've added a detailed explanation of various traps you might encounter along the way .

If you are new to Haskell I / O you may prefer to start by reading the Introduction to IO page .
Haskell is a pure language
Haskell is a pure language , which means that the result of any function call is fully determined by its arguments .
Pseudo - functions like rand ( ) or getchar ( ) in C , which return different results on each call , are simply impossible to write in Haskell .
Moreover , Haskell functions can't have side effects , which means that they can't effect any changes to the " real world " , like changing files , writing to the screen , printing , sending data over the network , and so on .
These two restrictions together mean that any function call can be replaced by the result of a previous call with the same parameters , and the language guarantees that all these rearrangements will not change the program result !
Let 's compare this to C : optimizing C compilers try to guess which functions have no side effects and do n't depend on mutable global variables .
If this guess is wrong , an optimization can change the program 's semantics !
To avoid this kind of disaster , C optimizers are conservative in their guesses or require hints from the programmer about the purity of functions .
Compared to an optimizing C compiler , a Haskell compiler is a set of pure mathematical transformations .
This results in much better high - level optimization facilities .
Moreover , pure mathematical computations can be much more easily divided into several threads that may be executed in parallel , which is increasingly important in these days of multi-core CPUs .
Finally , pure computations are less error - prone and easier to verify , which adds to Haskell 's robustness and to the speed of program development using Haskell .
Haskell 's purity allows the compiler to call only functions whose results are really required to calculate the final value of a top - level function ( e.g. , main ) - this is called lazy evaluation .
It 's a great thing for pure mathematical computations , but how about I /O actions ?
A function like
putStrLn " Press any key to begin formatting "
ca n't return any meaningful result value , so how can we ensure that the compiler will not omit or reorder its execution ?
And in general :
How we can work with stateful algorithms and side effects in an entirely lazy language ?
This question has had many different solutions proposed while Haskell was developed ( see History of Haskell ) , though a solution based on monads is now the standard .
What is a monad ?
What is a monad ?
It 's a concept from mathematical category theory .
In order to understand how monads are used to solve the problem of I/O and side effects , you do n't need to know category theory .
It 's enough to just know elementary mathematics .
Let 's imagine that we want to implement the well - known ' getchar ' function in Haskell .
What type should it have ?
Let 's try :
getchar :: Char get2chars = [ getchar , getchar ]
What will we get with ' getchar ' having just the ' Char ' type ?
You can see all the possible problems in the definition of ' get2chars ' :
Because the Haskell compiler treats all functions as pure ( not having side effects ) , it can avoid " unnecessary " calls to ' getchar ' and use one returned value twice .
Even if it does make two calls , there is no way to determine which call should be performed first .
Do you want to return the two chars in the order in which they were read , or in the opposite order ?
Nothing in the definition of ' get2 chars ' answers this question .
How can these problems be solved , from the programmer 's perspective ?
Let 's introduce a fake parameter of ' getchar ' to make each call " different " from the compiler 's point of view :
getchar :: Int ->
Char get2chars = [ getchar 1 , getchar 2 ]
Right away , this solves the first problem mentioned above - now the compiler will make two calls because it sees that the calls have different parameters .
The whole ' get2 chars ' function should also have a fake parameter , otherwise we will have the same problem calling it :
getchar :: Int ->
Char get2chars :: Int ->
String get2chars _ = [ getchar 1 , getchar 2 ]
Now we need to give the compiler some clue to determine which function it should call first .
The Haskell language does n't provide any way to express order of evaluation — except for data dependencies !
How about adding an artificial data dependency which prevents evaluation of the second ' getchar ' before the first one ?
In order to achieve this , we will return an additional fake result from ' getchar ' that will be used as a parameter for the next ' getchar ' call :
getchar :: Int -> ( Char , Int ) get2 chars _ = [ a , b ] where ( a , i ) = getchar 1 ( b , _ ) = getchar i
So far so good — now we can guarantee that ' a ' is read before ' b ' because reading ' b ' needs the value ( ' i ' ) that is returned by reading ' a ' !
We 've added a fake parameter to ' get2 chars ' but the problem is that the Haskell compiler is too smart !
It can believe that the external ' getchar ' function is really dependent on its parameter but for ' get2 chars ' it will see that we 're just cheating because we throw it away !
Therefore it wo n't feel obliged to execute the calls in the order we want .
How can we fix this ?
How about passing this fake parameter to the ' getchar ' function ?
In this case the compiler can't guess that it is really unused .
get2 chars i0 = [ a , b ] where ( a , i1 ) = getchar i0 ( b , i2 ) = getchar i1
Furthermore , ' get2 chars ' has the same purity problems as the ' getchar ' function .
If you need to call it two times , you need a way to describe the order of these calls .
Consider this :
get4chars = [ get2chars 1 , get2chars 2 ] -- order of ' get2 chars ' calls is n't defined
We already know how to deal with these problems : ' get2 chars ' should also return some fake value that can be used to order calls :
get2chars :: Int -> ( String , Int ) get4chars i0 = ( a ++ b ) where ( a , i1 ) = get2chars i0 ( b , i2 ) = get2chars i1
But what should the fake return value of ' get2 chars ' be ?
If we use some integer constant , the excessively smart Haskell compiler will guess that we 're cheating again .
What about returning the value returned by ' getchar ' ?
See :
get2chars :: Int -> ( String , Int ) get2 chars i0 = ( [ a , b ] , i2 ) where ( a , i1 ) = getchar i0 ( b , i2 ) = getchar i1
Believe it or not , but we 've just constructed the whole " monadic " Haskell I /O system .
Welcome to the RealWorld , baby
Warning :
The following story about IO is incorrect in that it cannot actually explain some important aspects of IO ( including interaction and concurrency ) .
However , some people find it useful to begin developing an understanding .
The ' main '
Haskell function has the type :
main :: RealWorld -> ( ( ) , RealWorld )
where ' RealWorld ' is a fake type used instead of our Int .
It 's something like the baton passed in a relay race .
When ' main ' calls some IO function , it passes the " RealWorld " it received as a parameter .
All IO functions have similar types involving RealWorld as a parameter and result .
To be exact , " IO " is a type synonym defined in the following way :
type IO a = RealWorld -> ( a , RealWorld )
So , ' main ' just has type " IO ( ) " , ' getChar ' has type " IO Char " and so on .
You can think of the type " IO Char " as meaning " take the current RealWorld , do something to it , and return a Char and a ( possibly changed ) RealWorld " .
Let 's look at ' main ' calling ' getChar ' two times :
getChar :: RealWorld -> ( Char , RealWorld ) main :: RealWorld -> ( ( ) , RealWorld ) main world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = getChar world0 ( b , world2 ) = getChar world1 in ( ( ) , world2 )
Look at this closely : ' main ' passes the " world " it received to the first ' getChar ' .
This ' getChar ' returns some new value of type RealWorld that gets used in the next call .
Finally , ' main ' returns the " world " it got from the second ' getChar ' .
Is it possible here to omit any call of ' getChar ' if the Char it read is not used ?
No , because we need to return the " world " that is the result of the second ' getChar ' and this in turn requires the " world " returned from the first ' getChar ' .
Is it possible to reorder the ' getChar ' calls ?
No : the second ' getChar ' can't be called before the first one because it uses the " world " returned from the first call .
Is it possible to duplicate calls ?
In Haskell semantics - yes , but real compilers never duplicate work in such simple cases ( otherwise , the programs generated will not have any speed guarantees ) .
As we already said , RealWorld values are used like a baton which gets passed between all routines called by ' main ' in strict order .
Inside each routine called , RealWorld values are used in the same way .
Overall , in order to " compute " the world to be returned from ' main ' , we should perform each IO procedure that is called from ' main ' , directly or indirectly .
This means that each procedure inserted in the chain will be performed just at the moment ( relative to the other IO actions ) when we intended it to be called .
Let 's consider the following program :
main = do a <- ask " What is your name ? " b <- ask " How old are you ? " return ( ) ask s = do putStr s readLn
Now you have enough knowledge to rewrite it in a low - level way and check that each operation that should be performed will really be performed with the arguments it should have and in the order we expect .
But what about conditional execution ?
No problem .
Let 's define the well - known ' when ' operation :
when :: Bool -> IO ( ) -> IO ( ) when condition action world = if condition then action world else ( ( ) , world )
As you can see , we can easily include or exclude from the execution chain IO procedures ( actions ) depending on the data values .
If ' condition ' will be False on the call of ' when ' , ' action ' will never be called because real Haskell compilers , again , never call functions whose results are not required to calculate the final result ( i.e. , here , the final " world " value of ' main ' ) .
Loops and more complex control structures can be implemented in the same way .
Try it as an exercise !
Finally , you may want to know how much passing these RealWorld values around the program costs .
It 's free !
These fake values exist solely for the compiler while it analyzes and optimizes the code , but when it gets to assembly code generation , it " suddenly " realize that this type is like " ( ) " , so all these parameters and result values can be omitted from the final generated code .
Is n't it beautiful ?
' >>=' and ' do ' notation
All beginners ( including me ) start by thinking that ' do ' is some magic statement that executes IO actions .
That 's wrong - ' do ' is just syntactic sugar that simplifies the writing of procedures that use IO ( and also other monads , but that 's beyond the scope of this tutorial ) .
' do ' notation eventually gets translated to statements passing " world " values around like we 've manually written above and is used to simplify the gluing of several IO actions together .
You do n't need to use ' do ' for just one statement ; for instance ,
main = do putStr " Hello ! "
is desugared to :
main = putStr " Hello ! "
Let 's examine how to desugar a ' do ' with multiple statements in the following example :
main = do putStr " What is your name ? " putStr " How old are you ? " putStr " Nice day ! "
The ' do ' statement here just joins several IO actions that should be performed sequentially .
It 's translated to sequential applications of one of the so - called " binding operators " , namely '>>':
main = ( putStr " What is your name ? " ) >> ( ( putStr " How old are you ? " ) >> ( putStr " Nice day ! " ) )
This binding operator just combines two IO actions , executing them sequentially by passing the " world " between them :
( >> ) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b ( action1 >> action2 ) world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = action1 world0 ( b , world2 ) = action2 world1 in ( b , world2 )
If defining operators this way looks strange to you , read this definition as follows :
action1 >> action2 = action where action world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = action1 world0 ( b , world2 ) = action2 world1 in ( b , world2 )
Now you can substitute the definition of '>>' at the places of its usage and check that program constructed by the ' do ' desugaring is actually the same as we could write by manually manipulating " world " values .
A more complex example involves the binding of variables using " <- " :
main = do a <- readLn print a
This code is desugared into :
main = readLn >>= ( \ a -> print a )
As you should remember , the ' >>' binding operator silently ignores the value of its first action and returns as an overall result the result of its second action only .
On the other hand , the ' >>= ' binding operator ( note the extra ' = ' at the end ) allows us to use the result of its first action - it gets passed as an additional parameter to the second one !
Look at the definition :
( >>= ) :: IO a -> ( a -> IO b ) ->
IO b ( action1 >>= action2 ) world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = action1 world0 ( b , world2 ) = action2 a world1 in ( b , world2 )
First , what does the type of the second " action " ( more precisely , a function which returns an IO action ) , namely " a -> IO b " , mean ?
By substituting the " IO " definition , we get " a -> RealWorld -> ( b , RealWorld ) " .
This means that second action actually has two parameters - the type ' a ' actually used inside it , and the value of type RealWorld used for sequencing of IO actions .
That 's always the case - any IO procedure has one more parameter compared to what you see in its type signature .
This parameter is hidden inside the definition of the type alias " IO " .
Second , you can use these '>>' and '>>=' operations to simplify your program .
For example , in the code above we do n't need to introduce the variable , because the result of ' readLn ' can be send directly to ' print ' :
main = readLn >>= print
And third - as you see , the notation :
do x <- action1 action2
where ' action1 ' has type " IO a " and ' action2 ' has type " IO b " , translates into :
action1 >>= ( \ x -> action2 )
where the second argument of '>>=' has the type " a -> IO b " .
It 's the way the ' < -' binding is processed - the name on the left - hand side of '< -' just becomes a parameter of subsequent operations represented as one large IO action .
Note also that if ' action1 ' has type " IO a " then ' x ' will just have type " a " ; you can think of the effect of ' < -' as " unpacking " the IO value of ' action1 ' into ' x ' .
Note also that '< -' is not a true operator ; it 's pure syntax , just like ' do ' itself .
Its meaning results only from the way it gets desugared .
Look at the next example :
main = do putStr " What is your name ? " a <- readLn putStr " How old are you ? " b <- readLn print ( a , b )
This code is desugared into :
main = putStr " What is your name ? " >> readLn >>= \ a -> putStr " How old are you ? " >> readLn >>= \ b -> print ( a , b )
I omitted the parentheses here ; both the ' >>' and the ' >>= ' operators are left - associative , but lambda - bindings always stretches as far to the right as possible , which means that the ' a ' and ' b ' bindings introduced here are valid for all remaining actions .
As an exercise , add the parentheses yourself and translate this procedure into the low - level code that explicitly passes " world " values .
I think it should be enough to help you finally realize how the ' do ' translation and binding operators work .
Oh , no !
I forgot the third monadic operator - ' return ' .
It just combines its two parameters - the value passed and " world " :
return :: a ->
IO a return a world0 = ( a , world0 )
How about translating a simple example of ' return ' usage ?
Say ,
main = do a <- readLn return ( a * 2 )
Programmers with an imperative language background often think that ' return ' in Haskell , as in other languages , immediately returns from the IO procedure .
As you can see in its definition ( and even just from its type ! ) , such an assumption is totally wrong .
The only purpose of using ' return ' is to " lift " some value ( of type ' a ' ) into the result of a whole action ( of type " IO a " ) and therefore it should generally be used only as the last executed statement of some IO sequence .
For example try to translate the following procedure into the corresponding low - level code :
main = do a <- readLn when ( a >= 0 ) $ do return ( ) print " a is negative "
and you will realize that the ' print ' statement is executed even for non-negative values of ' a ' .
If you need to escape from the middle of an IO procedure , you can use the ' if ' statement :
main = do a <- readLn if ( a >= 0 ) then return ( ) else print " a is negative "
Moreover , Haskell layout rules allow us to use the following layout :
main = do a <- readLn if ( a >= 0 ) then return ( ) else do print " a is negative " ...
that may be useful for escaping from the middle of a longish ' do ' statement .
Last exercise : implement a function ' liftM ' that lifts operations on plain values to the operations on monadic ones .
Its type signature :
liftM :: ( a -> b ) -> ( IO a -> IO b )
If that 's too hard for you , start with the following high - level definition and rewrite it in low - level fashion :
liftM f action = do x <- action return ( f x )
Mutable data ( references , arrays , hash tables ... )
As you should know , every name in Haskell is bound to one fixed ( immutable ) value .
This greatly simplifies understanding algorithms and code optimization , but it 's inappropriate in some cases .
As we all know , there are plenty of algorithms that are simpler to implement in terms of updatable variables , arrays and so on .
This means that the value associated with a variable , for example , can be different at different execution points , so reading its value can't be considered as a pure function .
Imagine , for example , the following code :
main = do let a0 = readVariable varA _ = writeVariable varA 1 a1 = readVariable varA print ( a0 , a 1 )
Does this look strange ?
First , the two calls to ' readVariable ' look the same , so the compiler can just reuse the value returned by the first call .
Second , the result of the ' writeVariable ' call is n't used so the compiler can ( and will ! ) omit this call completely .
To complete the picture , these three calls may be rearranged in any order because they appear to be independent of each other .
This is obviously not what was intended .
What 's the solution ?
You already know this - use IO actions !
Using IO actions guarantees that :
the execution order will be retained as written each action will have to be executed the result of the " same " action ( such as " readVariable varA " ) will not be reused
So , the code above really should be written as :
import Data .IORef main = do varA <- newIORef 0 -- Create and initialize a new variable a0 <- readIORef varA writeIORef varA 1 a1 <- readIORef varA print ( a0 , a 1 )
Here , ' varA ' has the type " IORef Int " which means " a variable ( reference ) in the IO monad holding a value of type Int " .
newIORef creates a new variable ( reference ) and returns it , and then read / write actions use this reference .
The value returned by the " readIORef varA " action depends not only on the variable involved but also on the moment this operation is performed so it can return different values on each call .
Arrays , hash tables and any other _mutable_ data structures are defined in the same way - for each of them , there 's an operation that creates new " mutable values " and returns a reference to it .
Then special read and write operations in the IO monad are used .
The following code shows an example using mutable arrays :
import Data .
Array .IO main = do arr <- newArray ( 1 , 10 ) 37 :: IO ( IOArray Int Int ) a <- readArray arr 1 writeArray arr 1 64 b <- readArray arr 1 print ( a , b )
Here , an array of 10 elements with 37 as the initial value at each location is created .
After reading the value of the first element ( index 1 ) into ' a ' this element 's value is changed to 64 and then read again into ' b ' .
As you can see by executing this code , ' a ' will be set to 37 and ' b ' to 64 .
Other state - dependent operations are also often implemented as IO actions .
For example , a random number generator should return a different value on each call .
It looks natural to give it a type involving IO :
rand :: IO Int
Moreover , when you import C routines you should be careful - if this routine is impure , i.e. its result depends on something in the " real world " ( file system , memory contents ... ) , internal state and so on , you should give it an IO type .
Otherwise , the compiler can " optimize " repetitive calls of this procedure with the same parameters !
For example , we can write a non -IO type for :
foreign import ccall sin :: Double ->
Double
because the result of ' sin ' depends only on its argument , but
foreign import ccall tell :: Int ->
IO Int
If you will declare ' tell ' as a pure function ( without IO ) then you may get the same position on each call !
IO actions as values
By this point you should understand why it 's impossible to use IO actions inside non-IO ( pure ) procedures .
Such procedures just do n't get a " baton " ; they do n't know any " world " value to pass to an IO action .
The RealWorld type is an abstract datatype , so pure functions also can't construct RealWorld values by themselves , and it's a strict type , so ' undefined ' also can't be used .
So , the prohibition of using IO actions inside pure procedures is just a type system trick ( as it usually is in Haskell ) .
But while pure code can't _execute_ IO actions , it can work with them as with any other functional values - they can be stored in data structures , passed as parameters , returned as results , collected in lists , and partially applied .
But an IO action will remain a functional value because we can't apply it to the last argument - of type RealWorld .
In order to _execute_ the IO action we need to apply it to some RealWorld value .
That can be done only inside some IO procedure , in its " actions chain " .
And real execution of this action will take place only when this procedure is called as part of the process of " calculating the final value of world " for ' main ' .
Look at this example :
main world0 = let get2chars = getChar >> getChar ( ( ) , world1 ) = putStr " Press two keys " world0 ( answer , world2 ) = get2chars world1 in ( ( ) , world2 )
Here we first bind a value to ' get2 chars ' and then write a binding involving ' putStr ' .
But what 's the execution order ?
It 's not defined by the order of the ' let ' bindings , it 's defined by the order of processing " world " values !
You can arbitrarily reorder the binding statements - the execution order will be defined by the data dependency with respect to the " world " values that get passed around .
Let 's see what this ' main ' looks like in the ' do ' notation :
main = do let get2chars = getChar >> get Char putStr " Press two keys " get2 chars return ()
As you can see , we 've eliminated two of the ' let ' bindings and left only the one defining ' get2 chars ' .
The non -' let ' statements are executed in the exact order in which they 're written , because they pass the " world " value from statement to statement as we described above .
Thus , this version of the function is much easier to understand because we do n't have to mentally figure out the data dependency of the " world " value .
Moreover , IO actions like ' get2 chars ' can't be executed directly because they are functions with a RealWorld parameter .
To execute them , we need to supply the RealWorld parameter , i.e. insert them in the ' main ' chain , placing them in some ' do ' sequence executed from ' main ' ( either directly in the ' main ' function , or indirectly in an IO function called from ' main ' ) .
Until that 's done , they will remain like any function , in partially evaluated form .
And we can work with IO actions as with any other functions - bind them to names ( as we did above ) , save them in data structures , pass them as function parameters and return them as results - and they wo n't be performed until you give them the magic RealWorld parameter !
Example : a list of IO actions
Let 's try defining a list of IO actions :
ioActions :: [ IO ( ) ] ioActions = [ ( print " Hello ! " ) , ( putStr " just kidding " ) , ( getChar >> return ( ) ) ]
I used additional parentheses around each action , although they are n't really required .
If you still can't believe that these actions wo n't be executed immediately , just recall the real type of this list :
ioActions :: [ RealWorld -> ( ( ) , RealWorld ) ]
Well , now we want to execute some of these actions .
No problem , just insert them into the ' main ' chain :
main = do head ioActions ioActions !!
1 last ioActions
Looks strange , right ?
Really , any IO action that you write in a ' do ' statement ( or use as a parameter for the '>>'/'>>=' operators ) is an expression returning a result of type ' IO a ' for some type ' a ' .
Typically , you use some function that has the type 'x -> y -> ... -> IO a' and provide all the x , y , etc. parameters .
But you 're not limited to this standard scenario - do n't forget that Haskell is a functional language and you 're free to compute the functional value required ( recall that " IO a " is really a function type ) in any possible way .
Here we just extracted several functions from the list - no problem .
This functional value can also be constructed on - the - fly , as we 've done in the previous example - that 's also OK .
Want to see this functional value passed as a parameter ?
Just look at the definition of ' when ' .
Hey , we can buy , sell , and rent these IO actions just like we can with any other functional values !
For example , let 's define a function that executes all the IO actions in the list :
sequence_ :: [ IO a ] -> IO ( ) sequence_ [ ] = return ( ) sequence_ ( x : xs ) = do x sequence_
xs
No black magic - we just extract IO actions from the list and insert them into a chain of IO operations that should be performed one after another ( in the same order that they occurred in the list ) to " compute the final world value " of the entire ' sequence_ ' call .
With the help of ' sequence_ ' , we can rewrite our last ' main ' function as :
main = sequence_ ioActions
Haskell 's ability to work with IO actions as with any other ( functional and non-functional ) values allows us to define control structures of arbitrary complexity .
Try , for example , to define a control structure that repeats an action until it returns the ' False ' result :
while :: IO Bool -> IO ( ) while action = ???
Most programming languages do n't allow you to define control structures at all , and those that do often require you to use a macro- expansion system .
In Haskell , control structures are just trivial functions anyone can write .
Example : returning an IO action as a result
How about returning an IO action as the result of a function ?
Well , we 've done this each time we 've defined an IO procedure - they all return IO actions that need a RealWorld value to be performed .
While we usually just execute them as part of a higher - level IO procedure , it 's also possible to just collect them without actual execution :
main = do let a = sequence ioActions b = when True getChar c = getChar >> get Char putStr
" These ' let ' statements are not executed ! "
These assigned IO procedures can be used as parameters to other procedures , or written to global variables , or processed in some other way , or just executed later , as we did in the example with ' get2 chars ' .
But how about returning a parameterized IO action from an IO procedure ?
Let 's define a procedure that returns the i'th byte from a file represented as a Handle :
readi h i = do hSeek h AbsoluteSeek i hGetChar h
So far so good .
But how about a procedure that returns the i'th byte of a file with a given name without reopening it each time ?
readfilei :: String -> IO ( Integer -> IO Char ) readfilei name = do h <- open
File name ReadMode return ( readi h )
As you can see , it 's an IO procedure that opens a file and returns ... another IO procedure that will read the specified byte .
But we can go further and include the ' readi ' body in ' readfilei ' :
readfilei name = do h <- open
File name ReadMode let readi h i = do hSeek h AbsoluteSeek i hGetChar h return ( readi h )
That 's a little better .
But why do we add ' h ' as a parameter to ' readi ' if it can be obtained from the environment where ' readi ' is now defined ?
An even shorter version is this :
readfilei name = do h <- open
File name ReadMode let readi i = do hSeek h AbsoluteSeek i hGetChar h return readi
What have we done here ?
We 've build a parameterized IO action involving local names inside ' readfilei ' and returned it as the result .
Now it can be used in the following way :
main = do myfile <- readfilei " test " a <- myfile 0 b <- myfile 1 print ( a , b )
This way of using IO actions is very typical for Haskell programs - you just construct one or more IO actions that you need , with or without parameters , possibly involving the parameters that your " constructor " received , and return them to the caller .
Then these IO actions can be used in the rest of the program without any knowledge about your internal implementation strategy .
One thing this can be used for is to partially emulate the OOP ( or more precisely , the ADT ) programming paradigm .
Example : a memory allocator generator
As an example , one of my programs has a module which is a memory suballocator .
It receives the address and size of a large memory block and returns two procedures - one to allocate a subblock of a given size and the other to free the allocated subblock :
memoryAllocator :: Ptr a ->
Int -> IO ( Int -> IO ( Ptr b ) , Ptr c -> IO ( ) ) memory Allocator buf size = do ...... let alloc size = do ... ... free ptr = do ... ... return ( alloc , free )
How this is implemented ?
' alloc ' and ' free ' work with references created inside the memory Allocator procedure .
Because the creation of these references is a part of the memory Allocator IO actions chain , a new independent set of references will be created for each memory block for which memory Allocator is called :
memoryAllocator buf size = do start <- newIORef buf end <- newIORef ( buf ` plusPtr ` size ) ...
These two references are read and written in the ' alloc ' and ' free ' definitions ( we 'll implement a very simple memory allocator for this example ) :
... let alloc size = do addr <- readIORef start writeIORef start ( addr ` plusPtr ` size ) return addr let free ptr = do writeIORef start ptr
What we 've defined here is just a pair of closures that use state available at the moment of their definition .
As you can see , it 's as easy as in any other functional language , despite Haskell 's lack of direct support for impure functions .
The following example uses procedures , returned by memory Allocator , to simultaneously allocate / free blocks in two independent memory buffers :
main = do buf1 <- mallocBytes ( 2 ^ 16 ) buf2 <- mallocBytes ( 2 ^ 20 ) ( alloc1 , free1 ) <- memoryAllocator buf1 ( 2 ^ 16 ) ( alloc2 , free2 ) <- memoryAllocator buf2 ( 2 ^ 20 ) ptr11 <- alloc1 100 ptr21 <- alloc2 1000 free1 ptr11 free2 ptr21 ptr12 <- alloc1 100 ptr22 <- alloc2 1000
Example : emulating OOP with record types
Let 's implement the classical OOP example : drawing figures .
There are figures of different types : circles , rectangles and so on .
The task is to create a heterogeneous list of figures .
All figures in this list should support the same set of operations : draw , move and so on .
We will represent these operations as IO procedures .
Instead of a " class " let 's define a structure containing implementations of all the procedures required :
data Figure = Figure { draw :: IO ( ) , move :: Displacement -> IO ( ) } type Displacement = ( Int , Int ) -- horizontal and vertical displacement in points
The constructor of each figure 's type should just return a Figure record :
circle :: Point -> Radius -> IO Figure rectangle :: Point -> Point -> IO Figure type Point = ( Int , Int ) -- point coordinates type Radius =
Int -- circle radius in points
We will " draw " figures by just printing their current parameters .
Let 's start with a simplified implementation of the ' circle ' and ' rectangle ' constructors , without actual ' move ' support :
circle center radius = do let description = " Circle at " ++ show center ++ " with radius " ++ show radius return $ Figure { draw = putStrLn description } rectangle from to = do let description = " Rectangle " ++ show from ++ " - " ++ show to ) return $ Figure { draw = putStrLn description }
As you see , each constructor just returns a fixed ' draw ' procedure that prints parameters with which the concrete figure was created .
Let 's test it :
drawAll :: [ Figure ] -> IO ( ) drawAll figures = do putStrLn " Drawing figures : " mapM_ draw figures main = do figures <- sequence [ circle ( 10 , 10 ) 5 , circle ( 20 , 20 ) 3 , rectangle ( 10 , 10 ) ( 20 , 20 ) , rectangle ( 15 , 15 ) ( 40 , 40 ) ] drawAll figures
Now let 's define " full - featured " figures that can actually be moved around .
In order to achieve this , we should provide each figure with a mutable variable that holds each figure 's current screen location .
The type of this variable will be " IORef Point " .
This variable should be created in the figure constructor and manipulated in IO procedures ( closures ) enclosed in the Figure record :
circle center radius = do centerVar <- newIORef center let drawF = do center <- readIORef centerVar putStrLn ( " Circle at " ++ show center ++ " with radius " ++ show radius ) let moveF ( addX , addY ) = do ( x , y ) <- readIORef centerVar writeIORef centerVar ( x + addX , y + addY ) return $ Figure { draw = drawF , move = moveF } rectangle from to = do fromVar <- newIORef from toVar <- newIORef to let drawF = do from <- readIORef fromVar to <- readIORef toVar putStrLn ( " Rectangle " ++ show from ++ " - " ++ show to ) let moveF ( addX , addY ) = do ( fromX , fromY ) <- readIORef fromVar ( toX , toY ) <- readIORef toVar writeIORef fromVar ( fromX + addX , fromY + addY ) writeIORef toVar ( toX + addX , toY + addY ) return $ Figure { draw = drawF , move = moveF }
Now we can test the code which moves figures around :
main = do figures <- sequence [ circle ( 10 , 10 ) 5 , rectangle ( 10 , 10 ) ( 20 , 20 ) ] drawAll figures mapM_ ( \ fig -> move fig ( 10 , 10 ) ) figures drawAll figures
It 's important to realize that we are not limited to including only IO actions in a record that 's intended to simulate a C++/ Java - style interface .
The record can also include values , IORefs , pure functions - in short , any type of data .
For example , we can easily add to the Figure interface fields for area and origin :
data Figure = Figure { draw :: IO ( ) , move :: Displacement -> IO ( ) , area :: Double , origin :: IORef Point }
Exception handling ( under development )
Although Haskell provides a set of exception raising / handling features comparable to those in popular OOP languages ( C++ , Java , C# ) , this part of the language receives much less attention .
This is for two reasons .
First , you just do n't need to worry as much about them - most of the time it just works " behind the scenes " .
The second reason is that Haskell , lacking OOP inheritance , does n't allow the programmer to easily subclass exception types , therefore limiting flexibility of exception handling .
The Haskell RTS raises more exceptions than traditional languages - pattern match failures , calls with invalid arguments ( such as head [ ] ) and computations whose results depend on special values undefined and error " .... " all raise their own exceptions :
example 1 :
main = print ( f 2 ) f 0 = " zero " f 1 = " one "
example 2 :
main = print ( head [ ] )
example 3 :
main = print ( 1 + ( error " Value that was n't initialized or cannot be computed " ) )
This allows to write programs in much more error - prone way .
Interfacing with C/C++ and foreign libraries ( under development )
While Haskell is great at algorithm development , speed is n't its best side .
We can combine the best of both worlds , though , by writing speed - critical parts of program in C and rest in Haskell .
We just need a way to call C functions from Haskell and vice versa , and to marshal data between two worlds .
We also need to interact with C world for using Windows / Linux APIs , linking to various libraries and DLLs .
Even interfacing with other languages requires to go through C world as " common denominator " .
Chapter 8 of the Haskell 2010 report provides a complete description of interfacing with C .
We will learn FFI via a series of examples .
These examples include C/C++ code , so they need C/C++ compilers to be installed , the same will be true if you need to include code written in C / C++ in your program ( C/C++ compilers are not required when you just need to link with existing libraries providing APIs with C calling convention ) .
On Unix ( and Mac OS ? ) systems , the system - wide default C/C++ compiler is typically used by GHC installation .
On Windows , no default compilers exist , so GHC is typically shipped with a C compiler , and you may find on the download page a GHC distribution bundled with C and C++ compilers .
Alternatively , you may find and install a GCC / MinGW version compatible with your GHC installation .
If you need to make your C/C++ code as fast as possible , you may compile your code by Intel compilers instead of GCC .
However , these compilers are not free , moreover on Windows , code compiled by Intel compilers may not interact correctly with GHC - compiled code , unless one of them is put into DLLs ( due to object file incompatibility ) .

Calling functions
First , we will learn how to call C functions from Haskell and Haskell functions from C .
The first example consists of three files :
main.hs :
{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-} main = do print " Hello from main " c_function haskell_function = print " Hello from haskell_function " foreign import ccall safe " prototypes.h " c_function :: IO ( ) foreign export ccall haskell_function :: IO ()
evil.c :
# include < stdio . h > # include " prototypes.h " void c_function ( void ) { printf ( " Hello from c_function
" ) ; haskell_function () ; }
prototypes.h :
extern void c_function ( void ) ; extern void haskell_function ( void ) ;
It may be compiled and linked in one step by ghc :
ghc -- make main.hs evil.c
Or , you may compile C module (s ) separately and link in .o files ( this may be preferable if you use make and do n't want to recompile unchanged sources ; ghc 's -- make option provides smart recompilation only for .hs files ) :
ghc -c evil .c ghc -- make main.hs evil .o
You may use gcc / g++ directly to compile your C/C++ files but I recommend to do linking via ghc because it adds a lot of libraries required for execution of Haskell code .
For the same reason , even if your main routine is written in C/C++ , I recommend calling it from the Haskell function main - otherwise you 'll have to explicitly init / shutdown the GHC RTS ( run- time system ) .
We use the " foreign import " specification to import foreign routines into our Haskell world , and " foreign export " to export Haskell routines into the external world .
Note that the import statement creates a new Haskell symbol ( from the external one ) , while the export statement uses a Haskell symbol previously defined .
Technically speaking , both types of statements create a wrapper that converts the names and calling conventions from C to Haskell or vice versa .
All about the " foreign " statement
The " ccall " specifier in foreign statements means the use of C ( not C++ ! ) calling convention .
This means that if you want to write the external function in C++ ( instead of C ) you should add export " C " specification to its declaration - otherwise you 'll get linking errors .
Let 's rewrite our first example to use C++ instead of C :
prototypes.h :
# ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { # endif extern void c_function ( void ) ; extern void haskell_function ( void ) ; # ifdef __cplusplus } # endif
Compile it via :
ghc -- make main.hs evil.cpp
where evil.cpp is just a renamed copy of evil .c from the first example .
Note that the new prototypes.h is written to allow compiling it both as C and C++ code .
When it 's included from evil.cpp , it 's compiled as C++ code .
When GHC compiles main.hs via the C compiler ( enabled by - fvia - C option ) , it also includes prototypes.h but compiles it in C mode .
It 's why you need to specify .h files in " foreign " declarations - depending on which Haskell compiler you use , these files may be included to check consistency of C and Haskell declarations .
The quoted part of the foreign statement may also be used to import or export a function under another name -- for example ,
foreign import ccall safe " prototypes.h CFunction " c_function :: IO ( ) foreign export ccall " HaskellFunction " haskell_function :: IO ()
specifies that the C function called CFunction will become known as the Haskell function c_function , while the Haskell function haskell_function will be known in the C world as HaskellFunction .
It 's required when the C name does n't conform to Haskell naming requirements .
Although the Haskell FFI standard tells about many other calling conventions in addition to ccall ( e.g. cplusplus , jvm , net ) current Haskell implementations support only ccall and stdcall .
The latter , also called the " Pascal " calling convention , is used to interface with WinAPI :
foreign import stdcall unsafe " windows.h SetFileApisToOEM " setFileApisToOEM :: IO ()
And finally , about the safe / unsafe specifier : a C function imported with the " unsafe " keyword is called directly and the Haskell runtime is stopped while the C function is executed ( when there are several OS threads executing the Haskell program , only the current OS thread is delayed ) .
This call does n't allow recursively entering into the Haskell world by calling any Haskell function - the Haskell RTS is just not prepared for such an event .
However , unsafe calls are as quick as calls in C world .
It 's ideal for " momentary " calls that quickly return back to the caller .
When " safe " is specified , the C function is called in safe environment - the Haskell execution context is saved , so it 's possible to call back to Haskell and , if the C call takes a long time , another OS thread may be started to execute Haskell code ( of course , in threads other than the one that called the C code ) .
This has its own price , though - around 1000 CPU ticks per call .
You can read more about interaction between FFI calls and Haskell concurrency in [ 7 ] .
Marshalling simple types
Calling by itself is relatively easy ; the real problem of interfacing languages with different data models is passing data between them .
In this case , there is no guarantee that Haskell 's Int is represented in memory the same way as C's int , nor Haskell 's Double the same as C's double and so on .
While on * some * platforms they are the same and you can write throw - away programs relying on these , the goal of portability requires you to declare imported and exported functions using special types described in the FFI standard , which are guaranteed to correspond to C types .
These are :
import Foreign .
C.Types ( -- equivalent to the following C type : CChar , CUChar , -- char / unsigned char CShort , CUShort , -- short / unsigned short CInt , CUInt , CLong , CULong , -- int/unsigned / long / unsigned long CFloat , CDouble ... ) -- float / double
Now we can import and export typeful C / Haskell functions :
foreign import ccall unsafe " math.h " c_sin :: CDouble -> CDouble
Note that pure C functions ( those whose results depend only on their arguments ) are imported without IO in their return type .
The " const " specifier in C is not reflected in Haskell types , so appropriate compiler checks are not performed .
All these numeric types are instances of the same classes as their Haskell cousins ( Ord , Num , Show and so on ) , so you may perform calculations on these data directly .
Alternatively , you may convert them to native Haskell types .
It 's very typical to write simple wrappers around imported and exported functions just to provide interfaces having native Haskell types :
-- | Type - conversion wrapper around c_sin sin :: Double ->
Double sin = fromRational .
c_sin .
toRational
Memory management
Marshalling strings
import Foreign .
C.String ( -- representation of strings in C CString , -- = Ptr CChar CStringLen ) -- = ( Ptr CChar , Int )
foreign import ccall unsafe " string.h " c_strlen :: CString -> IO CSize -- CSize defined in Foreign .
C.Types and is equal to size_t
-- | Type - conversion wrapper around c_strlen strlen :: String ->
Int strlen = ....
Marshalling composite types
A C array may be manipulated in Haskell as StorableArray .
There is no built - in support for marshalling C structures and using C constants in Haskell .
These are implemented in c2hs preprocessor , though .
Binary marshalling ( serializing ) of data structures of any complexity is implemented in library Binary .
Dynamic calls
DLLs
because i do n't have experience of using DLLs , can someone write into this section ?
ultimately , we need to consider the following tasks :
using DLLs of 3rd- party libraries ( such as ziplib )
putting your own C code into a DLL to use in Haskell
putting Haskell code into a DLL which may be called from C code
Dark side of IO monad
unsafePerformIO
Programmers coming from an imperative language background often look for a way to execute IO actions inside a pure procedure .
But what does this mean ?
Imagine that you 're trying to write a procedure that reads the contents of a file with a given name , and you try to write it as a pure ( non - IO ) function :
readContents :: Filename ->
String
Defining readContents as a pure function will certainly simplify the code that uses it .
But it will also create problems for the compiler :
This call is not inserted in a sequence of " world transformations " , so the compiler does n't know at what exact moment you want to execute this action .
For example , if the file has one kind of contents at the beginning of the program and another at the end - which contents do you want to see ?
You have no idea when ( or even if ) this function is going to get invoked , because Haskell sees this function as pure and feels free to reorder the execution of any or all pure functions as needed .
Attempts to read the contents of files with the same name can be factored ( i.e. reduced to a single call ) despite the fact that the file ( or the current directory ) can be changed between calls .
Again , Haskell considers all non-IO functions to be pure and feels free to omit multiple calls with the same parameters .
So , implementing pure functions that interact with the Real World is considered to be Bad Behavior .
Good boys and girls never do it ;)
Nevertheless , there are ( semi- official ) ways to use IO actions inside of pure functions .
As you should remember this is prohibited by requiring the RealWorld " baton " in order to call an IO action .
Pure functions do n't have the baton , but there is a special " magic " procedure that produces this baton from nowhere , uses it to call an IO action and then throws the resulting " world " away !
It 's a little low - level magic .
This very special ( and dangerous ) procedure is :
unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
Let 's look at its ( possible ) definition :
unsafePerformIO :: ( RealWorld -> ( a , RealWorld ) ) -> a unsafePerformIO action = let ( a , world1 ) = action createNewWorld in a
where ' createNewWorld ' is an internal function producing a new value of the RealWorld type .
Using unsafePerformIO , you can easily write pure functions that do I /O inside .
But do n't do this without a real need , and remember to follow this rule : the compiler does n't know that you are cheating ; it still considers each non-IO function to be a pure one .
Therefore , all the usual optimization rules can ( and will ! ) be applied to its execution .
So you must ensure that :
The result of each call depends only on its arguments .
You do n't rely on side - effects of this function , which may be not executed if its results are not needed .
Let 's investigate this problem more deeply .
Function evaluation in Haskell is determined by a value 's necessity - the language computes only the values that are really required to calculate the final result .
But what does this mean with respect to the ' main ' function ?
To " calculate the final world 's " value , you need to perform all the intermediate IO actions that are included in the ' main ' chain .
By using ' unsafePerformIO ' we call IO actions outside of this chain .
What guarantee do we have that they will be run at all ?
None .
The only time they will be run is if running them is required to compute the overall function result ( which in turn should be required to perform some action in the ' main ' chain ) .
This is an example of Haskell 's evaluation - by - need strategy .
Now you should clearly see the difference :
- An IO action inside an IO procedure is guaranteed to execute as long as it is ( directly or indirectly ) inside the ' main ' chain - even when its result is n't used ( because the implicit " world " value it returns will be used ) .
You directly specify the order of the action 's execution inside the IO procedure .
Data dependencies are simulated via the implicit " world " values that are passed from each IO action to the next .
- An IO action inside ' unsafePerformIO ' will be performed only if result of this operation is really used .
The evaluation order is not guaranteed and you should not rely on it ( except when you 're sure about whatever data dependencies may exist ) .
I should also say that inside ' unsafePerformIO ' call you can organize a small internal chain of IO actions with the help of the same binding operators and / or ' do ' syntactic sugar we 've seen above .
For example , here 's a particularly convoluted way to compute the integer that comes after zero :
one :: Int one = unsafePerformIO $ do var <- newIORef 0 modifyIORef var ( + 1 ) readIORef var
and in this case ALL the operations in this chain will be performed as long as the result of the ' unsafePerformIO ' call is needed .
To ensure this , the actual ' unsafePerformIO ' implementation evaluates the " world " returned by the ' action ' :
unsafePerformIO action = let ( a , world1 ) = action createNewWorld in ( world1 ` seq ` a )
( The ' seq ' operation strictly evaluates its first argument before returning the value of the second one [ 8 ] ) .
inlinePerformIO
inlinePerformIO has the same definition as unsafePerformIO but with addition of INLINE pragma :
-- | Just like unsafePerformIO , but we inline it .
Big performance gains as -- it exposes lots of things to further inlining {-# INLINE inlinePerformIO #-} inlinePerformIO action = let ( a , world1 ) = action createNewWorld in ( world1 ` seq ` a ) # endif
Semantically inlinePerformIO = unsafePerformIO in as much as either of those have any semantics at all .
The difference of course is that inlinePerformIO is even less safe than unsafePerformIO .
While ghc will try not to duplicate or common up different uses of unsafePerformIO , we aggressively inline inlinePerformIO .
So you can really only use it where the IO content is really properly pure , like reading from an immutable memory buffer ( as in the case of ByteStrings ) .
However things like allocating new buffers should not be done inside inlinePerformIO since that can easily be floated out and performed just once for the whole program , so you end up with many things sharing the same buffer , which would be bad .
So the rule of thumb is that IO things wrapped in unsafePerformIO have to be externally pure while with inlinePerformIO it has to be really really pure or it 'll all go horribly wrong .
That said , here 's some really hairy code .
This should frighten any pure functional programmer ...
write :: Int -> ( Ptr Word8 -> IO ( ) ) ->
Put ( ) write !
n body =
Put $ \ c buf @ ( Buffer fp o u l ) -> if n <= l then write ' c fp o u l else write ' ( flushOld c n fp o u ) ( new Buffer c n ) 0 0 0 where {-# NOINLINE write ' # -} write ' c ! fp ! o ! u ! l = -- warning : this is a tad hardcore inlinePerformIO ( withForeign Ptr fp ( \ p -> body $ ! ( p ` plusPtr ` ( o + u ) ) ) ) ` seq ` c () ( Buffer fp o ( u + n ) ( l - n ) )
it 's used like :
word8 w = write 1 ( \ p -> poke p w )
This does not adhere to my rule of thumb above .
Do n't ask exactly why we claim it 's safe :-) ( and if anyone really wants to know , ask Ross Paterson who did it first in the Builder monoid )
unsafeInterleaveIO
But there is an even stranger operation called ' unsafeInterleaveIO ' that gets the " official baton " , makes its own pirate copy , and then runs an " illegal " relay - race in parallel with the main one !
I can't talk further about its behavior without causing grief and indignation , so it 's no surprise that this operation is widely used in countries that are hotbeds of software piracy such as Russia and China ! ;)
Do n't even ask me - I wo n't say anything more about this dirty trick I use all the time ;)
One can use unsafePerformIO ( not unsafeInterleaveIO ) to perform I / O operations not in predefined order but by demand .
For example , the following code :
do let c = unsafePerformIO getChar do_proc c
will perform getChar I / O call only when value of c is really required by code , i.e. it this call will be performed lazily as any usual Haskell computation .
Now imagine the following code :
do let s = [ unsafePerformIO getChar , unsafePerformIO getChar , unsafePerformIO getChar ] do_proc s
Three chars inside this list will be computed on demand too , and this means that their values will depend on the order they are consumed .
It is not that we usually need .
unsafeInterleaveIO solves this problem - it performs I / O only on demand but allows to define exact * internal * execution order for parts of your datastructure .
It is why I wrote that unsafeInterleaveIO makes illegal copy of baton .
First , unsafeInterleaveIO has ( IO a ) action as a parameter and returns value of type ' a ' :
do str <- unsafeInterleaveIO myGetContents
Second , unsafeInterleaveIO do n't perform any action immediately , it only creates a box of type ' a ' which on requesting this value will perform action specified as a parameter .
Third , this action by itself may compute the whole value immediately or ... use unsafeInterleaveIO again to defer calculation of some sub-components :
myGetContents = do c <- get Char s <- unsafeInterleaveIO myGetContents return ( c : s )
This code will be executed only at the moment when value of str is really demanded .
In this moment , getChar will be performed ( with result assigned to c ) and one more lazy IO box will be created - for s .
This box again contains link to the myGetContents call
Then , list cell returned that contains one char read and link to myGetContents call as a way to compute rest of the list .
Only at the moment when next value in list required , this operation will be performed again
As a final result , we get inability to read second char in list before first one , but lazy character of reading in whole .
bingo !
PS : of course , actual code should include EOF checking .
also note that you can read many chars / records at each call :
myGetContents = do c <- replicateM 512 getChar s <- unsafeInterleaveIO myGetContents return ( c ++ s )
A safer approach : the ST monad
We said earlier that we can use unsafePerformIO to perform computations that are totally pure but nevertheless interact with the Real World in some way .
There is , however , a better way !
One that remains totally pure and yet allows the use of references , arrays , and so on -- and it 's done using , you guessed it , type magic .
This is the ST monad .
The ST monad 's version of unsafePerformIO is called runST , and it has a very unusual type .
runST :: ( forall s . ST s a ) -> a
The s variable in the ST monad is the state type .
Moreover , all the fun mutable stuff available in the ST monad is quantified over s :
newSTRef :: a -> ST s ( STRef s a ) newArray_ :: Ix i => ( i , i ) ->
ST s ( STArray s i e )
So why does runST have such a funky type ?
Let 's see what would happen if we wrote
makeSTRef :: a ->
STRef s a makeSTRef a = runST ( newSTRef a )
This fails , because newSTRef a does n't work for all state types s -- it only works for the s from the return type STRef s a .
This is all sort of wacky , but the result is that you can only run an ST computation where the output type is functionally pure , and makes no references to the internal mutable state of the computation .
The ST monad does n't have access to I/O operations like writing to the console , either -- only references , arrays , and suchlike that come in handy for pure computations .
Important note -- the state type does n't actually mean anything .
We never have a value of type s , for instance .
It 's just a way of getting the type system to do the work of ensuring purity for us , with smoke and mirrors .
It 's really just type system magic : secretly , on the inside , runST runs a computation with the real world baton just like unsafePerformIO .
Their internal implementations are almost identical : in fact , there 's a function
stToIO :: ST RealWorld a -> IO a
The difference is that ST uses type system magic to forbid unsafe behavior like extracting mutable objects from their safe ST wrapping , but allowing purely functional outputs to be performed with all the handy access to mutable references and arrays .
So here 's how we 'd rewrite our function using unsafePerformIO from above :
oneST :: ST s Int -- note that this works correctly for any s oneST = do var <- newSTRef 0 modifySTRef var ( + 1 ) readSTRef var one ::
Int one = runST oneST
Welcome to the machine : the actual GHC implementation
A little disclaimer : I should say that I 'm not describing here exactly what a monad is ( I do n't even completely understand it myself ) and my explanation shows only one _possible_ way to implement the IO monad in Haskell .
For example , the hbc Haskell compiler and the Hugs interpreter implements the IO monad via continuations [ 9 ] .
I also have n't said anything about exception handling , which is a natural part of the " monad " concept .
You can read the " All About Monads " guide to learn more about these topics .
But there is some good news : first , the IO monad understanding you 've just acquired will work with any implementation and with many other monads .
You just can't work with RealWorld values directly .
Second , the IO monad implementation described here is really used in the GHC , yhc / nhc ( jhc , too ? ) compilers .
Here is the actual IO definition from the GHC sources :
newtype IO a = IO ( State # RealWorld -> ( # State # RealWorld , a # ) )
It uses the " State # RealWorld " type instead of our RealWorld , it uses the " (# # ) " strict tuple for optimization , and it adds an IO data constructor around the type .
Nevertheless , there are no significant changes from the standpoint of our explanation .
Knowing the principle of " chaining " IO actions via fake " state of the world " values , you can now easily understand and write low - level implementations of GHC I/O operations .
The Yhc / nhc98 implementation
data World = World newtype IO a = IO ( World -> Either IOError a )
This implementation makes the " World " disappear somewhat [ 10 ] , and returns Either a result of type " a " , or if an error occurs then " IOError " .
The lack of the World on the right - hand side of the function can only be done because the compiler knows special things about the IO type , and wo n't overoptimise it .
