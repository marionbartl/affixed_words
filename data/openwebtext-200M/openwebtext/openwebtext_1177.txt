( CNN ) -- Two U.S. spacecraft are set to crash on the moon Friday .
On purpose .
And we 're all invited to watch .
An artist 's rendering shows the LCROSS spacecraft , left , separating from its Centaur rocket .
NASA 's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite is scheduled to drop its Centaur upper - stage rocket on the lunar surface at 7:31 a.m. ET .
NASA hopes the impact will kick up enough dust to help the LCROSS probe find the presence of water in the moon 's soil .
Four minutes later , the LCROSS will follow through the debris plume , collecting and relaying data back to Earth before crashing into the Cabeus crater near the moon 's south pole .
The LCROSS is carrying spectrometers , near - infrared cameras , a visible camera and a visible radiometer .
These instruments will help NASA scientists analyze the plume of dust -- more than 250 metric tons ' worth -- for water vapor .
The orbiting Hubble Space Telescope and NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will watch , and photograph , the collisions .
And hundreds of telescopes on Earth also will be focused on the two plumes .

NASA is encouraging amateur astronomers to join the watch party .
" We expect the debris plumes to be visible through midsized backyard telescopes -- 10 inches and larger , " said Brian Day at NASA 's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , California .
Day is an amateur astronomer who is leading education and public outreach for the LCROSS mission .
Ames will host " Impact Night , " an event with music and food starting Thursday evening before a live transmission of the lunar impact will be shown around 4:30 a.m. PT Friday .
Other science observatories and amateur astronomy clubs across the country will be hosting similar events .
iReport :
Are you planning to watch ?
" The initial explosions will probably be hidden behind crater walls , but the plumes will rise high enough above the crater 's rim to be seen from Earth , " Day said .
The Cabeus crater lies in permanent shadow , making observations inside the crater difficult .

The impacts will not be visible to the naked eye or through binoculars .
If you do n't have a telescope , or you live in areas where daylight will obscure the viewing , NASA TV will broadcast the crashes live .
Coverage begins at 6:15 a.m. ET Friday .
The two main components of the LCROSS mission are the shepherding spacecraft and the Centaur upper stage rocket .
The spacecraft will guide the rocket to its crash site .
Data from previous space missions have revealed trace amounts of water in lunar soil .
The LCROSS mission seeks a definitive answer to the question of how much water is present .
NASA has said it believes water on the moon could be a valuable resource in the agency 's quest to explore the solar system .
LCROSS launched with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral , Florida , on June 18 .
Friday 's lunar impact will be visible best in areas that are still dark , particularly in the Western United States .
The Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey , California , will open up its doors early Friday to allow people to watch the event through its 30 - inch telescope .
It 's " the most accessible public telescope in the [ San Francisco ] Bay Area , " said Dave Samuels , the observatory 's vice president .
So far , at least 50 people have signed up , Samuels said , noting that number is " really phenomenal , especially on a school night [ and ] work night .
It 's really incredible . "
Students , retirees and board members are among those scheduled to attend .
Samuels said a special low - light , infrared video camera will be hooked up to the telescope so that the audience can watch the rocket strike the moon .
The observatory is in Fremont Peak State Park , which is on a list of California parks that could close because of recent budget cuts .
Samuels said he hopes Friday 's event triggers more interest in astronomy , particularly among young children , and possibly help the park to stay open .
" It 's things like this that get kids interested [ in science ] , " he said .
" It will probably be a defining moment for them . "
Darrick Gray , who teaches atmospheric sciences at Ray - Pec High School near Kansas City , Missouri , said he 's planning to take 17 students -- all juniors and seniors -- to watch the lunar impact .
" This is truly a once - in - a - lifetime thing , " Gray said .
He said he 's arranged for a school bus to pick up the kids early Friday and take the class to the Powell Observatory in Louisburg , Kansas .
" It 's weather - dependent ; we 've got rain right now , " Gray said .
" It 's going to be a call I make at 5 a.m . "
Gray , who is also the director of the Astronomical Society of Kansas City , said his students will try to take photos of the impact through the eyepiece of their telescopes .
He said he hopes the event will influence his students to pursue careers in science .
" Being as we do live here in Missouri , we 're away from the hub [ of astronomy ] , " Gray said .
" We 're not in Florida , we 're not in Texas , we 're not in Silicon Valley -- it 's not something they 're used to seeing .
" So any time you can show them something that 's never been done , and they say , ' Oh this is pretty cool , ' I think they buy into that . "

Carne Asada
Carne asada , which translates as “ roast meat , ” is a festive and flavorful dish of thinly sliced marinated beef .
The key to making amazing carne asada is a marinade that strikes the right balance of spicy , sweet and savory flavors .
Any cook who loves carne asada is likely to have their own secret blend of herbs , spices and marinating liquid and we ’re thrilled Darlene has shared hers for the Primal Blueprint Cookbook Contest .
( Enter your own Primal recipes for a chance to win a Primal prize package and to be included in the reader - created Primal Blueprint Cookbook .
View all the details and the current theme here . )
When the ingredients for this marinade are all chopped and mixed together , take a long , deep whiff .
The aroma of the marinade hints at the flavor to come .
Warm spices , refreshing lime , the sweet scent of oranges and the malty aroma of beer will have you salivating and counting the minutes until the meat goes on the grill .
The marinade does n’t just add flavor ; the acidity in the citrus fruits and beer helps tenderize the meat , too .
The alcohol will burn off as the steak cooks but the flavor of the beer will subtly enhance the carne asada .
Choose a darker beer for a richer , more intense flavor .
Serve carne asada over shredded lettuce with slices of avocado or guacamole and a garnish of pico de gallo or salsa .

Young Canadians are dramatically different from young Americans , a new cross - border survey has found .
Canadians from 18 to 34 travel more , recycle more , charge more , play the lottery more , marry less , text - message less and rent more than their American counterparts , the Ipsos Reid study revealed .
" Americans come through as a little more grounded , more domestic .
Canadians are more of the free - spirit type , " Samantha McAra , a 26 - year - old senior research manager in Calgary with the polling company , said Friday .
" My friends and I , we 're renting , not married , have careers , like to travel .
The environment thing , too .
If someone does n't recycle , it 's sort of like you look at that person and they 're sort of judged . "
McAra wrote the questions for the survey , which asked 1,000 people on each side of the border to respond online .
The traditional telephone poll would n't work for a demographic in which 34 per cent of Americans and 19 per cent of Canadians only have a cellphone , she said .
McAra may be smack in the middle of the " emerging market group , " as she calls it , but even she was baffled by some of the 10 social networking groups on the final list , sites such as imeem.com and ning.com .
But even they had six and three people registered , respectively , among those polled .
Facebook is the social networking site of choice for Canadians , at 81 per cent registered , compared to 57 per cent for Americans .
In the U.S. , 54 per cent are signed onto MySpace , compared with 23 per cent of young Canadians .
Companies are increasingly interested in the 18 - to - 34 - year - old market , McAra said , because they have healthy incomes and the urge to acquire ; baby boomers , on the other hand , have the incomes but not as strong a need to spend .
Among the findings in the 18 - to - 34 group :
Canadians sent an average 78.7 text messages a week ; Americans send 129.6 .
73 per cent of Canadians rated the environment as important compared to 61 per cent of Americans .
88 per cent of Canadians actively recycle compared to 72 per cent of Americans .
44 per cent of Canadians rated terrorism as important compared to 65 per cent of Americans .
25 per cent of Canadians are married and 18 per cent are living together , compared to 39 per cent of Americans married and 7 per cent living together .
35 per cent of Canadians own their own home compared with 45 per cent of Americans
48 per cent of Canadians vacationed outside of Canada ; 19 per cent of Americans vacationed out of the U.S .

Climate correspondent , BBC News
Average temperatures have not increased for over a decade
This headline may come as a bit of a surprise , so too might that fact that the warmest year recorded globally was not in 2008 or 2007 , but in 1998 .
But it is true .
For the last 11 years we have not observed any increase in global temperatures .
And our climate models did not forecast it , even though man-made carbon dioxide , the gas thought to be responsible for warming our planet , has continued to rise .
So what on Earth is going on ?
Climate change sceptics , who passionately and consistently argue that man 's influence on our climate is overstated , say they saw it coming .
They argue that there are natural cycles , over which we have no control , that dictate how warm the planet is .
But what is the evidence for this ?
During the last few decades of the 20th Century , our planet did warm quickly .
Recent research has ruled out solar influences on temperature increases Sceptics argue that the warming we observed was down to the energy from the Sun increasing .
After all 98 % of the Earth 's warmth comes from the Sun .
But research conducted two years ago , and published by the Royal Society , seemed to rule out solar influences .
The scientists ' main approach was simple : to look at solar output and cosmic ray intensity over the last 30 - 40 years , and compare those trends with the graph for global average surface temperature .
And the results were clear .
" Warming in the last 20 to 40 years can't have been caused by solar activity , " said Dr Piers Forster from Leeds University , a leading contributor to this year 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
But one solar scientist Piers Corbyn from Weatheraction , a company specialising in long range weather forecasting , disagrees .
He claims that solar charged particles impact us far more than is currently accepted , so much so he says that they are almost entirely responsible for what happens to global temperatures .
He is so excited by what he has discovered that he plans to tell the international scientific community at a conference in London at the end of the month .
If proved correct , this could revolutionise the whole subject .
Ocean cycles
What is really interesting at the moment is what is happening to our oceans .
They are the Earth 's great heat stores .
In the last few years [ the Pacific Ocean ] has been losing its warmth and has recently started to cool down
According to research conducted by Professor Don Easterbrook from Western Washington University last November , the oceans and global temperatures are correlated .
The oceans , he says , have a cycle in which they warm and cool cyclically .
The most important one is the Pacific decadal oscillation ( PDO ) .
For much of the 1980s and 1990s , it was in a positive cycle , that means warmer than average .
And observations have revealed that global temperatures were warm too .
But in the last few years it has been losing its warmth and has recently started to cool down .
These cycles in the past have lasted for nearly 30 years .
So could global temperatures follow ?
The global cooling from 1945 to 1977 coincided with one of these cold Pacific cycles .
Professor Easterbrook says : " The PDO cool mode has replaced the warm mode in the Pacific Ocean , virtually assuring us of about 30 years of global cooling . "
So what does it all mean ?
Climate change sceptics argue that this is evidence that they have been right all along .
They say there are so many other natural causes for warming and cooling , that even if man is warming the planet , it is a small part compared with nature .
But those scientists who are equally passionate about man 's influence on global warming argue that their science is solid .
The UK Met Office 's Hadley Centre , responsible for future climate predictions , says it incorporates solar variation and ocean cycles into its climate models , and that they are nothing new .
In fact , the centre says they are just two of the whole host of known factors that influence global temperatures - all of which are accounted for by its models .
In addition , say Met Office scientists , temperatures have never increased in a straight line , and there will always be periods of slower warming , or even temporary cooling .
What is crucial , they say , is the long - term trend in global temperatures .
And that , according to the Met office data , is clearly up .
To confuse the issue even further , last month Mojib Latif , a member of the IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) says that we may indeed be in a period of cooling worldwide temperatures that could last another 10 - 20 years .
The UK Met Office says that warming is set to resume
Professor Latif is based at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at Kiel University in Germany and is one of the world 's top climate modellers .
But he makes it clear that he has not become a sceptic ; he believes that this cooling will be temporary , before the overwhelming force of man-made global warming reasserts itself .
So what can we expect in the next few years ?
Both sides have very different forecasts .
The Met Office says that warming is set to resume quickly and strongly .
It predicts that from 2010 to 2015 at least half the years will be hotter than the current hottest year on record ( 1998 ) .
Sceptics disagree .
They insist it is unlikely that temperatures will reach the dizzy heights of 1998 until 2030 at the earliest .
It is possible , they say , that because of ocean and solar cycles a period of global cooling is more likely .
One thing is for sure .
It seems the debate about what is causing global warming is far from over .
Indeed some would say it is hotting up .

The University of São Paulo to support Openmoko ?
From : " Jon ' maddog ' Hall " < maddog - AT - li.org >
To : community - AT- lists.openmoko.org
Subject : The University of São Paulo 's intent to join Openmoko development Date : Mon , 13 Jul 2009 07:02:48 - 0400 Message -ID : <1247482968.6019.10.camel@shamet >

Dear Openmoko Community ,
In light of the refocusing of Sean 's company on consumer items , there has been a perceived vacuum created in the Openmoko community 's efforts to create next - generation open cellular smart phones .
I happened to be working with Dr. Marcelo Zuffo , a full professor and the head of the Laboratory for Integrated Systems at the University of São Paulo , Brazil , on an unrelated project .
I asked Dr. Zuffo if the university would be willing to join the Openmoko community and to provide critical resources to the task at hand .
I subsequently have met with Dr. Zuffo several times on this matter , have seen his facilities ( which include a very modern and state - of - the - art SMT line ) and have discussed the goals of the community to design and prototype a completely open design for a cellular phone .
Dr. Zuffo and the university understand your issues , understand free and open source software and hardware and are willing to assist the community with this project .
I might add that the university can bring several new capabilities to the community :
First of all , Dr. Zuffo has discussed the Openmoko project with the Minister of Telecommunications of Brazil , and the Minister is very enthusiastic about the concept .
Having the support of the government of the twelfth largest economy behind the project might really help us with various negotiations with vendors .
Secondly the University has been working on several aspects of telecommunications for a long time , and therefore has expertise in telephonic security and codecs ( among other things ) that could be of use to the Openmoko community .
Third , the university has the ability and expertise to design new integrated circuits .
Recently they designed a a range of analog - digital chips .
Therefore the possibility of developing , manufacturing and freely licensing new chips to help reduce the cost of the phone is possible .
Forth , while the facilities I mentioned are capable of producing up to 10,000 units at the rate of one circuit board every 30 seconds , the purpose of the facilities is research , developing and support projects that can lead innovation , the lab 's charter does not allow them to manufacture more units then the 10,000 because that would be " commercial production " .
Therefore the university has a goal of freely licensing the design to companies for manufacture .
Fifth , the university would be happy to host the mailing lists and forums of the Openmoko project .
If some of the software projects need hosting and can not find hosting services other places , the university will consider acting as a primary hosting facility for these projects .
Sixth , personally I would like to see this concept extended , of inviting more universities and their facilities to help with this project world - wide .
I hope that the leadership of the University of Sao Paulo will help create the structure and inspiration for this to happen .
Finally , the university has a non -profit legal entity , LSITEC , which can easily do the type of paperwork that Sean 's company did ( NDAs , certification ) so the community can leverage off that .
I know that there will be a lot of questions and considerations to take before the community is comfortable with this relationship .
Dr. Zuffo has asked that I help coordinate the joining together of the university with the community , and in the interest of seeing Openmoko continue to do the fine work started by Sean and all of you , I will be glad to help in this capacity .
I am monitoring the community mailing list , and people are also welcome to email me directly ( maddog@li.org ) with questions that you do not ( for any reason ) wish to post to the list .
A copy of Dr. Zuffo's letter of intent is below .
I have the original PDF if anyone would like to see it , but it was too big to make it through the community 's standards on mailing lists unmoderated , and I thought you might like to see this as soon as possible .
Warmest regards , Jon " maddog " Hall President , Linux International CTO of Koolu , Inc.
==========================================================================================================
São Paulo , 8th July 2009 , Mr. Jon Maddog Hall The Executive Director Linux International .
Dear Mr. Hall , according our conversation LSI - USP the Laboratory for Integrated Systems at the University of São Paulo , Brazil , is interested in hosting the OpenMoko Community to design innovative cell phone designs .
We would like to offer the community the following facilities : ?
State - of - art facilities for SMT ( Surface Mounting Technology ) prototyping of complex electronics boards ; ?
State - of - art facilities and expertise for design HW and SW in telephony and communications ; ?
Expertise in testing and certification ; ?
A new building located at a Center position at USP São Paulo , to host community meetings , as well as computational infrastructure for email , WEB servers and project databases .
- LSI has a long term expertise in designing complex electronics systems , including integrated circuits , and we would like to involve also our IC design team that could eventually design some components of the OpenMoko models .
All legal procedures will be conducted by LSITEC , our non-profit organization to help technology developing .
Finally I would like to be completely available for any further questions and discussion .
My regards , Marcelo Knörich Zuffo Full Professor Laboratory for Integrated Systems University of São Paulo ?

It has been one of the elusive goals of seafaring nations almost since the beginnings of waterborne trade , but for nearly 500 years the idea has been dismissed as an impossible dream .
Now , as a result of global warming , the dream is about to come true .
Within days , a journey that represents both a huge commercial boon and a dark milestone on the route to environmental catastrophe is expected to be completed for the first time .
No commercial vessel has ever successfully travelled the North - east Passage , a fabled Arctic Sea route that links the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific far more directly than the usual southerly cargo route .
Explorers throughout history have tried , and failed ; some have died in the attempt .
But early next week the German - owned vessels , Beluga Fraternity and Beluga Foresight , are scheduled to dock in the Dutch port of Rotterdam .
It is the culmination of a two - month voyage from South Korea across the perilous waters of the Arctic , where an unprecedented ice - melt has at last made the previously impassable course a viable possibility .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The new route could transform Russia 's economic fortunes .
Throughout history , the country 's search for a warm - water port that would provide sea routes open year - round has dominated the geopolitics of the region .
But the economic advantages are balanced by the disastrous environmental news that the transit represents .
" This is further proof that climate change is happening now , " said Melanie Duchin , Arctic Expedition leader on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise , who added that the development put greater pressure on world leaders to agree a major emissions cut at their Copenhagen meeting in December .
" This is not a cause for celebration but cause for immediate action , " she said .
The 12,000 - tonne vessels ' summer journey through the Northeast Passage was carried out with 3,500 tonnes of construction materials and parts for a Siberian power station on board .
Once completed , the voyage will have shortened the traditional commercial sea route from the Far East to Europe – via the Suez Canal – by more than 4,000 nautical miles .
Russian maritime officials are now hoping that the feat will result in an " Arctic Rush " with the northern sea route becoming a viable summer competitor to the Suez and Panama canals .
They have offered to cut ice - breaker fees in the North - east Passage to encourage major shipping companies to start using it .
Nils Stolberg , the President of the Bremen - based Beluga group which organised the commercial voyage insisted yesterday that ships ' transit was not an experiment but the first step towards opening the North - east Passage to shipping world wide .
He said his company already had new contracts to ship goods along the route from Asia to Siberia next summer .
" We are all very proud and delighted to be the first Western shipping company to have successfully transited the legendary North - east Passage and delivered a sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , " he said .
He also estimated that the path had saved $ 92,000 ( £ 55,000 ) worth of fuel for each ship .
Despite global warming , the Northeast Passage is still seriously hampered by hundred - mile long swathes of shifting pack ice that extend southwards from the North Pole even in summer .
The islands off the north coast of Siberia also contain glaciers which cast icebergs into the warming waters of the passage with increasing frequency .
In 1983 a Russian ship was crushed by pack ice it encountered in the passage in the middle of summer .
However , the Russian Transport Ministry which operates a fleet of six nuclear powered - ice - breakers to assist Russian and other coastal commercial ships , says that in recent summers the route has rarely been completely impassable .
" The ice conditions were far more severe 20 years ago , " a spokesman said .
The voyage of the two Beluga vessels was certainly no picnic .
Although not thoroughbred ice - breakers themselves , both ships were designed to cope with ice - strewn waters and were accompanied by at least one Russian nuclear ice - breaker during the whole of the trip .
The two ships encountered snow , fog , ice floes , and treacherous icebergs which showed only about one meter of their huge underwater volume on the sea 's surface .
The most challenging stretch of the voyage came at its northernmost point , the Vilkizi Strait on the tip of Siberia .
Half of the sea 's surface was covered with pack ice and the captains of both vessels had to call Russian ice pilots on board to shepherd them through .
Vlarey Durov , captain of the Beluga Foresight spoke of the stress he experienced from having to keep a constant lookout for ice and the time spent waiting for the seas to clear .
But he insisted : " It is an economically and ecologically beneficial shortcut between Europe and Asia ...
On such voyages the advantage of fewer miles can outweigh the delays in waiting for clear water . "
Finding a North - east Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific was the goal of mariners and governments in 16th - century Europe because the route would have shortened the voyage to the newly discovered spice islands of the East Indies by some 2,000 miles – the equivalent of a year 's sailing .
However , most expeditions ended in disaster .
The first attempt by the British navigator Richard Chancellor took place in 1553 but was brought to an abrupt halt in the winter of the same year when his ships became trapped in the ice .
Chancellor abandoned ship and marched across the ice to Moscow where he was entertained at the court of Ivan the Terrible .
His fellow explorer Sir Hugh Willoughby stayed with his crew aboard ship and was discovered frozen to death two years later .
Another attempt in 1597 by the Dutch explorer William Barents ended with his ship being trapped and crushed in the ice .
Barents and his crew were forced to spend the winter in a makeshift driftwood hut living on polar bear meat .
Barents , after whom the polar Barents sea is named , did not survive either .
If the current voyage ends successfully , such maritime disasters may become a thing of the past .
But a separate environmental disaster may be only beginning to unfold .

The congressional candidate is the latest to chime in on perspectives of where gold is going .
This ties in with our expectations that the Fed 's generous excess liquidity , coupled with a declining dollar , will likely see gold as the primary focus on new capital flows .
If gold does really hit $ 5,000 expect a military coup by the various governors of the Fed .
As to Schiff 's contention that a plunge in the dollar will be accompanied by Chinese dumping of Treasuries , we are not so sure it is that simple .
Bernanke is well aware of the game of poker ( where courtesy of the reserve currency he can raise into infinity , even on blind ) , and this is the only bluff he would be unable to respond to .
Which is why the tacit assumption that China will keep USTs in exchange for Geithner backing off from allegations of renminbi manipulation , seems very sensible .
Either way , if Peter Schiff ultimately does get elected into Congress , it will be amusing to watch the Grayson - Schiff financially astute tag team take on the rest of their underedcuated associates , and hopefully , the administration and its flawed economic policies .

JAPAN is a decent , consensual and egalitarian country .
Much of it is still prosperous , despite a dismal period for the economy .
The beliefs of its two main political parties are often hard to tell apart .
Both their leaders are grandsons of ( rival ) prime ministers .
There were no loud celebrations when the results of the general election were announced on August 30th .
It is tempting therefore to write it off as no earth - shattering event .
That would be a mistake .
The vote , in which the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) broke the half - century lock of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) on power , marked the overdue destruction of Japan 's post - war political system .
The question is what will now take its place .
System change
There are three reasons to believe that this vote marks a big change .
The first is the scale of the DPJ 's victory .
When the LDP lost once before , in 1993 , it remained easily the biggest party in the Diet , and within 11 months was back in power .
Today , the LDP is devastated .
It keeps just 119 out of 480 seats in the lower house of the Diet , down from 300 .
The DPJ has 308 .
Second , the rejection of the LDP is the culmination of deep changes in Japan 's political culture .
The LDP , a pro-American , pro-business consequence of the cold war , was undermined by two decades in which consumer interests and non-profit groups slowly mounted a challenge to its paternalism .
Electoral reform in the mid-1990s introduced single - member districts , helping to create an opposition that could take on the LDP .
Third , by overthrowing the LDP , Japan 's voters have turfed out not just a party , but a whole system .
After the LDP 's creation in 1955 , Japan 's “ iron triangle ” of party , bureaucrats and business promoted breakneck growth , and distributed its fruits equitably : cheap finance for big business , contracts for construction companies , jobs for the masses , subsidies for farmers and re-election for the LDP machine .
But corruption flourished , as tax money went to the highest bidders .
Growth slowed from the 1980s , and the system was too inflexible to adjust .
Voters grew more demanding .
Roads , dams and temporary , low - paid jobs were no longer enough .
People wanted careers .
They wanted doctors , nursing homes and decent schools that would keep young families from moving to the big cities , leaving only the old behind ( see article ) .
And they wanted confidence that the government would still be solvent when they drew down their pensions — not a sure bet in a country with a national debt approaching 200 % of GDP .
Successive LDP administrations failed to respond to these demands because the government was often the weakest of the three sides of the triangle .
Ministers ' best intentions were undermined by bureaucrats or party barons with their own networks of power .
Hence the voters ' rejection of the old system in favour of something unfamiliar in Japan : an open and accountable government .
The huge task of creating it falls to Yukio Hatoyama , whom the Diet will appoint as prime minister on September 16th .
It is not clear whether he , or his party , is up to the job ; for alarmingly little is known — even by the voters — about the people who have taken power in the world 's second - biggest economy .
In opposition the DPJ tapped into the powerful , rather Nordic , vision of their society that many Japanese people cling to and fear they are losing .
Accordingly , it rejected the free - market version of change championed by Junichiro Koizumi , a reforming LDP prime minister .
This left - leaning , pro-union bias explains the party 's silence on liberalisation and deregulation of medical and other services that would boost productivity and help create the demand and jobs that Japan badly needs .
The party has also made mild anti-American noises about military bases and the Japanese fleet .
A market economy might be just about acceptable to the party , but an American market society , however defined , is not .
To Western ears , some of this sounds worrying .
Yet the DPJ may be less frightening in office than in prospect .
It has already begun to temper its foreign - policy rhetoric to calm American nerves .
And its big economic idea , radical by Japan 's standards , is broadly welcome .
Where the LDP looked after producers ' interests , the DPJ says it will put consumers first .
It also says it will steer the economy away from export - led growth towards domestic demand .
These assurances , coupled with a stronger social safety net and employment provisions ( see article ) , may help lift some of the deflationary fog that has lain heavy over Japan for so long .
Bureaucrats and the budget
But all this depends on Mr Hatoyama 's first task : redesigning government .
Here he starts with an advantage .
Unlike the LDP , the DPJ government will not have to fight off a parallel party power structure when it makes policy .
The cabinet will therefore be more powerful , and more accountable .
The test will be taking on the bureaucracy .
Mr Hatoyama will have to strike a delicate balance .
On the one hand the DPJ demands accountability , and promises to break bureaucrats ' backs to get it .
On the other , it needs to harness bureaucrats ' talents if it is to formulate and carry out sound policy , particularly since so many new DPJ politicians are wet behind the ears .
How Mr Hatoyama both motivates bureaucrats and punishes them when they step out of line will make or break the DPJ .
The crucial battle comes between now and December , in drawing up the budget for the 2010 fiscal year .
Ministries have already submitted their spending plans , including pork for favoured groups , hoping for the usual lack of political oversight .
The DPJ promises to rebuild the budget - making process from scratch , going through programmes line by line .
That , too , is a chance for the new government to show that it is not as profligate as its opponents have claimed .
Japan has had other opportunities for reform , and has failed to take them .
Mr Hatoyama , with no favours to return , has a chance both to revolutionise how Japan is governed and to revitalise the economy .
He will need judgment for the first , and imagination for the second .
Wish him plenty of both .

With no charges , woman accused in husband ’s death set free
Mona Shield Payne / Special to the Sun
Charges have n't been filed against a Las Vegas woman arrested in the shooting death of her husband earlier this month and a justice of the peace today ordered her released from custody .
Metro Police arrested Ericka McElroy on Oct. 7 outside her home in the 5000 block of Upper Falls Court in the southwest valley .
McElroy , 25 , allegedly fired a shotgun into the chest of her 37 - year - old husband , Shane McElroy , following a domestic dispute , police said .
Ericka McElroy appeared in Las Vegas Justice Court today by video represented by the Public Defender ’s Office .
Deputy District Attorney Pamela Weckerly said her office needed 30 days to file the criminal complaint .
With no charges to hold her , Justice of the Peace Tony Abbatangelo released McElroy on her own recognizance .
She is scheduled to appear in court again on Nov. 16 .
After marrying , Mr. Kristol followed his wife to Chicago , where she was doing graduate work and where he had what he called “ my first real experience of America . ”
Drafted into the Army with a number of Midwesterners who were street - tough and often anti-Semitic , he found himself shedding his youthful radical optimism .
“ I ca n’t build socialism with these people , ” he concluded .
“ They ’ll probably take it over and make a racket out of it . ”
In his opinion , his fellow GI ’s were inclined to loot , rape and murder , and only Army discipline held them in check .
It was a perception about human nature that would stay with him for the rest of his life , creating a tension with his alternative view that ordinary people were to be trusted more than intellectuals to do the right thing .

After the war he and Ms. Himmelfarb spent a year in Cambridge , England , while she pursued her studies .
When they returned to the United States in 1947 , he took an editing job with Commentary , then a liberal anti-Communist magazine .
In 1952 , at the height of the McCarthy era , he wrote what he called the most controversial article of his career : “ ‘ Civil Liberties , ’ 1952  A Study in Confusion . ”
It criticized many of those defending civil liberties against the government inquisitors , saying they failed to understand the conspiratorial danger of Communism .
Though he called Senator McCarthy a “ vulgar demagogue , ” the article was remembered for a few lines : “ For there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy : he , like them , is unequivocably anti-Communist .
About the spokesmen for American liberalism , they feel they know no such thing .
And with some justification . ”
After leaving Commentary , Mr. Kristol spent 10 months as executive director of the anti-Communist organization the American Committee for Cultural Freedom , and in 1953 he removed to England to help found Encounter magazine with the poet Stephen Spender .
They made an unlikely pair : Mr. Spender , tall , artsy , sophisticated ; Mr. Kristol , short , brash , still rough around the edges .
Together , they made Encounter one of the foremost highbrow magazines of its time .
But another explosive controversy awaited Mr. Kristol .
It was later revealed that the magazine had been receiving financial support from the C.I.A. Mr. Kristol always denied any knowledge of the connection .
But he hardly appeased his critics when he added that he did not disapprove of the C.I.A. ’s secret subsidies .
Back in New York at the end of 1958 , Mr. Kristol worked for a year at another liberal anti-Communist magazine , The Reporter , then took a job at Basic Books , rising to executive vice president .
In 1969 he left for New York University , and while teaching there he became a columnist for The Wall Street Journal .

Missouri Guardsmen make meth to learn how to identify meth labs
1st Lt. Richard Sambolin , of the Missouri National Guard 's 7th Civil Support Team , works with chemicals used to produce meth as part of a lab identification course at the Missouri Highway Patrol headquarters .
FORT LEONARD WOOD , Mo. ( Oct. 1 , 2009 ) — Four Missouri National Guardsmen in the 7th Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team based at Fort Leonard Wood recently participated in clandestine lab training at the Missouri Highway Patrol headquarters .
The four men , 1st Lt. Nathan Looper of Lynchburg , 1st Lt. Matthew Marks and 1st Lt. Richard Sambolin of Waynesville , and Staff Sgt. Jason Allabaugh of Chadwick , took the course as part of their training , along with law enforcement officials from across the state .
The class was primarily geared toward the detection and cleanup of methamphetamine labs .
The training included classroom sessions and hands - on exercises .
During the course , participants learned two methods for producing methamphetamine .
Under close supervision , the participants used common household chemicals to make batches of meth in the highway patrol ’s crime lab .
“ The purpose of the course is to be able to identify products used in a meth lab so that we can differentiate between a clandestine lab and a clandestine chemical or biological lab , ” Looper said .
“ Now we can look at photos of labs taken by our reconnaissance team and identify whether it is a terroristic lab or a meth lab . ”
Being able to tell the difference is important for the team because their mission is to focus on detecting , identifying , and neutralizing weapons of mass destruction .
Meth labs , however , are generally left to law enforcement .
“ Quick identification is a part of the 7th Civil Support Team ’s mission statement .
We need to be those keen eyes , ” said Sambolin , the unit ’s reconnaissance team officer in charge .
“ Having this training allows us to discern whether we are dealing with weapons of mass destruction or with a different lab set up . ”
It also makes for quicker resolutions to any lab discoveries .
“ That saves the state money , time and resources , ” said Looper , the team ’s medical operations officer .
That does n’t always mean that one type of lab is n’t related to the other .
“ The methamphetamine could be a money lab to buy the products that they need for the chemical or biological lab , ” Looper said .
“ One lab leads to another .
They can use the same labware for both products , but will use different ingredients . ”
Allabaugh , the team ’s medical noncommissioned officer , said he obtained a better understanding of what finished products within the labs will look like , which will help him during incidents to determine what substances need to be analyzed .
“ We can look at photos to determine what we want to take samples of , ” Allabaugh said .
“ We do n’t want to randomly take samples .
It also will tell us what step in the process they are at . ”
The thing that surprised Allabaugh about the class most was what the drug itself is made of .
“ People actually ingest those harmful chemicals , ” he said .
Marks , the team ’s nuclear medicine science officer , agreed .
“ It ’s been informative seeing the true hazards behind a meth lab and what law enforcement goes through when they go into a lab , ” Marks said .
“ It ’s interesting to see what lengths people will go through to get their high . ”
The quick and dirty methods of making meth were shocking , Marks said .
“ I ’ve learned how dangerous it is if you do n’t have any training to make it , ” he said .
Other than lab setups and the production of meth , the course also goes over detection equipment and personal protective equipment , which is carefully reviewed for team members .
Sambolin said it is still beneficial because the course used different brands than what the team does .
“ It gives us the ability to learn about one more piece of equipment and one more type of personal protective equipment , ” he said .
The Guardsmen also used the class time to network with law enforcement officials .
“ It gives us a great opportunity for us to continue our relationship with the Missouri Highway Patrol and Missouri Department of Natural Resources , ” Sambolin said .
“ We always welcome the opportunity to train together , so in the event of an incident , we have face recognition .
“ I feel lucky that we are here as ambassadors for the Missouri National Guard , ” Sambolin said .

COLUMBUS , Ohio 
The young woman found in 2007 in a backwoods trailer in West Virginia , where she said she had been held captive and raped , recanted her story on Wednesday .
“ Megan Williams was 20 years old in September 2007 when she reported that she had been kidnapped , raped and tortured in an allegedly racist attack , ” Byron L. Potts , Ms. Williams ’s lawyer , said Wednesday in a brief statement .
“ Megan Williams is now recanting her story . ”
The turn of events represents a striking reversal in a racially charged case that led to the conviction of seven people , all but one of whom are serving lengthy prison sentences .
It also raises questions about whether the prosecutor , who resisted strong pressure to pursue hate - crime charges based on race , should have gone further in checking Ms. Williams ’s credibility .
But Brian Abraham , the former prosecutor for Logan County who handled the cases , said the seven people charged with the crimes relating to Ms. Williams ’s abuse had been convicted based on physical evidence and their own corroborating statements , not on Ms. Williams ’s testimony .
12,000 - 6,000 years ago , the Sumatran tiger was isolated from the mainland population and has since developed into the smallest subspecies of tiger .
While the actual population is unknown , it is believed that only 100 - 400 Sumatran tigers survive today in the wild .
However , two more now exist at the Dublin Zoo and they have a very doting mom .
Stars with Stripes
29th July 2009
Visitors are being captivated by the antics of two of Dublin Zoo ’s latest arrivals – a pair of beautiful 8 week old Sumatran tiger cubs .
The yet unnamed cubs are a most precious edition to Dublin Zoo as the Sumatran Tiger is a critically endangered species - only a few hundred of these magnificent creatures survive in the wild .
The birth occurred in the early hours of 29th May to mother Sigra .
The male cub weighed in at 1 kg at birth and the female .85 kg .
Mother Sigra is showing her usual maternal instinct , already proven with her previous cubs which are now also part of the global breeding programme .
What is more surprising though is the way that stunning dad Kepala , who arrived in Dublin from Chester Zoo in February , has taken to his offspring .
Says keeper Anita Langstone : “ He is watchful and caring , affectionate and very protective towards them . ”
Speaking about this most significant birth , Zoo Director , Leo Oosterweghel said “ You never know what is going to happen when you introduce two big cats – so we are delighted with this spectacular result .
The bigger picture is of course that these cubs will help us to introduce our visitors to the plight of this critically endangered cat as well as making a huge contribution to the global breeding programme . ”
The keepers at Dublin Zoo are delighted with how the little siblings are progressing and are keeping a close eye on the cubs ’ developing personalities .
The female cub is said to be a “ very intelligent and inquisitive creature ” while the male is already displaying his father ’s traits with a “ boisterous nature ” and a striking , masculine appearance .
Dublin Zoo plays a significant role in the international breeding programme which is designed to ensure the survival of tigers in their natural habitat .
As well as contributing to this breeding programme visitors to Dublin Zoo have the opportunity to support these critically endangered species by purchasing a Tiger adoption pack at Dublin Zoo gift shop .
To celebrate this significant birth , Dublin Zoo is offering a family pass plus a Tiger adoption pack and a Guide Book at the special price of just € 60 .
There will also be special Sumatran tiger talks and tiger face painters free of charge over the long weekend .
Visitors to Dublin Zoo will be able to see the new tiger cubs , alongside their mother Sigra and Father Kepala from today .
The White House 's fear of protests from Code Pink and other left - wingers has put the brakes on President Obama making any public appearances during his visit to San Francisco this week .
Obama is scheduled to parachute into Liberalville on Thursday afternoon and pick up a cool $ 2 million for the Democratic Party at a fundraiser at the St. Francis Hotel - then spend the night , before checking out early the next morning and heading to Houston for a community service forum hosted by former President George H.W. Bush .
The St. Francis event is about all the public will see of him here .
Concerns about big and loud protests over the war in Afghanistan , the prohibition on open gays and lesbians in the military and other issues have squelched any thought of a trip to a local school or high - tech manufacturing plant that often accompanies such visits , said a source involved in the planning .
" You 're always sensitive about having your San Francisco moment here , " said former White House spinmeister Chris Lehane .
He still recalls a news conference he organized here in 2000 for then - presidential candidate Al Gore .
It turned into a near - disaster when a " transvestite kept asking if he would support public funding for sex changes . "
" No matter how you answered , you get in trouble , " Lehane said .
As for Obama 's visit , Code Pink co-founder and political rabble - rouser Medea Benjamin said the Pinks are still planning " something big and visual " at Union Square , across from the St. Francis fundraiser .
We 're also told a Code Pinker has already bought a ticket to the Obama event and will try to hand the president a petition demanding a U.S. exit strategy from Afghanistan .
And - no doubt - the protester will be exiting just as quickly .
Sparks to fly : Theresa Sparks made news as San Francisco 's first transsexual president of the Police Commission before quitting for the $ 167,500 - a- year job as head of Mayor Gavin Newsom 's Human Rights Commission .
Now she may have a new job in mind - the Board of Supervisors .
" I 'm leaning toward it ... but I 'm not there yet , " Sparks said .
The seat she 's eyeing is the one representing the Sixth District .
It 's being vacated after next year 's elections by the ever - outspoken Chris Daly .
Sparks said she hopes to make a final decision by the end of the month .
If she does run , Sparks said she would hold on to her new job at City Hall .
After all , says the former CEO of the Good Vibrations sex - store chain , " I was unemployed one week short of a year , and I 'm not a professional politician . "
Jerry - atrics : When San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom first got into the governor 's race against Jerry Brown , his handlers were predicting a Generation Gel vs. Generation Geritol showdown .
Well , they got it , but one look at the polling shows Generation Geritol is kicking their butts .
Much of Brown 's 20 - point margin over Newsom in the Democratic polls is attributable to the 30 - point spread in Jerry 's favor among voters over 50 .
That 's the group that shows up at the polls most reliably .
Newsom 's troubles with older voters appear to be over the two things his campaign counted as strengths : his age and his very vocal support for same - sex marriage .
Budapest - bound : President Obama has nominated Eleni Tsakopoulos - Kounalakis - daughter of Sacramento mega - developer and Democratic donor Angelo Tsakopoulos - to be ambassador to Hungary .
Tsakopoulos - Kounalakis , a major philanthropist , was a big - time backer of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton 's presidential bid .
For a while , word was that Tsakopoulos - Kounalakis would be headed for Singapore - but now we know better .
In the bag : Just days after it was snatched near San Francisco 's Union Square , Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson 's garment bag has been recovered .
A pair of Good Samaritans phoned Johnson 's office Tuesday to say they had found the bag , which Johnson reported had been lifted Saturday when he turned to help an elderly gentlemen into a cab .
Mayor Gavin Newsom 's office dispatched a couple of staffers to pick up the recovered goods near Mason and Eddy streets .
" Everything was there - from the pinstripe suit to the pair of shoes , a shirt and a necktie , " Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard said .
" In San Francisco , Good Samaritans are everywhere - so I hope Kevin Johnson does n't hold it against us , " Ballard said .
Feelin ' the love :
The last we heard of San Francisco Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , he was stomping out of a Democratic function at the Fairmont after telling Gov. ArnoldSchwarzenegger to " kiss my gay ass . "
So , does he have any regrets , in light of the governor signing legislation designating a state day of recognition for Harvey Milk ?
" No , " Ammiano said .
" Kissing is safe sex .
It was all said in the spirit of love . "

Stoneleigh , the world economy seems to be suffering from two great structural woes at present , namely stubbornly high energy prices that are linked to demand that is persistently ahead of the supply curve , and a level of debt that has destabilized the global finance and banking systems .
Can you explain for us the scale and structure of this debt and to what extent write - downs and quantitative easing ( QE ) have solved this problem ?
At the ASPO conference in Denver , October 2009 , I had the good fortune to meet Stoneleigh , former editor of The Oil Drum Canada , who left the The Oil Drum crew with colleague Ilargi to set up The Automatic Earth where they publish stories , news and analysis of the unfolding financial crisis .
I spent a couple of days chatting with Stoneleigh where she recounted her rather gloomy prospects for the immediate future of the global economy .
The following interview is a summary of her analysis of the unfolding situation .
Note that in a departure from convention , my questions are set in " blockquotes " to distinguish these from Stoneleigh 's responses .
Firstly , I would say that the energy prices that currently seem stubbornly high should fall substantially as the speculative premium evaporates and demand falls on a resumption of the credit crunch .
The sucker rally that has spawned all the talk of green shoots is essentially over in my opinion .
The result should be a reversal of a number of trends that depend on the ebb and flow of liquidity - we should see stock markets and commodity prices fall , a significant resurgence in the US dollar and a large contraction of credit .
The scale of the reversal should be substantial , as should its effects on energy demand .
Demand is not what one wants , but what one is ready , willing and able to pay for , and in a severe credit crunch the capacity to pay for supplies of most things will be severely reduced .
Figure 1
As demand falls , and with it prices , investment in the energy sector is likely to dry up .
Many projects will be uneconomic at much lower prices , meaning that the projects which might have cushioned the downslope of Hubbert ’s curve ( and the much steeper net energy curve ) , are unlikely to be developed .
In this way a demand collapse sets the stage for a supply collapse that could place a hard ceiling on any prospect of economic recovery .
That is a recipe for extremely high energy prices in the future .
Secondly , our vulnerability to the consequences of debt is extremely high at the moment .
The scale of that debt is staggeringly large .
The global credit hyper - expansion has been decades in the making and is now significantly larger than notable events of the past such as the South Sea Bubble of the 1720s and the Tulip Bubble of the 1630s .
It dwarfs the excesses that led to the Great Depression .
Figure 2
Credit bubbles are inherently self - limiting , proceeding until the debt they generate can no longer be supported .
We have already passed that point , and we are now two years into a contraction phase that is about to accelerate .
As the aftermath of a credit bubble is typically proportional to the scale of the excesses that preceded it , we should be in for the largest economic contraction in at least several hundred years , and it will be global .
Real estate , which is a major focus of the mania , should do particularly badly in the coming years ( in fact the coming decades or longer ) .
There is still so much deleveraging ahead , and so many danger signals , such as the scale of the coming interest resets on US mortgages between now and 2012 ( below ) .
While the subprime resets are ending , Alt A and Option ARMs are just beginning .
Figure 3
There will be a very significant undershoot of historically average values , as there always is following a mania ( much more than the Case - Shiller projection below suggests ) .
In my opinion , housing prices are likely to fall at least 90 % on average .
For those who own property on margin , this will be a disaster .
Figure 4
For evidence that this crisis is indeed global , look , for instance , at European housing bubbles , which were worse than in the US .
Figure 5
Figure 6
Unlike inflation , which divides the underlying real wealth pie into smaller and smaller pieces , credit expansion creates multiple and mutually exclusive claims to the same pieces of pie .
Once a credit expansion reaches its maximum extent , and contraction begins , these excess claims begin to be extinguished .
Unfortunately , the leverage is such that there are probably over a hundred claims to each piece of pie .
While contraction begins slowly , as is the nature of positive feedback loops , it picks up momentum until a cascade point is reached , whereupon one can expect the excess claims to be extinguished in a rapid and chaotic process .
This amounts to a rapid collapse in the supply of money and credit relative to available goods and services , which is the definition of deflation .
Figure 7
The scale of the problem has been temporarily concealed by a market rally and the shovelling of tens of trillions of dollars of taxpayer ’s money into a giant black hole of credit destruction .
This has done nothing to reignite lending , but the temporary ( and entirely irrational ) resurgence of confidence has restored a measure of liquidity .
As that confidence evaporates with the end of the rally , that liquidity will also disappear
Banks hold extremely large amounts of illiquid ‘ assets ’ which are currently marked - to - make - believe .
So long as large - scale price discovery events can be avoided , this fiction can continue .
Unfortunately , a large - scale loss of confidence is exactly the kind of circumstance that is likely to result in a fire - sale of distressed assets .
The structure of the credit default swap component of the derivatives market makes this very much more likely .
The CDS market allowed large bets to be placed on certain prices falling , and by entities which did not have to own those assets .
This creates a perverse incentive for some parties to cause others to fail for profit ( akin to me being able to take out fire insurance on your house and thereby give me an incentive to burn it down ) .
An added complication is the extreme degree of counterparty risk that resulted from a complete lack of capital adequacy regulation .
Many parties with winning bets will not be able to collect , so they may cause financial mayhem for nothing .
The CDS market is worth some $ 62 trillion , and a meltdown is very likely in my opinion .
A large - scale mark - to - market event of banks illiquid ‘ assets ’ would reprice entire asset classes across the board , probably at pennies on the dollar .
This would amount to a very rapid destruction of staggering amounts of putative value .
This is the essence of deflation .
I have for a long time argued and believed that there are so many interests vested in protecting our current system that national governments , the IMF and institutions working together would keep the market flooded with liquidity in order to ward off the threat of deflation .
In fact , it seems that a prolonged period of inflation is the only way to diminish our debts .
I sensed at ASPO International in Denver that this was the majority view .
Do you agree that inflation is the most likely near term outcome of current monetary policy ?
Figure 8
Absolutely not .
I agree that this is the consensus opinion , but I see it as fundamentally mistaken .
The debt monetization that is going on has done nothing to increase the supply of money and credit relative to available goods and services , which is the definition of inflation .
Credit contraction dwarfs debt monetization , leaving us in a state of net contraction , even though we have just experienced a large rally lasting months , which should have been the most favourable condition for reigniting lending if such a thing were in fact possible .
I would argue that it is simply not possible and that deflation is inevitable .
Figure 9
Figure 10
Credit bubbles always end this way , with the mass extinguishing of the excess claims debt represents .
They are essentially Ponzi schemes , crucially dependent on the continued buy - in of new entrants .
Globalized finance brought a flood of new entrants following the liberalization of the early 1980s , but there are now no more new sources of wealth to tap .
Deregulation allowed the reckless to gamble away virtually everything , including bank deposits and pension funds .
Globalized finance has created a giant Enron , which while appearing robust is actually almost completely hollowed out .
Such structures implode , often without much notice .
Figure 11
In my opinion , deflationary deleveraging will continue until the ( small amount of ) remaining debt is acceptably collateralized to the ( few ) remaining creditors .
Until that point , there can be no lasting return of the confidence required to rebuild shattered credit markets .
Deflation is ultimately psychological .
Without trust we will see hoarding of the cash which will be very scarce in the absence of the credit that currently comprises the vast majority of the effective money supply .
The combination of scarce cash and a very low velocity of money will be toxic .
Money is the lubricant in the economic engine and without enough of it that engine will seize up as it did in the 1930s , when farmers dumped milk they could n’t sell into ditches while others were starving for want of the money to buy food .
There was plenty of everything except money , and without money , one cannot connect buyers and sellers .
Potential buyers will have no purchasing power as they will have lost access to credit and their ability to earn an income will be hit by spiking unemployment .
Those who still have jobs will find that they have no bargaining power and there is therefore no wage support .
Sellers and producers will have no market and will themselves lose the means to purchase supplies or raw materials for the things they would like to produce .
If conditions remain frozen for any length of time , they will go out of business .
The deeper the collapse , the more protracted the trough and the more difficult the eventual recovery .
Figure 12
I would argue that we have no need to fear inflation until we have reached a trough - until the deleveraging impulse is spent .
We can expect to spend a long time in the liquidity trap , where real interest rates will be much higher than nominal rates , leaving central bankers “ pushing on a string ” .
Some would argue that faced with the unimaginable specter of deflation that governments will seize control of interest rates from the bond market .
Why do you think this may not happen ?
The bond market is far more powerful than governments at this point .
While the international debt financing model remains , the bond market will retain its power to prevent money printing .
Even though governments are not succeeding in increasing the effective money supply for reasons already discussed , they are nevertheless increasing systemic risk with their activities .
This is a recipe for very much higher interest rates as a risk premium .
Governments do not set interest rates , they decide what rate to defend , but if that rate is substantially different from what the bond market requires , then defending it would be ruinous .
Figure 13
I think we are headed ( not imminently but eventually ) for a bond market dislocation , with nominal interest rates on government debt spiking into the double digits .
This will amount to hitting the emergency stop button on the economy , especially since real interest rates will be substantially higher ( the nominal rate minus negative inflation ) .
I am in fact expecting interest rates on private debt to rise before we see problems in the market for government debt , as the latter should benefit substantially in the shorter term from a flight to safety .
The risk premium on private debt is already rising , which is a serious danger signal for such thoroughly indebted societies as we see in the developed world .
But stock markets are booming again , several OECD economies are emerging from recession , unemployment has stabilized , there are green shoots everywhere .
Surely the current QE strategy is working ?
The green shoots are gangrenous .
Some of the largest market rallies on record happened during the course of the Great Depression , as depressions are associated with very high volatility .
Look for instance at the great sucker rally of 1930 .
There are always rallies of all different sizes in any bear market , just as there are pullbacks of all sizes in bull markets .
No market ever moves in only one direction .
People tend to extrapolate recent trends forward , but this amounts to stepping on the gas while looking only in the rearview mirror .
This is one reason why major trend changes are so rarely anticipated .
Another is that the prevailing view of markets is fundamentally wrong .
There is no perfect information , perfect competition , stabilizing negative feedback , rational utility maximization or efficient markets .
Markets are irrational , driven by swings of optimism and pessimism , or greed and fear , in an endless tug of war , and largely in an information vacuum .
Investors chase momentum by jumping on passing bandwagons , hence demand for financial assets increases when prices are rising and falls when prices are falling , in classic positive feedback loops .
Figure 14
We have just lived through a period of several months when greed and complacency were in the ascendancy , but that trend is about to reverse in my opinion .
Looking at markets as constructs of human herding behaviour allows them to be probabilistically predictable , permitting the forecasting of trend changes .
For anyone who is interested in pursuing this idea further , I suggest looking into Bob Prechter ’s socionomics - a fascinating subject which delves into the many effects of changes in collective mood .
For instance , as pessimism deepens , driving economic contraction , one would expect to see many manifestations of collective anger and mistrust .
As this progresses it is likely to lead to xenophobia and a blame - game , with skillful manipulators ( such as the fascist BNP leader Nick Griffin in the UK ) poised to direct the anger of the herd towards their own chosen targets .
The potential for serious social fragmentation is very high when expectations have been dashed and there is not enough to go around .
Having lived through a very long period of manic optimism and increasing inclusion , we in the developed world are not used to expressions of the dark side of human nature , except for entertainment purposes in popular television programmes .
It will come as a considerable shock .
Would you care to give your opinion on where the Dow Jones Industrial Average is headed in the near ( 1 year ) and medium terms ( 2 to 5 years ) ?
I think the market will fall hard ( intervening short rallies notwithstanding ) for perhaps 18 months .
This was the length of the first leg down ( October 2007 - March 2009 ) and so represents a reasonable first guess at how long the next leg at the same degree of trend might last .
I think we will see falls of thousands of points in a series of cascades .
I do n’t see the markets reaching a lasting bottom until probably the middle of the next decade , and even then I do n’t expect it to be a final bottom .
This has been the largest credit bubble in history , and the aftermath of a major bubble always undershoots where it began before any kind of recovery begins .
Figure 15
The aftermath of the last major mania - the South Sea Bubble in the 1720s - lasted decades and culminated in a series of revolutions .
Figure 16
We are still relatively near the beginning of our own crisis , but already it compares with the Great Depression .
How do you see the US$ , gold and oil trading in the same time frame ?
I think almost all assets will fall as price support is knocked out from underneath them , but the dollar should rise initially on a flight to safety .
Scarce cash will be king for a long time , and the value of one ’s currency relative to available goods and services domestically will matter much more for most people than its value relative to other currencies internationally .
In a deflationary scenario , prices fall , but purchasing power typically falls even faster , meaning that everything becomes less affordable despite the lower nominal prices .
Prices in real terms , adjusted for changes in the supply of money and credit , are what matter .
In a world where almost everything is becoming rapidly less affordable , the essentials will be the least affordable of all , as a much larger percentage of a much smaller money supply will be chasing them .
This will confer relative price support .
Although we could initially see a large glut in energy supply as demand falls off a cliff , this is likely to lead to supply collapse as investment dries up , hence I expect energy prices to bottom early in this depression .
Both financial and physical risks to energy exploration are likely to increase substantially in a destabilized and capital constrained world , and even maintaining existing assets could become very difficult .
This is a recipe for much greater state involvement in ownership and exploitation of ( probably deteriorating ) energy assets , with increasing conflict over those assets as supply gets dramatically tighter with lack of investment .
As for gold , I expect it to fall initially as people sell not what they would like to , but what they can , in order to raise the cash they need for living expenses and debt servicing .
Owning gold is likely to become illegal again ( as it did in the Great Depression ) in my opinion .
This would n’t necessarily stop you owning it , but would stop you trading it ( at least without taking major risks ) for other things you might need .
Owning gold now therefore only makes sense if one is confident of being able to sit on it for a very long time , as it will hold its value over the long term as it has for thousands of years .
What will be the consequences for unemployment levels and services provided by government ?
Figure 17
Unemployment will go through the roof as the prospects for selling most goods and services decline dramatically .
In the developed world we are nations of middle men - generally service economies where we make a living figuratively taking in each other ’s laundry .
Most of us produce relatively little .
Even those who do will find almost no market for their exports , and those who could find buyers may not be able to send shipments as credit contraction prevents shippers from getting the letters of credit they need to ship goods .
A glance at what has happened to the Baltic Dry Index ( below ) indicates the difficulties already facing shipping companies .
Figure 18
Unfortunately middlemen are almost completely expendable , and the services of others are likely to become unaffordable for the majority very quickly .
While there will be a huge surplus of labour , and the few who retain purchasing power will be able to hire anyone they want for very little , most people will have to do everything for themselves , as poor people have done throughout history and as most of the population of the world does now .
Not only will we lose access to the paid labour of others , but we will lose our virtual energy slaves as well .
This will represent an enormous fall in the standard of living for the vast majority .
Figure 19
Whereas inflation can conceal a fall in purchasing power , so that people may not even realize it is happening , deflation brutally exposes it .
Wages would have to fall just to keep purchasing power the same , but keeping it the same will not be an option for cash - strapped employers .
In addition , with a large surplus of labour , workers will have no bargaining power .
This is a recipe for exploitation the likes of which we have not seen for a very long time , but in the intervening adjustment period it is likely to lead first to war in the labour markets .
I would expect general strikes and a breakdown in the reliability of centralized services such as healthcare , education , power systems , water treatment , garbage ( and snow ) removal etc .
This will be exacerbated by plunging tax revenues for all levels of government , which governments will try to compensate for by raising taxes , on anyone still capable of paying , to punitive levels .
We would thus expect rapidly deteriorating services at much higher cost .
Figure 20
Figure 21
Many people are at risk of being eventually priced out of the market for goods and services , and particularly the essential ones , entirely .
In my opinion , we stand on the brink of truly tragic circumstances .

In the previous article I ’ve written ( Creating Convincing Images with Blender Internal Renderer - part1 ) , I discussed about creating convincing 3D still images through color manipulation , proper shadowing , minimal lighting , and a bit of post - processing , all using but one application – Blender .
This time , the article you ’re about to read will give us some thoughts on how to mimic a 3D scene with the use of some basic 2D tools .
Here again , I would stress that nothing beats a properly planned image , that applies to all genres you can think of .
Some might think it ’s a waste of precious time to start sitting and planning without having a concrete output at the end of the thought process .
But believe me , the ideas you planned will be far more powerful and beautiful than those ideas you just had , when you were just messing around and playing with the tool directly .
In this article , I would n’t be teaching you how to paint since I ’m not good at it , rather I ’ll be leading you through a series of steps on how to digitally sketch / draw your scenes , give them subtle color shifts , add fake lighting , and apply filter effects to further emulate how 3D does its job .
Primarily , this all leads you into a guide on how I create my digital drawings ( though I admit they ’re not the best of its kind ) , but somehow I ’m very proud , I eventually gave life to them from concept stage to digital art stage .
It might be a bit daunting at first , but as you go along the series , you ’ll notice it gets simpler .
However , some might get confused as to how this applies to other applications since we ’re focusing on The GIMP in this article .
That ’s not a problem at all once you are familiar with your own tool ; it will just be a matter of working around the tools and options .
I have been using The GIMP for a long time already , and as far as I can remember , I have n’t complained on its shortcomings since those shortcomings are only but bits of features which I would n’t be need at all .
So to those of you who have been and are using other image editing programs like Adobe Photoshop , Corel , etc. , you ’re welcome to wander around and feel free to interpret some GIMP tools to that of yours .
It ’s all the same after all , just a tad bit difference on the interface .
Just like what Jeremy Birn has said on one of his books : “ Being an expert user of a 3D Program , bit itself , does not make the user into an artist more than learning to run a Word Processor makes someone into a good writer . ”
Additionally , one vital skill you have to develop is the skill of observation , which I myself ham yet to master .

Patience
Let ’s Get Started !
I would already assume you have the latest version of GIMP installed on your system and is running properly , otherwise , fix the problem or ask help from the forum ( http://www.gimptalk.com).
I ’m also assuming you have all your previous tasks done before sitting down and going over this article ( which I ’m pretty much positive you are ) .
And then lastly , be patient .
Sketch it out
The very first thing we ’re going to do is to sketch our ideas for the image , much like a single panel of a storyboard .
It does n’t matter how good you draw it as long as you understand it yourself and you know what ’s going on in the drawing .
This time , you can already visualize and create a picture of your final output and it ’s great if you did , if not , it ’s fine still .
The important thing is we have laid down our scene one way or another .
You can take your time sketching out your scenes and adding details to them like how many objects are seen , how many are in focus , what colors do they represent , how are your characters ’ facial expressions , what is the size of your image , etc .
So just in case we forgot how it ’s going to look like in the end , we have a reference to call upon and that is your initial sketch .
This way , you ’ll also be affected by the persistence of vision where after hours and hours ( yay ! ) of looking on your sketch , you somehow see an afterimage of what you are about to create , and that ’s a good thing !
I ’m not good at sketching so please bear with my drawing :
After this , it ’s now time to open up The GIMP and begin the actual fun part !
First Run
After executing GIMP , this should ( and most likely ) be the initial screen that ’s going to be displayed on your screen :
The GIMP Initial Screen
We do n’t want Wilbur ( GIMP ’s Mascot ) to be glaring at us from a blank empty window all the time , do we ?
And right now we could go ahead and add a canvas with which we ’ll be adding our aesthetic elements into , but before that you might want to inspect your application and tool preferences just to make sure you have set everything right .
Activate the window with the menu bar at the top ( since we currently have three windows to choose from ) , and then locate Edit > Preferences , as seen below :
Locating GIMP ’s Preferences
GIMP Preferences
Everything you see here should be self - explanatory , if it is n’t , just leave it for the moment and check the manual later , since I ’m pretty much sure that thing you did n’t understand on the Preferences must be something we will not use here .
So go ahead and save whatever changes you did and sometimes , GIMP might ask you to restart the application for the changes to take effect , then do what she says and we should be back on the black canvas shortly after application restart .
By now , we should be having three windows , the main Toolbox Window ( located on the left ) , the main Image Window ( located on the middle ) , and the Layers Window ( located on the right ) .
If , by any chance , the Layer Window is not there , go ahead and activate the Image Window and go to Windows >
Layers or press CTRL + L to bring up the Layer Window .
Showing the Layers Window
Creating the Canvas
Now that everything ’s set up , we ’ll go ahead and add a properly - sized canvas that we ’ll paint on , which will be the entire universe for our creation at a later stage .
Let ’s go and create than now by going to File >
New or by pressing CTRL +
N. A window will pop up asking you to edit and confirm the image settings for the canvas you ’re creating .
You can choose from a variety of templates to use or you can manually input sizes ( which we are going to do ) .
Before that , change the unit for coordinate display to inches just so we could have a better visual reference of how big our drawing canvass will be .
Then on the Width input box , type 9 ( for nine inches ) , and for the Height input box , type 6 ( for six inches ) respectively .
This , however , is a very subjective portion , since you can just have any size you prefer , I just chose nine inches by six inches for the purposes of this article .
Clicking the Advanced Options drop - down menu will reveal more options for you .
But right now , we ’ll never deal with that , just the width and height are sufficient for what we ’ll be need .
When you ’re done setting up the dimensions and settings , click OK to confirm ( is there a chance we could chance the OK buttons to “ Alright ” buttons , which sounds , uhmmm , better ) .
Creating a New Image
At this moment , we should be seeing a blank canvas with the dimensions that we ’ve set awhile back .
Then just at the right window ( Layers Window ) , you ’ll notice there ’s already one layer present as compared to the default which is none .
So everytime we add a new layer ( which is very vital ) , we ’ll be referencing them over to the Layers Window .
Since the creation of the layering system in image editors , it has been a blast to organize elements of an image and apply special effects on them as necessary .
We can imagine layers as transparent sheets overlaying each other to form one final image ; one transparent sheet can have a landscape drawn , another sheet contains trees and vegetation , and another sheet ( which is above the tree sheets ) is our main character .
So together , we see a character with trees on a landscape in one .
But as far as traditional layering is concerned , digital layering has been far more superior in terms of flexibility and the amount of modes we can experiment with .
New Image with Layer
This time might be a good idea to save our file natively , by that I mean save it in a format that is recognizable only by GIMP and that is lossless in format , so whether we save it a couple of times as such , no image compression happens and the image quality is not compromised .
However , the native format is only related to GIMP and is not known elsewhere , so uploading such file to your website will show no image at all because it is n’t recognized by the browser .
In order to make it generally compatible , we export our image to known formats like JPEG , PNG , GIF , etc. depending on your need .
Saving an image file on its native format preserves all the options we have like selections , paths , layers , layer modes , palettes , and many more .
This native format that GIMP uses is known as .XCF which stands for “ eXperimental Computing Facility ” .
Throughout this article , we ’ll save our files mainly in .xcf format and later on , when our tasks are done and we call our image finished , that ’s the time we export it to a readable and viewable format .
Let ’s go ahead and save our file by going to File >
Save , or by pressing CTRL + S.
This brings up a window that we can type our filename into and browse and create the location for our files .
Type whatever filename you wish and append the “ .xcf ” file extension at the end of the filename , or you can choose “ GIMP xcf image ” from a list on the lower half of the window .

The push for accelerated deployment is due to the increased perceived nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea .
It 's believed that many of their nuclear programs could be in development underground , below levels of current bunker - busting bombs ' range .
The Pentagon intends the rapid deployment to send a message that the United States is tweaking strategies to address new threats .
And nothing is more American than advertising the sheer size and tonnage of the bombs hanging below our jets .
It was n't long ago that media watchers , from the crusty to the up and coming , were marking The Politico as a model for success : one half print , one half online , one half arena rock politics .
But Politico has been sliding down the pole of " news ! right ! now ! " — the same one that quickly turned The Huffington Post and Drudge Report into large unintelligible masses of pseudo agitprop .
The 50 - point ( no , 75 - point ) headline — or the siren — is king .
Nothing could be closer to this truth than the piece that ran on POLITICO on Wednesday :
" Roman Polanski backers gave $ 34 k to Barack Obama , DNC "
I 'm not sure what bullet point in the memo linked above mentions equating support for child rapists with support for Obama , but this type of news piece — one that hardly deserves the " news " qualifier — is n't , say , not allowed , nor is it necessarily unfair .
What this piece represents is a type of journalism that simply demands you click on the headline regardless of what lies behind it .
It 's one thing when it comes from The Huffington Post ; as one of thousands of unpaid bloggers there , I do n't expect every headline and columnist to be brimming with relevant and hard - hitting news .
But Politico built its reputation by putting fresh topsiders on the ground and cultivating solid investigative reporting .
No one denies that modern times have called for a recalibration of any given news outlet 's business model .
But this Polanski piece is so lazily inflammatory , so lazily lazy , that it represents what will turn Politico 's front page into something more akin to CNN than the New York Times .
Subjectively and anecdotally , I 've watched Politico referenced less and less by other news outlets .
My political readings take me from The American Scene to Andrew Sullivan , Talking Points Memo to Marc Ambinder , The Next Right to New Majority , and beyond .
Rarely do I see a link to a Politico item that is n't done in chastisement , with the rare exceptions of Ben Smith and Mike Allen .
Politico was once on the path to subverting the mainstream media pecking order with its under - the - radar reporting and its impressive web presence .
But as the Polanski headline exemplifies , they 've become complacent , and now seek mere sensationalism where they used to seek breaking news .
The force behind the above headline is one of the oldest — and most thoroughly disproven — in the land : correlation is causation .
The article does n't come out and say a greater connection exists between President Obama and Roman Polanski other than a handful of donors , but the presumption is transparent .
The template for this kind of story — look at this random connection !
And that one !
And that one !— is one reason that network news and many newspapers are now little more than elaborate megaphones for the shrill .

Canonical announced the very first release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution on October 20 , 2004 .
Five years later , Ubuntu is the star of the Linux desktop and has achieved a level of popularity and mindshare that is unprecedented among the various flavors of the open source operating system .
This ascent to stardom and growing mainstream relevance were driven by a confluence of important technical and philosophical characteristics that differentiate the Ubuntu experience .
In honor of Ubuntu 's fifth anniversary , we are going to look at five ways that Ubuntu has made the Linux platform more human .
1. The Ubuntu Code of Conduct
The Ubuntu Linux distribution is named after an African philosophical principle which holds that the betterment of the individual and community are interconnected .
This philosophy is at the core of Ubuntu development and is formalized in the Ubuntu code of conduct , a simple set of rules that Ubuntu members commit to follow .
Although the contents of the code of conduct are well within the boundaries of common sense , having a codified standard encourages respectful and considerate collaboration , making Ubuntu more inclusive and welcoming to new contributors .
The code of conduct was recently updated to boost its clarity and expressiveness .
Benjamin Mako
Hill , one of the original authors of the code , wrote about its conception in a blog entry today .
" On my first day working for the company that would become Canonical , I talked with Mark Shuttleworth about some ideas for community governance .
Partially in reaction to some harsh behavior in other free software projects we 'd worked on , Mark and I agreed that some sort of explicit standard for behavior in Ubuntu would be a good thing .
Over lunch of what was my literally first day working on Ubuntu , I wrote a draft of code of conduct that was essentially the version that Ubuntu has used until today , " he wrote .
" The code has become a sort of constitution of our community and a widely enforced standard .
People treat the code as a reflection of what ' Ubuntu ' — both the concept and our project — stands for . "
2. Short , time - based release cycles
Ubuntu was born as a derivative of the venerable Debian project .
One of the most serious weaknesses of Debian is its long development cycles and unpredictable release schedule .
Ubuntu adopted a consistent six - month cycle based on the GNOME release model .
This means that users always have access to the latest desktop software .
The predictability has also helped to make Ubuntu popular with hardware vendors .
3 . Easy installation from a single CD image
Ubuntu can be installed from a single CD image which provides a comprehensive desktop environment , including an open source office suite .
The emphasis on delivering a highly refined core environment instead of a software smorgasbord is an important aspect of Ubuntu .
Users do n't have to choose what software they want during the installation process .
Ubuntu is largely responsible for popularizing Live CD installation , a model that has since been adopted by other distros .
Ubuntu is also very easy to install alongside Windows thanks to Wubi .
4. Convenient access to useful proprietary components
Although the Ubuntu developers aim to provide a free and open desktop , the distro makes it easy to install important proprietary components that many users require to have a functioning Linux system .
The difficulty of installing these bits on other mainstream Linux distributions had previously been an impediment to many prospective Linux adopters .
Ubuntu 's restricted driver tool will automatically detect and optionally install proprietary drivers that are required by the user 's hardware .
The distro also includes a codec tool that will help users install the GStreamer packages that they need to play certain video content .
5 . Strong focus on improving desktop usability
The Ubuntu developers are committed to improving usability in the distro itself and in upstream projects that are used in the default Ubuntu installation .
This strong focus on usability has been present since the earliest days of Ubuntu and has grown considerably over the past year .
Canonical recruited a team of professional designers and interaction experts in 2008 and launched the Ayatana project earlier this year as an umbrella for various usability initiatives such as the Papercuts effort .
These aspects of Ubuntu have all contributed to the distro's remarkable success .
Ubuntu has come a long way over the past five years but still has a long road ahead before the infamous Bug # 1 can be closed .
The upcoming release of Ubuntu 9.10 , scheduled for next week , is another important step forward .

The technique has been developed in Ellesmere Port 's waste water treatment works and is being used on maize and rape seed crops .
Dr Son Le , of United Utilities , said : " We could be eating vegetables grown from our waste .
That 's sustainable . "
' Easy to use '
Every year the UK generates millions of tonnes of human waste , so this technique is being hailed as an environmentally - friendly way to dispose of the material .
The fertiliser begins life as sludge , the waste left over after sewage has been treated .
The sludge is then placed in a rotating steam - heated drum , breaking the material down into odour - free pellets , packed with nutrients .
Richard Tomlinson , from Fields Farm in Broxton , Cheshire , trialled the product .
He said : " I 've been very impressed .
The product is easy to use , and generates excellent yields .
" It 's also completely odourless , which means farmers wo n't get complaints from local residents .
I see no reason why it can't take off more widely . "
United Utilities treats an estimated 1.35 million tonnes of sewage every day .
An amendment to the Senate Defense Appropriations bill for FY2010 that was proposed on October 1st by Senator Al Franken and co-sponsored by Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) was brought to the Senate floor today ( info on the Franken Amendment may be found HERE ) .
Today was the day that the Senate finished up its debate on Defense Appropriations ( the House already passed their version of it ) and the last of the amendments were voted on .
The Franken Amendment was one of those that was voted on today .
The text of this amendment reads :
To prohibit the use of funds for any Federal contract with Halliburton Company , KBR , Inc. , any of their subsidiaries or affiliates , or any other contracting party if such contractor or a subcontractor at any tier under such contract requires that employees or independent contractors sign mandatory arbitration clauses regarding certain claims .
Although the legalese of this amendment is quite hard to fully read , it is clear to me that this amendment slams the breaks on the illegal and unethical activities committed by Halliburton and KBR in their contracts overseas .
The motion passed 68 - 30 ( as you can see HERE ) !
Today 's a good day in Congress and it's not often that one says that .
In other news , Thomas Perez was confirmed today as Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice by a vote of 72 - 22 .
He has been waiting in the wings since he was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 4th , but his nomination was held up by Republicans due to his record on immigration and civil rights cases .
Update : A video where Senator Franken calls out KBR for preventing a rape victim in the military from seeking a redress in a court of law .
This is where he proposed his amendment .
Researchers in the US studying two generations of contemporary women found evidence of natural selection among humans that showed we are still evolving despite advances in medical care and standards of living : they predicted that the women ’s descendents will be slightly shorter and chubbier , have lower blood pressure and cholesterol and will have their first children earlier in life .
The study was the work of researchers from Yale University , the University of Pennsylvania and the Boston University School of Medicine who are part of a working group sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham , North Carolina .
A paper on the study is due to be published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The senior author , Dr Stephen C Stearns is Edward P Bass Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale .
Stearns said in a separate statement that :
“ The idea that natural selection has stopped operating in humans because we have gotten better at keeping people alive is just plain wrong . ”
For the research , Stearns and colleagues accessed records from the 60 - year Framingham Heart Study that started in 1948 .
They looked at data on more than 2,000 North American women who had reached menopause and analyzed about half a dozen or so traits that relate to human health in relation to the number of children they had ( a measure of “ reproductive success ” ) over their lifetime .
After adjusting for possible confounders such as income , education and smoking , using statistical models , the researchers estimated the heritability of traits by applying correlations among all relatives and made short - term predictions of how each trait was likely to be passed on to the third generation of women in the study .
They also adjusted for indirect effects of selection by measuring the effect the traits have on each other : such as the extent to which high blood pressure may be linked to lower or higher age of sexual maturity .
The results suggested that :
The women ’s descendents will be slightly shorter and heavier .
Their descendents will also have lower blood pressure and cholesterol .
The women will have their first child earlier , and will reach menopause later in life .
For example , they predicted that the third generation of women in the study will begin their periods a month earlier and experience their menopause a month later than their mothers and grandmothers .
Stearns said :
“ The take - home message is that humans are currently evolving . ”
“ Natural selection is still operating , ” he added .
While the changes may be slow and gradual , the rates they predicted are much the same as we see elsewhere in nature , said the researchers .
“ These results place humans in the medium - to - slow end of the range of rates observed for other living things , ” explained Stearns .
“ But what that means is that humans are n’t special with respect to how fast they ’re evolving .
They ’re kind of average , ” he noted .
“ Natural selection in a contemporary human population . ”

As I already pointed out many times , there are a lot of parallels between the current depression and the one from 1929 .
Some interesting charts Hussman posted on his blog today compare the current bear market rally with the biggest one from the Great Depression :
Here is a chart of the S&P 500 in weekly data .
Note that the market easily and repeatedly breached the lower green bands during the decline , so we should not assume that these bands provide reliable guidance for buying or selling .
The recent advance has moved the market the full distance from lower to upper bands , however , which typically does not go uncorrected .
The following chart may look the same as the above chart .
But it is from April 1930 .
The market recovered by an almost identical percentage following the 1929 crash , peaking in April 1930 , after which it suffered a subsequent decline to fresh lows .
The point here is not that the same outcome will necessarily follow in this instance , but that we would be remiss not to consider the fact that investors were equally cheerful in early 1930 , when the front page of the Wall Street Journal featured an article entitled “ A Turn of the Tide Near ” assuring investors :
“ It can not be imagined that the wholesale failures and interest defaults characteristic of earlier depressions will now be repeated .
Confidence in our banking system wholly precludes the money panics of former eras . ”
Hussman observes the parallels in the index movement from lower to upper bands , and suggests that the current market might be headed in the same direction .
I would recommend to at least seriously consider this possibility in all your decisions .
The key thing to keep in mind in all of this :
The recent rally , green shoots , and recovery hopes have been created and / or fueled by massive government expenses , and by a believe in the omnipotence of our leaders in Washington .
But government spending sprees , too , will have to come to an end sooner or later .
On top of that , all that the recent government programs have accomplished is to get marginal individuals back to the same flawed habits , such as owning unaffordable homes , buying too many cars , etc .
The interest that the government has to pay on its debts when it runs up sky high deficits , and the taxes it will have to raise in order to make those payments , will be hanging over the recovery like a Damocles Sword .
The Federal Reserve , too , will be faced with a similar situation .
Let ’s assume , for the sake of the argument , that lending activity on homes , cars , etc. were to pick up again .
What will the Fed do then ?
Cut interest rates ?
Add more bank reserves ?
Surely not , quite the opposite .
Once existing stimulus programs and credit expansion attempts subside , there wo n’t be much left to pick up the slack .
The consumer wo n’t be able to go back to business as usual unless he goes through a long period of reduced consumption , deleveraging , and savings , a period during which the majority of production and spending inside the US will have to be focused on capital goods , so as to restore a balanced ratio between the production of consumer goods and the production of capital goods .
At the point when these government stimuli wind down , Keynesian clowns will be jumping out of the bushes left and right , and demand that the government take on more debt and spend more money .
But at some point their mindless tirades will no longer appeal to an overtaxed and overleveraged populace .
Their ivory tower nonsense will be way too far detached from simple realities .
Any temporary recovery we witness now , is likely to be remembered as just that , a temporary phenomenon .
All actions taken so far have set the perfect stage for a double dip recession of enormous proportions , the worst possible prolongation of the necessary correction .
If it was our dear government ’s objective to repeat the playbook from the Great Depression one by one , then they have indeed succeeded phenomenally .

ABSTRACT
The viability of implementing an in - memory database , Erlang ETS , using a relatively - new data structure , called a Judy array , was studied by comparing the performance of ETS tables based on four data structures : AVL balanced binary trees , B - trees , resizable linear hash tables , and Judy arrays .
The benchmarks used workloads of sequentially - and randomly - ordered keys at table populations from 700 keys to 54 million keys .
Benchmark results show that ETS table insertion , lookup , and update operations on Judy - based tables are significantly faster than all other table types for tables that exceed CPU data cache size ( 70,000 keys or more ) .
The relative speed of Judy - based tables improves as table populations grow to 54 million keys and memory usage approaches 3GB .
Term deletion and table traversal operations by Judy - based tables are slower than the linear hash table - based type , but the additional cost of the deletion operation is smaller than the combined savings of the other operations .
Resizing a hash table to 232 buckets , managed by a Judy array , creates the most consistent performance improvements and uses only about 6 % more memory than a regular hash table .
Other applications could benefit substantially by this application of Judy arrays .
I ’m not going to hide that we ’re Android enthusiasts and while we try to be as objective as possible , we certainly take more of a liking to Android than , well … any other mobile platform in the history of the universe .
That being said , we understand there is an approaching “ problem ” with Android regarding potential hardware fragmentation .
As Android grows and the number of carriers , manufacturers and handsets rises , developers will face an incredibly diverse range of circumstances on which they need to develop .
Right or wrong ?
Fake Steve Jobs would agree as he compares the Motorola Droid and Sprint HTC Hero :
… let ’s say they ’re both the most amazing pieces of hardware ever invented , way better than the iPhone , purely on a hardware basis .
Now imagine you ’re an app developer .
Maybe you ’ve got a game .
Writing for Android means you do one version for this phone : ( shows Droid ) – and another version for this one : ( shows Sprint HTC Hero ) –
As you may notice , they ’re not very alike .
And let ’s imagine there are loads more of these Android phone models , all slightly ( or very ) different from one another .
Like this new vaporphone that Dell is working on .
And you , lucky Android developer , have the pleasure of trying to guess which models are going to sell enough units to make it worth your while to port your application to them .
He makes it sound really difficult , does n’t he ?
Its mostly smoke , mirrors and yearnful ignorance .
No , you do n’t need to redo your entire application or game for every single phone on the market .
In fact , Google recently addressed this “ issue ” by simplifying every single Android Phone ’s options as being one of 3 screen resolutions :
QVGA ( 240×320 )
HVGA ( 320×480 )
WVGA ( 480 ×854 )
Regardless of the screen ’s actual “ size ” that means that each developer would need to account for THREE different hardware types in terms of the screen .
And it is n’t like the developer needs to totally rework their application .
I was tipped on this article ( and the rebuttal concept ) by Jeff from Codesector.com , the creator of 2 Android applications ( Maverick and Here I Am ) and this is what he had to say :
Hi Rob , After reading ( and laughing at ) this post I made simple screenshot that demonstrated same app on all screen resolutions .
Which include QVGA ( 240×320 ) , HVGA ( 320×480 ) and WVGA ( 480×854 ) .
The point is , Android system can automatically resize apps to any screen resolution – developers do n’t need to adapt their programs to dozens phones .
To make app look better on bigger screens like in Motorola Droid , a folder with hi-res graphics ( e.g. 48x48 px icons in addition to 32x32 px ) should be included in the application .
It ca n’t be more simple than this :)
A little adaptation may be needed for small screen devices , but this is a few minutes of work .
On a QVGA device , Android Market will filter out all apps that do not declare small screens support .
So developers may want to check and update their applications to make them ready for HTC Tattoo and similar phones .
He continued by claiming other hardware variations were being addressed by Google to make it simpler for the developer to account for differences .
For example : does the phone have a D - Pad or trackball ?
In terms of coding an app or game , the developer does n’t have to write separate code for each – the trackball movement is correlated with D - Pad movement and the developer work load is n’t ridiculously increased as iFanboys may want you to believe .
Here is the screenshot from one of Jeff ’s applications that quickly illustrates the same application working on 3 different Android - safe screen resolutions / sizes :
And the iPhone enthusiast might say :
3 > 1 so you lose
But there are three things they are n’t taking into consideration :
Taking 3 screens into consideration does n’t mean 3 times the work
Soon enough there will be more Android Phones than iPhones in the world .
Developers will find it MORE than worth their time to go through a few extra steps to ensure their application is available all over the world , on numerous carriers , on phones made by numerous manufacturers .
And do n’t forget the wild card in all of this – the customer .
Despite what the Fake Steve Jobs , the Real Steve Jobs or any other Steve Jobs thinks – not everyone wants an iPhone .
Not everyone wants a touchscreen .
Not everyone wants a specific screen size , a specific shape , specific capabilities / needs , specific buttons , specific hardware layout , specific look , specific ANYthing .
The iPhone gives customers something very specific and I wo n’t lie – something very good .
But Android gives options .
And being able to choose from lots of very different , very specific and inevitably very good and * gasp * superior options is something many users / customers appreciate .
I hate to burst any bubbles out there but not everyone wants an iPhone .
Being able to choose from hundreds of different phones , knowing they can get pretty much all the same apps on each one regardless of which they prefer is pretty darn amazing .
And … I ’m guessing … it will probably be worth it for the developer to make a few little changes to some images so the user gets a nice view on each screen .
I heard you thinking “ Hundreds of phones ?
Is he on crack ? ”
To answer the latter question , yes .
But the more important of the questions is the “ hundreds ” – am I serious ?
I would n’t be surprised to see 100 +
Android Phones available by next year on a global scale .
Probably the same reason I think those 2012 market share estimations are modest at best .
And the Fake Eric seems to agree .

Green shoots of recovery in New York City ?
How towns and cities cause the extinction of local plants has been revealed for the first time .
An international team of botanists has compared extinction rates of plants within 22 cities around the world .
Both Singapore and New York City in the US now contain less than one - tenth of their original vegetation , reveals the analysis published in Ecology Letters .
However , San Diego , US and Durban , South Africa still retain over two - thirds of their original flora .
Both the pace of urban change and how many plants remain in a city are good predictors of whether plant species will survive there in the future , says the report .
" The rapid and ongoing growth of cities and towns significantly threatens global biodiversity , " says Dr Amy Hahs , a scientist working at the Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne , Australia .
So Hahs and colleagues from universities in Australia , New Zealand , Singapore , the UK and US came together to try to understand how this process occurs , in order to find ways to prevent it happening .
We need to consider vegetation as a long - term investment rather than as a disposable asset
Dr Amy Hahs
For the first time , the team compiled raw data on plant extinctions within 22 urban areas , organised into three categories .
First , they examined cities in which the native flora started to be transformed more than 400 years ago .
Almost all are European cities , including Glasgow in the UK , Vienna in Austria , and Zurich in Switzerland .
Hong Kong is also included as it experienced extensive landscape transformation prior to 1600 AD , before urbanisation .
They also categorised cities in which the native flora started to be transformed after 1600 AD , but before any floral surveys could be completed .
Such cities include New York City and Chicago in the US and Auckland , New Zealand and Singapore .
Urban expansion threatens Melbourne 's native grasses
The third category included cities that had large areas of native flora at the time they were surveyed , but subsequently were transformed by urban development .
Los Angeles and San Diego in the US , Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia and Capetown and Durban in South Africa were included here .
By doing this , the researchers were able to unpick how the history of a town or city influenced how many plants became extinct as a consequence .
Future threats Cities belonging to the first two categories had by far the highest extinction rates .
" For example , Singapore and New York City have both lost 600 species of plants from an initial species richness of 2179 and 1361 species respectively , " says Dr Hahs .
However , in general , cities with more than 30 % vegetation cover had much lower extinction rates .
For example , San Diego and Durban both retain over 60 % of their native vegetation cover , and have both only lost only 11 species each from an initial floral diversity of 926 and 2218 species respectively .
" Under current planning and design practices , it is very hard to maintain 30 % native vegetation within an urban area , but finding ways around this problem either through innovative design or restoration will help preserve local biodiversity , " says Dr Hahs .
Singapore , a pleasant but less green land
The analysis also revealed that more recently built cities can expect to lose a significant proportion of their native plants over the coming decades .
" The cities we expect to lose the most plant species over the next 100 to 150 years are Melbourne and Adelaide , " says Dr Hahs .
Indeed , unless more is done to intervene , the researchers expect Melbourne to lose more than half its 1200 original plant species over the next 100 years .
" If we want to keep plant diversity in our cities , we need to protect and restore areas of native vegetation , " says Dr Hahs .
" Plants and people can coexist in urban areas .
We just need to consider vegetation as a long - term investment rather than as a disposable asset . "

Magnet therapy involves applying the weak magnetic field of permanent magnets to the body , for purported health benefits .
Different effects are assigned to different orientations of the magnet .
Products include magnetic bracelets and jewelry ; magnetic straps for wrists , ankles , knees , and back ; shoe insoles ; mattresses ; magnetic blankets ( blankets with magnets woven into the material ) ; magnetic creams ; magnetic supplements ; plasters / patches and water that has been " magnetized " .
Application is usually performed by the patient .
Last week , Ms. Kransky was invited to an interview for a clerical job with a health insurance company .
She drove her Jeep truck downtown and waited in the lobby of an office building for nearly an hour , but no one showed .
Despondent , she drove home , down $ 10 in gasoline .
For years , the economy has been powered by consumers , who borrowed exuberantly against real estate and tapped burgeoning stock portfolios to spend in excess of their incomes .
Those sources of easy money have mostly dried up .
Consumption is now tempered by saving ; optimism has been eclipsed by worry .
Meanwhile , some businesses are in a holding pattern as they await the financial consequences of the health care reforms being debated in Washington .
Even after companies regain an inclination to expand , they will probably not hire aggressively anytime soon .
Experts say that so many businesses have pared back working hours for people on their payrolls , while eliminating temporary workers , that many can increase output simply by increasing the workload on existing employees .
“ They have tons of room to increase work without hiring a single person , ” said Heidi Shierholz , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute Economist .
“ For people who are out of work , we do not see signs of light at the end of the tunnel . ”
Even typically hard - charging companies are showing caution .
During the technology bubble of the late 1990s and again this decade , Cisco Systems  which makes Internet equipment  expanded rapidly .
As the sense takes hold that the recession has passed , Cisco is again envisioning double - digit rates of sales growth , with plans to move aggressively into new markets , like the business of operating large scale computer data servers .
Yet even as Cisco pursues such designs , the company ’s chief executive , John T. Chambers , said in an interview Friday that he anticipated “ slow hiring , ” given concerns about the vigor of growth ahead .
“ We ’ll be doing it selectively , ” he said .

The whole debate over health insurance has me thinking .
While we consider the millions of Americans without health insurance , we should also be having a debate about homeowners insurance .
It is hard to believe , but in the richest country in the world , there are some that go without homeowners insurance .
How can we as a society tolerate this any longer ?
I think we need to open up the debate and start exposing the evil homeowners insurance companies that are greedy and always looking for a big profit .
These companies do n't actually do anything except charge premiums and then occasionally pay out on claims .
The difference is excessive profits that benefit the executives .
We need to make homeowners insurance affordable and available to everyone .
No one should have to go without it .
First , we need mandates on these insurance companies that say they can't discriminate .
These greedy companies think it is okay to discriminate if you have a pre-existing condition .
There are people who have had major fires or floods that have severely damaged homes and now they are being prevented from buying insurance .
This is pure discrimination and we should not allow this to happen as a society .
The next thing we need to do is to get state legislatures to start mandating that these insurance companies cover more things .
There are millions of homeowners with leaky faucets and stained carpets .
They should not have to live like this .
Insurance policies should cover these things .
It is not right that some should have to walk around with a stained carpet while rich people can get new carpet on a regular basis .
The insurance companies should be forced to cover such things in their policies .
You should also know that when you get your free carpet cleaning , covered by your insurance , that it could only be done by a government - licensed professional .
Now we must discuss unfair competition .
We need states to enact laws that prevent people from buying homeowners insurance from other states .
It is ridiculous that someone from Florida can buy insurance from some company in North Carolina .
This hurts the people of Florida by exporting jobs .
Florida residents should be forced to buy homeowners insurance from companies within Florida that benefit the workers of Florida .
It might be argued that the federal government should override this using the Commerce Clause in the Constitution .
We must remember that the Commerce Clause provides the federal government the power to do anything .
But in this particular instance , the federal government should respect states ' rights and not interfere .
Hopefully , buying your own homeowners insurance wo n't be an issue anyway , since you should be provided this as a benefit from your employer .
It would make perfect sense for the federal government to set up the tax code and other regulations that encourage businesses to provide homeowners insurance coverage to their employees .
These businesses can afford it and people should not be expected to go out and have to shop around for their own policy .
If all of these measures are not enough and some homeowners are still without insurance ( although , how could that be , since these measures would surely lower costs ) , then the federal government should step in and provide a government option .
People will be mandated to have homeowners insurance or they will pay a fine or else go to jail .
But do n't worry , because the government option will help those in need .
After all , what is the government for if it is not to take care of people ?
We are a compassionate and caring society with a lot of wealth .
We should care for our fellow human beings .
In our times , nobody should go without homeowners insurance .
Let 's get state governments and the federal government to fix this problem .

ALBANY — Most lobbyists come to the Capitol with a briefcase , a position paper and a cellphone .
At least one arrived with a pot plant , and for this she must answer .
Abigail Storm - Eggink , 58 , does n't deny she 's the owner of the two 18 - inch plants cops took from her in separate incidents recently .
One was confiscated by the Albany Police Department on June 30 as she carried it down Pearl Street on her way to the Capitol , where the Kingston woman and her 71 - year - old husband , Dan Eggink , have been coming regularly for 14 months — including the past 10 weeks straight , five days a week — to protest pot laws .
" The police ( officer ) told me not to walk the street with it , to put it in a plastic bag , " she said .
A couple of days later , she brought a second plant covered by a bag , and got it past the Capitol 's security screeners .
It was on the same afternoon as a plant sale outside Empire State Plaza .
For two days , Storm - Eggink and her husband had paraded outside the government complex with the weed .
But on July 3 , according to a court document , after she brought it inside and used it as a visual aid while confronting senators in the corridors , she was charged by State Police with unlawful possession of a controlled substance as soon as she stepped out onto the landing on State Street .
Storm - Eggink and her husband say they have been called by God to right a wrong .
She refused a chance to settle the two cases — which have been merged — with the offer of an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal .
" That would mean I 'm guilty , " she said .
" I do n't want to plead guilty .
The whole purpose is to expose fraud .
I want my plants ; they have value .
It belonged to the people .
God gave it to the people . "
Storm - Eggink hopes to use the trial before City Court Judge Rachel Kretser to make a larger case based on the First Amendment , religious freedom and what she sees as the inalienable right to the bounty of the land — including marijuana .
Storm - Eggink , who plans to represent herself , is to appear Friday morning on the charges .
The offense carries a charge of no more than 15 days in jail .
Storm - Eggink and her husband have become fixtures in Albany .
Besides their daily lobbying vigil at the Capitol — where the couple have made their case to lawmakers , legislative aides and reporters — they 've taken up their " Free Marijuana " sign and attended every Alive At Five concert at the Corning Preserve .
They are eager to complete the series with this Thursday 's show , which aptly enough features Bob Marley 's reggae band , The Wailers .
The couple say they grow and use pot for many purposes and that all New Yorkers should be free to do so without fear of arrest .
Hemp , they say , can be used for many consumer products that are mostly imported now , and for medical purposes , although they oppose a proposed medical marijuana bill that would restrict legal use to very sick people .
Dan Eggink says he wishes his first wife , who died of cancer in 1977 , had been able to use the oils from cannabis .
He 's convinced the herbal treatment kills cancer cells .
( Needless to say , this theory falls well outside conventional medicine . )
Eggink says he and his wife " are on a mission from God — like the Blues Brothers . "
The two have moved around , but have lived in and around Woodstock for two decades .
" We 've lived on everything from sinking houseboats to penthouses in Manhattan and Paris , " he said , adding that like - minded people have aided their activism .
" In Albany , a lot of people smoke pot and keep it secret . "
The couple , who have seven children , have also been homeless .
They support themselves as they can , and help pay for their New York Citizens Against Marijuana Prohibition campaign partly from a settlement in an accidental death case involving their son , who was shot by an acquaintance who was playing with a faulty pistol .
They were arrested and convicted once before on a pot charge , in 1977 in Eugene , Ore .
A person they knew entrapped them , they said , when they took $ 10 from him and gave him a bag of " very good cannabis . "
They paid a $ 100 fine .
Sen . Marty Golden , R - Brooklyn , a former New York City police officer who was seriously injured during a drug bust , said he hopes Storm - Eggink gets the book thrown at her .
" You can advocate for anything in this state , but when you start to bring in samples that are illegal , then it 's illegal , " he said .
" I hope she gets the max . "
Golden said he does not like to see drug props , and is still upset with Sen. Ruben Diaz Sr. for holding up bags of sugar during the debate over restructuring the Rockefeller Drug Laws to show how little an eighth of an ounce of cocaine is .
Sen .
Hugh Farley , R - Niskayuna , a business law professor , said the pot activists do n't bother him , and he considers them " kind of funny . "
" They were n't obnoxious ; they were n't in your face , " he said .
" Every time we came out of conference they tended to be there .
I do n't think they were taken seriously by anybody ; I do n't think their issue is taken seriously by anyone .
In my judgment they were just trying to get attention . "

When Rose Watson moved into her Nottingham home nine years ago , there was no central heating , the gas heater in the living room was leaking carbon monoxide , and any warmth in the building tended to leach out of the draughty single - glazed windows .
Her gas bill was huge ; her priority was the battle to keep her house warm , never mind carbon footprints .
" I thought , if the money 's there and I need gas , I 'll just put it on , " she says .
Watson , a beauty therapist , used to think nothing of jumping into her car to drive to the nearest shops , a short walk away at the end of her road .
Her hair straighteners stayed on standby all day , and her children would leave mobile phone chargers and games consoles switched on even when they were n't being used .
" It was easy for me to switch something on and just forget about it , " she says .
" Lights would be on all the time – I 'd walk into a room and see a light on and would n't turn it off . "
But even with the heating left on , the house where she lives with her partner and three children stayed cold .
Finally , when she was pregnant with her youngest son , who is now five , things changed .
Fed up with rising energy bills and an uncomfortable home , Watson agreed to take part in a telephone survey about her energy use .
In return for answering some questions , she would get some energy - saving lightbulbs and tips on how to make her house more environmentally friendly .
Over the next two years , following the tips from the Energy Saving Trust ( EST ) and others , Watson got hooked on simple ways to green her home .
Her paper - thin loft insulation was topped up to the recommended 200 mm , energy - saving lightbulbs went up in all the rooms , the single - glazed windows were replaced with double - glazing , and draught excluders were fixed under all the doors and around the front door .
She even blocked up the hatch between the dining room and kitchen to stop draughts blowing through the rooms .
At its most energy hungry in 2007 , the three - bedroom end - of - terrace , built around the 1930s , used around £ 19 of gas in winter and £ 17 of electricity per week .
" Now it 's about £ 11 on gas and it's not even been on since Christmas , " says Watson .
" The electricity is now £ 9 per week . "
A rough calculation by the EST shows that Rose 's family has halved its carbon footprint at home since 2007 .
Energy use in homes accounts for more than a quarter of the UK 's carbon emissions , so retro-fitting houses with energy - saving measures will play an important role in most households that sign up to 10:10 , the Guardian - backed campaign to persuade people to reduce their emissions by 10 % in 2010 .
Making your house energy efficient is an easy way to cut a large part of your carbon footprint : it also , as Watson has found , saves money .
In the winter , she used to set the central heating thermostat to at least 22C and often higher .
Now it never rises above 16C .
" Before , every single room used to be constantly hot but now I 've got used to the cold and I just stick a jumper on , " she says .
Her children have also been trained to keep their energy consumption down .
" The kids will let their phone drain out of power now – before they 'd charge it just for the fun of it , if the battery had gone down by one bar they 'd just charge it back up .
But now they let it run out first . "
She insists they never leave anything on standby .
" It 's not that much effort – once they 've stopped playing with something , they 'll just turn it off at the plug . "
" If it 's not being used then I turn the Wii off , " says her son , seven .
" If a light 's on in a room and no one 's in it then I turn it off . "
Watson says her mother never taught her about saving energy because , she suspects , it was n't a necessary part of her lifestyle then .
" At least if I teach my family , they can get it into their head .
If one family can do it , 10 more can do it , a hundred can do it . "
Water is also used with care .
She never fills the kettle with any more than she needs , long ago turned down the washing machine cycle from 60C to 30C , and the whole family have switched from baths to showers , so using less water .
( Hot water is an important chunk of a home 's carbon footprint : the EST calculates that Britons could save 30 % of the carbon emissions associated with heating household water by following simple advice such as lagging pipes and using low - flow taps .
It estimates that installing just a few water - saving measures could save a typical household hundreds of pounds a year on combined water and energy bills . )
This year , Watson 's family made one of their biggest sacrifices .
Normally they would jet off to Greece or Spain for the summer holidays but , this time , their destination was closer to home : Bournemouth .
This is one sacrifice that might not stick , though .
Holidays are about getting some good weather , says Watson , and Bournemouth was n't too impressive on that front .
Next year it might be back to the Mediterranean .
On the plus side , the family has become less reliant on its car habit .
Travelling across the country to visit friends or family still involves driving ( trains are too costly ) but going to the local shops now means a walk or a bike ride .
When her son needs to get to football practice , Watson arranges shared lifts with other local families .
Caroline Rams of the EST says Watson shows what an average British family can achieve with ease when trying to make their first cut in carbon emissions .
" Rose has a busy life and a large family who certainly keep her on her toes .
Yet she has always found time to prioritise her energy - saving behaviour ; so much so that it has become second nature .
She is the perfect example of how you do n't have to change too much of your lifestyle to become green . "
It 's simple to think of Watson and her family as selfless green pioneers , cutting their consumption for the sake of the planet .
She is more pragmatic about her actions , though .
" I do n't wake up and think I need to save the world ; really it 's about benefiting your purse first .
But I do get worried about the environment sometimes because I have children and they 'll have to deal with it . "
Watson 's partner agrees that saving energy and reducing carbon footprints are practical necessities .
" Oil 's going to run out , is n't it , " he says .
" The market will then dictate things – as energy gets more scarce , the cost will go up and that will drive people to actually conserve energy . "
He thinks more people need to get as active as Watson in dealing with the carbon footprint of their homes .
" The basic fault is that people do n't realise that the cumulative amount can be a lot .
One house can't do it , everyone 's got to do their bit .
Everyone 's little bit adds up to a lot . "

Mm , the art is beautiful * nods *
Just horrendously godawful writing , plot , and most of the basic design ;D I loved the free exploration , but that 's more a case of ' not ' doing something - deigning not to clutter their world with more awful quests so we can ' make our own ' .
Would have been far better as a standalone game paying homage to Fallout .

The reality is that the New Atheist campaign , by discouraging religion , wo n't create a new group of intelligent , skeptical , enlightened beings .
Far from it :
It might actually encourage new levels of mass superstition .
And that 's not a conclusion to take on faith -- it's what the empirical data tell us .
" What Americans Really Believe , " a comprehensive new study released by Baylor University yesterday , shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology .
It also shows that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations , far from being resistant to superstition , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians ....
This is not a new finding .
In his 1983 book " The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener , " skeptic and science writer Martin Gardner cited the decline of traditional religious belief among the better educated as one of the causes for an increase in pseudoscience , cults and superstition .
He referenced a 1980 study published in the magazine Skeptical Inquirer that showed irreligious college students to be by far the most likely to embrace paranormal beliefs , while born - again Christian college students were the least likely . [ 2 ]
”
Men who are sympathetic , kind , co-operative and warm are unlikely to end up as bosses .
To some extent the same applies to women .
That might not come as a surprise , but a study has provided firm evidence of the link between personality and job choice .
" People who are n't very nice are more likely to become managers , " said Michelle Tan , a researcher in the economics program at the Research School of Social Science , at Australian National University , and co-author of the study .
The research found a strong link between personality type and many , though not all , jobs .
The results differed for men and women .
Males and females tended to enter different occupations even though they had similar personality traits and skills .
Even when they had the same occupations , similar men and women took home widely different pay packets .
The study used a sample of 5397 men and women drawn from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey .
It sought to understand the extent to which personality determined occupation and whether this could explain the gender pay gap .
Good RPGs invariably lead to good stories .
I have a love / hate affair with this particular story .
Do n’t get me wrong , it ’s pretty damn awesome .
I ’m just a little sick of it because a ) I ’ve been repeating it for the last five years and b ) no matter how many games I GM I ’ll never do anything this cool ever again .
Before we begin I need to lay down a little bit of background story .
You know it ’s good when the story has required reading before you can even begin the story .
I ’ve always been bothered by insanity in RPGs .
It often ends up being run as a player having private conversations with the GM .
Everyone sits by patiently while the player has a conversation in his head and when its done they all nod and smile happily .
If the player is competent he ’ll act as though the private conversations were real , but everyone knows they ’re not .
At best you get a character whose intelligence is questioned .
The rest of the time they end up as comic relief .
That ’s not how insanity works .
Let ’s go with schizophrenia for an example ( it ’ll come up later in the story ) .
The problem is n’t that there are voices in your head .
The problem is that you ca n’t distinguish those voices from the people talking to you in real life .
This leads to wonderful roleplaying opportunities , but is incredibly hard to model in a tabletop game .
How can you put voices in a player ’s head without him noticing the GM whispering in his ear ?
Fast forward to the spring of 2003 .
I was preparing to run my first RPG ever .
Some players were old and some were new , but all were willing to cooperate with a first time GM trying to learn the ropes .
I had two problems .
The first was the ranger .
Phelmore if I remember correctly .
The player wanted to be somewhat crazy and picked bipolar disorder .
Cool .
I wanted the player to be a lot crazy .
Like , crazy as in what we discussed in this story ’s backstory .
But I did n’t see how to do it .
The next problem was more of a group thing .
I wanted exactly four players .
This would let me write plenty of individual plot and give each player a bigger chance in the shared spotlight .
Maybe in the future I ’d learn how to write for a bigger group , but I really wanted to start with four .
Some of the players disagreed .
They were used to bigger groups ( 6 - 8 ) and thought I should run with five , bare minimum .
So I put the problems together and got a solution .
I told the players about my buddy Jason who was going to be living with me next semester .
He was from out of town but I wanted my home friends to meet with my college friends so I ’d invited him to be our fifth .
He was going to play a cleric who belonged to the same adventurers school as Phelmore .
In fact the two of them knew each other pretty well .
They ’d start the game as allies on some sort of investigation to track down a murderer .
The players seemed cool about it .
I neglected to tell them that Jason and his PC did n’t exist * .
First session starts and we ’re waiting for Jason to show up .
We ’re doing individual preludes for each character so I ’m able to run everyone else .
Eventually I pick up the phone .
“ What ?
You ca n’t make it ?
Shit , that sucks .
Will did the mechanic give an estimate .
Damn .
Well good luck . ”
Etc. Jason would not be joining the first session .
I ran Phelmore ’s prelude , NPCing as Jason ’s PC ( whose name I wish I could remember right now .
Let ’s just call him Tyler for obvious reasons ** ) .
I improvised a plot that would separate Tyler and Phelmore at least until imaginary Jason ’s imaginary car got fixed .
Basically Tyler would track down the murderer they were after and Phelmore would go on the PC ’s quest .
But while they were doing this , Phelmore and Tyler would communicate by letter ( the game world ( the only time I homebrewed ) had an advanced postal system ) and this would let them take advantage of it .
I was encouraging players to keep journals .
Phelmore ’s journal would take place in the form of a letter to keep Tyler up to date with the game .
And in turn I responded with letters from Tyler ’s point of view about the murderer he was chasing .
As a point of clarity , what was actually going on with the letters is that Phelmore would write letters each night addressed to Tyler .
He ’d then become Tyler and read the letter and respond to it .
Okay , so this is multiple personality disorder moreso than schizophrenia .
So shoot me .
The letters never actually got sent and were stored in boxes in the PC ’s backpack .
But something in his subconscious kept him from ever noticing that the boxes of letters were there .
He seemed normal enough during the beginning of the game .
The manic depressiveness played a greater role in the character ’s insanity .
Jason could n’t afford to repair his car , but I ’d been running plot with him simultaneously over IM .
Eventually the plots would converge I promised .
People soon realized that something was up with Phelmore though .
His wounds disappeared over night ( his other side was a cleric after all ) .
And when the group spent a night together in prison they noticed him muttering holy words in his sleep .
There were more details , but those were the only two I can remember five years later .
At any rate , the players knew he had some plot going on but were n’t in any position to investigate it yet .
Fast forward to the second to last session of the game ( which is n’t much fast forwarding as the game was only 8 sessions long ) .
The players are in an underground library camping for the night .
They ’d done something to piss off the mafia .
As such , the mafia sent out some arcane tricksters to kill of the PCs .
On the off chance that someone woke up , the tricksters took the PCs gear away first and then went in for the kill ( I really just wanted to see the players win a fight without relying on magical equipment ) .
Players woke up , killed the attackers , and everyone took back their gear .
Except for that strange box that nobody recognized .
Narro , the quintessential bloodlust halfling rogue , took it .
The box was full of letters from Phelmore to Tyler .
Now , I ’ve always been aware that players will draw all sorts of conclusions .
That ’s why you should n’t plan for specific directions your players can take , but you should plan a robust world than can handle impulsive players .
I never would have expected the reaction the players took , and yet it was so perfect .
Phelmore ’s recovered backpack contained all the letters he thought he sent to Tyler .
Obviously the mafia guys kidnapped
Tyler , got his letters , and somehow used them to track down Phelmore .
The PCs had to return to the city , so they could infiltrate the mafia and rescue the ranger ’s imaginary friend !
Seriously , what could be more perfect than that ?
The players got captured by the mafia and I got more heavy handed with my hinting regarding Phelmore .
I was amazed that they had n’t figured him out yet , but I wanted to make sure that his story came up during game time .
The murderer Tyler was allegedly tracking just so happened to be working in the mafia and he recognized Phelmore .
The player just chalked that one up to Phelmore chasing that guy during his prelude .
Oh well .
While the PCs were being interrogated , a mind flayer licked Phelmore ’s head and was confused .
He said it had a lot of flavor , or something to that effect and that he ’d need a cigarette before he could analyze that character any further .
Then the PCs made their escape .
I was really glad they threw me the mafia plot line , because I truly had no idea how to entertain them for this second to last session .
Oh yeah , while they were there they picked up some information concerning the whereabouts of the big bad evil guy .
He has n’t been mentioned yet because as far as I ’m concerned the real meat of the game was the imaginary player plot .
So begins the last session .
At this point the players knew Jason was never gong to be gaming with them , but they had n’t put everything together yet .
The players tracked the BBEG to his lair and were preparing for a big fight .
Part of their preparation included a spell by the name of Rary ’s Telepathic Bond .
This let them communicate telepathically .
When the Telepathic Bond went up on Phelmore they got line noise .
Or something .
I ’m not sure exactly how I described it .
But the gnome wizard ( who was the player I made sure saw all of Phelmore ’s hints ) figured things out .
The rest of the group had a private meeting to discuss what they learned .
( Sidenote leading back to my first point about insanity – it made me very happy that Phelmore ’s player was the last one in on his insanity .
He knew his reality was screwed up but could n’t tell how .
They figured it out and then brought the problem to him . )
Once again , I ca n’t remember the conversation that took place except for the tail end .
The three other players were figuring out how to break the news to poor Phelmore .
The uberintelligent gnome wizard , Fnipper , and the charming halfling rogue / bard , Narro , were not up to the task .
No matter how well thought out or nicely they said it , they could n’t predict how Phelmore would react to being told he was insane .
Instead they gave the task to the half orc barbarian who called himself Thug .
The logic was that Phelmore would likely flip out and attack the bearer of this news , and Thug was the one who could take such an attack .
It was a good choice .
Once they calmed him down , the players made Phelmore practice with a greatsword ( Tyler ’s favorite weapon ) .
They were able to confirm he knew what he was doing with it ( in mechanics terms they found out that he had weapon focus greatsword , even though Phelmore never took it ) .
I think they also had him use a Telepathic Bond on himself to ease communications between his two sides .
I may be making that last part up though .
Did I mention that it ’s been a while .
In the end , Phelmore / Tyler had an epiphany and became one .
Phelmore gained Tyler ’s cleric levels and became powerful enough to defeat the BBEG .
So , in summary I made up a player and told the players he’d be joining us as a way to simulate schizophrenia / multiple personality disorder .
The players bought it and nobody figured out what was going on until the very last day of game .
They even declared war on the mafia to save the ranger ’s imaginary friend along the way .
When I tell this story to other GMs , they ’re awed .
Not to brag , but I ’m still amazed at what I pulled off .
It was my very first attempt at being a game master .
And as awesome as that was , I know that I ’ll never pull off anything that cool again .
* Okay , I lied a little .
Jason did exist and he was a D&D player who I ’d be rooming with the next semester .
He was in on the plan but was n’t actually going to be gaming with us .
I picked someone who could be a warm body for the imaginary PC if ever I needed to get bailed out on this plot .
Never needed him , but I was glad to have a backup plan .
** Yes , I blatantly ripped off Fight Club .
I did n’t even bother to hide it .
But it worked because of how the plot was unveiled to the players .
They did n’t know it was a movie rip off until they ’d played through it .
This extended story is the best example I can give to justify my article on creativity theft .
More details have come to light since I spoke with Phelmore ’s player .
Tyler was actually named Ellessor .
That jogged my memory a little .
‘ Ellessor ’ was another hint I put in the game , but did n’t expect the players to pick up on .
According to the Tolkien elvish dictionary , Ellessor is quenya for ‘ in your head . ’
Suppose you write a program and you send the source code to two of your friends , $ {\cal A} $ and $ {\cal B}$ .
Your two friends read the code and when they finish , $ A$ errors are detected by $ {\cal A}$ , $ B$ errors are detected by $ {\cal B}$ , and $ C$ errors are detected by both .
So , in total , $ A+ B−C $ errors are detected and can now be eliminated .
We wish to estimate the number of errors that remain unnoticed and uncorrected .
The original version of this problem concerns manuscripts and proofreaders , instead of source code and programmers .
It was posed and solved by George Polya and published in 1976 on The American Mathematical Monthly under the name of Probabilities in Proofreading .
Because the problem is interesting and Polya ’s solution is short and elegant , I have decided to record and share it .
Also , since code sharing and reading is a frequent activity in the software development world , estimating the desired value can be helpful for some readers of this blog .
Estimating the number of unnoticed errors
Let $ E $ be the number of all errors , noticed and unnoticed , in the source code .
Our goal is to estimate the value of $ E - ( A+ B - C ) $ .
Let $ p $ be the probability that friend $ {\cal A}$ notices any given error and $ q $ the analogous probability for friend $ {\cal B}$ .
The expected number of errors that may be detected by $ {\cal A}$ is $ E{\cdot}p $ and by $ {\cal B}$ is $ E{\cdot}q $ .
Assuming that these probabilities are independent , the expected number of errors that may be mutually detected by both friends is $ E{\cdot}p{\cdot}q $ .
Because we are interested in an estimate , we can safely assume that the expected numbers are approximately equal to the number of errors detected , that is , $ E{\cdot}p \sim A$ , $ E{\cdot}q \sim B$ , and $ E{\cdot}p{\cdot}q \sim C$ .
( We use the notation $ \sim$ to denote that two numbers are approximately equal . )
We now have all the ingredients to conclude the solution .
Recall that our goal is to estimate the value of $ E - ( A+ B - C ) $ .
We calculate : >
$ $ \beginproof \pexp {E - ( A+ B - C ) } \hint {=} {we rewrite $ E$ to prepare the introduction of $ A$ , $ B$ , and $ C$} \pexp{\frac{E{\cdot}p{\cdot}E{\cdot}q}{E{\cdot}p{\cdot}q} - ( A+B - C ) } \hint{ \sim} {assumption on estimates} \pexp{\frac{A{\cdot}B}{C} - ( A+B - C ) } \hint{=}{arithmetic} \ pexp{\frac{( A-C) {\cdot}( B-C)}{C}~~.} \endproof $ $
This is the desired estimate !

This month 's issue of WIRED features a great story by Amy Wallace : " An Epidemic of Fear : How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All . "
It 's an overview of the anti-vaccination movement in the United States , a topic that should be very familiar to anyone who reads Discover 's baddest astronomer .
At ScienceBlogs , Orac and Abel Pharmboy gives big thumbs - up to the article .
The anti-vaccination movement is a little weird -- they claim that vaccines , which are universally credited with wiping out smallpox and polio and other bad things , are responsible for causing autism and diabetes and other also - bad things , all just to make a buck for pharmaceutical companies .
The underlying motivation seems to be a combination of the conviction that things must happen for a reason -- if a child develops autism , there must be an enemy to blame -- and a general distrust of science and technology .
Certainly the pro-science point of view is fairly unequivocal ; like any medicine , vaccines should be used properly , but they have done great good for the world and there are very real dangers of increased risk for epidemics if enough children stop receiving them .
Good for WIRED for taking on the issue and publishing an uncompromisingly pro-science piece on it .
But the anti-vax movement is more than just committed ; they 're pretty darn virulent .
And since the article came out , author Amy Wallace has been subject to all sorts of attacks .
She 's been documenting them on her Twitter feed , which I encourage you to check out .
Some lowlights :
It 's pretty horrifying stuff .
But there is good news :
Wallace also reports that the large majority of emails she has received were actually in favor of the piece , and expressed gratitude that she had written it .
There are strong forces arrayed against science , but the truth is on our side , and a lot of people recognize it .
It gives one a bit of hope .
Amongst the little Common Lisp projects I have been working on at ITA , that we have published as free software , there is single - threaded - ccl , a small modification to Clozure CL ( CCL ) that allows it to start and run in a single thread .
Why is that hack necessary at all ?
Because I 'd like to do useful computations in forks ( including but not limited to parallel compilation with POIU or XCVB or robust Erlang - style concurrency ) , but ( a ) the upstream CCL insists on always spawning ancillary threads during system initialization to manage interactive I/O , and ( b ) threads pretty much guarantee that most attempts to compute in a fork will result in massive instability .
I 'll cover the first issue quickly , but the second issue is what I will develop .
Unhappily regarding the first issue , Gary Byers , the top CCL author and maintainer , has expressed his disinterest in providing an option for single - threaded startup in the upstream CCL , even though I offered that I could do the porting and maintaining myself .
Note that such supported interface would probably involve more than my small hack : my hack sacrifices some interactive features , meaning that you have to manually call finish - output to flush your output stream buffers before you may expect the user to see what you printed ( which you should do to be standard - compliant anyway ) , and to that you need to manually poll for any Ctrl - C interrupts to have them processed .
Yet supporting the option would n't be hard , as long as you do n't care too much for interrupts : 1 - you 'd have to refactor and clean up the startup process , which would be a good thing anyway , and 2 - you 'd have to do the right thing with streams , which is just a special variable away ( like Perl 's $ | ) , though it would probably be better to keep an interactive ?
slot in the stream class ( possibly initialized by default from such special variable ) .
Now , getting interrupts right may be tricky ( and may involve some of the PCLSRing issues discussed below ) but I 'm sure the target audience of the single - threaded - ccl , who write system software , would be quite happy to live with that restriction .
There is little to add to this issue , so I 'll say no more .
The second issue is more interesting .
The conclusion is that if you have threads when you fork , the only safe things to do are pretty much to either call execve ( 2 ) or to dump a core ( 5 ) , unless you go through excruciating pains to otherwise make it work .
These excruciating pains are what I 'd like to walk you through .
The reason that fork does n't marry well with threads is that when you fork , the child process will have only one active thread ( a copy of the one that forked ) in an address space that is a copy ( on write by either party ) of the memory of the parent process ; therefore , all the data structures that are being shared by the current thread with other threads may be in whatever transient state these threads ( not to speak about signal handlers ! ) may have been putting them at the moment the kernel copied the address space ( which itself may or may not be atomic when multiprocessors are involved ) .
The consequence is that unless the forking thread took care to hold a lock on each and every single shared data - structure that the child might possibly need to use ( which might involve properly blocking signals ) , any of these data - structures may have been made available to the child in an unusable state that is completely unfixable ( including it possibly being unsafe to attempt to reclaim associated resources ) .
Thus , unless you can solve this difficult concurrency problem , if you use fork and want to continue useful computations in the child , you must eschew the problem and either fork before any other thread is started , or after all other threads have exited cleanly — and you cannot just kill threads , for the same reason that they might be in the middle of modifying shared data - structures at the time you would shoot them down .
Alternatively , you might not care at all about continuing any computation in the child process with any of the datastructures that these other threads may be accessing : you might be about to execve ( 2 ) a new program without the need for any of those datastructures to setup that call , or you might be about to dump a core in the middle of the ( possibly suspect ) computation for purely analytic purposes without the need to resume computation afterwards .
Or you have indeed protected the few datastructures you care for with appropriate locks , and might not care about the minefield in the rest of your address space because you know that neither your child process nor any of the libraries that it uses will ever roam in that minefield ( not even through a signal handler ) nor need to reclaim the memory resources .
But what if you want to actually solve the difficult problem ?
What if you want to achieve multithreaded PCLSRing and synchronize all your threads in a state that is stable enough for the child to resume computations ?
The problem is solvable in theory ( indeed was a topic of my PhD thesis ) , and there even exist tools to solve it in practice , though we may soon find these tools to be lacking .
Speaking of tools , some smart ass may point you at an interface function meant to help you solve the problem somewhat modularly : pthread_atfork .
But the existence of this function does n't guarantee that it will be used properly , or even that it is possible to use it properly .
Indeed , you can grep ( 1 ) in vain for calls to it in most libraries , including allegedly thread - safe libraries and downright multithreaded libraries ; you 'll find that few if any use atfork at all .
But do n't blame the library authors too fast before you consider the cost / benefit analysis of even trying to use this interface properly .
First problem is , when you attempt to grab all those locks you need , you not only have to track down what all those locks are , you also have to order them properly .
Indeed , if one thread tries to grab lock A then lock B , while another thread tries to grab lock B then lock A , then you are due for a deadlock ; and even if you modify your code so the second thread will back out of B after failing to get A before it tries again , then for all your efforts you may avoid the deadlock but still have a livelock .
The only safe and live solution is there should be a clear dependency ( partial ) order between locks , and that you should never try to grab a higher - level lock while holding a lower - level lock .
Now , if your atfork is trying to grab all the locks , then you have to define a total order that is compatible with the previous partial order , and if two threads attempt to each compute such a total order , they better agree on the topmost element for whichever common subset of locks they are trying to grab .
In the case of simple low - level C libraries without dynamic datastructures , getting such an order should be straightforward : each library would have a global lock and only call lower - level libraries , so you 'd grab the higher level library lock first , then the lower level library lock ; hopefully , the way your linker works , it calls initializers for lower - level libraries first , and the atfork handlers will be registered in the correct order .
But then again , are you sure your library writers got this right ?
Considering how little the feature is used , it does n't encourage anyone to bother trying and debugging a non-deterministic concurrency issue .
And because you do n't expect others to bother , why bother yourself , when your work will be in vain unless they do their part of the job ?
In absence of an enforcement mechanism these things just do n't happen .
Since there is no automated such mechanism , and the social incentives are lacking , you better be ready to go through the source code to ensure things are done right when you need them .
And when the code is proprietary , you better have a great relation with the authors to get what you need , and the authors better be just as madly clever as you are to get it to work .
But we were talking about the simple case of low - level libraries with only one or a few static global locks each .
Now consider what happens if you 're writing a higher - level library that has to take into account a dynamic set of locks , or worse where some user - provided callbacks or other higher - order functions may be called while holding a lock , that may themselves cause operations requiring lower locks to be called .
And what if these callbacks even potentially cause the dependency order between the locks of various libraries to not be known statically at compile - time , or worse to change with phases of your program ?
Remember that before this ordering issue kicked in , we were assuming that you could trace the set of all the resources involved in your high - level computation .
To say the least , it all requires that you should possess a jolly good understanding of all concurrency issues throughout the code .
Worse even , you will have to maintain that deep understanding as your code evolves , and as the libraries you use evolve .
If you are writing a small part of some biggish software involving tens of developers past , present and future , your chance of getting this right are pretty thin .
It would be nice if some automatic tool helped you get it right by construction , by tracking all the resources in use and their dependency order ; but such tool does n't exist , and even if it did , it would only be useful if it were used on each and every module that will run in the same address space as your module .
There again , we 're far from it .
Does your favorite high - level programming language implementation properly use atfork in its runtime ?
Does it allow you to declare resources in a way that allows them to be automatically tracked down with their dependency order always well - established ?
Does it provide hooks for your application to register its own atfork handlers ?
I bet it does n't .
But then again , I may be proven wrong !
And if enough people start using it , that might build enough pressure to get all these libraries to properly use it .
However , holding locks is only one part of the problem .
Then comes the cleanup of the resources in the child process .
If the fork is a one - off for a special - purpose operation , or even an n-off for a small - enough bounded number n , you may not actually care ; you may tolerate that a large part of your address space be occupied with unused and unusable resources reserved for the use of now non-existent threads , that these resources will never be used , may bitrot quietly , and hopefully will quickly end up being swapped out .
But if spawning threads and forking are both part of your normal computation model , you will find that after a few iterations , the descendent 's memory will be all clogged with unfreed resources .
Actually , address space is only one problem , and other resources may leak and run out , like file descriptors and other operating system handles and capabilities ;
Finally , not being able to track down these leaking resources and get rid of them might not just be a performance issue , but also be a security issue : what if you fork to run unsafe libraries , in which a malicious cracker can now inject code that captures passwords and other sensitive information ?
Once again , when you deal with simple low - level libraries , the problem is relatively straightforward : in your cleanup handler , just reset your global datastructures to remove any trace of datastructures used by other threads ; then be sure to restart any required ancillary thread before the next time it is used , informing it about any datastructure you kept for the current thread ( if any ) .
If you were maintaining a stateful session with a server , you may have to reinitialize a new session , any existing transaction being aborted as if a " normal " communication error had happened ( and you handle these cases , do n't you ? ) .
Then again , for reasons already discussed , just because it is straightforward does n't mean it has been provided to you ; after all , it is tedious code to maintain , code for which there is no expected user .
Now once you try to generalize the procedure to arbitrary higher levels of abstractions , including whichever layers of application reside above the language or module you are trying to write , then you realize that to fully and properly solve the problem of forking with threads , you have to fully solve the reputedly difficult problem of properly interrupting and killing a thread ; indeed what you are trying to do is precisely cleaning up resources from threads that were interrupted at a random moment in some parent but were never otherwise properly interred .
And there the difficulty lies in that while you may have a proper understanding of your code , and do what it takes to correctly preserve its invariants and not break any of the invariants of the lower level layers that you rely upon , you cannot know what invariants matter to the application layers above you : they could be just anything .
You just can't do what it takes when you can't know what it takes , and some applications will want something different and opposite from what want other applications .
That is why language implementers can with a lot of work achieve enough PCLSRing to synchronize every thread in a stable state with respect to say memory allocation invariants , so that garbage collection can be successfully undertaken ; but they can't make it so that any thread ( much less all threads ) will be in a stable enough state as to be safely killed irregardless of what the application invariants are .
Surely you could easily kill the thread , unlink its stack from the GC roots , and reclaim its storage .
But little good would that do if that meant your application was then stuck because that thread was in the middle of some high - level operation , and no one will be able to cleanup after this half - done operation when the thread is dead .
Was the interrupted thread in the middle of transfering money from account A to account B , with the transferred amount being currently included in both ( respectively neither ) account ?
You better not interrupt there , or money will have appeared ( respectively disappeared ) from your accounting system , presumably a bad thing .
Hopefully , if the thread was in the middle of any transaction , it will be holding some kind of lock , and you will only be able to interrupt it when the lock is released .
Now the thread may be constantly in the middle of such transactions , and the odds of interrupting it at the right moment may be slim ; so you can't just poll for the thread to be in a stable state , you need the interruption to be queued and processed as soon as the thread exits its atomic operation and reaches a stable state .
Except that what is stable to one upper level of the code may not be stable enough for one yet higher level of the code , so you want to queue your interruption at the highest level that matters .
Finally , the thread might not naturally reach a stable state in any reasonable , predictable or otherwise satisfactory amount of time if left to its own device , especially where optimizations may reorder operations and skip any stable state .
Therefore you may have to not just wait for the target thread to stabilize , but make it enter a special execution mode where it will do its best to promptly rollback or rollforward its current transaction and leave the thread in a proper state suitable for interruption .
And of course , once you 've gotten the PCLSRing itself correct , you still need be able to walk the stable state of the process and do whatever cleanups and resets are necessary to account for the death of the threads that you killed .
Tracing garbage collection might do a lot of work for you , but you may still have to unregister the deceased activities and their resources from whichever registries you use before the GC may be able to do its job .
And the unregistration will probably be different during a fork 's child cleanup from what it is in the parent : in the parent , you want to do things gracefully , completing transactions by committing or aborting them , returning resources to the system and various servers ; in the child , you want to just forget about those things of which you have a duplicate , neither commit nor abort transactions that are the parent 's property to complete , just relinquishing access to those resources to which you were given an undeserved duplicated handle .
Thus you can't " just " unwind the stack and play the normal unwind handlers and other finalizers — unless the handlers were built in such a way that they can recognize that you 're unwinding in a special " throw it away " mode .
Note that this part is tricky even in the single - threaded case ; the multi - threaded case only compounds it slightly in that you have to not forget to walk the resources from other threads to deallocate them , in addition to those from parts of the current thread 's continuation that are irrelevant to the child .
The part that is really made harder by multithreading is the PCLSRing problem ; the subsequent cleanup is mostly just " normally hard " .
Another approach would be to not try to free resources of interrupted activities in the current image , but only allocate fresh resources for relevant activities in a fresh image .
In addition to the cost of initializing the fresh image and all its libraries ( which can be paid in advance by keeping an preforked initialized server image listening ) , this implies the cost of serializing the relevant state in the current image , and either save it aside while the process somehow reinitializes from scratch , or send it over the wire to a newly created or forked process that is being execve 'd and initialized .
The cost of such a " Copying GC " approach to resource reclamation is somewhat high , but so is the cost of returning resources from other threads actually , and at least this cost does n't depend on what a gazillion other activities written and controlled by different authors may be running in the parent image .
This approach also has the advantage that you can often abstract away from the state of underlying low - level libraries you link to , and that the protocol for forkability , while more constraining than it can be without serializability , is quite simple : the ability to serialize the relevant state of the thread — which can be useful for other purposes ( persistence , migration ) .
What might do the trick to manage issues with PCLSRing ( or serialization ) would be an interface for declarative resource - dependency management in your programming language API : which resource depends on which other resource having been initialized ( and what does that mean for the encoding and decoding data ) .
Did you see one ?
No ?
Too bad .
Problem is , it might be non-trivial to implement right , difficult to prove correct statically , and costly to enforce dynamically .
In low - level languages , things may be simple , programmers will receive no help whatsoever to get them right .
Higher - level languages might conceivably offer support to automate these things , but solving the problem in the general case might be quite tricky for language implementers .
With higher - order functions and modules , establishing a sound concurrency protocol may depend on clients and servers respecting the mutual contract .
Now what language support is there or can there be to clearly define and enforce such contract ?
Is there significant research in solving that problem ?
Not that I know of — but I have n't followed recent developments .
Region - based memory management and substructural typing look like a good trail to follow ; but does it go all the way to PCLSRing ?
If you know , please tell me .
Meanwhile , I 'll keep using the usual " solution " — let the garbage accumulate , and forget the TUNESy hopes of a system capable of holistic bookkeeping , instead manually create a controlled subsystem that does its own bookkeeping of the things I manually specify as important , so I may export them from a cluttered system and reimport them into a fresh one .
Smelly people , fat people and people who cough and sneeze are the most disliked passengers to be seated next to on an airplane , according to a survey .
Almost half of the people polled by website Travelocity said passengers with poor hygiene are the worst , while 30 per cent dislike people who cough and sneeze and 15 per cent do n't like sitting next to fat passengers .
Almost two thirds of people said seat - kicking was the rudest behaviour displayed by passengers , followed by loud talking or swearing and reclining the seat all the way back .
When it comes to fat passengers , 44 per cent of people believed they should be given two seats at no extra cost , while 39 per cent believed they should have to pay for an extra seat .
Bringing larger than allowed carry - on luggage was deemed the most annoying thing a passenger could do when boarding , while people rushing to get off a plane was the worst thing passengers could do when exiting .

Roman Polanski , the 76 - year - old filmmaker who was accused of drugging and raping 13 - year - old Samantha Geimer in 1977 , has been arrested in Switzerland .
Polanski , who was convicted of having sex with a minor but fled to France before he could be sentenced , is currently facing extradition back to the United States , where he could finally be sentenced for his 32 - year - old conviction .
In the wake of Polanski ’s belated arrest , commentators have posed dozens of arguments in the Oscar - winning director ’s defense .
Most of them are bullshit .
—-
“ But he ’s already paid his price , because everyone knows he ’s a rapist , and he can never work in Hollywood . ”
As Patrick Goldstein wrote in the LA Times , “ I think Polanski has already paid a horrible , soul - wrenching price for the infamy surrounding his actions .
The real tragedy is that he will always , till his death , be snubbed and stalked and confronted by people who think the price he has already paid is n’t enough . ”
Ahh : “ the real tragedy . ”
Some people may be under the impression that a 13 - year - old being drugged and raped by a 44 - year - old man constitutes a “ real tragedy . ”
Others may contend that both Polanski and his rape victim have suffered “ real tragedies ” in their lifetimes .
But no , there can only be one the real tragedy , and it is that people have “ snubbed ” Roman Polanski because he raped someone and skipped town .
If only the recognition of the Academy Awards , the BAFTAs , the Berlin International Film Festival , Cannes , the Directors Guild of America , the Golden Globes , the Independent Spirit Awards , the Stokholm Film Festival , the Venice Film Festival , and dozens of other awards organizations could begin to heal that wound .
—-
“ But he escaped the Holocaust / his mother died at Auschwitz / His wife was killed by Charles Manson ”
Talk about real tragedies :
These , of course , are real tragedies .
Upon hearing of Polanski ’s arrest , French Minister of Culture Frederic Mitterrand announced that he “ strongly regrets that a new ordeal is being inflicted on someone who has already experienced so many of them . ”
This is a fair argument — - and one that can be made about many , many people convicted of crimes in the United States .
A lot of the people who are locked up behind bars have endured unspeakable traumas in their own lives — - sexual assault , poverty , drug addiction , gang life , homelessness , and mental illness .
Why are they held accountable for their actions , while Polanski gets to be like , “ Peace , I ’m just going to chill in France for thirty years , try not to rape anybody else , and maybe win an Oscar .
See you guys later ” ?
It ’s not because of what he endured .
It ’s because he makes movies .
But let ’s say , for argument ’s sake , that Polanski is n’t getting a break because he ’s famous , but rather because he ’s had a hard life .
When France decries “ the ordeal ” being “ inflicted ” on Polanski , what the country is really saying is that rape is not important because it ’s not as horrific as the Holocaust , and not as evil as Charles Manson .
And that ’s a pretty fucked - up standard , oui ?

“ But he made The Pianist / Chinatown / Rosemary ’s Baby / Revulsion . ”
Congratulations , the Huffington Post ‘s Kim Morgan :
You win the prize of penning the most disgusting defense of Polanski I ’ve read to date !
Morgan prefaces her post by saying she is “ not going to go into my Roman Polanski defense , ” but suffice to say she is “ not happy about his arrest . ”
Instead of getting bogged down by the legal gobbledygook , Morgan shoots off a blog post entitled “ Roman Polanski Understands Women . ”
Seriously .
“ One should not , ” she writes , “ take Polanski ’s films literally , for they are often heightened versions of what occurs naturally in our world : desire , perversion , repulsion . ”
Okay , but how about his rape of a 13 - year - old girl ?
Are we allowed to take that “ natural occurrence ” literally ?
Morgan does n’t directly address that question , but she does argue that Polanski ’s very brilliance is a product of his relationship with human “ darkness ” :
Polanski ’s removed morality is exactly why he is often brilliant :
He is so empathetic to his characters that , like a trauma victim floating above the pain , he is personally impersonal .
He insightfully scrutinizes what is so frightening about being human , yet he does n’t feel the need to be resolute or sentimental about his cognizance .
He is also , consciously or subconsciously , aware of the darkness he explores , especially in his female characters , who could be seen as extensions of himself .

You know what I find revolting ?
When a film critic prefaces her work with a disclaimer about how much it sucks that a rapist is getting arrested for raping someone , and then uses the rapiest imagery possible to applaud his film work .
Nope !
Sorry !
Understanding Women is not a valid defense against rape .
Similarly , being a really marvelous film director does n’t mean that you get to rape someone and not go to prison .
Even if you made The Pianist .
Remember : making The Pianist and being a rapist are not mutually exclusive .

“ But the girl ’s mother made him rape her . ”
Oops , nevermind , this one is actually an even more disgusting defense of Roman Polanski , also on the Huffington Post :
The 13 - year old model ‘ seduced ’ by Polanski had been thrust onto him by her mother , who wanted her in the movies .
The girl was just a few weeks short of her 14th birthday , which was the age of consent in California .
( It ’s probably 13 by now ! )
Polanski was demonized by the press , convicted , and managed to flee , fearing a heavy sentence .
I met Polanski shortly after he fled America and was filming Tess in Normandy .
I was working in the CBS News bureau in Paris , and I accompanied Mike Wallace for a Sixty Minutes interview with Polanski on the set .
Mike thought he would be meeting the devil incarnate , but was utterly charmed by Roman ’s sobriety and intelligence .
So , Polanski is just a really special guy who was practically forced to have sex with that 13 - year - old girl by her mother .
It ’s almost as if Roman Polanski was raped by that 13 - year - old girl .
Also , no , the age of consent in California is not “ 13 by now , ” it is 16 18 ( !! ) .
By the by : the author of this little gem is Joan Z. Shore , co-founder of Women Overseas for Equality .
Thanks , Joan , for your deft approach to women ’s issues !
“ But he did n’t know she was 13 . ”
Please , Anne Applebaum .
Polanski had to ask her mother for permission to shoot her for Vogue .

“ But 13 is old enough to consent to sex ”
Let ’s assume that , like Joan Shore and others have suggested , age 13 is old enough to consent to sex , and Polanski is merely a victim of the Puritanical sex laws of the U.S.A .
If that ’s true , then surely 13 would be old enough to say no to sex , right ?
Because here ’s what Geimer said happened at the one - on - one Vogue shoots :
According to Geimer in a 2003 interview , “ Everything was going fine ; then he asked me to change , well , in front of him . ”
She added , “ It did n’t feel right , and I did n’t want to go back to the second shoot . ”
Geimer later agreed to a second session , which took place on March 10 , 1977 at the Mulholland area home of actor Jack Nicholson in Los Angeles .
“ We did photos with me drinking champagne , ” Geimer says .
“ Toward the end it got a little scary , and I realized he had other intentions and I knew I was not where I should be .
I just did n’t quite know how to get myself out of there . ”
She recalled in a 2003 interview that she began to feel uncomfortable after he asked her to lie down on a bed , and how she attempted to resist .
“ I said , ‘ No , no .
I do n’t want to go in there .
No , I do n’t want to do this .
No ! ” , and then I did n’t know what else to do , ” she stated .
That ’s rape , whether you are 13 years old or 14 or 16 or 44 or 76 .

“ But the American justice system is fucked up . ”
Granted .
But if we ’re going to talk about the fuck - up - edness of the U.S. legal system , surely we can find a better martyr than a famous rich guy with the best lawyers in the world who drugged and raped a 13 - year - old girl , struck a plea deal in order to get off with the lesser charge of “ unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor ” ( or statutory rape ) , and then fled the country when it looked like the plea deal may not be honored ?
I ’m all for Polanski being tried legally and fairly .
Over the years , Polanski has repeatedly attempted to appeal the case — - a really cool feature of the American legal process he purposefully evaded — - but he refuses to appear in court .
Excuse me while I play the world ’s tiniest piano , but if the American legal system is broken , the fix is not for rapists to just choose their own adventure ( in this case , France ) .
—-
“ But his victim has forgiven him ”
From Applebaum ’s column : “ The girl , now 45 , has said more than once that she forgives him , that she can live with the memory , that she does not want him to be put back in court or in jail , and that a new trial will hurt her husband and children . ”
It ’s certainly a relief to hear that Geimer , after three decades and a settled civil suit against Polanski , has moved on from her childhood sexual assault .
Of course , a victim ’s should always be considered over the course of a trial .
At the same time , forgiveness , sympathy , and identification with one ’s attacker are fairly common in sexual assault cases , and these sentiments do n’t make sexual assault any less damaging — - or any more legal .
Again , you can argue that Polanski is an example of how the American legal system unduly punishes its criminals , but until you ’re willing to free all the nation ’s sex offenders and make them promise to just keep their cool until their victims get around to forgiving them , it ’s not a very solid argument .
—-
“ But his victim does n’t want to have to relive her assault again . ”
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
Samantha Geimer , like many victims of sexual assault , is justified in holding a grudge against the criminal justice system .
When a rape victim decides to report her assault to the police , she ’s looking at years of intense police , legal , and media scrutiny .
She will have to relive her assault over and over again over the course of trial and investigation .
She will have her sexual history dredged up and put on display .
These are all big deterrents to reporting sexual assault .
But while a sexual assault victim may never personally recover from the trauma , the public scrutiny , at least , usually ends with the sentencing .
Unless , of course , your attacker is a famous movie director who refuses to be sentenced , in which case you will be forced to relive your assault : a ) every time your attacker attempts to cross another country ’s borders ; b) every time your attacker releases a new film ; c ) every time your attacker attempts to have his conviction overturned ; d ) every time your attacker does anything noteworthy .
The fact that Geimer ’s childhood sexual assault has haunted her in the press for 30 years is a real tragedy , and one man is responsible for that : Roman Polanski .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The economy is growing again .
So when are the jobs that go with growth going to get here ?
Not anytime soon , unfortunately .
The consensus forecast is that job losses will continue through the end of this year , with many economists not expecting unemployment to peak until next summer .
That will add to the 7.2 million jobs already lost in this downturn .
Even with Thursday 's report that showed the economy grew at a 3.5 % annual rate in the third quarter , the continued job losses are not a shock .
Jobs are what are known as a trailing or lagging indicator , meaning that they change in response to other economic events , rather than predicting changes the way a leading indicator , such as the stock market , does .
That 's because even after a recession has ended , employers are slow to add staff until they 're sure that demand has returned .
The real worry is that the deepest and longest recession since the Great Depression will be followed by a jobless recovery , just like what happened after the recessions in 1990 - 1991 and 2001 .
It took almost two years after the end of the 2001 recession before the economy started adding jobs on a consistent basis .
And it was n't until February 2005 until the job market got back to the employment levels of four years earlier .
Some economists argue that the job losses in this downturn will prompt employers to start hiring at a rapid clip soon after the economy starts to improve .
" People cut so quickly that they cut things they should n't have , not just fat but also muscle and bone , " said Robert Brusca of FAO Economics .
Many other economists were already looking for a tough labor market for at least the next year .
According to a survey by the National Association of Business Economics , the consensus forecast of 44 top economists is for an addition of only 12,000 jobs a month in the first quarter of next year .
The economists surveyed also indicated they do n't expect monthly job gains to top the 150,000 level -- which is generally thought of as what is needed to keep pace with population growth -- until the end of 2010 .
And in the most troubling sign , more than a half of the economists surveyed said they did n't expect a recovery to pre-recession levels in the job market until 2012 while a third said they did n't believe a full job recovery would occur until 2013 or beyond .
There are number of reasons for this pessimism .
Money to hire is tight
Small businesses are typically the engine of job growth , but their access to credit is still severely limited .
That means that even if they 're confident about their future prospects , many small employers wo n't be able to afford to add staff .
" Recessions that involve a financial crisis take a much longer time for there to be a jobs recovery , " said Heidi Shierholz , labor economist for the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank .
" The credit crunch is n't getting worse , but it 's still very tight . "
Even larger businesses are n't experiencing the kind of growth that might prompt them to start bringing back staff .
Earnings tracker Thomson Reuters is projecting that overall revenue for the companies in the Standard & Poor 's 500 will be down nearly 10 % in the third quarter compared to a year earlier and that profits will decline 18 % .
And even though fourth quarter profits are expected to more than triple compared to a year ago , most of that will be due to lower costs .
Revenue is only forecast to be up 6 % .
" It typically takes a couple quarters after the upturn in revenue to get an upturn in employment , " said Keith Hembre , chief economist with First American Funds .
" That takes us to at least the second quarter of next year . "
Shorter hours , longer recovery
Employers have n't only been slashing jobs in this downturn .
They 've been reducing the hours of the workers they keep in order to keep a lid on wages .
The average work week is now 33 hours , a record low .
A record 9.2 million people that have jobs are working part - time because their hours have been cut or they can't find full - time work .
That 's more than doubled since the start of a recession .
Experts said before employers go on massive hiring binges , they are far more likely to restore hours to their part - time employees first .
That may be good news for those workers , but not for those looking for jobs .
" We expect to see hours rise first before hiring picks up , " said Shierholz .
" That 's a leading indicator .
What 's scary is that it 's still declining . "
Permanent changes
During all downturns , employers naturally pull back in response to worsening economic conditions .
This recession has been no different .
Every recession also tends to lead to permanent changes in the job market for some sectors of the economy .
But the structural changes during this downturn have been more severe and widespread than in a typical recession .
The auto industry , construction and finance sectors were major employment engines heading into the recession , responsible for one job out of every 11 in the country .
But they have all gone through major shifts .
Together , those three industries have shed 18 % of their work force since the start of the recession .
By way of comparison , the remaining sectors in the economy have only lost 4 % of their workers .
Recovering many of the lost jobs in those sectors will be difficult , if not impossible .
In some cases , the jobs lost were only there to begin with because of bubbles that are not likely to inflate again anytime soon .
For example , the drastic restructuring of the U.S. auto manufacturers in response to plunging auto sales is not good news for auto dealers .
Dealers , which employ more people than auto plants , have lost 16 % of their jobs during this recession .
Auto dealers actually gained jobs during the last downturn .
Nonbank lenders , a group that included many of the subprime lenders who helped drive the housing boom , have lost one job in six during the recession .
Those jobs are unlikely to return .
Likewise , the construction industry shed 20 % of its workforce while real estate lost almost 7 % of its jobs .
" You may get some recovery in construction as housing turns up , but I think it will be weak for quite a few years , " said Hembre .
He added that the same is probably true for the financial services sector .
That means that many of the unemployed , from auto workers to mortgage brokers to construction industry craftsmen , will probably find subdued demand for their skills for years to come .
The Big Mac , long a symbol of globalisation , has become the latest victim of this tiny island nation 's overexposure to the world financial crisis .
Iceland 's three McDonald 's restaurants - all in the capital , Reykjavik - will close next weekend , as the franchise owner gives in to falling profits caused by the collapse in the Icelandic krona .
Goodbye Big Macs ... Iceland 's golden arches fall victim to the financial crisis .
" The economic situation has just made it too expensive for us , " Magnus Ogmundsson , the managing director of Lyst Hr. , McDonald 's franchise holder in Iceland , said on Monday .
Lyst was bound by McDonald 's requirement that it import all the goods required for its restaurants - from packaging to meat and cheeses - from Germany .
The incident was not the first time a visiting Russian bear was involved in a deadly attack in Kyrgyzstan .
In 2002 a bear on loan from Russia to the Bishkek city zoo attacked and killed a small child who had reached out to pet it .
Gore , in St. Louis , says Bush would put U.S. back in record red ink
ST . LOUIS ( CNN ) -- Making his way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles , Vice President Al Gore told a rally in St. Louis that this year 's presidential election was a " battle for the future of our country . "
" It 's about making the right choices to keep our progress and strong economy going and reach out and make sure no one is left behind , " said Gore , sharing the stage with his wife , Tipper , running mate Sen.
Joe Lieberman and Lieberman 's wife , Hadassah .
Gore said his Republican opponents would lead the country back to the policies of the 1980s , adding , " What they caused last time were record deficits , repeat recessions , high unemployment . "
The vice president extolled what he said eight years of the Clinton / Gore administration had produced : Economic growth , deficits changed to surpluses , 22 million new jobs and the strongest economy in the history of the United States .
However , Gore said the November election was about the economy of the future .
He said that if elected , his No. 1 priority would be to " keep balancing the budget every year and paying down the ( national ) debt to demonstrate our fiscal responsibility , to keep interest rates low and to keep creating new jobs . "
Other priorities Gore mentioned were raising the minimum wage and improving education and job training .
Gore campaigns on health care plan
Earlier , in Independence , Missouri , Gore told an audience of senior citizens that his health care proposals save more money and provide better coverage than those of his Republican opponent , George W. Bush .
Stopping in the hometown of former president Harry S. Truman , whom Gore called " one of the greatest fighters for working men and women in the United States , " Gore discussed his plans for Social Security , Medicare and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare .
" These three health care issues affecting seniors are at the center of the debate in our nation over which direction we 're going to take , " Gore told the crowd .
Monday marked the 65th anniversary of the Social Security Act becoming law with President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's signature .
Promises specifics in speech
Gore said his convention speech Thursday night accepting his party 's presidential nomination will offer specific policy proposals to contrast with the " generalities " of his Republican opponents , Bush and running mate Dick Cheney .
" People on the other ticket are good men .
I 'll never attack them personally , " Gore said .
" But I do think the American people deserve to know the specifics about how the American people would be affected if ( Republicans ) won , how the American people will be affected if ( the Democrats ) win . "
He also suggested that Bush had glossed over the details of his plans for Social Security and Medicare in order to create a false impression of caring about the programs .
While Democrats are in the limelight this week , Bush is relaxing at his ranch in Texas .
But his campaign staff was quick to respond to Gore 's statements .
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said that Bush has given plenty of specifics on his agenda and that Gore 's contention " once again shows why the vice president has a problem with credibility . "
Dan Bartlett , another Bush spokesman , said Gore , as part of the Clinton administration , has had the past 7 1/2 years to work on Medicare and Social Security reform and was now at work on the " difficult task of reinventing his record of failing to . "
Working toward universal health care
Gore said he would set aside a portion of the nation 's budget surplus to expand Social Security and Medicare and would make use of a " lock - box " to keep funding for health care safe from other political uses .
" I believe that we have to move step - by - step toward Harry S. Truman 's goal toward universal health care for all of our people , starting with a prescription drug benefit for our seniors , more help for long - term care , a better and more secure Medicare program , and full health coverage for every single child in America within the next four years , " Gore said to applause .
Bush 's prescription - drug plan provides government subsidies to the poorest senior citizens and promises to give the rest the right to sign up for a plan that offers coverage .
Gore 's more ambitious proposal -- and more costly , at $ 253 billion over 10 years -- would add a Medicare prescription drug benefit , offering free coverage for low - income recipients , a monthly premium arrangement for others and catastrophic coverage for all .
On retirement savings , Gore has proposed tax incentives for investors building nest eggs over and above a guaranteed Social Security benefit .
One elderly woman reluctant to speak into Gore 's microphone fit perfectly into his script .
Responding to Bush 's plan to let workers divert some of their payroll taxes from Social Security into the stock market for potentially bigger retirement savings , the woman protested in a quavering voice :
" Who 's going to take care of me ?
I do n't know about investing funds . "
Gore , teasing , said , " Well , could n't you get on the Internet ... do n't you think that would be fun to try to follow that every day ? "
The woman replied , " I 've tried to study stocks , and it 's like a foreign language to me .
I need to keep my Social Security . "
On Tuesday , Gore will meet up with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a rally in Monroe , Michigan .
The following day , the vice president will head to Los Angeles to prepare for his acceptance speech .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
In September , 22 - year - old Scott Zeilinski sued the owner and staff of Nick 's Short Stop Party Store in Clinton Township , Michigan , alleging that he was shot and wounded during a visit to the store .
Those allegations appear to be true .
The likely problem for the plaintiff here is that he was robbing the store at the time .
Zeilinski was convicted of armed robbery for the incident , which took place in November 2007 .
According to court records , Zeilinski came into the store wearing a mask and brandishing a knife , which he reportedly held to the employees ' throats while threatening to kill them .
After he got some cash and cigarettes ( hey , smokes are expensive these days ) , he started to make his way out of the store , still making threats .
One of the clerks grabbed a gun and shot Zeilinski twice .
Zeilinski , who is serving an 8 - to - 22 - year sentence , has now sued and is demanding upwards of $ 125,000 for the pain , suffering , and emotional distress inflicted on him by the people he had just robbed .
He will probably argue that the force used was disproportionate since he " only " had a knife and was , apparently , shot in the back .
Those facts make it a little reminiscent of a case I wrote about in 2006 , in which a man sued AutoZone and two of its employees for injuries he incurred while robbing them .
There , the robber had the gun , but the employees managed to take it away from him and then merrily beat him with a pipe as he was running away .
He argued they should have stopped hitting him once the robbery ended .
I have never robbed anyone or been robbed , but I would guess that it 's not always that clear when a robbery has actually ended , so I would not have a problem with them erring on the side of some additional beating .
I mean , you never know when the guy might get up and start robbing you again .
Michigan , like many other states , has what are sometimes called " stand your ground " laws intended to aid the defendant in cases like these .
But whether or not Zeilinski's claim is legally barred , its jury appeal is , shall we say , limited .

Jeg har lenge vært nysgjerrig på om akselerometeret på min Lenovo T400 kunne brukes til noe i Windows 7 , bortsett fra HD - beskyttelse .
Så jeg lastet ned de siste driverne til T400 fra Lenovos oppdateringsprogram og installerte Vista driverne , selv om jeg kjører Windows 7 .
Deretter lastet jeg ned en nattlig Firefox versjon ( 3.7 ) og prøvde ..
Det virket !
Se her :
Ok .. jeg er en nerd .. men jeg synes det var artig .
Tenk alt det gøye man kan lage !

Suddenly , it 's all about boys in Toronto public schools .
Weeks after taking the reins of Canada 's largest school board , education director Chris Spence has brought his trademark focus on boys to a sweeping " Vision of Hope ! " he unveiled Tuesday evening to trustees .
The one - time football player says he wants the board to launch a number of single - sex classes , boy - friendly programs and an all - male alternative school to try to boost male learning and cut boys ' dropout rate .
It is among a range of priorities he sets for the Toronto District School Board , as well as going green , turning digital , balancing the books and cutting violence .
" The last thing I want to do is demonize our boys , but all around we see great concerns about their learning , " he said , citing lower test scores than girls and more acting out .
To level the playing field for boys , he suggests , " might require differentiated treatment . "
Next September , he wants the board to open a Male Leadership Academy for boys from kindergarten to Grade 3 as a sort of alternative school or " school of choice , " and add a grade each year , with many , if not all teachers being male .
Moreover , he wants to launch 300 " demonstration classrooms " across the city to showcase the best ways of teaching , including classrooms he calls " boy - friendly . "
" Boys thrive in environments that are hands - on and where there is opportunity to move around , " he said , citing portable desks that let children be more mobile , and clipboards rather than notebooks so students feel less tied to a desk .
" When every bone in a boy 's body says ` Move ! ' we 're ( usually ) saying ` Sit down . '. "
The Toronto board has a handful of single - sex classrooms and an all - girls high school for students at risk , but Spence wants to expand the model , which he promoted at two schools in Hamilton .
" Male teachers would be value - added , " he said , citing the importance of male mentors for boys , particularly in communities where father figures are absent .
" They say a boy without a father figure is like an explorer without a map , " said Spence , who has pioneered mentoring programs for boys .
" One of the most reliable predictors of whether a boy will succeed or fail in high school rests on a single question : does he have a man in his life to look up to ? "
The advocacy group People for Education has raised concerns about specialty schools " because of the tendency for that to divide populations , as opposed to bringing populations together , " said spokesperson Annie Kidder , citing research in Britain and Canada that shows a system of specialty schools can lead to " a fair amount of social segregation . "
Toronto board chair John Campbell said he expects Spence 's plan to meet with little resistance next week when it comes up for approval by trustees .
" We went through a long search to get a very capable agent of change , and we got one . "
The scope of the report , presented to the board 's planning and priorities committee Tuesday , is broad .
Spence says he wants all schools wireless by 2015 .

He wants 20 per cent fewer students suspended each year , 20 per cent less violence and 40 per cent fewer expulsions .
And Spence will propose the board begin a community review of the future of schools in eight different neighbourhoods where declining enrolment is a problem , to be named next week .
These reviews would give priority to keeping open schools from kindergarten to Grade 8 , rather than middle schools and junior high schools .
" I am deeply committed to the model of kindergarten - to - Grade 8 which the board adopted as a model last year and which presents fewer transitions for children , " said Spence .
Spence 's plan also urges the board to :
— Launch five " redevelopment projects " with mixed use of school property to generate capital funding ;
— Hire a marketing director to boost enrolment , including a drive to recruit more fee - paying international students ;
— Reduce violent incidents by 20 per cent ;
— Establish a Parent Academy , similar to one in Miami , where parents can receive training in a range of subjects ;
— Install solar energy systems on up to 20 schools each year ;
— Promote " full - service " schools with community use .
So began an ordeal Mr McGrath will never forget .
He was due to leave the next morning for a surfing trip to the nearby Mentawai Islands , famed for their large , clean , barrelling waves .
The charter boat captain who had just left his room after negotiating a fee died in a bathroom downstairs .
'' He was missing body parts .
He was totally messed up , '' Mr McGrath said yesterday A female hotel worker suffered horrific injuries , pinned down by a broken pillar for eight hours in the hotel 's foyer .
'' It 's almost a sickening feeling thinking about the girl out the front , '' Mr McGrath , 21 , said , staring at the wreckage of the Hotel Dipo .
'' This has just totally mentally destroyed me .
Mate , I just want to get out of here . ''
His escape was just as extraordinary as the footage - obtained by The Sunday Age - that he shot .
'' I just turned around and picked up the camera and started video recording .
'' I looked down and there was a huge crack where the wall used to be .
I did n't know where to go because the staircase had collapsed and crumbled in …
It happened in a matter of seconds .
I went into panic … I was just thinking about how I would get out because the staircase had crumbled in .
I was that far up .
How was I going to get down ? ''
In the end , Mr McGrath leapt a metre - wide chasm in the building , jumping on to another landing .
A miscalculation from a 10 - metre height would have left him badly injured .
He then scampered down through the rubble .
'' Everything was covered in dust - you could barely even breathe . ''
When he finally emerged , the scale of the devastation was apparent .
'' The whole front of the hotel had collapsed in and there was a lady bawling her eyes out the front .
She was covered in rubble - up to her shoulders with rubble .
We dug it and dug it . ''
In the end it was fruitless effort ; a pillar that was pinning her down from the hips was too big to remove .
It took eight hours to find a truck to pull it out - the woman survived .
Outside , the scene around Mr McGrath was apocalyptic .
Collapsed buildings , rubble everywhere , and the constant pleading cries and screams of victims .
The Ramayana Mall , two hundred metres down the road , was engulfed in flames .
'' You could hear the building collapsing from the inside .
God knows how many people were inside , '' he says .
After three hours wandering the streets carrying only his camera and a mobile phone that did n't work , his shock and bewilderment gave way to panic as the city descended into pitch black , the only lights coming from vehicles ferrying victims to hospital and the flames from burning buildings .
'' The reality sunk in .
I realised how bad it all was and I knew that no one could really help me . ''
Mr McGrath then made a decision that he concedes was risky , but one he does n't regret .
He returned to the hotel to retrieve his passport and ATM card from his third - floor room .
'' I had a torch , but it was so dusty .
It was really hard to see .
I got into the crack where the building had split in half and climbed up .
It was really unstable .
There was lots of loose tiles .
It was really slippery at the edge where I had to jump .
It was just so hectic . ''
Loading
He got his passport and ATM card and , a day later , he even retrieved his surfboards .
But he could n't contact his family .
'' They went into a total panic , just trying to make sure I was all right . ''
Contact has been made , and Mr McGrath got a flight to Singapore yesterday .
He wo n't be coming back to Padang .
'' It 's been too much , '' he says .
But he has n't lost his zest for travel .
He 's going to hook up with his father , Peter , in the Philippines .
The waves are waiting .

The Phillies ' offense has been more consistent in this series than it was during much of the regular season .
In the top of the first inning , Victorino blasted a hard line drive over the wall in right field .
Five Phillies batters forced Ubaldo Jimenez to throw 30 pitches in the first , a victory in itself against the Rockies ' best starter .
The upscale British grocery store which has a Royal Warrant to provide foodstuffs to the Queen of England says it ’s done with Fox News for good .
The Waitrose grocery store chain , which has roughly 200 stores across the United Kingdom , has announced that it will suspend advertising anywhere on the Rupert Murdoch - owned cable network after customers complained about their brand ’s placement during a segment of The Glenn Beck Show .
According to a British newspaper , a shopper who emailed management expressing outrage that they were “ associated with this particular form of rightwing cant ” received a humbled reply .

“ We take the placement of our ads in individual programmes very seriously , ensuring the content of these programmes is deemed appropriate for a brand with our values , ” a customer service spokesman is said to have written in reply .
“ Since being notified of our presence within the Glenn Beck programme , we have withdrawn all Waitrose advertising from the Fox News channel with immediate effect and for all future TV advertising campaigns . ”
A spokesman for the supermarket would n’t comment on how many complaints the store had received , saying only , “ We believe it was the right thing to do ” and “ we take the views of our customers seriously . ”
Waitrose was the first grocery store chain in England to be awarded a Royal Warrant by the Queen in 2002 .
The marks are awarded to firms that have supplied the royal family for at least five years , and are used in marketing .
Nearly two dozen companies have abandoned Beck ’s program after comments he made in July when he accused President Barack Obama of being a racist .
Beck said Obama held a “ deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture ” after the president said a police officer had “ acted stupidly ” in arresting Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates .

“ I ’m not saying that he does n’t like white people , ” Beck remarked .
“ I ’m saying that he has a problem .
This guy is , I believe , a racist . ”
Among those who quit Beck ’s show included big - box juggernaut Wal - Mart and consumer products behemoth Procter & Gamble , as well as Travelocity and Best Buy .
Waitrose ’s announcement , however , does n’t mean the chain wo n’t simply stop advertising on Beck ’s show ; it means they wo n’t be advertising on Fox News Channel entirely .
Waitrose advertises on the channel carried by Sky in the United Kingdom , the Guardian says .
MANY of the nearly 30 million Americans who suffer from migraines end up feeling like guinea pigs .
Chronic patients  those who are laid low 15 or more days a month  often cycle through drug after drug in search of relief .
They also contend with side effects like mental sluggishness and stomach upset .
Treatment involves guesswork because doctors have not pinpointed what causes migraines , nor do they know which drugs will best help which patients .
“ It can be a merry - go - round going from medication to medication in pursuit of control , ” said Dr. Roger K. Cady , the vice president of the board for the National Headache Foundation , a nonprofit organization devoted to patient education .
No wonder that last month , news of a surgical “ cure ” that touts a high success rate ricocheted worldwide .
The double - blind study , published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery , found that more than 80 percent of patients who underwent surgery in one of three “ trigger sites ” significantly reduced their number of headaches compared with more than 55 percent of the group who had sham surgery .
More than half of the patients with the real surgery reported a “ complete elimination ” of headaches compared with about 4 percent of the placebo group .
Forehead lifts are cosmetic procedures that plastic surgeons typically perform to smooth furrowed brows .
But a decade ago , after some of his patients reported that their migraines improved post - operation , Dr. Bahman Guyuron , a plastic surgeon and the lead author of the study , began to search for a surgical solution that could address migraine trigger points  which he defines as where the headache begins and settles  in the forehead , temples and the back of the head .
How Much Will You Have to Pay for Hulu ?
Nothing .
How Much Will You Pay for “ Hulu Plus ” ?
Good Question .
Is Hulu putting up a pay wall around its Web TV site ?
Nope .
Does Hulu want to charge people to watch Web TV ?
Yes .
Confused ?
Do n’t be .
It ’s pretty straightforward : Hulu , the joint venture between News Corp . ’s ( NWS ) Fox , GE ’s ( GE ) NBC Universal and Disney ’s ( DIS ) ABC , does n’t plan on charging people to watch the stuff it ’s currently airing on the site–a mix of first - run shows from broadcast TV , a limited number of cable TV shows and a smattering of movies .
But Hulu is trying to figure out how to create some kind of premium offering where you ’ll pay for stuff that is n’t on the site right now .
That ’s what Hulu ’s backers have been saying for months , so it ’s a little puzzling that News Corp.
COO Chase Carey ’s comments got folks worked up yesterday .
Meanwhile , multiple sources familiar with Hulu ’s plans tell me that …
Hulu does n’t actually have a plan yet , but it is trying to piece one together .
There are some pretty obvious ways to go here .
Hulu could sell movies or TV shows on a pay - per - view basis , or it could sell subscriptions to shows it does n’t offer now or to a deeper offering of shows it already has .
You could call it “ Hulu Plus ” ( no charge for that one , guys ) .
If you ’re a fan of Fox ’s “ Family Guy , ” for instance , Hulu is only of limited help :
The site only has the most recent five episodes .
So how much would you pay to watch the rest of them ?
If you do n’t have an answer for that , do n’t worry – Team Hulu does n’t know , either .
Nor can they tell you if airing free shows on Hulu has cut into other revenue streams like broadcast TV advertising or DVD sales , even though “ we ’ve done a thousand regression analyses on this , ” says an industry executive involved in the site .
Do bear in mind that this was a problem Hulu ’s backers did n’t really envision when they were dreaming up the site ; at the time , they were most concerned with building a video site that would allow them to barter with Google ( GOOG ) and Apple ( AAPL ) .
Now they own one of the biggest video sites on the Web , one they say is performing ahead of plan .
And Hulu is selling enough advertising that it ’s coming close to reaching break - even , according to executives I spoke to this week .
But at the very least , adding a pay component to Hulu helps mollify those who fear the site is cannibalizing their existing businesses .
Or who simply want another revenue stream .
And a pay element dovetails with Hulu ’s interest in joining up with the “ authentication ” movement pushed by cable guys like Comcast ( CMCSA ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) .
Meanwhile , here ’s the use case for Hulu that its backers originally envisioned –“ catch up viewing . ”
I was on a plane when last night ’s episode of the “ The Office ” aired , but I can watch the whole thing –with ads I can’t skip–on my laptop today .
And so can you :
You wo n't hear it from the Obama administration , but there 's still a revolution going on in Iran .
Massive protests — which began in June following the sham election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — persisted last month on Quds Day , when the government attempted to orchestrate nationwide anti-Israel marches .
Refusing to follow the regime 's script , marchers chanted " Death to Russia " and " Death to China " instead .
( Russia was the first country to recognize Ahmadinejad as president in June , ...
Here Is What SuperFreakonomics Will Look Like
Today is the day the last substantial changes are being made to the manuscript of SuperFreakonomics , which will be published on October 20 .
We feel it is considerably better than the first book but of course you will be the judge of that .
Today is also the day , happily , that the book ’s cover has been completed .
It was executed by our friends at Number 17 , with explosive and photographic assistance from the extraordinary Andrew Zuckerman .
I love it very much , but I am pretty biased .
I ’m sure you will share your views , especially if they run counter to mine .

McDonald ’s is going to the Louvre .
The new outlet to be opened in one of the stations of the Museum has outraged some of the cultural elite who view art as their domain , not ours .
The Louvre was once a palace filled with the art works of kings and queens .
French Revolutionaries made it a museum for the public in 1793 .
Art was at last accessible to the masses .
Since then , although the Louvre is sill accessible to those who can afford to travel to France , it has become a symbol of both French nationalism and ruling class cultural superiority .
The lesson the 8 million people a year who visit the Louvre learn is that great art is the preserve of the select few , and seeing that art is a privilege bestowed on you ( for a small fee ) by the great and good in society .
As to really appreciating the artworks , well , for another fee , we can explain it to you .
But as for really understanding it , that is something only we elite , trained for many many years , can do .
In other words the Louvre reflects the class divisions in society .
AS class society developed seven or eight thousand years ago the social surplus enabled a select few to rule and some of them to become artists .
The rest of the community became producers of goods and services .
Specialisation of work has been the order of the day for labour ever since , irrespective of the type of class society .
It means that most of us who work to produce the social surplus do n’t have time to become artists let alone great artists .
Those who do have that time live off the surplus value we create .
A society which recognises itself , ie a socialist society , will not impose these constraints on labour .
As Marx put it :
… as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being , each man has a particular , exclusive sphere of activity , which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape .
He is a hunter , a fisherman , a shepherd , or a critical critic , and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood ; while in communist society , where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes , society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow , to hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticise after dinner , just as I have a mind , without ever becoming hunter , fisherman , shepherd or critic .
It probably needs updating to include artist and blogger / critic but you hopefully get the idea .
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
French nationalism has expropriated the global art that is in the Louvre .
The stereotype of ‘ French difference ’ is in fact a late 19th century capitalist construct , one typical of all national bourgeoisie .
It helps tie the working class to the ruling class and is part of the structure that defends the extraction and appropriation of profit from workers .
In France the power of the petit bourgeois farmers as a bulwark of reaction against revolution saw the ruling class favour its survival and development with concessions that have until now kept French small scale agriculture at a level not seen in other developed countries of Europe for decades .
But that is changing .
For a start globalisation has radicalised many small farmers .
In 1999 Jose Bove drove through McDonald ’s in Agen , literally .
Bove is of the left , opposing not globalisation but those who control it and profit from it at the expense of peasants and workers .
He has stood for example in solidarity with the Palestinians , against GMO crops , for farmers ’ control of production and with third world farmers against the rapaciousness of agribusiness .
He is now a member of the European Parliament with Europe Ecologie , an umbrella group of French environmentalists .
In damaging McDonald ’s with his tractor , he drew attention to the anti-small producer logic and reality of big business .
McDonald ’s has responded in part by sourcing 75 percent of its produce from French farmers .
But still McDonald ’s dominance of French gastronomy grows .
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
EVERY ruling class has its lies and the French are no different .
But globalisation is undercutting some of those lies .
The image of a French gastronomic paradise , of a culture par excellence , crashes against the reality of capitalism and its demands on French workers .
The battering ram of global capitalism is destroying the idea of national difference .
Let me quote Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto .
The bourgeoisie , by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production , by the immensely facilitated means of communication , draws all , even the most barbarian , nations into civilization .
The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it forces the barbarians ’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate .
It compels all nations , on pain of extinction , to adopt the bourgeois mode of production ; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst , i.e. , to become bourgeois themselves .
In one word , it creates a world after its own image .
And so it is with McDonald’s .
The business model is simple – cheap , mass produced meals for families .
Have the French been able to resist this heavy artillery of cheap family meals ?
Not at all .
France is the second most profitable country for McDonald ’s in the world .
It has the fastest growing number of customers and of outlets .
Why ?
Maybe the French working class do n’t believe the lies of a French gastronomic paradise , or , more likely , ca n’t afford it .
French pensioners and students for example make up a huge consumer base for McDonald’s .
So too do French working families .
Despite the 35 hour week in France , working hours have been increasing there just as they have in every other country .
Families have less hours in the day to prepare meals and spend time together .
One solution is to go to McDonald ’s and have some time together while eating a cheap meal .
The Golden Arches wo n’t undermine the Louvre .
They ’ll feed hungry tourists .
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Jose Bove had the right idea , although in attacking a symbol of economic oppression he did n’t challenge its existence .
French workers earlier this year responded to the economic crisis with two general strikes , but the respectable Socialist and Communist Parties and their kin in the trade union movement stopped the momentum before it got out of hand .
Memories of May 1968 began to well up and the trade union bureaucrats wanted no threat to capitalism to arise , no tiny spark of resistance to grow .
So they carolled the anger with a May Day strike which they hoped would be the end of the movement , not its beginning .
They succeeded .
McDonald ’s at the Louvre is not the end of the world .
It is but a logical expression of the undemocratic globalisation that sees capitalism spread across the world .
As Marx and Engels said presciently over 160 years ago :
The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe .
It must nestle everywhere , settle everywhere , establish connections everywhere .
But McDonald ’s in France is an example not of the spread of capitalism across the globe into France but of the destruction of old relations of production within an established capitalist country .
Marx and Engels again :
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production , and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society …
All fixed , fast - frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away , all new - formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify .
All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned …
The task for the Left in the face of this internal and external globalisation is to build a mass movement of workers to harness the potential that capitalism has created , for the benefit of all humanity , by extending democracy into the realm of production .

Guns do n’t kill people , it ’s true .
Bullets do .
“ Without ammo , a handgun is only good for pistol - whipping someone , ” notes Assemblyman Kevin de Leon ( D - Los Angeles ) .
“ Ammo is the lifeblood of a handgun . ”
On Sept. 11 , the last day of this year ’s regular legislative session , De Leon narrowly won final passage of a bill to regulate sales of handgun ammunition .
The assemblyman has a long list of gang shooting horror stories from his district , which stretches from Hollywood to the Alhambra city line and includes Echo Park , Lincoln Heights and part of East Los Angeles .
Advertisement
Stray bullets from gang crossfire have killed a 9 - year - old girl playing in the kitchen , a 14 - year - old girl as she sat in the back seat of her family ’s SUV and a 4 - year - old boy while walking with his sister outside their home .
Plus there has been a barrel - load of gangbanger assassinations .
De Leon ’s bill , AB 962 , would make it illegal to knowingly sell handgun ammunition to criminals .
Strangely , De Leon says , it ’s against the law for criminals to possess ammo but not for someone to sell it to them knowing they are criminals .
The bill also would prohibit hard - core gang members -- those under court injunction restrictions -- from possessing handgun bullets .
And -- the more controversial part -- it would require :
* Ammunition dealers to keep bullets out of easy reach of potential shoplifters , similar to cigarettes .
Advertisement
* Dealers to check a purchaser ’s identification , take a thumbprint and make the records available to local law enforcement .
There ’d be no waiting period before delivery of the ammo , as there is with firearms .
* Handgun owners to buy their bullets face - to - face from a licensed dealer .
They could order through the Internet or by mail , but they ’d have to pick up the ammo at a store , just as they now must when buying a gun .
Opponents -- Republican legislators and the gun lobby -- complained about inconveniencing law - abiding citizens .
“ I ’d rather be inconvenienced and alive than have criminals convenienced and be dead , ” says Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca , one of many law enforcement officials who support De Leon ’s bill .
Advertisement
“ The problem is the criminals ’ easy access to ammunition because of the overemphasis on not inconveniencing law - abiding citizens , ” the sheriff adds .
“ The price we all pay is random violence .
A safer society will also be a somewhat more inconvenienced society .
. . .
Those of us in the crime - fighting business need more solutions to control criminal violence . ”
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has not signaled a position on the bill .
But he vetoed another version by a different author five years ago .
In the veto message , Schwarzenegger pointed out that the federal government once had a similar law and concluded it “ was simply unworkable and offered no public safety benefit . ”
The federal law existed from shortly after Robert F. Kennedy ’s assassination in 1968 until President Reagan signed the repealer in 1986 -- a prehistoric era before the Internet and high - tech databases .
Since then -- and since Schwarzenegger ’s veto -- several California cities have proved that , with modern technology , they can use dealers ’ records as a crime - fighting weapon .
They ’re able to track down felons and other people -- spousal abusers , the criminally insane -- who have violated the law by obtaining ammunition .
Advertisement
Los Angeles , Sacramento and 12 other cities -- including Beverly Hills , Carson , Inglewood , Pomona , Santa Ana , Santa Monica and West Hollywood -- have adopted ordinances requiring dealer record - keeping of ammo purchases .
In a 17 - month period , L.A. police arrested 25 people ; confiscated 20 weapons , including a machine gun ; and seized more than 2,900 rounds of ammunition , according to Deputy Chief Charlie Beck .
Sacramento has California ’s most comprehensive ammo-control program .
In less than 20 months , it found that ammunition had been illegally purchased by 229 people , including 173 felons .
The district attorney filed charges against 190 , trial was set for 136 and all but eight pleaded guilty .
Seized were 160 firearms , including seven assault weapons and eight explosive devices .
Police Capt .
James Maccoun , who heads the Sacramento gun detail , says dealers file their information to the department electronically .
Every transaction is checked against a database of people prohibited from possessing weapons .
Advertisement
The dilemma for Sacramento , L.A. and the other cities is that when criminals learn about the dealer record - keeping , they can drive into another community and load up on bullets .
“ We do n’t catch the smart ones , ” Maccoun says .
Beck says L.A. 's law “ would be 10 times more effective if it were statewide . ”
The L.A. ordinance covers all ammunition , including shotgun shells .
Advertisement
De Leon ’s bill would cover only handgun bullets , a concession to hunters .
But that still did n’t attract any Republican legislative support .
The measure passed each house with no votes to spare .
“ This bill is going after rural communities like no other gun bill has , ” declared Assemblyman Joel Anderson ( R - San Diego ) , whose district covers rural areas .
“ So all I ask is : Why ca n’t you just let my people go ? ”
That drew some chuckles .
But most of the half - hour Assembly debate produced predictable opposition verbiage with seemingly little real passion .
Republicans complained about infringing on 2nd Amendment rights , which Democrats vehemently denied .
Advertisement
“ As a law - abiding citizen , staunch supporter of 2nd Amendment rights , a Little League coach who is required to have a thumbprint to coach and required to provide a thumbprint for a driver ’s license , I rise to support this bill , ” said new Assemblyman Steve Bradford ( D - Gardena ) .
Schwarzenegger should sign the measure .
Sheriffs and police chiefs want it .
It ’s a crime - fighting tool that does n’t stomp on the rights of lawful gun owners .
And it would keep loaded weapons out of the hands of some criminals and gangbangers .
Target the bullets .

A Maricopa Association of Governments committee on Wednesday evening approved a controversial plan to extend Loop 202 for 22 miles through Ahwatukee Foothills and South Mountain Park , connecting Chandler to Laveen with an eight - lane freeway .
Despite opposition from Ahwatukee Foothills residents , environmental advocates and about two dozen residents of the Gila River Indian Community , the MAG Transportation Policy Committee voted unanimously in favor of the planned $ 1.9 billion South Mountain Freeway .
Plans call for it to start at Interstate 10 at Pecos Road and end at I - 10 and 59th Avenue and be finished as soon as 2017 .
After listening to about an hour of testimony both for and against the extension , Mesa Mayor Scott Smith moved that the committee approve the plan .
" The reality is we are in a Valley that has grown tremendously , " Smith said .
" We have a freeway system that dumps tens of thousands of cars into the middle of our city .
None of the solutions are perfect , but as a region we have needs that can't be ignored . "
Next Wednesday , the MAG Regional Council is expected to give final approval to the plan .
After that , it will be forwarded to the Arizona Department of Transportation , which will study the environmental impact of the path for the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration .
Proponents of the freeway extension say it would help alleviate traffic congestion on Interstate 10 and West Valley arterial streets .
" We need to build the freeway , " said west Phoenix resident Wes Lines , one of three people at the meeting who spoke in favor of the 202 extension .
" Fifty - first Avenue has gotten so busy it can't handle all the traffic . "
But many in Ahwatukee oppose the extension through their community and South Mountain Park , saying it would destroy homes and a church , and bring noise and pollution to remaining neighborhoods .
A committee of Ahwatukee residents put together by Phoenix City Councilman Sal DiCiccio recently has urged MAG and ADOT officials to see if the Gila River Tribal Council would allow Loop 202 on its land .
But Gila River members who spoke at the meeting pointed out that their Tribal Council has twice passed resolutions against the freeway .
" I know that Ahwatukee residents are upset about losing the serenity of their area , " said Linda Allan , who lives on the Gila River Reservation .
" What about our land ?
We have been there for hundreds and hundreds of years , " she said .
" I do n't think my grandparents and great - grandparents went through what they went through to have a freeway put onto their land . "
WASHINGTON  Late last month , the senior White House adviser David Axelrod and Roger Ailes , chairman and chief executive of Fox News , met in an empty Palm steakhouse before it opened for the day , neutral ground secured for a secret tête - à - tête .
Mr. Ailes , who had reached out to Mr. Axelrod to address rising tensions between the network and the White House , told him that Fox ’s reporters were fair , if tough , and should be considered separate from the Fox commentators who were skewering President Obama nightly , according to people briefed on the meeting .
Mr. Axelrod said it was the view of the White House that Fox News had blurred the line between news and anti-Obama advocacy .
What both men took to be the start of a frank but productive dialogue proved , in retrospect , more akin to the round of pre-Pearl Harbor peace talks between the United States and Japan .
By the following weekend , officials at the White House had decided that if anything , it was time to take the relationship to an even more confrontational level .
The spur : Executives at other news organizations , including The New York Times , had publicly said that their newsrooms had not been fast enough in following stories that Fox News , to the administration ’s chagrin , had been heavily covering through the summer and early fall  namely , past statements and affiliations of the White House adviser Van Jones that ultimately led to his resignation and questions surrounding the community activist group Acorn .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Fannie Mae , the government - controlled mortgage insurer , said Thursday that it needs another $ 10.7 billion from the Treasury Department to stay afloat .
The new infusion means the troubled company has drawn a total of $ 45.9 billion of its $ 200 billion lifeline this year .
Fannie Mae and its sister firm , Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , were taken over by the federal government last September amid the global financial meltdown .
In one hopeful sign , Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 14.8 billion , or $ 2.67 per diluted share , down from $ 23.2 billion , or $ 4.09 per share , in the previous quarter .
The company lost $ 2.3 billion , or $ 2.54 per share , in the second quarter last year .
Credit losses from the housing crisis are still to blame for Fannie Mae 's dour results .
The company racked up $ 18.8 billion in credit - related expenses during the latest quarter .
However , the company reduced its provision for credit losses to $ 18.2 billion , from $ 20.3 billion in the first quarter , because of a slowdown in the increase of estimated defaults and losses per default .
The value of non-performing loans on its books increased to $ 171 billion as of June 30 , compared with $ 144.9 billion on March 31 and $ 119.2 billion on December 31 .
The Obama administration is leaning heavily on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pull the country out of the housing meltdown .
They are key players in the president 's foreclosure rescue program .
The companies will soon have a new regulator .
James Lockhart announced this week that he is stepping down as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency after more than three years .
Ed DeMarco , who helped develop and oversee the insurers ' participation in the administration 's rescue program , will serve as the agency 's acting director .
When Flash first landed on the World Wide Web ( we still called it that back in those days ) it was very popular and it became common for websites that wanted to look “ cool ” to load a Flash animation when a visitor arrived at the site .
The standard method was to force the user to sit through this animation to convince them of how cool you were .
As time passed it became widely accepted that this practice was , to use the technical term , totally fucked .
Despite years of frustrated users screaming at the websites to get that stupid fucking intro out of their way and let them use the site , some sites argue that there are certain cases where a Flash into is still a good idea .
Maybe so .

No longer the stuff of disturbing futuristic fantasies , an arsenal of u201 Ccrowd control munitions , u201D including one that reportedly made its debut in the U.S. , was deployed with a massive , overpowering police presence in Pittsburgh during last week 's G - 20 protests .
Nearly 200 arrests were made and civil liberties groups charged the many thousands of police ( most transported on Port Authority buses displaying u201CPITTSBURGH WELCOMES THE WORLDu201D ) , from as far away as Arizona and Florida with overreacting … and they had plenty of weaponry with which to do it .
Bean bags fired from shotguns , CS ( tear ) gas , OC ( Oleoresin Capsicum ) spray , flash - bang grenades , batons and , according to local news reports , for the first time on the streets of America , the Long Range Acoustic Device ( LRAD ) .
Mounted in the turret of an Armored Personnel Carrier ( APC ) , I saw the LRAD in action twice in the area of 25th , Penn and Liberty Streets of Lawrenceville , an old Pittsburgh neighborhood .
Blasting a shrill , piercing noise like a high - pitched police siren on steroids , it quickly swept streets and sidewalks of pedestrians , merchants and journalists and drove residents into their homes , but in neither case were any demonstrators present .
The APC , oversized and sinister for a city street , together with lines of police in full riot gear looking like darkly threatening Michelin Men , made for a scene out of a movie you did n't want to be in .
As intimidating as this massive show of armed force and technology was , the good burghers of Pittsburgh and their fellow citizens in the Land of the Brave and Home of the Free ain't seen nothin ' yet .
Tear gas and pepper spray are nothing to sniff at and , indeed , have proven fatal a surprising number of times , but they have now become the old standbys compared to the list below that 's already at or coming soon to a police station or National Guard headquarters near you .
Proving that u201 C what goes around , comes around , u201D some of the new Property Protection Devices were developed by a network of federally - funded , university - based research institutes like one in Pittsburgh itself , Penn State 's Institute for Non-Lethal Defense Technologies .
In Pittsburgh last week , an enormously expensive show of police and weaponry , intended for u201Csecurityu201D of the G20 delegates , simultaneously shut workers out of downtown jobs for two days , forced gasping students and residents back into their dormitories and homes , and turned journalists ' press passes into quaint , obsolete reminders of a bygone time .
Most significant of all , however , was what Witold Walczak , legal director of the Pennsylvania ACLU , told the Associated Press : u201CIt ’s not just intimidation , it ’s disruption and in some cases outright prevention of peaceful protesters being able to get their message out .

Many fields of study suffer from what 's called " publication bias " as a result of the fact that journals are usually happier to run articles that describe positive results .
This is especially problematic in the case of medical studies , where negative results can be extremely useful — it 's valuable to know which drugs do n't work — and commercial interests are more than happy to keep failed trials quiet .
In 2005 , medical journals forged a policy meant to ensure that a description of any clinical trial would be registered in public databases before it took place .
A new study in this week 's edition of JAMA suggests that the impact of this policy has been a bit limited : not every clinical study is being registered , and many trials result in publications that differ significantly from the experiments described in these databases .
The policy in question was crafted with the intention of ensuring that any clinical trial would be visible to the public and research community , regardless of whether the results were ultimately deemed worthy of publication .
The journals agreed that they would refuse to publish any results that had n't been registered in a clinical trial database , such as the US ' ClinicalTrials.gov , in advance .
This provides a very strong incentive to register any trial .
Nobody typically starts a trial they know is going to fail , and both researchers and drug companies have strong incentives to publish positive results — it makes sense to register everything in advance , simply to ensure the option of publication later .
As a result , the trial registries should become a valuable resource to the research community , which will have a better sense of work that might otherwise be invisible , and regulators , who will know if a company might be sitting on informative results .
Of course , all of this depends on things working as intended : journals can't break ranks and publish studies that have n't been registered , and researchers have to register an accurate description of the trial that takes place .
The JAMA study looked into how well this is working out .
Its authors searched PubMed for papers published in 2008 that described the results of a randomized clinical trial in one of three fields : cardiology , rheumatology , and gastroenterology .
In many cases , the publications included information on the trial 's registration .
If they did n't , the authors of the paper were contacted and , if that failed , the details were plugged into a variety of national and international trial registration sites in an attempt to identify it .
Right away , they ran into problems .
Of the 323 published trials that they identified , a full 89 ( 27 percent ) had n't been registered at all , as far as the authors could tell .
Another 39 had been registered , but had a result , termed a primary outcome , that was too vague .
" For example , ' blood pressure ' is not a clearly specified outcome , " the authors note .
" Ideally , we sought an unambiguous definition ( e.g. , change in systolic pressure from baseline at 12 months ) . "
Three of the trials were actually registered only after the study had been completed .
That left them with only about half of the initially identified studies to work with .
But , even here , there were notable problems .
In 46 cases , the trial was registered with a primary outcome that was n't the same as the one described in the publication .
So , for example , 15 of them published results that never mentioned the primary outcome that the trial was intended to study .
In other cases , the intended primary outcome was demoted to a secondary result , or a planned secondary outcome became the primary focus of the eventual publication .
Looking at why these changes occurred , the researchers found that the shift generally happened because the results from the planned focus were n't statistically significant ; the ones that replaced them were .
So , there 's still a publication bias towards positive results , but it 's a matter of a change in emphasis within a publication .
For the most part , it 's hard to fault papers for focusing on positive results , even if they were n't really the ones that the researchers set out to examine .
Still , the fact that the intended outcomes were n't mentioned at all in over 10 percent of the cases is cause for concern .
Overall , the mere fact that this study could be pursued is an indication that the new system is having an effect : a significant number of researchers are now registering their clinical trials , and doing so well enough that the intended outcomes can be compared with what gets published .
Still , the significant discrepancies indicate that it can be viewed as a work - in - progress rather than a job well done .
It 's obvious that the journals are still publishing papers based on trials that have n't been registered .
This means that their editors need to become stricter about rejecting papers that do n't conform to the policy , and apply pressure to the editors of journals that have n't yet adopted it .
But it seems that peer reviewers will have to shoulder some responsibilities as well .
It 's their job to provide a scientific vetting , and they 're best positioned to identify when a trial registration is too vague to be valuable or describes experiments that wind up being at odds with the eventual publication .
The journals could obviously help them by requiring that reviewers get trial registration information from the authors and instructing them to compare the registration with the results , but , ultimately , the reviewers will have to follow through .

McIver , 24 , spent the 2008.09 season split between the Anaheim Ducks and Canucks .
In 18 NHL games last season , all with Anaheim , McIver recorded one assist and 36 penalty minutes .
In an additional 28 games with the Canucks American Hockey League affiliate , Manitoba Moose , McIver had two assists and 59 penalty minutes .
The 6 ’3 ” , 205 - pound defenceman was originally drafted 254th overall by the Canucks in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft .
One of the central tenants of central bank politics is that these venerable institutions must be insulated from political influence and intimidation .
It was not so long ago that the obscure and enigmatic central banker was considered the most adept .
The " independence " of central banks is intended partly to service their unenviable burdens .
In particular , the need to put the breaks on the economy here and there - a decidedly unpopular mandate politically , indeed , one that can topple administrations .
Further , to resist the many calls to spur short - term growth ( paid back with interest in later years ) via monetary policy .
In this context , and given the recent calls for total transparency ( read : total political accountability ) of the Federal Reserve System how is one to look at " The Great Moderation ? "
In the case of this article , as an opportunity to offer a pair of novel and contrarian theories :
1 . It was the presence of political accountability in monetary policy , not its absence that sewed the seeds of the present crisis .
2 . The natural conclusion can only be that Monetary Policy Institutions require less political accountability , not more .
To begin with , it will be useful to be particular about what is meant by " Monetary Policy Institutions . "
Obviously , central banks officially charged with the management of monetary policy apply .
Officially , ( that is , according to the Federal Reserve Act ) the goal of monetary policy is to :
... maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy 's long run potential to increase production , so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long - term interest rates .
( 12 USC § 225(a ) )
Conventional wisdom would hold this role as one limited to the Federal Reserve System - since that 's what the Federal Reserve Act says .
Practically speaking , the Federal Reserve System is merely one of several Monetary Policy Institutions in the United States - that is , institutions with the ability and the indirect ( if not direct ) mandate to influence prices , employment and long - term interest rates on a large scale .
Some introductory facts :
In 2008 some $ 6 trillion in interest bearing , marketable public debt issued by the Treasury was outstanding .
Nearly $ 9 trillion in " Mortgage Related " debt was floating about at the same time .
Of this , some $ 5 trillion was either securitized or guaranteed by Government Sponsored Entities ( " GSEs " ) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or other government entities .
The Federal Reserve 's balance sheet today , near its most bloated state , sits at a mere $ 2.1 trillion , and this is more than double its size before the recent , world - saving expansion .
True , GSEs and other mortgage related entities do not have the Discount Window as a tool to influence rates .
But given their central role in setting mortgage rates for the country ( an $ 8 trillion dollar economic experiment ) and the ability to permit market actors to offload risk to them with impunity , it is difficult not to regard these institutions as powerful monetary policy tools , tools that have been used shamelessly since the 1980s to artificially push mortgage rates below their equilibrium state even given an already loose monetary policy pursued by crisis pariah Alan Greenspan .
Recognizing the " multi- tiered " nature of monetary policy is critical to understanding both the current crisis , and the nature of the problem .
Put simply : Not content with permitting the Federal Reserve System to run monetary policy , that is , believing that , in its wisdom , it knew better what mortgage rates should look like , Congress , with the acquiescence of a number of successive executive administrations , elected to usurp a wide swath of monetary policy for itself via mortgage lending .
The result : Real estate became joe - sixpack 's bank , 401 ( k ) portfolio , job creation machine , unemployment check , and , finally , lender of last resort .
It is easy to forget that during Greenspan 's tenure , Congress often chided ( even outright savaged ) the Chairman for not doing enough to spur levels of economic growth they thought appropriate .
In hindsight this is illustrative of the concept that the " green is always greener on the other side " ( of monetary policy ) even during boom times .
Greenspan 's contemporary bemusement that he might be blamed for the crisis given his belief that " short term " rates should n't influence mortgages fell on deaf ears - but probably should n't have .
The reality is that through a series of political lackeys appointed based on the merits of their political acumen and either totally out of their depth or at the end of their careers , the GSEs effectuated rampantly loose monetary policy for years , totally unopposed by Democrats ( who were graciously ushered into office by the millions of beneficiaries of glossy " low - income loans , " " first time buyer " incentives and the like ) or Republicans ( who were lulled into hypnotic trances by prose containing the phrase " The American Dream of Home Ownership . " )
It is precisely because the political system creates such bi-partisian perfect storms that monetary policy should never be given over to populists .
Since this author is hard - pressed to named a non-populist in Congress today , turning over the Federal Reserve System to legislative whims suggests a quick repeat of the same crisis writ large ( r ) .
The Federal Reserve System must have the stamina and testicular fortitude to stand firm in the face of crisis and embrace bank failure and rebirth .
Letting Lehman go , far from a sin , was quite saintly .
What followed , a total acquiescence to political cries to " do something for the love of all things capitalist , " was the beginning of the end .
Oh no !
The country will not permit that sort of thing again !
While auditing the Federal Reserve System may go a long way toward exposing the dangers of the institution and the excesses of years past , there is a real danger that subjecting it to scrutiny in future years will make monetary policy even more a political animal than it is today .
One wonders , even as the Federal Housing Administration teeters towards collapse , how the many adjuncts and aides - de - camp to the GSEs have managed to avoid similar scrutiny given their central role in the crisis .

When scientists at the Australian Institute of Sport recently decided to check the Vitamin D status of some of that country ’s elite female gymnasts , their findings were fairly alarming .
Of the 18 gymnasts tested , 15 had levels that were “ below current recommended guidelines for optimal bone health , ” the study ’s authors report .
Six of these had Vitamin D levels that would qualify as medically deficient .
Unlike other nutrients , Vitamin D can be obtained by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight , as well as through foods or supplements .
Of course , female gymnasts are a unique and specialized bunch , not known for the quality or quantity of their diets , or for getting outside much .
But in another study presented at a conference earlier this year , researchers found that many of a group of distance runners also had poor Vitamin D status .
Forty percent of the runners , who trained outdoors in sunny Baton Rouge , Louisiana , had insufficient Vitamin D. “ It was something of a surprise , ” says D. Enette Larson - Meyer , an assistant professor in the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences at the University of Wyoming and one of the authors of the study .
Vitamin D is an often overlooked element in athletic achievement , a “ sleeper nutrient , ” says John Anderson , a professor emeritus of nutrition at the University of North Carolina and one of the authors of a review article published online in May about Vitamin D and athletic performance .
Vitamin D once was thought to be primarily involved in bone development .
But a growing body of research suggests that it ’s vital in multiple different bodily functions , including allowing body cells to utilize calcium ( which is essential for cell metabolism ) , muscle fibers to develop and grow normally , and the immune system to function properly .
“ Almost every cell in the body has receptors ” for Vitamin D , Anderson says .
“ It can up - regulate and down - regulate hundreds , maybe even thousands of genes , ” Larson - Meyer says .
“ We ’re only at the start of understanding how important it is . ”
But many of us , it seems , no matter how active and scrupulous we are about health , do n’t get enough Vitamin D. Nowadays , “ many people are n’t going outside very much , ” Johnson says , and most of us
assiduously apply sunscreen and take other precautions when we do .
The Baton Rouge runners , for instance , most likely “ ran early in the morning or late in the day , ” Larson - Meyer says , reducing their chances of heat stroke or sunburn , but also reducing their exposure to sunlight .
Meanwhile , dietary sources of Vitamin D are meager .
Cod - liver oil provides a whopping dose .
But a glass of fortified milk provides a fraction of what scientists now think we need per day .
( A major study published online in the journal Pediatrics last month concluded that more than 60 percent of American children , or almost 51 million kids , have “ insufficient ” levels of Vitamin D and another 9 percent , or 7.6 million children , are clinically “ deficient , ” a serious condition .
Cases of childhood rickets , a bone disease caused by lack of Vitamin D , have been rising in the U.S. in recent years . )
Although few studies have looked closely at the issue of Vitamin D and athletic performance , those that have are suggestive .
A series of strange but evocative studies undertaken decades ago in Russia and Germany , for instance , hint that the Eastern Bloc nations may have depended in part on sunlamps and Vitamin D to produce their preternaturally well - muscled and world - beating athletes .
In one of the studies , four Russian sprinters were doused with artificial , ultraviolet light .
Another group was n’t .
Both trained identically for the 100 - meter dash .
The control group lowered their sprint times by 1.7 percent .
The radiated runners , in comparison , improved by an impressive 7.4 percent .
More recently , when researchers tested the vertical jumping ability of a small group of adolescent athletes , Larson - Meyer says , “ they found that those who had the lowest levels of Vitamin D tended not to jump as high , ” intimating that too little of the nutrient may impair muscle power .
Low levels might also contribute to sports injuries , in part because Vitamin D is so important for bone and muscle health .
In a Creighton University study of female naval recruits , stress fractures were reduced significantly after the women started taking supplements of Vitamin D and calcium .
A number of recent studies also have shown that , among athletes who train outside year - round , maximal oxygen intake tends to be highest in late summer , Johnson says .
The athletes , in other words , are fittest in August , when ultraviolet radiation from the sun is near its zenith .
They often then experience an abrupt drop in maximal oxygen intake ,
beginning as early as September , even thought they continue to train just as hard .
This decline coincides with the autumnal lengthening of the angle of sunlight .
Less ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth and , apparently , sports performance suffers .
Concerned now about your Vitamin D status ?
You can learn your status with a simple blood test .
An at - home version is available through the Web site of the Vitamin D Council .
( Use of the tests is restricted in some states , including New York .
See the website for details . )
Be sure that any test checks the level of 25 ( OH ) D in your blood .
This level “ should generally be above 50 nanograms per milliliter , ” Larson - Meyer says .
If your levels are low , talk to your doctor about the best response .
Sunlight is one easy , if controversial , fix .
“ Most dermatologists will still tell you that no amount of sun exposure is safe , ” Johnson says .
But Larson - Meyer and other Vitamin D researchers are n’t so sure .
“ There ’s no good , scientific evidence that five to thirty minutes of sunlight a few times a week is harmful , ” she says .
Or try supplements .
“ 1,000 IU a day and much more for people who are deficient ” is probably close to ideal , Larson - Meyer says .
This , by the way , is about double the current recommended daily allowance .
Most experts anticipate that this allowance will be revised upward soon .
Consult with your doctor before beginning supplements .
Overdoses of Vitamin D are rare , but can occur .
Finally , stay tuned .
“ In the next few years , we ’re going to be learning much more ” about the role of vitamin D in bodily function and sports performance , Larson - Meyer says .
Mir ist da was aufgefallen … 😉
Sehr geehrter Herr Lösche ,
Gestern lief im Heute - Journal ein Bericht , der mir an sich sehr gut gefiel , weil er relativ neutral bis positiv war .
Nur der Teil , in dem sie zur Piratenpartei Stellung bezogen lässt Raum für Diskussionen .
( Siehe : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxknFRcY7LA)
Leider war ich etwas verwundert über ihr undifferenziertes Statement zur Piratenpartei .
Von ihnen als Politikwissenschaftler hätte ich etwas mehr Objektivität erwartet .
Sie meinten darin wortwörtlich :
„ Die Piraten sind eine Einpunkt - Partei .
So wichtig das Grundrecht auf freie Meinungsäußerung auch ist , sie sind einfach schmalbrüstig . “
Nun würde es mich interessieren , wie sie zu dieser unfairen , unwahren Aussage kommen .
Von einer objektiven Betrachtung des Phänomens Piratenpartei kann bei dieser Wortwahl jedenfalls keine Rede sein .
Ich empfehle ihnen die Lektüre des Parteiprogramms , welches sie unter folgendem Link als PDF herunter laden können :
http://www.piratenpartei.de/tmp/Wahlprogramm_Bundestagswahl2009.pdf
Das Wahlprogramm der Piratenpartei umfasst definitiv mehr als nur einen Punkt .
Ich habe mal einige Informationen über sie eingeholt , was nicht schwer war , da sie ja fast schon eine berühmte Persönlichkeit sind .
Wäre ich ein Mensch , der ihnen Böses unterstellen wollte , so würde ich auf „ verdächtige “ Veröffentlichungen ihrerseits verweisen , wie z.B .
– Verbände und Lobbyismus in Deutschland , Stuttgart 2006 ( im Erscheinen )
– Demokratie braucht Lobbying .
In : Thomas Leif / Rudolf Speth ( Hrg. ) , Die fünfte Gewalt .
Lobbyismus in Deutschland .
Bonn 2006 .
S. 53-68
– Lobbyismus als spezifische Form der Politikberatung .
In : Svenja Falk / Dieter Rehfeld / Andrea Römmele / Martin Thunert ( Hrg. ) , Handbuch Politikberatung .
Wiesbaden 2006 , S. 334-342 .
( Quelle : http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/39429.html)
… in denen sie Lobbyismus offensichtlich eher unkritisch gegenüber stehen und diese undemokratische Form der Mitbestimmung als Notwendigkeit darstellen .
Ich bin jedoch der Meinung , dass die überwältigende Mehrheit der Lobbyverbände nicht im Interesse des Volkes , sondern meistens ausschließlich im Interesse der jeweiligen Branchen und / oder Unternehmen handeln und dass sie die Medien , sowie die Politik dadurch meistens in einer Weise beeinflussen , mit der die Mehrheit der Bürger nicht einverstanden ist ( bzw .
wäre , sofern sie von den etablierten Medien „ ordentlich “ über die Ziele & Konsequenzen der so erlassenen Gesetze & Verordnungen aufgeklärt würde ) .
Ich dürfte ihnen nun auch noch Befangenheit unterstellen , welche sich durch ihre jahrzehntelange Mitgliedschaft in der SPD ( sogar über ein halbes Jahrhundert ) ergeben könnte – Aber wie gesagt , nur wenn ich ein böser Mensch wäre , der ihrem und dem Ansehen des ZDF schaden wollte und der hinter allem die große Verschwörung sieht .
( Quelle : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lösche)
Doch ich bin ja kein böser Mensch .
Aber auf den Kopf gefallen bin ich auch nicht , genauso wie viele meiner Mitbürger .
Ich lasse mich nicht so einfach hinters
Licht führen , wie ( leider ) so viele meiner Mitmenschen , die sich nicht richtig informieren , sondern hinterfrage kritisch und bilde mir meine eigene Meinung , bevor ich Expertenmeinungen blind Glauben schenke .
Mich stört es extrem , dass in diesem Land die „ etablierten “ Medien nach der Pfeife der „ etablierten “ Parteien tanzen ( siehe : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeLRgrZY9gc) und dass das Medium Internet ständig unterschätzt , dämonisiert und als „ rechtsfreier Raum “ verunglimpft wird .
Ich bin mir sicher : Das Internet ist die zukunftsweisendeste Innovation , seit der Erfindung des Rads !
Dieser Erkenntnis wird sich bald auch die Politik nicht mehr entziehen können .
Was ich mit der Zeit mitbekam , machte mich immer misstrauischer .
Ich finde es nicht fair , dass das ZDF - Heute - Journal Fachmänner zu Wort kommen lässt , die selbst Mitglied der SPD sind , dessen Aussagen dadurch nicht mehr wirklich ernst genommen werden können .
Disclaimer : Dieser offene Brief stellt die Meinung einer einzelnen Person und keine offizielle Position der Piratenpartei dar .
Of course
You can trust me .

A new article recently published in the Journal for Specialists in Pediatric Nursing explored vaccination history , vaccine safety monitoring systems in the U.S. , and the two most publicized theoretical vaccine - related exposures associated with autism – the vaccine preservative thimerosal and the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine .
A review of published research shows that there is not convincing scientific evidence supporting a relationship between vaccines and autism .
The article is part of a special issue , which includes five articles focusing on the topic of autism .
By definition , the onset of autism occurs prior to age three .
No clear cause of autism has been identified , although various possible associations have been examined .
There has been growing interest in environmental exposures , including vaccinations .
Childhood vaccinations are administered as early as possible to assure that infants are protected against diseases that occur in early childhood .
This time period often coincides with the time period that autism may be suspected or diagnosed .
A British paper published about 10 years ago seemingly made the claim that receipt of the MMR vaccine was associated with autism .
This initial report of a possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and the onset of autism received significant attention , and in England , MMR immunization rates dropped and the number of measles cases rose dramatically over the next decade .
In response to this concern in the U.S. , the CDC and NIH examined vaccine safety issues and after performing an in - depth review of the relevant literature , rejected a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism .
Eventually most of the authors of the original British paper also asked to retract the interpretation of their findings .
Concerns have also been raised about thimerosal , a preservative in multidose vaccines that was removed from routine vaccines in 2001 in the US and in 1992 in Denmark and Sweden .
Despite the removal in Denmark and Sweden , autism rates have continued to increase there .
Other studies have failed to find a link as well .
Finally , in February 2009 , the U.S. Court of Federal claims found that the MMR vaccine and thimerosal containing vaccines were not causal factors in the development of autism .
" Nurses are often in the unique position of providing advice regarding vaccines in their formal practice areas as well as in their daily lives , " the authors note .
" It is thus imperative that they have knowledge of the research and its results when discussing vaccines with parents , peers , and medical health professionals . "
Minnesota is getting its star wide receiver back for an abbreviated Big Ten season .
Penn State will not be so fortunate with its All - America linebacker .
Minnesota announced Wednesday that Rashod Bateman was cleared to play this season by the NCAA and Big Ten after opting out in August .
At Penn State , coach James Franklin closed the door on All - America linebacker Micah Parsons returning to the Nittany Lions .
The Big Ten postponed its fall football season on Aug. 11 , then announced two weeks ago that it would play after all , starting the weekend of Oct. 23 .
Both Bateman and Parsons opted out of the 2020 season before the Big Ten postponed amid concerns about the pandemic .
“ I want to thank the NCAA , Big Ten and our compliance office for working together and coming to a resolution that restored Rashod 's eligibility and allows him to play this fall , ” Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck said .
Bateman caught 60 passes for 1,219 yards and 11 touchdowns last season as a sophomore .
In coming back , Bateman announced he will wear jersey number zero for the Gophers , explaining : “ Because there is zero tolerance for racism in this culture , and there is zero doubt about what this program stands for . ”
“ These past few months have been uncertain and challenging , challenging for myself , this university and our society , ” Bateman said in a video posted on his Instagram account .
“ The Row the Boat culture has changed my life forever .
I know that to get through tough times , you have to keep your oar in the water , and I feel the safest and the best place to move forward is here at the University of Minnesota .
We ’ve got work left to be done , as a team and as a society . ”
Franklin told reporters Parsons had interest in returning to college football but after discussions with the player and his family , it was not going to happen .
" He had been gone for so long that it made it a little bit more complicated to work through , ” Franklin said .
Parsons was expected to be one of the best players in the country this season and is a likely high first - round pick in April 's NFL draft .
He had 109 tackles and five sacks as a sophomore last season .
Other Big
Ten schools have welcomed back stars .
Ohio State is getting back All - Americans Shaun Wade , a defensive back , and Wyatt Davis , a guard .
Michigan tackle Jaylen Mayfield , who opted out in August after the Big Ten 's postponement , is eligible to play for the Wolverines .
Purdue All - America receiver Rondale Moore , who opted out early like Parsons and Bateman , was cleared to play for the Boilermakers last week .
In the Pac - 12 , Oregon has been hit hardest by opt outs and it does not appear that the Ducks will be getting any of their departed stars back .
All - America offensive tackle Penei Sewell has declared for the draft along with defensive backs Deommodore Lenoir , Thomas Graham and Jevon Holland .
Southern California coach Clay Helton recently told reporters he had not ruled out the return of defensive tackle Jay Tufele and offensive lineman Alijah Vera - Tucker .
“ Those conversations are ongoing , ” Helton said .

Airships may be the key component in a new robotic system for exploring the celestial bodies most likely to harbor life like Mars and Jupiter 's moon , Titan .
The dirigibles would provide regional observations and autonomous command for ground - based vehicles , while maintaining contact with orbiters .
It 'd be a new role for airships , which were the wonder of the aerial world in the days before airplanes ( and rockets and space shuttles ) .
" The balloon or airship has a lot of advantages :
It 's buoyant , so it keeps its altitude and you do not need to invest energy to keep it afloat , " said Wolfgang Fink , who led the work at Cal Tech 's Visual and Autonomous Exploration Systems Research Laboratory , before accepting an appointment at the University of Arizona .
" It has a lot of advantages , especially in places like Titan , which has a dense atmosphere that 's perfect for an airship . "
Current robotic exploration missions are limited .
Orbiting telescopes like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provide low - resolution views of vast swaths of a celestial body while rovers and landers provide detailed observations of a tiny region .
Fink argues that we 'll need teams of robots to do any serious exploration looking for interesting features that might tip us off to the presence of life or geological activity .
And on planets with atmospheres , airships are the ideal middle layer for " tier - scalable reconnaissance , " a vision Fink has spelled out in a series of papers over the past several years .
To test how teams of autonomous robots working together could explore an area , Fink 's team built a miniature lab version of the system , as seen in the image above .
At just 4 feet by 5 feet , it 's not exactly the surface of Mars , but it allowed the team to test a piece of software that picks out anomalous objects in a landscape , the Automatic Global Feature Analyzer .
The software does n't try to place what it reads in images into known categories .
Surveying a scene , it does n't try to identify certain kind of rocks or geological features .
Instead , it just looks for the odd stuff out — the Waldo — in the scene .
For a place like Mars , where we know a lot of the territory is similar and seemingly lifeless , the weird stuff is probably the good stuff .
" If you do not know what you will encounter , you have to embrace the unknown , " Fink said .
With the miniature lab tests complete , Fink plans to take his show on the road , probably to the Arizona desert .
Over a large geographic region , they 'll float an airship with on - board camera and release rovers controlled by the feature analyzer software .
" For initial test purposes , we could put a Coke can and see if the science algorithms will flag these anomalies , " Fink said , " And then , once they are flagged , generate the navigation commands that are issued from the airships to the ground . "
They plan to try the Coke can test in the next year .
As time goes on , they will try more difficult terrains out because ultimately , it 's the extreme areas of other planets that could prove the most interesting .
By keeping the ground units cheap , they can also have more of them , allowing the missions to take greater risks .
" Mountain ranges , canyons , cliffs – those are the locations where interesting stuff might happen , " Fink said .
" You need to be able to get into those high - risk areas to get a nice and interesting science return .
You might lose some of these agents you deploy , but because they are simplified , you can deploy more of them and still afford to lose some of them . "
The entire system — satellite , airships and ground rovers — could be ready to go in the next decade , which would be long before NASA could actually use it .

BEIJING , Dec. 18 — At 5:45 in the morning the cabbage line outside the Old Drum Tower Outer Street New People ’s Produce Market is nearly two hours old .
First in line is a 72 - year - old woman named Mrs. Wang , who awoke at 3 , arrived at 4 and would wait until 8:30 for a single head of winter cabbage .
Free .
Cabbage , or bai cai , costs about 4 cents a head , so Mrs .
Wang ’s prize was not quite a free refrigerator .
She did not mind .
Nor did another retired matron who passed the time singing patriotic tunes and a shaky but enthusiastic English rendition of “ Baa Baa Black Sheep . ”
And neither did two elderly combatants who shouted at each another in unprintable Chinese for inexplicable reasons .
“ They are just fighting because they have nothing better to do , ” explained Mrs. Wang , who declined to provide her first name .
“ We all know each other .
We ’re all old neighbors . ”
Cabbage and old people are civic institutions in Beijing .
Winter brings them together .
For generations cabbage has arrived in markets by November , and Beijingers have hoarded it as an insurance policy to last them until spring , depending on the outdoor refrigeration of rooftops or windowsills .
Cabbage and turnips were the staples that saw people through the uncertain harvests and aching poverty of the Mao era .

Party conferences are all very well , but they are not always closely related to life on this planet .
That does n't usually matter , because life in the political bubble is interesting enough .
It has characters , mad , bad , dangerous and lovable ; it has fights , feuds and reconciliations ; and endless speculation about who is up or down .
In Labour 's case , though , we will be treated to a particularly otherworldly experience this week , in that the one bubble - world question is hardly going to be discussed – namely whether Gordon Brown will still be Prime Minister at the election .
Journalists will still use the conference as an excuse to interview each other about it .
That will only add another layer of unreality to the proceedings .
Not since the Conservative conference of 2003 , in which Iain Duncan Smith 's speech was interrupted by 17 standing ovations , will a party put on such a strenuous show of unity in defiance of the bubble 's own obsessions .
Let us skip over the bubble , therefore , to Friday , when a real political event occurs that does have implications for life on this planet – or at least this European corner of it .
At the end of this week the Irish will vote in a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty , with opinion polls suggesting that , this time , they will vote yes .
It could , of course , be argued that European politics is even more detached from Earth - bound matters than the Westminster bubble , and there is some truth in that .
The detail of the Lisbon Treaty is technical and confusing .
This supposed " tidying - up exercise " , as Jack Straw once called it , has spawned a bureaucratic Hydra of heads : a president of the council , a president of the commission and a foreign and security high representative thing .
None of the changes in the treaty will make any difference to the shape of our bananas or which side of the road we drive on .

And yet there is a larger and simpler truth , which is that Britain 's place in Europe is a basic alignment of our politics .
It does make a real - world difference whether the British Government is working with the grain of the rest of Europe or against it .
Which is why the response of British leaders to the Irish vote is so important .
In my interview with David Miliband today , the Foreign Secretary is scathing about David Cameron 's refusal to spell out his response to a yes vote .
So far , the Conservative leader has clung to an ambiguous form of words : that , if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified , he " would not let the matter rest there " .
On Friday , that slogan is likely to become unsustainable .
At that point , Cameron faces a series of choices .
What to say , and when to say it ?
To anyone observing from the outside , both are no -brainers .
He has to say that a Conservative government would accept the Lisbon Treaty now that it is likely to be ratified before the election .
And he should say it within minutes of the result of the Irish vote becoming known .
Waiting until his conference speech the following Thursday is the sort of thing that Gordon Brown would try to do .
Yet it looks as if Cameron will not say what he ought to say , in which case when he says it becomes irrelevant .
I understand that the Conservative leadership is still hoping that , even if the Irish say yes , the treaty will be delayed by a legal challenge in the Czech courts .
Vaclav Klaus , the Czech President , has not put his blob of sealing wax on the parchment yet , even though it has been approved by his parliament .
Klaus is a Eurosceptic , whose party is a member of the Tories ' new group in the European Parliament .
But there is an air of wishful thinking about all this .
British Eurosceptics have wound each other up for months about how the Lisbon Treaty could be derailed , seizing with an alarming lack of proportion on rogue polls in Ireland and a ruling by the German constitutional court that was reversed , as expected , last week .
My knowledge of the Czech legal system consists of a novel by Franz Kafka , but Foreign Office officials who are paid to know about such things say that the challenge is " not a problem " .
Miliband is not wrong to say that " it looks like the Tebbits , etc " wo n't let Cameron say , " Of course we 've got to live with Lisbon . "
The transformation of the parliamentary Conservative Party into an almost exclusively Eurosceptic body is one of the longest - lasting and most poisonous legacies of Margaret Thatcher .
Cameron himself is a gut sceptic , though he has the political wit to include the pro-European Kenneth Clarke in his Shadow Cabinet .
But does he have the political courage to tell the rest of his party what it is so unwilling to hear ?
Not yet .
Hence the discussion , as we report today , about other referendums that a Conservative government could hold .
Cameron as prime minister could not hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty once it has been ratified , as the Europhobes want : to repudiate the treaty after it has come into effect would be to leave the EU .
Hence the compromise plan for a popular vote on other issues that might come up in future negotiations .
It is not going to satisfy the hardliners .
Cameron 's cowardice on Europe is part of a pattern .
Painting with the broad brush of feel - good rhetoric , he is a moderniser , replacing the image of the Tories as right - wing zealots .
But on specifics he is often cautious and conciliatory of his own base .
There are two things he could do that would make it easier for soft - core Blairites to complete the transition from New Labour to liberal Conservative .
One would be to accept the Lisbon Treaty ; the other would be to ditch the promise of an inheritance tax cut for estates of up to £ 1 m , as Kenneth Clarke tried to do earlier this year .
He succeeded only in pushing it back towards the end of a first parliament .
As he prepares his conference speech , Cameron has been rereading the speeches delivered by Thatcher in 1978 and Tony Blair in 1996 before they came to power .
Thatcher 's in particular has struck him for its lack of policy and strength of values .
But policy matters in the real world , and on Friday he faces a critical test .
John Rentoul 's blog is at independent.co.uk/ jrentoul
The comment in question originally asserted that he would take down Protein Wisdom in response to my article and otherwise took issue with my journalistic ethics in very colorful language .
After I linked to it , he edited the comment to remove the part about him shutting down his own blog along with a couple of other , silly things .
Luckily , I took a screen cap of the comment before he got around to editing it .
This unsavory little incident , I think , goes to prove the point that I 'm trying to make about the way in which the blogosphere is sometimes misused in order to advance misinformation .
It also goes to show that the blogosphere is more often a means of advancing the truth - the fact that I can defend myself from what could have ended up looking like a situation in which I 'd made up or exaggerated the facts is an important reminder of how useful the blogosphere can be , especially when a particular argument requires ready access to the facts .
Update
Here is the portion of Goldstein 's original comment that he later removed on the sly , for those who'd rather not squint at a screen grab :
I 've always tried to allow opposing views on this site .
Hell , I 've let leftwing folks post here , have tried setting up debates with feminist sites .
For my troubles , I 'll now become the rightwing object lesson for nasty commentary .
All because some guy was treated poorly , and because he could n't be bothered to look past that and do research to see what this site was always about .
Of course , if I want to defend myself against such claims , I 'm free to go prove myself innocent .
That 's one of the " concessions . "
How kind .
Awesome !
I am well and truly done now .
I hate every last bit of this .
After deciding that he would instead take a more nonchalant approach , he changed the text to this :
Awesome !
Guess I deserve this for being one of the few sites that actually allows for debate .
... not to mention stealth redaction .
Yet Another Damned Update !
A bit more context for those who need it : I 've been debating at Protein Wisdom for two years and received a ridiculously viscous and incompetent reaction .
Today I put up an article detailing some examples of this nonsense and discussing the implications ; even before the article went up , Goldstein and others were denouncing it as a " hit piece , " calling into question my journalistic ethics , and otherwise being wacky .
Goldstein also announced that he was so upset that he'd be taking down his blog , but then apparently decided that he was n't coming off as non-chalant as he'd like and edited the comment to that end .
I 'd already linked to the comment and responded to it , so when I discovered it'd been altered , I put up a screen cap of the original , more silly version .
I took the pic in the first place because I 've seen him get into internet squabbles a number of times and have noticed that he has a tendency to change his own words after the fact when those words turn out to be inconvenient .
It was a hell of a weekend , really .

BBC European affairs correspondent , Sopron
" It was in Hungary that the first stone was removed from the Berlin Wall , " said the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
His successor Angela Merkel went to the Hungarian town of Sopron on Wednesday , to thank the country for opening its border 20 years ago .
That decision led to the fall of the Wall three months later .
The most important thing in those days was how I judged the position of Gorbachev in power
Miklos Nemeth Former Hungarian Prime Minister
But curiously enough , it was a picnic in a field outside Sopron that would change the face of Europe .
In the summer of 1989 , thousands of East German " tourists " had been making their way to Hungary , looking for a way to cross into Austria .
What drew them was a bold decision taken earlier that year by the reformist prime minister Miklos Nemeth to start dismantling the security system along the border .
" I thought it was obsolete in the 20th Century , " Mr Nemeth told the BBC .
Another reason was that Hungary , heavily in debt , simply could not afford to pay $ 1 m to maintain it .
As he returned from holiday in his official car , Mr Nemeth was shocked to see hundreds of young people and families camping outside the West German consulate in Budapest .
Others had found refuge in the imposing Holy Family Church in a leafy district of the Hungarian capital .
Among them was Robert Breitner , who was 19 .
He arrived with just the clothes on his back , after losing his backpack in a failed escape attempt .
" The street was full of East German cars , " he recalls .
Robert Breitner in the church garden where he camped 20 years ago " There were families who came with two or three cars and did a lot of escapes .
They lost one car so they took the next one ! "
Mr Breitner 's story was fairly typical .
Because of his family 's Christian beliefs , he was not allowed to do his high - school degree in the GDR .
He could not travel to the Soviet Union , let alone to West Germany , where most of his family lived .
From the age of 14 , he had decided to flee .
" I grew up just 300 metres behind the Berlin Wall but for me it was too dangerous to try it there , " he said .
He thought in Hungary " the chance to die was not as high " .
East German agents
The man who opened the gate to the church was Father Imre Kozma , who led the Order of Malta charity service .
The charity erected tents and distributed food - all under the watchful eye of the Stasi , the East German secret service , whose agents were posted just across the street .
They were afraid we would ... hand them over to the East German authorities
Father Kozma about the refugees Father Kozma said the refugees feared each other and even the Hungarian volunteers .
" They were afraid we would gather them in one place and hand them over to the East German authorities . "
Then in August , the place was awash with rumours and leaflets about the Pan- European Picnic .
Opposition groups had decided to organise the event as a celebration of good - neighbourly relations , with beer and gammon roasted over a bonfire right on the border with Austria .
But the refugees wanted more than a picnic .
Today , you can simply drive or walk into Austria with no questions asked .
The Iron Curtain has become a bike trail .
But in August 1989 , much of the barbed wire fence was still there .
Just before 3 o'clock that afternoon , Lt - Col Arpad Bella , who was in charge of the Hungarian border post , saw a crowd of men , women , even children rushing towards him .
Before his eyes , the first wave of East German refugees pushed through a barbed wire - topped wooden gate into the West .
Some cried , laughed , embraced each other .
Others kept running because they could not believe they were in Austria .
Guards ' dilemma
Without clear instructions from his superiors , Lt - Col Bella decided not to shoot .
" It was terrible for me ! " he said .
" Those two hundred people were just ten metres away from freedom .
So I took the decision that I thought was best for Hungary and for my own conscience . "
On the other side of the border , Austrian chief inspector Johann Goeltl faced another dilemma .
In their headlong rush to freedom , an East German family had left their eight - year - old son on the other side of the gate , which had now been closed .
" Please , please , let him through , " they pleaded , " otherwise we 'll have to go back to that terrible regime " .
Somehow , chief inspector Goeltl managed to sneak the boy in .
By the end of that day , more than 600 East Germans had crossed over to the West .
Three weeks later , when Hungary fully opened its borders , 60,000 flooded out .
Among the first to leave was Robert Breitner , who arrived in Berlin in time to see the Wall collapse .
But 20 years on , Lt - Col Bella feels he was only an actor in a complex play whose director remains unknown .
Some of those who organised the Pan - European Picnic , like engineer Laszlo Nagy , also feel politicians used it to test how far they could go .
" If you are taking part in a test of which you are not informed , you feel yourself as a worm that they use in fishing , " Mr Nagy said .
" They threw us in deep water and they were watching whether the sharks are coming or not . "
The shark of course was the Soviet Union , which still had 100,000 troops in Hungary .
Under Mikhail Gorbachev , its appetite seemed to be for reforms rather than military intervention .
Laszlo Nagy was one of the organisers of the Pan- European Picnic
In March 1989 , Miklos Nemeth told the Soviet leader he planned to dismantle the barbed wire along the border .
Mr Gorbachev reacted calmly and said border security was Mr Nemeth 's problem , not his .
The Hungarian prime minister took it as a green light .
But could things have gone differently ?
" Absolutely , we had worked out a lot of scenarios , " Mr Nemeth told me .
" For me , the most important thing in those days was how I judged the position of Gorbachev in power .
If he 's being toppled , kicked out of power , that would have been a different story , I can tell you . "
Like Mr Gorbachev , Mr Nemeth has retired from politics .
He is disappointed that crisis - ridden Hungary is no longer a leader in Central Europe .
Lt - Col Bella and chief inspector Goeltl are friends and often meet to talk about the past .
Robert Breitner went on to study politics and now works in St Petersburg , happy that East and West can do business together .
For Father Kozma , little has changed .
Except that now he drives one of the Trabants left behind by the refugees he helped 20 years ago .
Were you in Hungary when it opened its borders to the non-communist West ?

An 11 - year - old girl who jumped out of a car moments before it rolled down a sheer cliff face and crashed on rocks below says she is lucky to be alive .
Paige Dean escaped from the car which was rolling out of control down a 250 ft ( 76 m ) hill just seconds before it went over the edge at Benllech , Anglesey .
The schoolgirl had been sitting in the car listening to music when she accidentally knocked off the handbrake .
Paige , from Kinmel Bay , Denbighshire , said : " I have never been so scared . "
Paige , who was later treated for shock , was on holiday with her grandparents at the Golden Sunset caravan park .
I thought ' I 've got to get out ' and I jumped out and saw the car fall off the cliff
Paige Dean
She was listening to music in the car when she accidentally knocked off the brake and despite frantic attempts , she could not pull it back up .
The car started rolling towards the edge of the cliff , gaining momentum .
It ran over two unoccupied tents as it neared the edge .
With moments to spare , Paige managed to open the car door and fling herself to safety .
" I dropped my phone down the side of the car and when I reached over to get it I accidentally knocked the brake off , " she explained .
" I was rolling towards the edge of the cliff and I was petrified .
" I thought ' I 've got to get out ' and I jumped out and saw the car fall off the cliff .
" I definitely would have died .
I have never been so scared . "
Her grandmother Marie Dean , who looks after Paige and her brother Cameron , seven , saw the incident .
" I could not believe what was happening .
I ran after the car and I saw her jump out .
But my husband Billy did n't realise and shouted ' she 's gone ' , " she said .
Marie Dean spoke of her relief after Paige 's lucky escape " My whole body went numb and I ran over to Paige and held her as she cried .
" God was looking down on us , " she said .
Dave Massey , a paramedic and RNLI volunteer in Moelfre , was one of the first on the scene on Saturday at 1615 BST .
" It is a miracle she survived and that she had the presence of mind to jump out at the last second .
" There is no doubt that she would never have survived that fall , " he said .
The vehicle plummeted down the sheer drop and crashed into rocks before being submerged in water .
Paige was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital in Bangor by ambulance and had treatment for shock .
Mrs Dean said she was now on the lookout for a new car , and the police were recovering hers from the sea on Sunday .

A group of extremist Israeli youths , members of the outlawed Kach Movement , tried to prevent Palestinian nonviolent resistance leader , Abdullah Abu Rahma , from speaking at a forum in Paris , by creating chaos , acting in a violent way and trying to physically attack him .
Abu Rahma , coordinator of the Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements in Bil ’in village near Ramallah , was the guest speaker at the forum .
Fundamentalists interrupted his talk by breaking chairs while raising Israeli flags and by shouting and cursing at him while trying to physically attack him .
The extremists managed to disrupt the talk for approximately 30 minutes .
Organizers of the Forum denounced the attack , especially since it is meant to suppress freedom of speech .
During his talk , Abu Rahma spoke of the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian people , living under Israeli occupation , losing their lands for Israeli settlements and the Annexation Wall , and subject to constant attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers .
He called for isolating Israel and imposing sanctions on it until it recognizes the legitimate Palestinian tights of liberation and independence .
Abu Rahma is conducting a tour in Europe to talk about Palestinian nonviolent resistance against the Wall and settlements , and the suffering of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons .
He started his three - week tour two days ago in France , and will also be touring in the Czech Republic , Britain and Germany .
On March 14 , Abu Rahma was released from an Israeli detention facility after being imprisoned for 15 months .
He was kidnapped by the army in December 2009 .
Nine months later , an Israeli court “ convicted ” him of “ incitement ” and organizing and participating in the nonviolent protests in his village , Bil’in .
He was acquitted of stone - throwing and weapons possession charges .
The army tried to accuse him of having weapons for exhibiting spent tear - gas canisters and rubber - coated metal bullets fired by the army at the local , Israeli and international peace activists conducting nonviolent protests in Bil ’in .
Abu Rahma is a well - known Palestinian figure of the ongoing nonviolent resistance against the illegal Israeli Annexation Wall and illegal settlements built on Palestinian lands in the occupied territories .
Several Palestinians were killed while dozens of Palestinian , Israeli and International peace activists were wounded after being violently attacked Israeli soldiers who also fired live rounds at them .

New vs. Broken In
Inspecting your Kart
Finding Your Kart
What We Got
Seat Install
If you have the money , there 's nothing like a sweet , freshly painted beauty that 's been buffed , shined , and carefully assembled by the skilled hands at your local kart shop .
It only came out of its box thanks to a check you signed , the first time it hits the track will be with your rump in the seat , and the first time it gets spun into the kitty litter it 'll be due to your lack of grip / road / talent .
Unfortunately , not everybody has the bank account for that , having to do a little extra work themselves to get onto the track .
That 's us .
If you 've been following along in our An Introduction to Karting series then you learned a bit about the sport , came along with us to driving school , and most recently got a strong a dose of budgetary reality .
Now it 's time to find a kart .
Read on to find out where to look , what to look for , and how to get it ready to race .
The quickest way to get rolling is , of course , to buy a new kart and a new engine to go with it .
Your local shop might need a few days to get it all put together , but you can save hours of searching classifieds and all the other frustrating tasks that come along with buying something in a direct sale .
A new kart is not cheap , however , and if you think depreciation on a car is steep , wait until you see how much value your shiny new racing vehicle loses the first time it crosses a timing beam .
But , if you want to get the absolute best support from your local shop , this is the way to go .
A close second in terms of ease , quickness and support is to buy a used chassis and motor combination from your local shop at a price significantly cheaper than buying new .
You 'll be getting a package that someone at the shop will have at least given a cursory once - over , and that someone should be there to help you should you have any immediate problems .
Buy something privately and if your motor grenades after three minutes , you 're on your own .
Despite that , buying a used kart through a private transaction still has plenty of benefits .
Cost is of course the primary one , but even more important is the spares package that comes with most used karts .
Buy new and you 'll get the kart , engine and a library of manuals .
Buy it used from a shop and you might get a spare set of wheels thrown in .
Buy it used directly from its ( soon to be ) former owner and you 're likely to get dozens of wheels and tires , a collection of sprockets for various gearing options , telemetry bags of spare bits and bobs , and maybe even a stand .
Find yourself a disenchanted racer who 's completely getting out of the sport and you might get a trailer to haul the thing plus a full set of safety gear ( though we would never recommend using a used helmet ) .
Which is the right way to go ?
If you love bargain hunting then start trawling online ads , paying particular attention to the " Classifieds " forum at eKartingNews and other specialty sites like KartFinder.com .
If you have somewhat fewer limits on your budget and would rather pull your teeth out than deal with flaky sellers , call your local shop and see what lightly used models they have on offer .
And , of course , if you have more cash than time for comparo - shopping , go new .
Our economy will thank you .
If you are buying used , check the chassis .
There will surely be some light scrapes here and there , but excessive rust is a bad sign ; walk away if the frame is dented , crumpled or warped .
Check that the hardware is in good shape and that the fasteners do n't look like a schmorgasboard of random nuts and bolts of all different types and sizes ; that could mean things have n't been put together or maintained correctly .
That said , do n't be put - off by loose fasteners : racers will often leave things like the rear bumper attachment or the bolts holding the floorpan half - tightened to encourage chassis flex .
When it comes to the engine you 'll want to see the logbook , especially for a series like Rotax where a properly maintained and certified lump is a requirement for entry .
You 'll want to know how many hours it has seen overall and how many hours since the last rebuild .
Ask what components are new and what are old , and for the old ones how old are they – clutches and the like do n't last forever and can be expensive to replace .
If the engine is nearly due for a rebuild ( about 50 hours for a Rotax , many others are comparable , some much lower ) call a shop , get a rebuild quote , and make sure that 's factored into the deal .
Buying a motor that 's ready for a rebuild is not a bad idea at all so long as you are n't paying the same a fresh one .
If the engine was recently rebuilt ask how it was broken in .
Ideally you 'll find a package with a chassis that has a solid engine already installed ; that makes the shopping process much easier , saves you from having to deal with two sellers and will mean not having to get the thing installed yourself .
You might even be able to show up at a track for a test drive !
The next question is , of course , what kind to buy .
In the last installment we decided to go for the Rotax Max Challenge series , which made the engine choice easy but left the door open for a number of chassis options .
Whether going new or used you 'll want to find out what 's supported locally .
" When in Rome , run what the Romans run " is the word from Tim Hannen , owner of Oakland Valley Race Park – and that 's not just because most of these chassis are made in Italy .
At some point you 're going to break something .
Whether it 's just an air intake that falls off and gets run over or a hub that shatters after seeing the wrong end of a rumble - strip , you do n't want a potentially easy repair to end your weekend .
Sure , anything can be found on the internet , but your local shop is there to keep you racing so make sure they stock parts that will work on your kart .
Also , if you want to be quick you 're going to need setup help .
If there are a few other people running what you 're running , surely one of them will give you a few pointers – until you start beating them , anyway .
Sadly we lacked the financial leeway to go with a new kart and motor package , and while the barely - used packages at the shop looked tempting ( freshly shipped back from Italy where they were used in the Rotax World Finals ) they too were somewhat out of our budget .
So , we hit the classifieds and came up ... mostly empty .
While there were plenty of good deals to be had , few were local , and though we found sellers willing to ship engine or chassis or both we were n't too keen on buying sight - unseen .
However , we ultimately convinced a friend and kart racer , Paul Norman ( the guy who got us seriously thinking about the sport in the first place ) , to part with his former chassis , a six - or seven - year - old Fullerton model that most recently saw action with a Rotax lump .
That engine is now seeing out the end of its days as Paul 's spare , but the chassis came complete with two sets of wheels , plenty of tires in various states of grip , a stand , two ( nearly complete ) sets of bodywork , an Alfano Pro telemetry system , and enough bits , bolts and spares to fill a half - dozen Ziploc freezer bags .
The Fullerton brand actually went out of business a number of years ago , which made us a bit leery , but they were made by Top Kart , a more widely known Italian manufacturer whose parts by and large will fit on the Fullerton .
Also , our local track was once Fullerton 's American distributor and still has a number of parts for them in stock , not to mention plenty of tuning knowledge .
Finally , the price was right .
That still left us without a motor , though , and try as we might we could n't find a Rotax local .
The ones we located were multiple hundreds of miles ( or more ) away and generally priced in the $ 2,500 + range .
When we got a quote of a new Rotax package at the shop for $ 3,300 we took a deep breath and pulled the trigger , knowing that we were paying a good bit more than budgeted , but also feeling good knowing that the engine would be installed by trained hands ( i.e. not our own ) , and that we'd have the support of the shop in getting things up and running .
We would need it .
Our kart , despite being used , came without a seat .
Most karts will have one but rarely will it be the right size for you .
A properly fitting seat is absolutely vital both when it comes to achieving optimum kart handling and ensuring your comfort .
Too small and you simply wo n't fit ; too large and you 'll be flopping around too much to focus on important things like not crashing .
Finding that perfect size is difficult , so sit in as many as you can before buying .
Ordering a seat blind is a risky proposition .
Wie Aserbaidschan die Vorratsdatenspeicherung nutzt Peter Muehlbauer
Personen , die beim Schlager - Grand - Prix für das benachbarte Armenien gestimmt hatten , erhielten Besuch von der Polizei
Mit Telefon - und Internetverbindungsdaten , wie sie seit der Umsetzung einer EU - Richtlinie auch in Deutschland gespeichert werden , lässt sich viel anfangen .
Das führt nun die im südlichen Kaukasus gelegene ehemalige Sowjetrepublik Aserbaidschan vor Augen , in der Personen , die beim Schlager - Grand - Prix für das benachbarte Armenien stimmten , Besuch von der Polizei erhielten .
Einer der insgesamt 43 Anrufer aus Aserbaidschan , die sich für das vom Duo Inga & Anush gesungene Stück " Jan Jan " ausgesprochen hatten , sagte der BBC , dass man ihn aufgrund seines " unpatriotischen " Verhaltens als potentielles Sicherheitsrisiko ansehe .
Die Behörden des Ölstaates leugneten die Polizeibesuche nicht , meinten aber , dass man lediglich nach Erklärungen für das Stimmverhalten gesucht habe .
Hintergrund ist ein bewaffneter Konflikt um die Region Bergkarabach , der bereits seit Ende der 1980er Jahre andauert und zur massenhaften Vertreibung von Armeniern aus Baku sowie von Aserbaidschanern aus einem Korridor zwischen Armenien und Bergkarabach führte .
Zur Feindschaft zwischen den beiden Staaten trägt zudem bei , dass sich Aserbaidschaner vielfach als schiitische Türken verstehen und auch von Armeniern häufig als Angehörige jenes Volkes betrachtet werden , das die armenischen Siedlungsgebiete während des Ersten Weltkrieges durch gezielte ethnische Säuberungen und Massenmorde erheblich verkleinerte .

It ’s hard to believe there was once a time when Patton Oswalt might only have been remembered for his role on “ The King of Queens . ”
In the past few years , Oswalt has become renowned for his hilarious stand - up , gotten raves for his performance as Remy in Disney / Pixar ’s “ Ratatouille , ” and turned in some excellent work in appearances on “ Reaper ” and “ Dollhouse . ”
Soon , he ’ll be appearing on episodes of the “ Battlestar Galactica ” prequel , “ Caprica , ” but at the moment , he ’s making the rounds to promote his role in Robert Siegel ’s directorial debut , “ Big Fan . ” Bullz - Eye had the opportunity to talk with Oswalt about the film…and , by coincidence , the conversation took place on the release date of his latest album , My Weakness is Strong , so we talked a bit about the evolution of his stand - up , too .
Bullz - Eye : Hey , Patton , how ’s it going , man ?
Patton Oswalt : ( In a high - pitched voice ) What ’s up ?
BE : ( Laughs )
Not much .
I should start by telling you that I ’m sitting about 10 minutes away from Portsmouth , Virginia .
PO : No shit !
Wait a minute , are you in Newport News or something ?
BE : I ’m in Chesapeake .
PO : Okay , yeah .
Wow !
Well , you know , I was born in Portsmouth , but I only lived there for , like , a week .
BE : Yeah , I knew you did n’t really have any ties to here , per se .
PO : Yeah , yeah .
But I went to college in Williamsburg , so I know that area .
BE : As a matter of fact , my friend Elizabeth
Yow says that she ’s pretty sure that you still owe her a dollar from a one - off date that you two went on .
PO : You know what ?
I would not doubt that for a second .
Oh , my God , I was so broke back then .
Well , please tell her that she has infinite patience and charm .
BE : I certainly will .
So help me a little bit with the timeline on “ Big Fan . ”
When you were approached about doing the film , had “ The Wrestler ” already been released ?
Were you already familiar with Robert Siegel ?
" A lot of my instincts as an actor , I had to kind of sit on ( during ' Big Fan ' ) .
Like , my instinct was , ' I need to end this scene with a funny look or a button of some sort , ' and I could n’t do that .
So that was certainly odd for me to not have that resource in this role , but ... it was kind of cool to be in that situation for once in my career , where I ’m just totally outside of my comfort zone .
I mean , unbelievably outside of my comfort zone .
It was kind of thrilling . "
PO : I knew of him .
I knew his work from “ The Onion ” and stuff like that , and I loved all that stuff , and I knew that he ’d written “ The Wrestler , ” but I did n’t know him personally until we had breakfast and he gave me the script for “ Big Fan . ”
BE : So what were your thoughts when you first read it ?
I mean , are you a sports fan yourself ?
PO : No. ( Laughs ) I do not follow sports , man .
I ’ve never followed them .
BE : Well , y’know , while on the surface , given some of your …well , let ’s call them your geekier pursuits .
PO : ( Laughs ) Sure .
BE : … you would n’t seem to be the first choice to play a sports fan , but I guess fandom is fandom , ultimately .
PO : Yeah , I mean , I thought that , as far as the researching the fuel that drives these guys , I see it every day .
For one , I see it when I look at “ The Wrestler , ” but also just in my friends .
We are very , very passionate about esoteric things .
If that makes any sense .
BE : It does .
And , y’know , some people might say that Paul ’s actions in the film are over the top , but when I pitched my friend the hypothetical scenario of whether he ’d sue the player for kicking his ass or suck it up for the good of the team , he said he ’d probably convince himself it was his own fault for having it happen .
PO : Wow .
Yeah , man , I mean , it ’s almost like one of those religious parables .
“ When you show your god how much you love him , how far would you go to show that ? ”
Especially if the god answers and it ’s not the answer you want .
BE : Kevin Corrigan may well be the best “ best friend ” actor in Hollywood .
PO : Yeah , he ’s fantastic .
BE : Had you worked with him before ?
PO : No , but I ’ve known his stuff since he was in “ Goodfellas . ”
I ’d just never gotten a chance to work him until now .
But it was great that I got to do that .
BE : How was it playing a predominantly dramatic character ?
Because it ’s fair to say that you ’re not renown for drama .
PO : No. ( Laughs )
No , I ’m not .
And it was odd .
A lot of my instincts as an actor , I had to kind of sit on and not …like , my instinct was , “ I need to end this scene with a funny look or a button of some sort , ” and I could n’t do that .
So that was certainly odd for me , I guess , to not have that resource in this role .
But it ended up being really kind of weirdly exciting , because everything I was comfortable with as an actor , I could n’t use , and it was kind of cool to be in that situation for once in my career , where I ’m just totally outside of my comfort zone .
I mean , unbelievably outside of my comfort zone .
And it was kind of thrilling , y’know ?
BE : Given that Paul ’s kind of every geek ’s nightmare of how his life could potentially turn out …
PO : ( Laughs )
BE : …was it kind of cathartic to be able to play out that circle of Hell in a movie ?
PO : Yeah , because I ’ve seen and had one foot in that obsessive world about certain things , so to get to just …well , like you said , to play it out as a written , dramatic thing was sort of comforting .
BE : If I had one complaint , it was that I almost felt like they should n’t have listed Michael Rappaport ’s name in the credits .
It would ’ve been a nice surprise .
PO : Oh , yeah , and he was great .
BE : I guess your appreciation of the film depends heavily on whether you know someone who has this kind of fandom for anything .
What would you say is the closest thing that you ’d compare it to in your own life , that you love that much ?
PO : Film .
I ’m a movie buff .
Movies are definitely kind of an abiding passion of mine , so I can definitely understand it .
And like I said , I ’ve seen this kind of obsession up close in other people .
When I go to , like , revival theaters , you ’ll see them with their lunches and …it ’s pretty amazing .
But it ’s pretty intense .
On his " Dollhouse " character : “ I think that he was a really damaged guy .
And I think he was really , really sad .
And that ’s where some of his horrible behavior came from .
He just could n’t deal with his sadness , he could n’t deal with his loss , and he turned what had happened to him into , ' Well , the world owes me something , ' rather than , ' Let ’s deal with my loss . ' ”
BE : Given that you ’re such a cinephile , have you considered directing at all ?
PO : I would love to someday direct , but I think that ’s way out of my skill level right now .
( Laughs )
But hopefully one day I ’ll be able to pull that off , so we ’ll see .
BE : I wanted to ask you about your character on “ Dollhouse . ”
PO : Oh , yeah !
BE : Do you think he was a good guy or a bad guy ?
Because his motives certainly were n’t as awful as they could ’ve been , given some of the other episodes of the show .
PO : I think that he was a really damaged guy .
And I think he was really , really sad .
And that ’s where some of his horrible behavior came from .
He just could n’t deal with his sadness , he could n’t deal with his loss , and he turned what had happened to him into , “ Well , the world owes me something , ” rather than , “ Let ’s deal with my loss . ”
And that ’s a horrible position for a guy to be in , losing someone who was with you when you were nothing , and now you basically have the world , so how can you ever really trust that somebody loves you or is into you for what you are ?
You ’ll never , ever have that back .
And that ’s a scary thought for a guy .
For anybody .
BE : How did it feel playing a billionaire captain of industry ?
PO : ( Laughs )
Well , you know , I played him like …
Joss and I talked about it , and Joss ’s interpretation was , “ He ’s this ‘ aw , shucks ’ chinos - and - golf - shirt kind of guy who does n’t spend his wealth on appearances . ”
Stuff like that .
Does that make sense ?
BE : Yep .
PO : Oh , good .
BE : How did you come onboard the show in the first place ?
I mean , I would guess that you and Joss travel in similar circles .
PO : Yeah , but I auditioned .
I wish I had a more exotic story , but I just went in , I read for the part , and I got it .
( Laughs )
That ’s exactly how it was .
BE : Now , I ’m sure it ’s complete coincidence that you ’re doing press for “ Big Fan ” on the same week that your new CD / DVD , My Weakness Is Strong , is coming out .
PO : It is , actually , because we did n’t know when the movie was going to come out until the very , very last minute , because it did n’t have a distributor .
And the record company had planned a long time ago when to release the CD .
So it all just kind of came together this way .
I mean , the movie company did n’t know when the album was coming out , so they certainly did n’t plan it that way .
It was all very seat - of - the - pants , and , “ Hopefully we can get all of this out . ”
BE : Well , it ’s certainly nice timing , anyway .
PO : Oh , yeah , I ’m not complaining about that at all !
BE : I ’ve watched the special on Comedy Central , and this afternoon I plan to go pick up the album itself .
PO : Oh , wow , thank you !
BE : Sure .
From what I ’ve seen on the special , it definitely seems as though your stand - up is evolving , which I guess comes from “ growing up , ” as it were .
PO : Yeah , and I think most comedians go through that , where you have to change or evolve .
You do n’t want to just keep doing variations on the same themes .
And , besides , it would look kinda creepy for a guy my age to be doing stuff that , like , a 20 - year - old would do .
( Sneering ) “ Yeah , this is bullshit ! ”
It ’s , like , “ Really ?
You do n’t have bigger concerns at this point in your life ? ” ( Laughs )
BE : Well , you do seem to be straddling the two worlds with this one .
You ’re talking about impending fatherhood , but you ’re also talking about giving up LSD .
PO : Exactly .
It ’s just …y ’ know , life is changing around you , and it can get scary , man .
I do n’t know how else to put it .
It can get really , really weird .
BE : Well , as a father , are you happier than ever now that you can say , “ You know , I was Remy in ‘ Ratatouille ’ ” ?
PO : Yeah , exactly .
I mean …man , I wonder how that ’s gonna go .
That ’s gonna be really weird , is n’t it ?
BE : Hey , I plan to tell my daughter that I talked to Remy today , so she ’s gonna be psyched .
PO : ( Laughs )
Oh , man , that ’s so sweet .
Well , I hope she likes that !
I hope she ’s excited .
BE : Trust me , she will be .
So you ’re going to be in an episode of “ Bored to Death , ” I see .
PO : Yup !
BE : I checked out the panel for the series during the recent TCA tour , and I ’m so psyched for the show now .
PO : Oh , yeah , it ’s gonna be really , really funny .
I love Jonathan Ames , and everyone on the show is great .
I mean , I could n’t be more excited for it .
And for them .
BE : So given the premise of the show ( a private detective who tends to have a new client every week ) , I ’m presuming this will be a one - off role for you ?
PO : Well , it might not be a one - off , because my character is a guy who owns a shop that sells spy equipment , so for all I know , maybe they ’ll bring me back if they have to buy more shit .
( Laughs ) I would n’t complain if that happened !
BE : And you ’ve also signed on for “ Caprica . ”
PO : Yes , sir !
BE : As a sci - fi aficionado , I would presume you ’re pretty psyched about that .
PO : Oh , yeah .
Are you kidding ?
It ’s a huge deal .
My God , it ’s a big deal .
BE : So was this another case where you went in to audition ?
" I think most comedians go through that , where you have to change or evolve .
You do n’t want to just keep doing variations on the same themes .
And , besides , it would look kinda creepy for a guy my age to be doing stuff that , like , a 20 - year - old would do .
' Yeah , this is bullshit ! '
It ’s , like , ' Really ?
You do n’t have bigger concerns at this point in your life ? ' "
PO : No , they called and offered it to me !
And what was I going to say ?
“ No ” ?
I was so happy !
( Laughs )
No frakking way would I not do this .
Huh ?
Huh …?
Did you see what I did there ?
BE : Genius .
I ’m sure you ca n’t say much about what goes on , but can you give us a thumbnail sketch of your character ?
PO : He ’s a talk - show host on Caprica .
He ’s almost like the Jon Stewart of Caprica , so the characters will come on his show and make appeals for things .
Again , it ’s really , really well - written stuff .
It ’s Ronald Moore and David Eike and Jane Espenson , in all their usual terrificness .
BE : Awesome .
So what ’s your favorite project that you ’ve worked on that did n’t get the love you thought it deserved ?
PO : This little animated pilot I did for a comic book called “ The Amazing Screw - On Head , ” which is an amazing Mike Mignola one - shot comic that I just thought was …it was so well - done , and the artwork was great , and it was a really odd premise .
I just wish that it had done better than it did , because it really deserved more attention , and it deserved to have a life and develop .
They only shot the pilot , and it did n’t go anywhere .
It was very , very frustrating .
BE : If it makes you feel any better , the DVD is on my shelf as we speak .
PO : Man , I just thought that was so good , and I wish it had done better .
It deserved to do better .
Listen to me whining .
I should be ashamed of myself .
“ It deserved to do better ! ” ( Laughs )
BE : Tell me about your role in “ The Informant ! ”
PO : I am one of a gallery of incredulous and frustrated agents dealing with Matt Damon slowly going crazy .
That is my role .
BE : Is it a substantial part ?
PO : I have a few scenes .
It ’s not that substantial .
It was just great to work with Soderbergh , but it was such a fun script to read , so to get offered that part , it was , like , “ Yeah !
Fuck , yeah , I ’ll do this ! ”
BE : Since you ’re such a film buff , can you throw out a few of your favorite unheralded films by other people that you ’d like to recommend ?
PO : Recently there was a movie by Mario Van Peebles called “ Baadasssss ! ” that I thought should ’ve gotten just a crazy huge release .
But it did not , and that was very , very frustrating to me , because I think it ’s just such an amazing movie .
And then there ’s an early ‘ 70s movie with Dustin Hoffman called “ Straight Time ” that ’s one of the best crime films ever made , and it just got nothing .
The studio just kind of sat on it and did n’t do anything with it .
It ’s so frustrating to watch this great movie that should be up there with stuff like “ Chinatown ” and “ Five Easy Pieces , ” but it just got no release .
I mean , it ’s critically acclaimed , but it just did n’t get the attention it deserved .
At all .
BE : As far as some of the one - off appearances you ’ve done on TV shows , do you have any favorites ?
Personally , I ’m partial to your role as Leon on “ Reaper . ”
PO : Yeah , that was really fun , but so far , the one I ’m the most proud of is “ Dollhouse . ”
I really , really liked that one .
I liked how it was written , and I liked what I was able to do , and getting to work with Joss … ?
I ’m a huge fan of his .
So I think that , so far , that ’s probably my favorite .
BE : When you go on a show where it ’s a one - off , do you have the luxury of doing any sort of ad - libbing , or do they force you to stick to the script ?
PO : Well , on that one , I was anxious to just do the scene as written , because then I would look like a genius .
( Laughs )
You know , without putting my big fingerprints all over it .
BE : How about on “ United States of Tara ” ?
PO : No , you know , there ’s a lot of improv on that show .
I mean , they ’re cool about that , so that was really , really fun .
BE : All right , man , well , like I said , I love the movie .
Given the tone , I know it ’s probably not going to be a huge hit , but I hope it ’s at least a huge cult hit .
PO : Me , too .
I mean , I hope it just gets really good critical acclaim , because Robert deserves it .
BE : And if you ever decide to come back to William & Mary , let me know , because I am in the area .
PO : ( Laughs ) I will , man !
Absolutely !
BE : Oh , but before I go …and not to keep a bit going longer than it needs to go , but …have you heard about the new KFC sandwich , the Double Down ?
PO : Oh , God , yeah .
So many people have E - mailed me to tell me about it , but …I have spoken on KFC .
I have spoken , and I have moved on !
( Laughs )
BE : I thought surely the fact that it ’s two pieces of chicken instead of a bun would be enough to bring you back to your pulpit on the matter .
: No ! ( Laughs ) I ’m done with them !
Another gem from Flip Flop Fly Ball .
I ’ve provided photographic proof for your amusement below :
Adolf Hitler and the " Arab Reich "
The genesis of the cooperation between militant Islam and the extreme right can be traced back to the early years of the Third Reich .
During World War II , when much of the Islamic world sympathized with Hitler , members of the Muslim Brotherhood would often say prayers for an Axis victory during their meetings .
Moreover , some Muslims went so far as to fantasize over putative Islamic affinities of fascist leaders .
For example , rumors abounded that Benito Mussolini was an Egyptian Muslim whose real name was Musa Nili ( Moses of the Nile ) and that Adolf Hitler too had secretly converted to Islam and bore the name Hayder , or " the brave one . " ( ee Amir Taheri , Holy Terror : Inside the World of Islamic Terrorism , published in 1987 )
During the 1930s , the Third Reich had received entreaties from the Arab world .
After the Nazi government promulgated the Nuremberg Laws in 1936 , which greatly diminished the legal citizenship status of Jews , telegrams of support were sent to Hitler from all over the Arab and Islamic world .
And Nazi Germany's war against the British Empire next , electrified the Islamic world even more , whose people viewed it as a noble struggle against imperialism .
Furthermore , Germany and the Arab world shared the same enemies ( England , Zionism , and communism ) .
As well as Nazi influence in Iran , the Nazi regime also made overtures to Afghanistan during the 1930s and attempted to establish a political alliance with Mullah Mirza Ali Khan , who , along with his Waziri Mujahideen , resisted British rule of the Northwestern Province of Afghanistan from 1936 to 1947 .
In 1941 German envoys were sent to Gurwekht , which was a stronghold of Patani Islamic guerrilla action inside the British zone of occupied Sarhad .
They brought with them money and a letter of support from Adolf Hitler .
However the Afghan monarch was well aware of what happened to pro-German Iran , which was invaded by British forces .
Seeking to avert a similar fate , he finally expelled German and Italian diplomats from his country .
( Ataullah Bogdan Kopanski , " Muslims and the Reich , " Barnes Review , September - October 2003 ) .
The early victories of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps raised the hopes of Arabs seeking to establish independence .
Some Arabs from North Mrica volunteered to aid the German war effort , as evidenced by the creation of various Arab auxiliary units , including Freikorps Arabien ( Arab Free Corps ) , the Kommando Deutsch - Arabischer Truppen ( German - Arab Commando Troops ) , and the Deutsch - Arabisches Infanterie Battalion 845 ( German - Arab Infantry Battalion 845 ) .
After the war , remnants of these units would go on to join the anti colonial struggle in Algeria .
Islamic - fascist alliance was also exemplified by the cordial relationship between Hitler and the grand mufti of Jerusalem , Haj Amin al - Husseini .
By the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , al - Husseini joined the Ottoman Turkish Army , serving as an artillery officer until November 1916 .
As such , he would serve as a bridge carrying over imperialist ideas of Islam and Ottoman Turkey into modern times -- not unlike Hitler who feigned to be German in order to join Kaiser Wilhelm II ’s battle , the German Kaiser who stood next to Ottoman Emperor Abdul Hamid inside the Great Mosque , solemnly declaring himself ' protector of all Muslims . '
In April 1920 then , al - Husseini gained notoriety in Jerusalem when his followers went on a rampage at the festival of Nebi Musa , during which 5 Jews were killed and 211 Jews injured .
He is credited with having introduced the first modern " one who is ready to sacrifice his life for his cause " suicide squads , which primarily targeted moderate Arabs who refused to support his agenda .
Despite this record of incitement , the British appointed him Grand Mufti in 1922 .
On August 23 , 1929 , he led a second massacre of Jews in Hebron , followed by a third massacre in 1936 .
( Kenneth R. Timmerman , Preachers of Hate , 2003 ) Adolf Eichmann initially supported Jewish immigration into Palestine .
After his trip to Jerusalem in 1937 , however , he recommended that Jewish immigration be forbidden .
He was apparently taken by the display of Nazi flags and portraits of Hitler that he saw during his stay there .
( Morse , The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism )
When Hitler ’s Wehrmacht invaded Poland in 1939 , France and England declared war on Germany , al­ - Husseini decided to seek refuge in Iraq , where he found an ally in Rashid Ali al­ - Gilani , who became prime minister of that country in March 1940 .
In October 1939 al­ - Husseini already had gone to Baghdad and met with the Committee of Free Arabs , which was led by the so - called colonels of the Golden Square , to discuss plans for a revolution against the British .
The Free Arabs demanded an immediate cessation of Jewish immigration to Palestine and a crackdown on violence perpetrated by Zionist organizations such as Betar , led by Vladimir Jabotinski .
( Preachers of Hate , 2003 ) In October 1940 , representatives of the Free Arabs signed an Axis - Arab Manifesto of Liberation in Berlin .
Both Hitler and Mussolini expressed strong support for an independent , united Arab nation .
Thus while in Iraq , al­ - Husseini helped organize the new government led by Rashid Ali al - Gilani and the current minister of justice , Nadif Shaukat .
Al - Gilani appointed Nur Said as his new foreign minister , a choice that would later doom his short - lived regime , when the latter conspired with the British embassy .
Previously , in June , Said had helped to negotiate the German - Arab Peace and Cooperation Treaty in Ankara , Turkey .
On January 31 , 1941 , British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the removal of al - ­Gilani , and a power struggle ensued over the control of the new Iraqi government .
Nur Said and Abdullah bin Ali briefly seized power with British support .
However , a coup d' etat on April 1 , 1941 , restored al - Gilani to the position of prime minister .
Abdullah and Nur Said escaped to Amman , Jordan .
Soon thereafter , Germany recognized the new Iraqi government led by al - Gilani .
On May 12 , 1941 , al - Gilani declared independence from Great Britain .
In doing so , he sparked a greater anti colonial uprising of nationalist Muslims in Palestine , Syria , and Egypt .
One of the coup planners was an Iraqi officer named Khairallah Tulfah , the future father - in - law of Saddam Hussein .
( Timmerman , Preachers of Hate ) Al - Gilani 's second regime was also short - lived , however , as British forces quickly deposed it , but not before troops and policeman loyal to al - Gilani car­ried out a pogrom in which roughly 200 Jews were killed .
By May 29 , the Brit­ish Army had seized Baghdad and reinstalled Nur Said as the Iraqi leader .
To show his gratitude , Nur declared war against Germany in January 1943 .
Seeking to find a more hospitable location , the mufti thus sought refuge in Iran .
The nationalist general Shah Reza Pahlavi , who seized power in 1925 , was an admirer of Adolf Hitler 's racial policies and even went so far as to rename his county Iran , which translates into Aryan in Persian .
However , with the arrival of British and American troops in October 1941 , the mufti was forced once again to relocate .
Thus in November 1941 , al- Husseini traveled to Berlin , where he met Hitler and offered his full support .
Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop helped prepare the meeting .
In doing so , he forged an alliance between Nazi Germany and the Palestine Arab High Command , which al - Husseini led .
According to the recent “ Wegbereiter der Shoa ” this meeting was the genesis of Nazi - style anti-Semitism as a mass movement in the Arab world .
Hitler recognized al - Husseini as the leader of the Arab world and pledged to install him as the Arab Führer when the time was feasible .
Hitler dedicated a text to Christoph Schröder and Frau Junge , his secretary , which is called the Hitler - Bormann Documents , or the Testament of Adolf Hitler .
In this text , Hitler makes a criticism of his policies .
For his part , Hitler was very proud of his stature among Muslims and , near the war 's end , regretted that he had not done more to take advantage of this al­liance .
According to documented private conversations he had with his staff , Hitler lamented his alliance with Italy , insofar as it alienated some people in the Muslim world .
Italian adventures were looked upon as imperialistic aggression by those countries in North Africa that Mussolini had invaded .
Hitler expressed admiration for the solidarity of the Muslim people and believed that they could have been potentially useful allies against his enemies .
( See L. Craig Fraser , The Hitler - Bormann Documents .
Date and publisher unknown . )
Hitler even went so far as to accept the grand mufti as an " honorary Aryan " ( Norman Cameron and R. H. Steven , trans . , Hitler 's Table Talk , 1941 - 1944 , New York , 2000 ) and to support Hitler 's war efforts , al - Husseini next traveled to Bosnia in 1943 and helped organize the Waffen - SS Handschar Division in Yugoslavia , which was composed of Bosnian Muslim volunteers .
( For more on the Handschar Division , see George Lepre , Himmler 's Bosnian Division : The Waffen - SS Handschar Division , 1943 - 1945 , Schiffer Military History , 1997 .
According to one estimate , approximately 100,000 European Muslims fought for the Third Reich during the course of World War II .
( Morse , The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism , 2003 )
To further recruit­ment , al - Husseini wrote a book titled Islam and the Jews , which was distributed to Bosnian Muslim SS units during the war as motivational literature , and were encour­aged to identify themselves spiritually as Muslim and Arab but racially as German .
( Morse , 2003 , Yossef Bodansky , Islamic Anti-Semitism as a Political Instrument , 1999 ) In appreciation for his services , al - Husseini was elected as the supreme sheikh - ul Islam ( supreme religious leader ) of the Muslim troops of the Axis .
( Kopanski , " Muslims and the Reich ” ) The German occupation government in territory that it had conquered in the Soviet Union , garnered some goodwill from the local Muslim populations by reconstructing mosques that had been destroyed by the Soviets .
Furthermore , German authorities actually restored the institution of the mufti , which had been abolished by the Bolsheviks not long after the Russian Revolution .
According to one estimate , over 500,000 Muslim Turkomans , Tadjiks , and Uzbeks from the Central Asian Soviet republics volunteered to fight on the side of the Third Reich .
More than 180,000 Muslims were recruited to fight from the Caucasus , Crimea , and hil - Ural Tataristan .
Many of these Muslim sol­diers came from Lithuania and Latvia and according to “ Wegbereiter der Shoa ” became known as ‘ Askaris . ’
Reportedly , the Islamic Waffen - SS fought in the Battle of Stalingrad .
In 1945 , the German military founded the Nordkaukasische Waffengruppe ( North Caucus Armed Group ) for Muslim volunteers from Chechnya , Ingushetia , and Ossetia .
They were organized into nineteen independent Islamic combat battalions and twenty - four infantry companies in the Wehrmacht .
Furthermore , Muslim Turks and Tartars formed a Waffen - SS division known as the Osttürkischer Waffenverband ( East Turkish Armed League ) and SS - Waffengruppe " Turkestan " ( SS Armed Turkestan Group ) .
Many Muslim soldiers had been recruited from Soviet labor camps by SS­ Sturmbannführer Andreas Mayer .
Mayer died from a Soviet sniper 's bullet in 1944 while conducting antipartisan operations in Belarus .
In April 1944 , SS - Standartenführer Haruan al - Rashid ( William Hintersatz ) , an Austrian convert to Islam took over .
He led several Muslim units in battle against partisans in the Warsaw uprising in April 1943 .
( Kopanski , " Muslims and the Reich " ) Many Arab nationalists looked to Germany for inspiration during the 1930s and 1940s and saw National Socialism as a viable model for state building .
Hitler 's Mein Kamf found a receptive readership in parts of the Arabic world .
Many aspiring Arab leaders sought to emulate the German Führer and his National Socialist movement .
As far back as 1933 , Arab nationalists in Syria and Iraq embraced National Socialism .
In Egypt , a protofascist organiza­tion , Young Egypt , also known as the Green Shirts , attracted many army officers ,
The grand mufti is believed to have been instrumental in the group 's formation .
The Green Shirts went by different official names during its history , including Misf al­ Farlit in the 1930s , the Islamic National Party in 1940 , and the Socialist Party in 1946 .
Its leader , Mmed Hussein , also wrote a book in the style of Hitler 's Mein Kampf titled Imlini and published a rabidly anti-Semitic journal called al - Ichtirakya .
During a visit to New York in the late 1940s , Mmed Hussein , the leader of the Green Shirt Party , addressed a meeting of the extreme right National Renaissance Party ( NRP ) .
Kurt Mertig , the NRP 's first chairman , hoped to get a post at Cairo University .
( Kevin Coogan , Dreamer of the Day : Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International , 1999 ) .
Members of the Green Shirts , including young lieutenant colonel and future Egyptian president Anwar Sadat , along with Wing Commander Hassan Ibrahim and General Aziz al - Masri , attempted to execute a scheme in World War II in which they would link up with Rommel 's Afrika Korps and supply them with secret information on British strategy and troop movements .
The Nazis with the help of the Palestinians also were to exterminate half a million Jews in what is now Israel plus all Jews in Tunisia and Syria .
And as detailed in the recent “ Wegbereiter der Shoa .
Die Waffen -SS , der Kommandostab Reichsführer -SS und die Judenvernichtung 1939 - 1945 ” )
In 1942 , the Nazis created a special " Einsatzgruppe , " a mobile SS death squad , which was to carry out the mass slaughter similar to the way they operated in eastern Europe .
" Einsatzgruppe Egypt " was standing by in Athens and was ready to disembark for Palestine in the summer of 1942 , attached to the " Afrika Korps . "
Although hopes of a pan-German and pan-Arab alliance would be dashed with the defeat of Rommel , his early military successes gained admiration from the Arab popula­tion and this endured after the war .
Not long after the war , many German military officers and Nazi party officials were granted sanctuary in Middle Eastern countries , most notably Egypt and Syria , where they helped develop the militaries and intelligences agencies of those countries .
Unrepentant former Nazis formed clandestine networks that occasionally included contacts in the Middle East .
In the early postwar years , Egypt hosted many leading Nazi refugees .
For example , Major General Otto Ernst Remer , the officer that squelched the anti-Hitler coup in July 1944 , found refuge in Egypt , where he offered his services to the Nasser regime .
( See Martin Cüppers , Wegbereiter der Shoa , 2006 . )
With the help of Remer and other German military and technical advisers , Egypt developed a support base for Algerian , Moroccan , and Tunisian guerrillas fighting against France , as well as anti-British movements in Aden and the Mau Mau insurgency in Kenya .
Cairo became the nerve center for the Front de liberation nationale ( FLN , or National Liberation Front ) insurgency and the seat of the provisional government for Algerian rebels .
Remer also served as the front man for German arms traffickers who supplied the FLN and other Algerian guerrillas .
Also , Homanned Said , a former SS volunteer who fought in the grand mufti's Handschar Division , assisted the Algerian insurrection as well , commanding FLN guerrilla operations near the Tunisian border .
The Algerian war , however , proved to be a divisive issue among the international extreme right in the early postwar years .
As the investigative journalist , Martin Lee , noted , this conflict split the extreme right in Europe into two camps .
Among the leaders of the Secret Army Organization ( OAS ) were several French fascists , Vichy collaborators , and French Waffen SS volunteers who did not take kindly to the support that many of the German neo -Nazis provided to the FLN .
( See Martin Lee , The Beast Reawakens , 1997 ) In 1953 rumors spread in the Middle East that Hitler might still be alive and living in Brazil .
This prompted AI - Musawaar , an Egyptian weekly journal , to ask public figures what they would say to the Führer if they could write to him at that time .
Future Egyptian president Sadat expressed admiration for Hitler in the Egyptian Weekly : Dear Hitler , I welcome you back with all my heart .
You have been defeated , but in fact one should regard you as the real victor .
There will be no peace in the world until Germany again takes first place .
Your principal mistake was in opening too many fronts , but everything is forgiven , for you are a shining example of belief in one 's fatherland and people .
You are eternal , and we shall not be surprised if we see you again , or a second Hitler , back in Germany .
~ Irving Sedar and Harold J. Greenberg , Behind the Egyptian Sphinx , 1960 Although Sadat would go on to sign a historic peace treaty with his arch­nemesis , Israel , according to some sources , he never really had a change of heart .
According to Anis Mansour , one of Sadat 's closest friends and advisers , the peace treaty did not mean that Sadat had a change of heart toward Israel .
Rather , the treaty was a diplomatic maneuver that allowed Egypt to sit down with Israel and settle its accounts .
( Bodansky , Islamic Anti-Semitism as a Political Instrument ) .
The German model of centralized government and corporatist nationalism remained attractive to many of the early pan-Arab nationalists in Egypt , some of whom sought the creation of an " Arab Reich " that would unite all Arabs into ' one nation .
( Sedar and Greenberg , Behind the Egyptian Sphin ) .
The early pan-Arab leaders searched for methods to mobilize their populations and build independent nations .
They were influenced in large part by European fascists who viewed the state as an organic outgrowth of the nation .
As they saw it , only a strong , authoritarian state could protect the nation .
Hence , the German model of bureaucratic centralization and authori­tarianism looked attractive to many Arabs who sought an alternative way to modernize their countries .
Moreover , the fact that Germany was opposed to the Western powers , such as England and France , made it all the more appealing to Middle Easterners , who deeply resented colonialism .
Perhaps no other Arab country was more deeply influenced by National Socialism than Egypt .
King Farouk , who ruled Egypt during World War II , was initially seen as pro-Nazi , although his country was occupied by Britain .
By the early 1950s , a wave of anti-British and anti-American sentiment had swept Egypt .
Eventually both the U.S. and British governments decided that Farouk had to be replaced .
The CIA , under the influence of John Foster Dulles , selected Egyptian army general Muhammad Naguib to lead a new Egyptian government .
On July 22 , 1952 , with the help of the CIA , Naguib sent the army into the streets of Cairo and Alexandria and established himself as the commander in chief of military forces .
Although Naguib was the titular head of state , unbeknown to the CIA , the real power ultimately rested with Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser , who soon assumed the position of president .
This coup was also significant be­cause it opened the door for numerous Nazis to take prominent positions in the Egyptian government .
Arguably , the most important former Nazi in Nasser 's employ was Hitler 's commando extraordinaire , Otto Skorzeny , who arrived in Egypt in the early 1950s .
According to Martin Lee , Colonel Nasser , Otto Skorzeny , and Haj Amin al - Husseini ( the grand mufti ) formed a triumvirate to further both their personal and common goals .
Nasser is reported to have had great respect for Skorzeny .
Coincidentally , a young Yasser Arafat - a distant cousin of the grand mufti-participated in unconventional warfare training under the Egyptian soldiers , during which time he developed a rapport with Skorzeny that would reportedly last for many years .
( Martin Lee , The Beast Reawakens , 1997 ) Skorzeny 's principal responsibility was to train thousands of Egyptian com­mandos in guerrilla and desert warfare .
Furthermore , he organized and planned the initial forays of the early Palestinian terrorists into Israel and the Gaza Strip around 1953 - 1954 .
( Glenn B. Infield , Skorzeny : Hitler 's Commando , 1981 ) An Arab Foreign Legion was created , whose nucleus con­sisted of 400 former Nazi veterans who were recruited by Arab League agents in Germany .
Finally , Skorzeny sought to protect German scientists , technicians , and engineers who were recruited to work on Egypt 's special military program .
( Sedar and Greenberg , Behind the Egyptian Sphinx ) .
Not surprisingly , the Mossad - the newly created Israeli espionage agency - considered these personnel to be a serious threat to the security of Israel .
Conse­quently , the Mossad launched numerous missions to assassinate them - usually through the use of letter bombs - some of which found their intended targets .
During this period , renascent Nazis saw the rise of Arab and Third World nationalism as an excellent opportunity to create a German - Islamic neutralist alliance that would extend from the heart of Europe to the South China Sea .
( Lee , The Beast Reawakens ) .
This idea was consistent with the late Karl Haushofer 's policy of an alliance with the " Colored World . " ( Coogan , Dreamer of the Day )
One vision of this new extreme right foreign policy was to create - with the assistance of the grand mufti and the Arab League - a German - Egyptian - dominated power bloc that could resist both the United States and the Soviet Union .
( Sedar and Greenberg , Behind the Egyptian Sphinx ) .
Several other unrepentant German Nazis made their way to the Middle East and played important roles as well .
For example , Skorzeny 's uncle - in- law , Hjalmar Schacht , brokered the " Jeddah agreement " between German industrial firms and Saudi Arabia in 1954 .
Under the agreement , the Saudi government agreed to establish a fleet of supertankers to be built in German shipyards ­that would transport Saudi oil around the world .
The Greek magnate , Aristotle Onassis , was chosen to manage the shipping side of the arrangement .
The Jeddah agreement occasioned considerable consternation among various Western oil companies ; not only would the agreement have been extremely lucrative for the Ruhr shipbuilders , but it would also have threatened the market domi­nance of the " Seven Sisters " oil companies ' distribution of Middle East oil .
Ultimately , with the help of the CIA , the Western oil cartel was able to block the Jeddah agreement .
( Coogan , Dreamer of the Day ) .
Former Nazis also served the new Nasser government in the realm of propaganda .
For example , German expatriate Louis al - Hadj translated Hitler 's Mein Kampf into Arabic .
Johann von Leers , a former high - ranking assistant to Nazi Propaganda Minister Josef Göbbels who worked in the Berlin Foreign Min­istry , eventually settled in Cairo , where he churned out anti-Western and anti-­Israeli propaganda for Nasser 's government .
( Martin Lee , " The Swastika and Crescent , " Intelligence Report , Spring 2002 ) .
He eventually converted to Islam , assumed the Arabized name of Oman Amin von Leers , and went so far as to predict that the German people would turn their backs on Christianity and embrace Islam .
He confided his thoughts to his friend H. Keith Thompson in conversations and correspondence :
The Islamic bloc is today the only spiritual power in the world fighting for a real religion and human values and freedom I think sometimes if my nation had got Islam instead of Christianity we should not have had all the traitors we had in World War II , two million women would not have been burnt as " witches " by the Christian churches , there would have been no Thirty Years War which destroyed Germany and killed more that half of our nation .
One thing is clear - more and more patriot[ ic ]
Germans join the great Arab revolution against beastly imperialism .
To hell with Christianity , for in Christianity 's name Germany has been sold to our oppressors !
Our place as an oppressed nation under the execrable Western colonialist Bonn government must be on the side of the Arab nationalist revolt against the West I hamd ul Allah ! ...
Indeed , for our nation there is only one hope - to get rid of Western imperialism by joining the Arab - led anti­imperialist group .
( Coogan , Dreamer of the Day ) . .
Still other former Nazis who worked for Nasser included SS lieutenant gen­eral Wilhelm Farmbacher , who was the head of the original military adviser group in Egypt , and his assistant , Major General Oskar Munzel , who orga­nized the Egyptian Parachute Corps .
( Sedar and Greenberg , Behind the Egyptian Sphinx )
In the realm of economic development , Dr. Wilhelm Voss , the former director of the Skoda arms factory in Czechoslo­vakia and the Hermann Göring Steel Mills , was the architect of the Egyptian economy in the early postwar years .
Working with Reinhard Gehlen , Skorzeny , and Hjalmar Schacht , he increased West Germany 's trade with Egypt .
( Infield , Skorzeny ) .
During the Cold War , former Nazi officials would occasionally play off both sides of the East - West divide .
The case of Dr. Fritz Grobba , a German Orientalist who converted to Islam , is instructive .
Grobba was Berlin 's minister to Baghdad and also to the court of King Ibn Saud at Riyadh .
In the years leading up to World War II , with his colleagues and agents in the Middle East , Grobba conspired with the grand mufti to sabotage Anglo - French military and economic influence in the region .
In 1941 , they helped spark Rashid Ali al­Gilani 's revolt in Iraq , which was quickly suppressed by the British govern­ment .
Driven out of the Middle East by the Allies , Grobba , the grand mufti , al - Gilani , and their assistants took refuge in Berlin , where Hitler installed them in a special Bureau of Arab Affairs that was designed to disseminate propaganda to the Muslim world .
Grobba survived the war and eventually served as the director of Arab affairs at the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow .
Serving as a Soviet diplomatic intermediary , Grobba brokered an arms deal between Nasser 's Egypt and the Soviet Union .
His former compatriot , Otto Skorzeny , is thought to have helped engineer Nasser 's alliance with the Soviet Union .
Bolstered by the new alliance and relying on Nazi - trained military forces at his disposal , Nasser felt confident enough to seize the Suez Canal in 1956 .
His confidence backfired three months later , when Great Britain , France , and Israel attacked Egypt in order to regain control of the canal .
( Sedar and Greenberg , Behind the Egyptian Sphinx ) , Ultimately , the Egyptian - Soviet alliance undercut Skorzeny 's influence with Nasser .
Under pressure from the Soviets to establish relations with East Germany , Nasser alienated the German Federal Republic , which broke off diplomatic relations with Egypt and cut off all economic aid .
That effectively put an end to Skorzeny 's work in Egypt , including a rocket program in Helwan .
( Infield , Skorzeny ) .
Not to be left out of the action , some American right - wing extremists also sojourned in the Middle East in the early postwar years as well .
For example , in 1953 Francis Parker Yockey , the author of the 600 - page tome Imperium , and H. Keith Thompson were reported to have visited Cairo in an effort to forge an alliance with the Nasser regime .
Yockey was an early postwar exponent of pan­Eutopeanism .
In his geo-political framework , the United States was a more se­rious enemy to the European - derived peoples than the Soviet Union .
He praised Hitler as the " hero of the Second World War " and the Nazi seizure of power as the " European Revolution of 1933 . "
Yockey and an associate , Fred Weiss , reportedly sought to persuade Nasser to underwrite the development of a " cobalt bomb " on which exiled Nazi scientists were working .
( Coogan , Dreamer of the Day ; and Lee , The Beast Reawakens . )
Other American extremists reached out to Arabs in the Middle East as well .
In 1959 , the founder of the American Nazi Party , George Lincoln Rockwell , was reported to have made overtures to then President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic .
( FBI Internal Memorandum , File Number 97-3835-33 , July 13,1959 ) .
And James H. Madole , the leader of the extreme right National Renaissance Party , openly supported Arab regimes and may have received financial backing from Arab nationalists , including diplomats in the United States .
There is some indication that these overtures were taken at least somewhat seriously .
For example , Abdul Mawgoud Hassan , the press attaché of the Egyptian United Nations delegation , once spoke at an NRP meet­ing .
The NRP also corresponded with the grand mufti .
However , by all known accounts , not much ever came of these efforts .
( Nicholas Goodrick - Clarke , The Black Sun : Aryan Cults , Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity , 2002 ) .
Coogan believed that Nazi scientists in Argentina may have been working on a " cobalt bomb " project .
Just exactly what the " cobalt bomb " is , is unclear .
Weiss described it as ' a " goose - egg bomb , capable of destroying four city blocks . "
It sounds as if it might have been a forerunner to the so­ called suitcase nuclear bombs produced in the former Soviet Union .
( Coogan , Dreamer of the Day ) .
The rise of Palestinian terrorism in the early 1970 ’s then , caused some elements of the European extreme right to once again take interest in the Middle Eastern affairs .
After King Hussein of Jordan expelled the PLO from Jordan in 1970 , PLO chairman Yasser Arafat created a new terrorist organization called Black September .
The organization established strong ties with German left - wing rad­icals .
Working together , they carried out one of the most infamous acts in the annals of European terrorism - the kidnapping and subsequent killing of sev­eral Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich , Germany .
Actually , representatives of the extreme right had collaborated with Palestin­ian rejectionist groups long before the representatives of the radical left had .
A few neofascists even fought alongside Arab guerrillas in Middle Eastern conflicts .
For example , Robert Courdroy , a veteran of the Belgian SS , died in combat while fighting for the Palestinians in 1968 .
And , on some occasions , the extreme right actually worked side by side with the radical left in support of Palestinian terrorists .
Both the extreme right and Palestinian rejectionists shared hostility toward Zionism .
Early efforts on the part of the European extreme right to assist Palestinian rejectionists consisted primarily of financial support .
The case of Francois Genoud is illustrative .
Genoud founded a Swiss extreme right organization and worked as a trusted banker for German neo -Nazis .
Reportedly well connected to Arab circles in the Middle East , Genoud founded the Arab Commercial Bank in Geneva and became a formidable financial power as tens of millions of dollars were funneled through his hands for the use of Palestinians in Europe .
Through his various connections , Genoud was an important nexus between groups like Fatah and Black September on the one hand , and extre­mist groups in Europe on the other .
( Claire Sterling , The Terror Network , 1984 ) .
In his capacity as a shadowy financier , Genoud paid the legal costs for three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) who stood trial for blowing up an Israeli jet in Zurich .
Genoud 's Nazi roots went quite deep .
While studying in Bonn as a teenager in 1932 , Genoud actually met Hitler .
The young Genoud shook hands with his mentor and expressed his admiration for National Socialism .
When he returned to Switzerland in 1934 , he joined the pro­Nazi Swiss National Front .
Shortly thereafter in 1936 , he traveled to Palestine , where he became a confidant of Grand Mufti al - Husseini .
After the war , Genoud acquired all the posthumous rights to the writings of Hitler , Martin Bormann , and Josef Göbbels , increasing his fortune in the process .
Using his Swiss banking connections , he helped many Nazis escape from Germany , an effort to which Grand Mufti al - Husseini also allegedly lent assistance .
( Peter Wyden , The Hitler Virus : The Insidious Legacy of Adol Hitler , 2001 ) .
Genoud also helped underwrite the costs for the legal defense of Adolf Eichmann .
According to some European press accounts , Genoud sold defeated Nazis ' gold and deposited the proceeds into Swiss bank accounts to fi­nance these projects .
Genoud was particularly close to the grand mufti , serving as his financial ad­viser .
In 1958 , he founded the Arab Commercial Bank in Geneva to manage the assets of the Algerian National Liberation Front .
As mentioned earlier , sev­eral former Nazis , including Major General Otto Ernst Remer , assisted the rebels in their struggle against French colonial rule .
Genoud was reportedly involved in financing terrorist groups , disseminating anti-Israeli propaganda throughout the Middle East , and assisting the Palestinian hijackers of a Luft­hansa plane in 1972 .
He was particularly close to Dr. Waddi Haddad , the co­founder of the PFLP , and Ali Hassan Salameh of the Black September group .
However , his activities did not go unnoticed by his enemies .
In 1993 a bomb exploded in front of his house , and he barely escaped alive .
Feeling trapped , Genoud committed suicide by drinking poison in May 1996 .
( Wyden , The Hitler Virus ) .
Another important financial benefactor of Palestinian causes was the wealthy Italian publisher , Giangiacomo Feltrinelli .
Ironically , Feltrinelli was a financial supporter of communist groups ; however , he met secretly with the Italian neofascist Prince Valerio Borghese to discuss ways in which both the left and right could work together to battle imperialism .
( Sterling , The Terror Network ) The Black International , which operated under the name of the European New Order , held a summit in Barcelona on behalf of the Palestinians .
The organization was composed of vari­ous Nazis and fascists from Nazi Germany , Vichy France , Franco 's Spain , Salazar 's Portugal , Mussolini's Italy , and the Greek colonels ' military junta .
The Spanish leader , General Francesco Franco , is believed to have endorsed the meeting .
Two representatives from Fatah , the military arm of the PLO , attended the event .
Reportedly , the delegates discussed raising money , organizing arms traffic , and providing ex-Nazi military instructors to help train guerrillas .
A major endeavor was to recruit Caucasians to augment Fatah 's forces in the Mid­dle East and also collaborate in acts of sabotage and terrorism in Europe .
( Ibid ) .
Several summits followed this event , including one held on September 16 , 1972 , barely ten days after Palestinian Black September terrorists killed eleven Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics .
Six hundred delegates to this gathering re­portedly cheered Black September to the rafters .
( Ibid ) .
In May 1979 , another sum­mit was held in Paris , where a former SS officer and Rexist Parry ( a pro-fascist Belgian political parry that was active during the interwar years ) member , Jean Roberts Debbaudt , pledged support to the Palestinian resistance .
Still another right - wing extremist who established contacts in the Middle East was Jean Thiriart from Belgium , who served as a secretary for a neo -Nazi group called La Nation Europeene .
He shared many of the ideas of Francis Parker Yockey , including creating a European Third World bloc that could re­sist the United States .
In 1968 , he traveled to several Arab countries to gain support for his idea of a " European brigade , " which he envisaged as a guerrilla army that would engage in armed struggle against American soldiers stationed in Europe .
Reportedly , Thiriart actually served as an adviser to Fatah in 1969 .
He sought to convince his Arab interlocutors that it would be in their interest if the United States became enmeshed in a " silent war " against neofascist ter­rorists in Europe .
( Lee , The Beast Reawakens ) .
He traveled to Iraq and conferred with Colonel Saddam Hussein , the future dictator of the country .
According to Thiriart , the Iraqis were enthusiastic about the plan but were persuaded by their then sponsor , the Soviet Union , to abandon the plan .
Thiriart was also believed to have been close to PFLP leader George Habash .
( Ibid ) .
Other efforts to collaborate in the field of terrorism followed .
For example , there were several instances of cooperation between German right - wing extre­mists and terrorist groups in the Middle East .
Following the example of Euro­pean left - wing terrorists , members of a small German neo -Nazi group , Wehrsportgruppe - Hoffmann , sought to develop an alliance with the PLO and other Middle Eastern terrorist groups during the 1970s and early 1980s .
Karl Heinz Hoffman , the leader of the group , traveled to Damascus in July 1980 to develop links between the PLO and East German intelligence agents .
Hoffman also worked out a deal that provided used trucks to the PLO in exchange for training .
( Ibid ) .
Members of this group reportedly received paramilitary training in PLO camps in Jordan and fought alongside Palestinians in that country during the " Black September " of 1970 .
( Bruce Hoffman , Right - Wing Terrorism in Europe since 1980 ) .
One German neo -Nazi mercenary , Karl von Kyna , even died in combat during a Palestinian commando raid in September 1967 .
( Lee , " The Swastika and Crescent " ) .
One of the most notorious terrorist groups of this period was the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which gained widespread notoriety in 1968 by hijacking several commercial airplanes .
The leader of the PFLP , George Habash , received support from neo-fascists in Europe known as the Black International .
The PFLP reportedly carried out terrorist attacks against Jewish targets in Europe with the assistance of Odfried Hepp and his neo -Nazi group , which unleashed a wave of bombings at four U.S. Army bases in Ger­many that damaged property and injured military personnel .
( Benjamin Netanyahu , Fighting Terrorism : How Democracies Can Defeat the International Terrorist Network , New York , 2001 ) .
In early 1970 , a neo -Nazi group calling itself the Freikorps Adolf Hitler , founded by Udo Albrecht , was identified as having participated in the Black September war against King Hussein 's government in Jordan .
In 1978 German police arrested members of the Freikorps Adolf Hitler and another organization , the Hilfskorps Arabien , on suspicion of smuggling arms from the Middle East into West Germany for Palestinian operatives that were living there .
In that same year , Albrecht was arrested in Germany and was found to be carrying a card that connected him to the Fatah organization .
This arrest was the first direct proof German authorities had linking German radicals with Middle Eastern terrorist organizations .
( Rand C. Lewis , A Nazi Legacy : Right - Wing Extremism in Postwar Germany , 1991 ) .
Still another neo -Nazi with whom the PLO had contact was Manfred Röder .
Following advice from Albrecht , he traveled to Lebanon to make contact with Yasser Arafat .
He never met with the PLO chairman , however , instead speaking with his deputy , Abu Jihad .
Disappointingly for Röder , Jihad refused to cooperate with him , which was a setback for relations between neo -Nazis and Palestinians .
( Ibid ) .
Undaunted , Röder continued to look for supporters in the Middle East .
In 1980 he traveled to Syria and Iraq to build a relationship of mutual support and trust , but these efforts appear to have failed .
Other German extremists , however , were able to establish significant ties .
There were also sporadic reports that surfaced during the 1980s of cooperation between German neo -Nazis and a Turkish fascist organization known as the " Gray Wolves . "
Mehmet Kengerle , who served with the SS in World War II , was the figure that allegedly sought to arrange this alliance .
( Ibid ) .
The organization 's most infamous member , Mehmet Ali Aga , attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul 11 in May 1981 .
This alliance , like the others that preceded it , was also short - lived and of limited significance .
More recently Fawsi Salim el - Mahdi , the leader of Yasser Arafat 's Praetorian Guard , " Tanzim 17 , " included the Nazi salute in a graduation ceremony for Palestinian Authority police cadets .
Known to his colleagues as " Abu Hitler . "
In fact his affection for the Third Reich is reflected in his choice of names for his two sons , Eichmann and Hitler .
( Morse , The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism ) .
By the late 1980 ’s however , there was little cooperation between militant Islam and the extreme right .
Arab nationalism had waned considerably , and most of the leading Nazi fugitives were dead or in permanent retirement .
The Palestinian rejectionists had begun to moderate .
What is more , the new Palestinian groups , such as Hamas , had no history of cooperation with the extreme right .
However , the end of the Cold War significantly changed international poli­tics .
Furthermore , the revolution in telecommunications greatly facilitated the exchange of ideas between dissident groups around the world .
As one observer noted , the Internet has been key to the development of the nascent alliance between Islam and the right .
By one estimate , more than 2,000 extremist sites dot the World Wide Web .
104 Another important factor is the demise of communism .
The extreme right abandoned the communist threat as its chief enemy ; in its place emerged the nemesis of the new world order , which , as one observer noted , is often perceived as " a juggernaut of international corporate finance , Jewish media , and American military power . "
( See David J. Whitaker , ed. , The Terrorism Reader ) .
The right 's conceptualization of this new enemy parallels closely the principal adversaries of militant Islam .
Finally , both the extreme right and Islam share a similar eschatology , in which the old order is viewed as incorrigibly corrupt , something that must be totally effaced in order to build a new order .
For these reasons , new opportunities for cooperation began to emerge by the late 1990 ’s..
During the 1980s Iran began to sponsor conferences to establish a working relationship among Middle Eastern terrorist group .
( Bodansky , Bin Laden ) .
Michael Ledeen believed that " in all probability the working relationship between al Qaeda and Iran was forged in the Afghan war , and continued uninterrupted throughout the nineties . "
( Ledeen , The War against the Terror Masters ) . .
Tehran resolved to transform Hezbollah into the " vanguard of the revolution . "
Despite its Shi'ite orientation , Iran sought to build bridges with Sunni terrorist organizations .
The Iranian arm of Hezbollah had been involved in interna­tional terrorism since 1981 , but this most recent initiative broadened the scope of its operations .
Although Tehran had previously sponsored numerous foreign terrorist groups , it could exert only a limited amount of influence over them , mostly by financial power and ideological suasion .
( Taheri , Holy Terror ) .
Khomeini 's successor , President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , established the Supreme Council for Intelligence Afairs , which was construed elsewhere as the Supreme Council for Terrorism .
The council laid the foundation for a broad - based terrorist organi­zation known as Hezbollah Internationa1 .
And in 1996 Dr. Mahdi Chamran Savehie from the Supreme Council convened a conference in Tehran , which brought many groups and leaders together , including Mustafa Al Liddawi of Hamas , George Habbash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , Abdullah Ocalan of the Kurdish People 's Party , Ramadan Shalah of the Pales­tinian branch of Islamic Jihad , Ahmed Sala of the Egyptian branch of Islamic Jihad , and Osama bin Laden .
( Robinson , Bin Laden ) .
The summit participants agreed to the unification of their financial system as well as the standardization of training in order to establish interoperability for their terrorist operatives .
Reportedly , a Committee of Three was established , which included Osama bin Laden of al Qaeda , Imad Mughniya of the Lebanese branch of Islamic Jihad , and Ahmed Sala of the Egyptian branch of Islamic Jihad .
Although two of these individuals were Sunnis and one was a Shi'ite , all sides were comfortable with the arrangement , and Iran trusted them .
In 1996 the Qods Force , the covert action arm of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , arranged the Khobar Towers bombing .
( It is worth noting that there is still some uncertainty surrounding the Khobar Towers bombing .
For example , the 9 - 11 Commission concluded , " While the evidence of Iranian involvement is strong , there are also signs that al Qaeda played some role , as yet unknown . " )
In early June 2002 the leaders of four major terrorist organizations - Hezbollah , Hamas , Islamic Jihad , and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine general command - met in Tehran , Iran , presumably to work on a common strategy to oppose Israel .
( David Frum and Richard Perle , An End to Evil : How to Win the War on Terror , 2003 ) .
Richard Clarke ( a former National Security Council staffer ) in Against All Enemies makes it clear that Iran was a " priority " country " as important as the others , " including the Taliban 's Afghanistan , in the post 9/11 war on terrorism .
And that , ” al Qaeda regularly used Iranian territory for transit and sanctuary prior to September 11 .
Al Qaeda 's Egyptian branch , Egyptian Islamic Jihad , operated openly in Tehran .
It is no coincidence that many of the al Qaeda management team , or Shura Council , moved across the border into Iran after U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan .
( See also the February 27 , 2006 Weekly Standard article Tehran plays host to al Qaeda :
In fact the 9/11 Commission reports last year stated that al Qaeda operatives received explosives training from Iran in the early 1990s .
Bin Laden " showed particular interest in learning how to use truck bombs such as the one that had killed 241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon in 1983 . "
This early history of collaboration did not come to an end .
Even after 1996 , Iran continued to open its doors to al Qaeda .
The Clinton administration 's original unsealed indictment of al Qaeda in November 1998 states that bin Laden 's group had allied itself with Iran and its terrorist puppet , Hezbollah .
The 9/11 Commission even left open the possibility that Hezbollah had assisted al Qaeda 's execution of the September 11 plot .
And although still part of an ongoing investigation following the gradual release of Saddam Hussein documents these days , early on some intelligence analysts already maintained that al Qaeda had endeavored to create an operational alliance with Saddam Hussein 's Iraq .
Simon Reeve claims that by early 1999 , bin Laden was in the process of forging a secret alliance with Saddam Hussein .
Contact between the two sides was first allegedly made in the early 1990s when Hassan al - Turabi put bin Laden in contact with operatives from the Iraqi secret service .
These contacts were supposed to have been maintained by representatives of the Iranian terrorist group Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization ( MKO ) , which had its headquarters in Baghdad .
( Bergen , Holy War , Inc ) .
A recent Foreign Affairs article titled “ Blessed July , ” refers to a book - length report with Iraqi documents and interviews with over 100 officials of Saddam ’s regime which was , in the words of the Foreign Affairs article , “ a regime - directed wave of ‘ martyrdom ’ operations against targets in the West . ”
The Foreign Affairs article mentions terror training camps operated by the Fedayeen Saddam , the militia of soldiers most loyal to Saddam .
Started in 1994 , according to the documents , it trained some 7,200 Iraqis in the art of terrorism in the first year alone .
“ Beginning in 1998 , ” according to the full report , “ these camps began hosting ‘ Arab volunteers from Egypt , Palestine , Jordan , “ the Gulf , and Syria . ” Laurie Mylroie asserted that bin Laden had known ties to Iraqi intelligence and that both parties share similar objectives , such as overthrowing the Saudi regime , ending the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf , and having sanctions against Iraq lifted .
( Mylroie , The new war against America : Saddam Hussein and the World Trade Center Attacks , 2001 ) .
Accordingly , Osama bin Laden 's right - hand man , Dr. Ayman al - Zawahiri , visited Baghdad in 1998 and received a $ 300,000 pay­ment just before he merged the Egyptian branch of Islamic Jihad group with al Qaeda .
( Frum and Perle , An End to Evil ) . .
Whereas there is evidence of Nazi Government links to various Governments in the Middle East including Iraq and Iran ; according to accounts , a convoluted web of terrorists that includes elements of al Qaeda , Iraqi intelligence , and German neo -Nazis have established a working relationship .
In the fall of 2002 , investigators with the German government 's Office for the Protection of the Constitution reported that right - wing extremists and radical Muslims were increasingly using similar rhetoric .
They both decry the new world order , which they see as controlled by Jews and enforced by U.S. military power .
Both movements are also wary of democracy .
Recently , German neo -Nazis have been seen sporting Palestinian headscarves at rallies and calling for worldwide intifada .
Also Udo Voigt , the chairman of the National Democratic Party , has reached out to Muslim extremists .
( Jeffrey Fleishman , " Shared Hatred Draws Groups Closer , " Los Angeles Times , January 19 , 2003 , Some investigators believe that Hezbollah and Argentinean right - wing extremists may have been responsible for the bombings of the Israeli embassy and Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires in 1993 and 1994 .
Jewish institu­tions outside Israel are generally less protected , and local anti-Semitic extremists can provide logistical help for attacks .
( Bodansky , Islamic Anti-Semitism as a Political Instrumen ) .
In 1993 , Imad Mughniya of Hezbollah masterminded the truck bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires , Argentina , which killed 29 people and wounded over 200 others .
This attack was followed by a second bombing on July 18 , 1994 , which destroyed the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association ( AIMA ) building in Buenos Aires , which housed several Argentine Jewish organizations .
The attack killed 86 peo­ple and wounded several hundred more .
And some speculate that the Arab and Nazi expatriate communities may have assisted in the attack .
( Samuel Katz , Relentless Pursuit : The DSS and the Manhunt for the al - Qaeda Terrorists , 2002 ) .
Although several factors would seem to militate against such an alliance , militant Islamic groups , including al Qaeda , have previously sought to cooperate with non-Islamic militant groups .
For example , in Ireland , army intelli­gence investigated the possibility that funds raised by the Mercy International Relief Agency ( MIRA ) may have found their way into the coffers of the Irish Republican Army .
In Spain , authorities discovered an alleged plan hatched by al Qaeda and Euskadi Ta Askatasuna ( ETA , or Basque Nation and Liberty ) to car - bomb a meeting of leaders of the European Union .
In Sierra Leone , the Revolutionary United Front was charged with selling millions of dollars worth of illegally mined diamonds to al Qaeda .
Finally , in Sri Lanka , the media re­ported that Liberation Tigers of Tamil had established ties with al Qaeda .
One of the chief obstacles to cooperation would seem to be a disagreement over religion .
However , there may be ways in which to hurdle this obstacle .
For example , inasmuch as the Koran teaches that Allah sent prophets to all major civilizations , it is conceivable that the extreme right could reconcile some of its beliefs with Islam .
( For example , some Muslim scholars have attempted to show that Socrates , Lao - Tzu , Hammurabi , and Zoroaster were prophets of Allah and thus acceptable to Islam .
( Yahiya Emerick , The Complete Idiots Guide to Understanding Islam , 2002 ) .
Furthermore , the entry requirements for Islam are relatively few in number .
Technically , all one need do to become a Muslim is to recite the Shahadah :
I declare there is no god except God , and I declare that Muhammad is the messenger of God .
One significant difference between right - wing terrorists and the more prominent variants of terrorists ( e.g. , left - wing during the 1970s , contemporary Islamic ) is that the former have had no significant state sponsors .
This material and logistical disadvantage could conceivably make the more radical elements of the extreme right more amenable to an alliance with outside groups .
Without governments to offer intelligence , funds , sanctuaries , training facilities , and other kinds of support , their effectiveness has been very lim­ited .
( Benjamin Netanyahu , Terrorism : How the West Can Win , 1986 ) .
One of the principal reasons terrorism spread from the Middle East and Latin America to Western Europe in the 1970s was that a shared ideology of anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism cemented ties among radical group .
( Martha Crenshaw , " Suicide Terrorism in Comparative Perspective , " in International Policy Institute for Counter - Terrorism , Countering Suicide Terrorism , 2002 ) .
The chief difference today is that the nascent anti-American global movement lacks a powerful state sponsor .
However , it is worth noting that most lethal acts of terrorism over the past decade have been perpetrated by groups and individuals unaffiliated with state sponsors .
Another very significant difference between right - wing and Islamic terrorists is the latter 's propensity for martyrdom .
Islamic extremists have demonstrated time and again their commitment to carry out suicide attacks , whereas such methods are virtually nonexistent among right - wing terrorists , for both logistical and ideological reasons .
Alex Curtis praised the exploits of Benjamin Smith , a former member of the World Church of the Creator , who went on a shooting spree that killed two and injured several others .
Just before he was about to be apprehended by the police , Smith committed suicide via a gun­shot to the head .
Curtis lauded Smith as an '' Aryan kamikaze " in a subsequent newsletter .
( '' Aryan Kamikaze Terrorizes Midwest , " Nationalist Observer , No. 15 July 1999 ) .
Sophisticated suicide operations require an extensive network capable of support and planning .
Islamic terrorists have such a network , but right - wing terrorists do not .
Perhaps more important , for Islamic terrorists , dying in a suicide operation is considered an act of martyrdom that will immediately be rewarded with splendid afterlife bliss .
Although right - wing extremists have traditionally not practiced suicide terrorism , the theme occasionally appears in their literature , most notably in William Pierce 's novel The Turner Diaries .
The conclusion is strikingly similar to the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon .
The story 's protagonist , Earl Turner , writes in his diary just hours before his scheduled attack :
It 's still three hours until first flight , and all systems are " go . "
I 'll use the time to write a few pages - my last diary entry .
Then it 's a one - way trip to the Pentagon for me .
The warhead is strapped into the front seat of the old Stearman and rigged to detonate either on impact or when I flip a switch in the back seat .
Hopefully , I 'll be able to manage a low - level air burst directly over the center of the Pentagon .
Failing that , I 'll at least try to fly as close as I can before I 'm shot down .
~ William Pierce , The Turner Diaries , 1993 Not unlike Muhammad Atta , Turner expressed a sense of calm before his mission .
It is a comforting thought in these last hours of my physical existence that , of all the billions of men and women of my race who have ever lived , I will have been able to play a more vital role than all but a handful of them in determining the ultimate destiny of mankind .
What I will do today will be of more weight in the annals of the race than all the conquests of Caesar and Napoleon if !
succeed !
~ Ibid Finally , like Atta , Turner shares a sense of religious fellowship with his com­rades .
The night before his suicide mission , Turner is inducted into " the Order , " the quasi- religious inner circle of the organization :
Knowing what was demanded in character and commitment of each man who stood before me , my chest swelled with pride .
These were no soft - bellied , conservative businessmen assembled for some Masonic mumbo - jumbo ; no loudmouthed , beery red necks letting off a little ritualized steam about " the goddam niggers " ; no pious , frightened churchgoers whining for the guidance or protection of an anthropomorphic deity .
These were real men ,
White men who were now one with me in spirit and consciousness as well as in blood .
~ Ibid .
Where it is known that Arab news­papers often reprint articles written by extreme right activists , there is also evidence to suggest that anti-Semitism has spread to some parts of the non-Arab Muslim World .
Even during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 , Malaysian prime minister Muhammad Mahathir went so far as to blame this predicament on Jews .
The high - powered currency speculator , George Soros , was seen as the chief culprit in adversely affecting the Malaysian economy .
More recently , in a speech presented at an Organization of the Islamic Conference summit in October 2003 , Mahathir accused Jews of trying to " rule [ the ] world by proxy [ and ] get others to fight and die for them . "
Further , he asserted that Jews promoted socialism , communism , human rights , and democracy so that persecuting them would appear to be wrong , and by doing so they have " gained control of the most powerful countries . "
Mahathir exhorted the Islamic umma " to face the enemy " and opined that 1.3 billion Muslims could not be " defeated by a few million Jews . "
( Speech by Prime Minister Muhammad Mahathir , " October 16 , 2003 ) .
Mahathir 's remarks were met with scorn by President George Bush , as well as various European governments , however , numerous ex­treme right groups and Muslims commended him for speaking out on this issue .
Defiant , Mahathir reiterated his criticism of Jews and Israel in an interview in May 2005 , in which he accused American politicians of being " scared stiff of the Jews because anybody who votes against the Jews will lose elections .
( Quoted in Simon Tisdall , '' Father ' of Malaysia Savages Bush and Blair , " Guardian , May 27,2005 ) .
Just as Islamists and the extreme right are beginning to find common ground , the gap between the far left and the far right may be narrowing as well .
Both movements often decry globalization .
Increasingly , they both share a criticism of Israeli policy toward Palestinians .
A case in point is the case of Rachel Corrie , an attractive twenty - three - year - old American student at Evergreen State College in Olympia , Washington , and a member of the International Sol­idarity Movement , who took a semester off to work as a peace activist in Gaza .
While there , she took part in a protest in which an Israel driver using a bull­dozer was preparing to knock down a Palestinian 's house .
Corrie stood between the bulldozer and the house and refused to move .
However , the Israel driver ran over her , and she sustained injuries from which she ultimately died .
Despite Corrie 's presumably left - leaning political orientation , various right - wing publications and websites eulogized her as an Aryan martyr .
What is more , the antiglobalization rhetoric of the contemporary extreme right could conceivably make its agenda more palatable to the far left , which also champions a similar platform , including radical environmentalism and animal rights .
In fact , in 2002 , the National Alliance created a front group , the Anti-Globalism Action Network ( AGAN ) , to capitalize on the left 's opposition to globalist organizations such as the World Bank , G8 , and the International Monetary Fund and sent it to Kananaskis , Canada , to protest a G8 meeting .
AGAN added an anti­Semitic twist to the traditional left - wing conspiracy narrative .
( Center for New Community .
" CNC Uncovers Neo-Nazis Masquerading as Anti­Globalization Activists , " June 21 , 2002 ) .
Extreme right stalwarts , such as Louis Beam , the chief proponent of the leaderless resis­tance approach in the United States , expressed solidarity with anti-World Trade Organization protestors in Seattle .
( Reynolds , " Virtual Reich " ) .
The conflation of anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism arises in large part from the relationship between the United States and Israel .
The paradox of modern Israel , as Christopher Hitchens argued , is that the state was created to provide a safe , stable , and proudly independent nation to which Jews from around the world could come to escape from fluctuations in gentile goodwill .
However , today Israel is largely reliant on foreign aid , most notably the annual subsidy of $ 3 billion from the United States .
Furthermore , the tiny nation appears to be hopelessly involved in endless battles that have the effect of catalyzing anti-Zionist sentiment around the world .
Anti-Semitism generated in the lands of the diaspora is weak , but anti-Zionism generated from the Middle East conflict grows strong .
Therefore , paradoxically , the " new anti-Semitism " appears to be engendered in large part by the existence of Israel .
In recent years , some observers have also noted the parallels between tradi­tional anti-Semitism and the current incarnation of anti Americanism .
( Hitchens , " Jewish Power , Jewish Peril , " Vanity Fair , September 2002 ) .
But as Waiter Laqueur observed , since the 1960s the American extreme right has been transformed from an ultrapatriotic movement to one that is increasingly anti­patriotic and nihilistic .
( Laqueur , No End to War , 2003 ) .
This shift explains how the extreme right could find common cause with anti-American movements such as militant Islam .
Both movements see the United States as being under the control of the Jews .
It thus follows that with the global rise of American prominence , the Jewish threat ex­tends to the entire world .
A new synthesis has been created , centered on the narrative of a U.5. - Israeli alliance .
The Israeli - Jewish hand is seen as pulling the strings of the American leviathan .
Just as bin Laden has conflated the United States and Israel under the rubric of the " Zionist - crusader " alliance , so has the international extreme right reified the notion of the U.S. government hopelessly under the control of a Jewish cabal in the phrase " Zionist occupation government , " or " ZOG . "
For many years , the European extreme right has identified the United States and its pervasive popular culture as an existential threat to the racial , cultural , and spiritual integrity of European civilization .
Ahmed Huber wrote an essay in this vein in 1982 , titled " The Unknown Islam . "
In it he identified three principal threats to Islam : Zionism , Marxism , and finally " the American way of life , " which was largely a code phrase for " Judaism . "
Huber commented on a trend in which anti-Semitism coincided with anti-Americanism :
Now the anti-Americanism all over the world , which should be directed at the American government , against Zionist power in America , becomes now a general anti-Americanism .
( For Huber see the article by Kevin Coogan , " The Mysterious Achmed Huber : Friend to Hitler , Allah and bin Laden " )
Similarly however , in an audio tape released in October 2003 , Osama bin Laden voiced his contempt for the United States , replete with anti-Semitic themes :
Some have the impression that you [ Americans ] are a reasonable people .
But the majority of you are vulgar and without sound ethics or good manners .
You elect the evil from among you , the greatest liars and the least decent and you are enslaved by your richest and the most influential among you , especially the Jews , who lead you using the lie of democracy to support the Israelis and their schemes and in complete antagonism towards our religion , Islam .
( " Bin Laden Calls Americans ' Vulgar and without Sound Ethics , ''' al- Jazeera , October 18 , 2003 ) .
A similar pattern to the anti-Americanism in Europe in the wake of 9/11 could be obseved .
Although anti-Americanism in the media came overwhelmingly from the political left , protests in the streets were almost all sponsored by the extreme right and radical Muslims .
Militant Islam and the extreme right both share a strikingly similar critique on several issues .
This development has not gone unnoticed by authorities .
Dale Watson , the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's ( FBI 's ) assistant director for counterterrorism , saw evidence of communication between extremists in the United States and Muslim extremists overseas .
( John Solomon , " U.S. Extremists ' Links with Terror Groups Watched , " Salon . corn , February 28 , 2002 . )
In recent years however , domestic right - wing extremists appear to be more internationally inclined than they traditionally have been in the past .
In the realm of terrorism , such cooperation would make for a very formid­able challenge , if carried out deftly .
Islamic terrorists have traditionally been foreign young men of Middle Eastern origin .
Despite the pronouncements on the part of authorities that they abhor racial profiling and would not condone its use , the fact remains that young men of Middle Eastern ancestry will tend to make people more suspicious than other population groups , for no other reason than that previous Islamic terrorists shared the same ethnic and religious characteristics .
If well - funded Middle Eastern terrorists could enlist the support of terrorists with white , Anglo - Saxon ethnic features , it could present an intelligence nightmare to authorities .
Reportedly , al Qaeda has already entertained this scheme .
According to a statement by then US .
attorney general John Ashcroft in May 2004 , al Qaeda was seeking to recruit operatives " who can portray themselves as Europeans . "
Also Alfred Schobert , a researcher at the Information Service against Right - Wing Extremism in Duisburg , Germany , made this observation with regard to the situation in Germany .
He conceded , however , that some far - right leaders see potential in such an alliance .
In order to avoid the intense scrutiny received by travelers from certain Middle Eastern countries , it is believed that al Qaeda is now using operatives from Chechnya , Bosnia , and even Western Europe .
Furthermore , some Muslim operatives are believed to have converted to Christianity in order to obscure their backgrounds and allay suspicion .
The U.S. government has warned law enforcement agencies that Islamic extremists , without any formal affiliation with al Qaeda , might carry out terrorist attacks in the United States and overseas .
The FBI fears that individuals on the fringes of extremist groups may carry out attacks on their own initiative .
Certain events , such as the war on Iraq and increasing tensions in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , could act as catalysts for such attacks .
( David Johnston and James Risen , " Agencies Warn of Lone Terrorists , " New York Times , February 23,2003 ) Extremists had used right - wing extremist propaganda to augment their anti-Zionist propaganda .
One major obstacle to any kind of serious collaboration is the fact that in the United States , there is no real right - wing terrorist infrastructure to speak of ; lead­erless resistance - actually a sign of desperation - predominates .
However the significance of potential collaboration in the area of propaganda should not be blithely dismissed , as conflicts in the future will increasingly revolve around information and communication matters .
So - called soft power is im­portant in an era of globalization .
Joseph
Nye was the first to distinguish between " hard power " and " soft power . "
The former consists of traditional measures such as military and economic strength , and the latter includes culture and ideology .
Adversaries will emphasize media operations and " perception management " in order to get their side of the story out .
As David Ronfeldt and John Arquilla argued , what happens at the " narrative level " is very important to the success of a network : Networks , like other organizations , are held together by the narratives , or stories that people tell .
... these narratives provide a grounded _expression of people 's experiences , interests , and values .
First of all , stories express a sense of identity and belonging - who " we " are , why we have come together , and what makes us different from " them . "
Second , stories communicate a sense of cause , purpose , and mission .
The express aims and methods as well as cultural dispositions - what " we " believe in , and what we mean to do , and how .
( Arquilla and Ronfeldt , Networks and Netwars : The Future of Terror. Crime , and Militancy , 2001 ) .
In fact there have been indications that the United States and the UK are losing the war of ideas , most notably in the Islamic world .
A survey conducted by the Pew Global Attitudes Project in forty - four countries and released in June 2003 found that a significant number of people in the Muslim world would trust Osama bin Laden to " do the right thing regarding world affairs . "
( Faye Bowers , " Al Qaeda 's Profile : Slimmer but Menacing , " Christian Science Monitor , September 9 , 2003 ) .
It is known that the war in Iraq sent support for the United States to record lows in the Muslim world , and the extreme right is keenly aware of this , so next a more in detailed review .
The new alliance has come .
The eleventh of September has brought together [ the two sides ] because the new right has reacted positively
They say , and I agree with them 100 percent , what happened on the eleventh of September , if it is the Muslims who did it , it is not an act of terrorism but an act of counterterrorism . ”
~ Ahmed Huber , as quoted in Peter Finn , " Unlikely Allies Bound by a Common Hatred , " Washington Post , April 29 , 2002 .
Saddam Hussein's uncle and future father - in law , Khairallah Tulfah , along with General Rashid Ali al - Gilani and the so - called colonels of the Golden Square , participated in a coup against the pro-British government of Iraq , and recognized as Iraq ’s new Government by Germany declared independence from Great Britain on May 12 , 1941 .
This pro-Nazi regime as we have seen was then ejected by a British military intervention soon thereafter , but not before the regime insti­gated an anti-Jewish pogrom in which 200 people were killed .
( See also David Frum and Richard Perle , An End to Evil : How to Win the War on Terror , 2003 ) .
Tulfah had a strong influence on his son - in - law , regaling him with his vision of a pan-­Islamic Nazi alliance .
Not unlike Hitler , Saddam Hussein sought to implement a new order based on the principles of nationalism and socialism under the dictatorial control of the Führerprinzip .
( Charles A. Morse , " The Nazi Background of Saddam Hussein , " February 21 , 2003 ) .
His Ba'ath ( Renaissance )
Party like the regimes in Iran , Syria , and soon also Egypt , had the characteristics of a European fascist party of the interwar years , seeking to mold the masses into a single organic collectivity through a program of corporatism and national regeneration .
Saddam Hussein's defiant position toward the United States and Israel throughout the 1990s bolstered his image in some quarters .
As a result , several representatives of the extreme right have reached out to him on numerous occasions .
In the weeks leading up to the Gulf War , some European right - wing extre­mists sought to provide token assistance and moral support .
For example , the late German neo -Nazi leader Michael Kuhnen reportedly negotiated with Iraqi diplomats in an effort to build an " Anti-Zionist Legion " to fight for Saddam Hussein and repel the U.S. - led coalition .
Another German neo-Nazi leader , Heinz Reisz , appeared on Russian state television on January 25 , 1991 , and pro­claimed " Long live the fight for Saddam Hussein ; long live his people ; long live their leader ; God save the Arab people . "
A French neo -Nazi , Michel Faci , traveled to Baghdad where he and twenty or so assorted activists and historical revisionists were guests of Saddam Hussein at a government - sponsored event titled " Friendship , Solidarity and Peace with Iraq . "
In 1986 famous Paganist and at the time intellectual leader of the so called , French Nouvelle Droite , Alain de Benoist released a publication , Europe , Tiers monde , meme combat ( Europe , the Third World , the Same Fight ) , in which he called for an alliance between Europe and the Arab Middle East , to weaken both the U.S. and Soviet blocs and their hold on Europe .
This rightist variant of " Third Worldism " was not informed by the more liberal - oriented admiration of the " noble savage " or white racial guilt , but rather by geopolitical hostility to the bloc system and its hold over Europe .
In January 1991 , Alain de Benoist , joined with a coalition that included various leftists , trade unionists , and anti-American rightists to protest the U.S. - led aggression against Iraq .
( Michael O'Meara , New Culture , New Right : Anti-Liberalism in Postmodern Europe , 2004 ) .
More recently Alain de Benoist has also been mentioned in a booklet with the misleading title “ New Religions and The Nazis ” 2006 , by Karla Poewe .
Poorly argued and under - researched , rather then having anything to do with the “ Nazis ” ( as the that time Government of Germany ) , Karla Poewe ’s booklet rather is a micro history of Jakob Wilhelm Hauer ’s religious ideas .
Saddam found support by Jean Marie Le Pen 's Front National .
Christian fundamentalists in the party favored Saddam because Iraq had been a major arms supplier to the Falange in its battle against Muslims in Lebanon during the civil war .
Anti-Americanism and anti-British sentiment played a role as well .
In October 1990 , Le Pen traveled to Baghdad as part of a delegation of right - wing parties from Europe to meet with Saddam Hussein .
They returned with fifty - three European hostages that were held by Iraq in the months prior to the war .
For his part , supporting Iraq was a clever way in which Le Pen could defuse criticism that he was anti-Arab and anti-Muslim .
( Harvey G. Simmons , The French National Front : The Extremist Challenge to Democracy , 1996 ) .
Reportedly , some elements of Jorg Haider 's Austrian Freedom Party ( FPO ) have also sympathized with Saddam Hussein 's regime .
For example , there is the case of Abdul Moneim Jebra , a sixty - year - old Iraqi arms dealer , who has report­edly sought to strengthen ties between the radical right and militant Islam .
Jebra now lives in Austria , where members of Jorg Haider 's FPO established an Iraqi- Austrian Association to promote ties with Baghdad .
In 1998 a plot to smuggle helicopters to Iraq that involved Jebra was uncovered during a Swiss bribery case .
Plus of course there is Vladimir Zhirinovsky , leader of the Russian ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party , who accused the Kremlin of " betraying " its long - term Arab partners and clients .
The Soviet Union had strong diplomatic ties with many countries in the Middle East , and until its collapse , Moscow played a key role in the re­gion , supporting Arab leaders such as Muammar Qaddafi in Libya , PLO chairman Yasser Arafat , Syrian president Hafez al - Assad , and Iraqi president Saddam Hussein .
However , Mikhail Gorbachev 's government consented to the U.5. - led military action in the Gulf War , an operation that it could have vetoed in the Security Council .
Furthermore , by that time , and even more so during Boris Yeltsin 's tenure , relations with the United States became the top Russian priority .
Zhirinovsky has sought to reestablish an alliance with Iraq .
Toward this end , he reportedly developed a warm relationship with Saddam Hussein .
The Iraqi ambassador to Russia appreciated Zhirinovsky 's gestures of support and has frequently been in attendance at Zhirinovsky 's birthday parties .
( Vladimir Solovyov and Elena Klepikova , Zhirinovsky : Russian Fascism and the Making of a Dictator , 1995 ) .
Zhirinovsky visited Baghdad on numerous occasions during the 1990s and was a guest of Saddam Hussein .
In one instance , he lectured the Iraq leader for four hours on the need to unite against the " American - Israeli plot " to dominate the world .
( Ibid ) In 1993 , Zhirinvosky even went so far as to send a contingent of his paramilitary " falcons " to Iraq to fight against " American imperialism . "
Hussein is rumored to have contributed considerable financial support to Zhirinovsky .
After his trip to Baghdad , Zhirinovsky increased the frequency and the stridency of his anti-American rhetoric .
( Ibid ) .
Other Russian right - wing extremists have also reached out to Muslims , so for example , Heidar Jamal has sojourned in several extremist orga­nizations .
He worked briefly for the ultranationalist Pamyat ( Memory ) orga­nization in 1989 and the late Ahmed Khomeini , the son of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , in 1990 .
In 1993 , he joined the Russian branch of the Islamic Committee .
He ran unsuccessfully for the Duma in 1995 .
Finally , in 1999 , his Islamic Committee joined forces with hard - line communists Victor Ilyukhin and Albert Marashov .
One constant theme that links all his projects is a viru­lent disdain for the West . ( Nabi Abdullaev , " Fundamentalism in Russia : An Interview with Islam Committee 's Heidar Jamal , " in Parfrey , Extreme Islam ) .
With Heidar Jamal and his friend Alexander Dugin who translated both Rene Guenon and Julius Evola in Russian , we are back to the larger circle of intellectuals that include also Alain de Benoit , and what Mark Sedgwick for lack of a better word called ‘ Traditionalism . ’
It was during Perestroika that Russian Traditionalists first took active steps .
In 1987 Dugin and Jamal together joined Pamyat ' ( Memory ) , later described by Dugin as " the most reactionary organization available . "
They hoped to in­fluence it toward Traditionalism , rather as Eliade had hoped to use the Legion of the Archangel Michael in Romania , and Evola had hoped to use the Fascists , the Herrenklub , and the SS .
( Sedgwick , 2004 ) .
Pamyat ' was the focus of popular opposition to Perestroika .
But Dugin's and Jamal 's attempts at infiltration of Pamyat ' were no more successful than had been Eliade 's or Evola 's similar efforts earlier .
Seminars they gave attracted respectable audiences ( up to 100 people ) , and Dugin was appointed to Pamyat ’s Central Council in late 1988 , but in 1989 they gave up and left .
Pamyat ' ; Dugin later described its members as " hysterics and KGB collaborators . "
Its importance for Russian oppo­sition politics in fact was like that of Theosophy for Western esotericism : it was the forum that facilitated the emergence of figures who would later be important elsewhere .
After they left Pamyat , where Jamal continued in the line of Islamist Traditionalism , Dugin in a parallel course of action became involved with Eurasianism .
In 1999 was appointed special advisor to Gennady Nikolayevich Seleznev , the CPRF speaker of the Duma .
( Ivan Kurilla , Geopolitika i kommunizm , “ Geopolitics and Commu­nism ” , Russki Zhurnal 23 , February 1999 ) .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , Dugin helped found the not entirely serious National Bolshevik Party and became increasingly associated with two major figures in Russian political life .
One was Gennady Zyuganov , the leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation ( CPRF ) .
The other , closer associate was Alexander Andreyevich Prokhanov , leader of a group known as the Pochvenniki ( Patriots ) .
In the end however Dugin would found his own Eurasian Party , characterized by Democratic intellectual Igor Vin­ogradov :
They are undertaking a noisy galvanization of a reactionary utopia that failed long ago , an attempt to revive it through the injection of a new vaccine - a combination of " Orthodoxy " and " Islam " in the name of combating insidious " Zionism , " putrid Western " Catholi­cism " and any kind of Jew - Masonry whatever ...
For all their [ intel­lectual ] ineptitude , they are very dangerous .
After all , the temptation of religious fundamentalism in our century of unbelief and general spiritual corruption is attractive to many desperate people who have lost their way in this chaos .
( Vinogradov , in Yelena Yakovich , " Kontinent in Moscow : Voice of Russian Culture , " interview with Igor Vinogradov , Literaturnaya Gazeta , July 22 , 1992 ) .
The credit for this revivification of a " failed " ideology must go to Dugin and Traditionalism , clearly the source of the " new vaccine " referred to .
Dugin continue to maintain his friendly rela­tions first established with Dugin 's visits to the West in 1989 , and continued with visits to Russia by de Benoist and his Belgian ally Robert Steuckers ( the first of which took place in March 1992 ) .
And with the publication of two collections of Dugin 's articles in Italian by Claudio Mutti , in 1991 and 1992 .
Where Mark Sedgwick ’s book is specifically about the ‘ traditionalism ’ of Rene Guenon and Julius Evola , what this has in common with other forms of traditionalism ore preservatist* , is that they construct a revisionist view of history that fits their own agenda .
If we take as an example political traditionalists or new right groups in the USA , we will see that the patriot movement looks to the American Revolution for inspiration , whereas the neo-Confederates look to the Civil War .
The Odinists idealize the Viking era , whereas the National Socialists and many of the historical revisionists admire Hitler 's Third Reich .
The World Church of the Creator idealizes not only the Third Reich but also the Roman Empire and the American Western frontier of the nineteenth century .
And the Christian Identity followers identify with the lost tribes of Israel .
For a preservatist / traditionalist political group in India we would look at ( the recently covered on this website ) RSS / Hindutva , and so on .
Another expression used is heritage ( in German called ' Völkish ' ) for example leader of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke explains it as , “ people understand very well that I 'm not a white supremacist and that I am a European American who wants to preserve my heritage like all people in the world want to , but the real danger to all heritages is Jewish supremacism , which seeks to destroy every heritage but the Jewish heritage . ”
( G. Michael , The Enemy of My Enemy , 2006 ) .
Thus terms like the ‘ new right ’ or / and ‘ extreme right ’ today therefore , are not without contradictions , another good case example is the right / left mélange that came in the aftermath of a pamphlet written in 1950 by Julius Evola titled Orientamenti ( Orienta­tions ) .
Ultra -conservative , paganist / occultist , Julius Evola at the time when he wrote this , was a supporter of Junio Valerio Borghese -- an aristocrat , a Fascist , and Second World War military hero .
( For details see Gianfranco De Turris , Elogio e diftsa di Julius Evola : Il Barone e i terroristi , 1997 ) .
When in 1951 the Italian police arrested some thirty members of the ‘ Fasces Revolutionary Action ’ ( FAR ) , Evola -- because his articles appeared in their publication was accused of also supporting the latter -- however he was acquitted . ( De Turris, 1999 ) .
It was the publicity surrounding this trial , that helped launch Evola on his postwar career , and he expanded Orientamenti into a book published in 1961 , Cavalcare la Tigre : Orientamenti esistenziali per un'epoca della dissoluzione ( Riding the Tiger : Existential Orientations for a Period of Disso­lution ) .
Here , Evola introduced the concept of what in Islam is titled hijra ( emigration ) , fundamental to the more extreme varieties of late twentieth - century political Islam .
Cavalcare la
Tigre became one of the central texts for the Italian new right .
Earlier the Ordine Nuovo ( New Order ) , established by Pino Rauti a dedicated follower of Evola was publicly committed to the defense of " all that of the traditional that has been saved and has found a pole . ”
It launched a joumal , Ordine Nuovo , and offered courses and semi­nars based around Evola 's ( and sometimes Rene Guenon 's ) works , including Evola 's Orientamenti .
One small group from within Ordine Nuovo even followed Ev­ola 's earliest interest , ceremonial magic and Roman neo-Paganism , establishing I Dioscuri ( Greek Dioskouroi , sons of Zeus ) in Rome in the late 1960 ’s . (
Franco Ferraresi , Minacce alia democrazia : La Destra radicale e la strategia de ’la tensione in Italia ne ’ dopoguerra , 1995 ) .
Little is known of the activities of this latter group , except that it ran into difficulties of some sort that led to the suicide of many of its members .
Most of the activities of Ordine Nuovo , however , were intellectual and political .
When the Ordine Nuovo became involved with terrorism a court order called for it ’s forced dissolution in 1974 .
But also for many leftists by then , the old division between left and right was no longer of much importance and had been replaced by a divide identified by Asor Rosa as a division between In and Out .
Bourgeois industrialists were In , as were unionized workers and the PCI ; the unemployed , women , students , and other marginal groups were Out.
Next Franco Freda , another student of Julius Evola sentenced to 16 years in prison in 1972 , founded the Fronte Nazionali ( National Front ) .
Its supporters were predominantly skin-heads , and their crusading issue was immigration , not as crude racism but as an attack on multiculturalism in the name of preserving the purity of distinct traditions .
Exactly what Evola did mean by apoliteia in practical terms - in the realm of action - has since been much disputed .
But just like is the case with various interpretations of what the exact meaning is of certain statements in the Koran , what is more important than what Evola meant , is what he was taken to mean .
Evola 's apoliteia thus was developed by Freda into a call for action against the bourgeois state irrespective of effect , a sort of Traditionalist existentialism - and the word " existentialism " is used in the subtitle of Cavalcare la Tigre .
Freda 's development of Evolian Traditionalism was not entirely nihilistic - he also argued for the destruction of the bourgeois state as a necessary preliminary to further developments , which implies belief in the possibility of " rectifying action " - but his call was in effect a call to what Gianfranco de Turris calls " rightist anarchism . "
( Ferraresi , Minacce alla democrazia , and De Turris , Elogio e d fesa ) .
Mark Sedgwick maintains that Evola , “ seems to have approved of what was being done in his name­ on condition that it was done with proper spiritual preparation .
” ( Sedgwick , 2004 ) .
Just as Evola shifted ( or was thought to have shifted ) the emphasis from the objectives of action to the interior state that gives rise to action , so Freda shifted the emphasis from the objective - which implied some central plan­ning and organization - to the individual .
Freda was one of the earliest and most important proponents of the " archipelago solution , " the new organiza­tional pattern of Italian ‘ new right ‘ terrorism that emerged a solution , by implication , to the problems raised by the dismantling of Ordine Nuovo .
This meant the replacement of earlier , relatively large and hierarchical structures by small and fluid groupings , usually forming for a particular op­eration and then dissolving , and normally acting independently of each other and of any central command .
( Ferraresi , Minacce alla democrazia ) .
The archipelago solution presents certain obvious operational advantages .
As an extension of the Leninist cell system , it is the ultimate guard against police infiltration : no more than a single operation can ever be compromised .
It is , however , more than a defense , since the abandonment of any control over operational groups makes sense only as a corollary to the abandonment of overall strategy .
The archipelago solution , then , is the companion of apoliteia , at least as Freda understood apoliteia .
The two together make up spontaneismo armato ( armed spontaneity ) , Freda 's most destructive discovery , later popularized in his journal , Quex .
Again , Mark Sedgwick suggests , “ there were echoes of Freda in both the organizational method and the apparent objectives of the terrorists who carried out the attacks on the USA September 11 , 2001 . ” ( Sedgwick , 2004 ) .
Finally Freda and some fifty of his followers were , convicted in 1999 of " incitement to racial discrimination , " and in 2000 the Fronte Nazionali was dissolved by decree of the minister of the interior and its assets were confiscated .
( Ruotolo Guido , " Il PM di Verona Papalia : ' C'e ' un vero pericolo " interview with Procurator Guido Papalia , La Stampa , December 3 , 2000 ) .
There were rumors , however , that Fronte Nazionali activists , in alliance with members of the Alleanza Nazionale , this time financed by Osama bin-Laden , had helped ferment the violence that shocked Italy during anti-globalization protests at the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa .
( On the basis of reports in Il Secolo XIX “ July 25 , 2001 ” , ascribed to sources in the Italian security services . )
According to a report in the Milan - based newspaper Corriere della Serra , also German intelligence services claimed that Osama bin Laden had financed extreme right organizations in Europe in the hope that they would assist him in carrying out terrorist attacks during a G - 8 summit meeting held in Genoa in the summer of 2001.

Though the Traditionalist terror in Italy ended in 1983 , that was not the end of the Traditionalists who had been involved in it .
Some , like Claudio Mutti after having spend some years in jail where he converted to Islam , continued nonviolently .
( Ferraresi , Minacce alla democrazia ) .
Two factors influenced his conversion : the writings of Guenon , to which he had been led by the writings of Evola , and Colonel Qad­dafi .
Guenon had convinced him of the need for a " path of realization , " some­thing Evola had not accomplished .
Qaddafi is a more unusual source .
Freda had had an interest in Qaddafi and Islam ; he wrote in Quex about Evola 's requirement for a spiritual basis for action in terms of the relationship between the " lesser jihad " ( armed conflict ) and the " greater jihad " ( the struggle to sub­due the lower self ) , and he published a translation of some of Qaddafi 's speeches .
( Mutti , " Pourquoi j'ai choisi l'Islam , " Elements : Revue de la Nouvelle Droite 53 ; Spring 1985 ) .
Mutti's Islam is militant and political .
Like we have seen above he has published Italian translations of Jamal 's work , but also of the Ayatollah Khomeini a preference he seems to have in common with Ahmed Huber cited at the beginning of this article .
That Islam is in­stalled on top of his early Evolianism is symbolized by the decor of his office , which is predominantly Islamic but includes a Nazi standard propped behind the filing cabinet , reported by Sedgwick who visited Mutti . ( Sedgwick , 2004 ) .
But also Heidar Jamal during the time he was the ideologist for the Party of the Islamic Renaissance and editor of its organ Tavhid [ Unity ] .
In the first issue Jamal analyzed the state of Islam in Traditionalist terms , adding a historical angle rarely found elsewhere , derived in this case from Islamist writings .
Islam , he pointed out , existed in time and was subject to decline just as everything else was .
Further , there had been no real Islamic government since the death of the Prophet , and certainly not since the Mongols .
Matters had grown much worse since then , since the " post - colonial elites " in the Islamic world were either nationalists ( and hence enemies of universal Islam ) or " atheist cosmopolitan[s ] , " equally enemies of true Islam .
In an article from I99I in Tavhid , translated in Italian , Jamal , after comparing the existential significance of death in Evolian Traditionalism to the meta­physical significance of death ( the final return to God ) in Islam , argues that " authentic Islam and the authentic right are non-conformist ; their vital char­acter consists of opposition , disagreement , non-identification . "
( " Islam and the Right , " Giperbort a Vilnius , 1991 , in Jamal , Tawhid ) .
For a Christian , " God is almost synonymous with hyper - conformism , " whereas Islam is a " protest ... against the reduction of God to ' consensus . '''
The political right and Islam both fight the snares of the world , including self - deification and " profane elitarianism . " ( Ro'i , Muslim Eurasia ) .
The PIR split in I992 over the issue of relations with Yeltsin and his project of Russian democracy , with the Jamall faction aligning with radical Islamists and Wahhabis in the Middle East and with the domestic opposition to Yeltsin , in the form of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation ( CPRF ) under Gennady Zyuganov and the rightist " Patriots " under Alexander Prokhanov .
( Leonid Berres , " The Wahhabis are Ready to Make an Alliance with Maka­shov and Ilyukhin , " Kommersant , July 24 , 1999 ) .
Both men were as­sociates of Jamal from his time in Pamyat ' , and both also associated with the other major Traditionalist in Russia , Dugin .
And Jamal 's relations in the Middle East were with men such as Hasan al ­Turabi , the leader of the Sudanese Islamic Front and according to Michael Asher in his book about the Sudanes Mahdi , at least one of the em­inence grise behind Osama bin Laden .
( Asher , Khartoum , 2005 ) .
The PIR as Jamal 's institutional framework was replaced by the Islamic Committee of Russia - a network of such Islamic Committees was established under al­ Turabi 's guidance at a conference in Khartoum in I993 in order to unite the leaders of various radical Islamist movements such as Turabi's own National Islamic Front , Hamas in Palestine , and the Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Jamal be­came leader of the Moscow branch of this Islamic Committee .
In a 1999 interview he spoke of contacts with the Hezbollah , Hamas , the Wolves of Islam ( a Chechen group ) , and the Afghan Taliban .
( Berres , " The Wahhabis . " )
According to Walid Pharis it was during the above meeting in Khartoum that the decision was made from now on al - Qaeda would be the “ mother ship ” of global Jihad .
Or as Pharis notes :
The central force of jihad , after the Khartoum gathering , targeted the United States head - on , both overseas and at home .
By this point al Qaeda was in charge of the world con­flict with America .
The " princes " ( or emirs ) were assigned the various battle­fields , but the " Lord " assumed the task of destroying the " greater Satan , " America .
The first wave started in 1993 on two axes :
One was in Somalia , where jihadists met U.S. Marines in Mogadishu in bloodshed .
The United States with­drew .
The same year , the blind sheikh Ahdul Rahman and Ramzi Yusuf conspired to blow up the Twin Towers in New York .
( Phares , Future Jihad , 2005 ) Finally of course a common ground between the extreme right and the Muslim world is the historical revisionism of Holocaust denial .
For example the Iranian leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , suggested that the Holocaust had been greatly exaggerated in part to undermine Islam :
There is evidence which shows that Zionists had close relations with German Nazis and exaggerated statistics on Jewish killings .
There is evidence on hand that a large number of non-Jewish hooligans and thugs of Eastern Europe were forced to migrate to Palestine as Jews .
The purpose was to install in the heart of the Islamic world an anti-Islamic state under the guise of supporting the victims of racism and to create a rift between the East and the West of the Islamic world .
( A. Foxman , Never Again , 2003 ) .
And the recent President of Iran , Rafsanjani ex­claimed that he was convinced that " Hitler had only killed twenty thousand Jews and not six million . " ( Foxman ) .
Rafsanjani even went so far as to raise the prospect of national suicide as part of an effort to destroy Israel , musing that the nuclear annihilation of Iran as a result of a retaliatory attack by Israel would be an acceptable price to pay to destroy half of the world 's Jewish population .
In such a conflagration , only a small portion of the world 's Muslims would perish .
( Michael A. Ledeen , The War against the Terror Masters , New York : St. Martin's , 2003 ) .
Abraham Foxman , believes that many Arabs are embracing Holocaust revisionism to delegitimate the state of Israel .
According to the reasoning of Holocaust revisionism , the trag­edy was deliberately exaggerated in order to generate global sympathy for Jews and support for the creation of the Jewish state .
Furthermore , it has been used to " extort " billions of dollars from the West and demoralize Aryans and the West " so that Jews could more easily control the world . "
( Foxman , Never Again ? ) .
David Duke has been in the forefront of efforts to reach out to the Islamic world .
In the fall of 2002 , when he presented two lectures in Bahrain titled " The Global Struggle against Zionism " and " Israeli Involvement in September 11 . "
And in an article published in the Arab News , a Saudi Arabian English daily newspaper , Duke repeated his assertion that Israel had assisted the terrorists in the 9/11 attack .
Duke ’s take on religion by the way , include things like “ the Anti-Christ ” , and “ Satanic - Christianity ” : T he truth is there is no such thing as Judeo - Christianity .
That would be saying Satanic - Christianity .
The religion now called Judaism did not even come formally into existence until six hundred years after Jesus Christ .
It began with the codification of the Babylon Talmud .
Interestingly enough , Islam is much closer to Christianity than Judaism .
For instance , Judaism condemns the Virgin Mary as a prostitute and viciously condemns Jesus as an evil sorcerer and a bastard .
In stark contrast , although Islam certainly does not share all the Christian views of Jesus Christ , it views Christ as the true prophet of God , virgin - born , and that God resurrected Jesus from the dead .
Ironically , the chief religious book of Islam , the Qur'an , actually defends Jesus Christ from the obscene slanders made against Him in the Jewish Talmud .
( " Evangelicals Who Serve the Anti-Christ ! " January 25 , 2003 ) .
More recently , in September 2005 , Duke received a doctorate in his­tory from the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management - a major private university system in the Ukraine .
And in November 2005 , he traveled to Syria , where he held a news conference .
Duke is not the only right - winger to draw parallels between Christianity and Islam .
For example , Bill Baker , former chairman of the Populist Party , gave a lecture titled " Reviving the Islamic Spirit . "
( Gil Francisco White , " Islamist - Nazi Alliance Reborn on Campus ? " The Daily Pennsylvanian , November 5 , 2003 ) .
From the above we have also seen that just as Islamists and the ( extreme ) new right are beginning to find common ground , the gap between the far left and the far right have been narrowing as well .
Both movements often decry globalization .
Increasingly , they both share a criticism of Israeli policy toward Palestinians .
A case in point is the case of Rachel Corrie , an attractive twenty - three - year - o1d American student at Evergreen State College in Olympia , Washington , and a member of the International Solidarity Movement , who took a semester off to work as a peace activist in Gaza .
While there , she took part in a protest in which an Israel driver using a bull­dozer was preparing to knock down a Palestinian 's house .
Corrie stood between the bulldozer and the house and refused to move .
However , the Israel driver ran over her , and she sustained injuries from which she ultimately died .
Despite Corrie 's presumably left - leaning political orientation , various right - wing publications and websites eulogized her as an Aryan martyr .
What is more , the antig10 ba1ization rhetoric of the contemporary extreme right could conceivably make its agenda more palatable to the far left , which also champions a similar platform , including radical environmentalism and animal rights .
In fact , in 2002 , the National Alliance created a front group , the Anti-Globalism Action Network ( AGAN ) , to capitalize on the left 's opposition to globa1ist organiza­tions such as the World Bank , G8 , and the International Monetary Fund and sent it to Kananaskis , Canada , to protest a G8 meeting .
AGAN added an anti­Semitic twist to the traditional left - wing conspiracy narrative .
( Center for New Community , “ CNC Uncovers Neo -Nazis Masquerading as Anti­Globalization Acrivists , ” June 21 , 2002 ) .
And extreme right stalwarts , such as Louis Beam , the chief pro
Retailers are denying accusations from a major consumer group that they sabotaged the GroceryChoice project .
Consumer group Choice lashed out at the Australian National Retailers Association this morning for undermining the GroceryChoice website .
Choice 's chief executive , Nick Stace , told a Senate hearing into the scrapping of the website that the association which represents the major supermarkets sabotaged the project .
Choice had taken over running the website when the Federal Government dumped the project in June , but Mr Stace says the Australian National Retailers Association stopped individual supermarkets from co-operating , and that stymied the project .
" They sabotaged , and you know I think there 's an anti-democratic kind of strain that 's running through that , because it was an election commitment on a popularly elected government and I think its pretty anti-democratic for a body like ANRA and the supermarkets to block progress in that way , " he told the hearing .
" It 's certainly anti-competitive bearing in mind that this would have added an important tool for consumers to compare prices . "
Competition law expert , Associate Professor Frank Zumbo from the University of NSW , agrees that the project was undermined by the major retailers , and says it would be easy for them to provide consumers with pricing information .
" Coles and Woolworths have sophisticated information systems to keep track of every product they sell .
They have the technology to provide customers with timely and up to date pricing information on all their products , " he wrote in a statement on the issue .
" So , if Coles and Woolworths were serious about customer service they would launch their own websites giving consumers ' real time ' pricing information for every product in every store .
Customers could then go online to check prices for themselves at any time . "
Allegations denied
However , the Australian National Retailers Association denies scuttling the GroceryChoice project , and its chief executive Margy Osmond says there were many hurdles to implementing the scheme .
" Much of the information that was being requested was simply not possible to be supplied , " she told ABC News Online .
" The large retailers do n't actually have standardised prices across the country , they have an extremely flexible approach which allows consumers to get the best deals in many parts of Australia . "
Margy Osmond says ANRA is only a representative body and could not have instructed its members to hinder the project .
Instead she lays much of the blame for website 's failure with Choice .
" We were very happy to be in discussions with Choice , and we were very keen to see the exercise progress , but we simply could n't get the information and the assurances from Choice that would make that possible , " she said .
" Our members are interested in anything that 's good for consumers and good for transparency in the marketplace .
We have been in discussions with the Minister , and we 'll continue to be in discussions with the Government about what we can do in that space . "
Professor Zumbo says the Government should not abandon the idea of grocery prices being available on the internet .
" If Coles and Woolworths fail to provide customers with real time pricing information , then the Federal Government should move to require Coles and Woolworths to do so , " Professor Zumbo concluded .
Additional $ 4 million
Treasury officials say the Government might have to pay consumer organisation Choice an additional $ 4 million for axing the Grocery Choice website .
The Government announced in June that it was scrapping the website after it had already spent $ 8 million on it .
Treasury officials have told today 's committee hearing they expect the Government 's remaining liability to be less than $ 4 million .
Coalition Senator Guy Barnett has expressed concerns that the Government 's tight deadline for setting up Grocery Choice meant the cheapest tender was not accepted .
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has told a Senate inquiry that the Informed Sources group offered to collect grocery information for $ 2.7 million less than the offer that the ACCC accepted .
They told the inquiry they had concerns about whether Informed Sources could collect the data and did not have enough time to check , because the Government wanted the website set up in six weeks .
Liberal Senator Guy Barnett says pressure from the Government led them to take a more expensive option .
NIRSpec Instrument Engineering Test Unit model is completed
14 October 2009
The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is a large ( 6.5 m ) , cold ( < 50 K ) , infrared - optimised telescope designed to address a number of key topics in modern astronomy , which include identifying the first stars and galaxies and , studying how they have evolved .
When launched in 2014 JWST will carry a suite of four scientific instruments including NIRSpec - an innovative multi-object spectrograph designed to obtain spectra of up to 100 objects simultaneously .
NIRSpec 's multi-object capability combined with the sensitivity of the JWST telescope will be essential for determining the age , chemical composition and distances of faint galaxies .
These measurements are key to unravelling the history of galaxy formation in the early Universe – one of the primary science goals of the JWST mission .
The NIRSpec Engineering Test Unit ( ETU ) model realistically replicates the thermal , mechanical , electrical and optical characteristics ( up to the micro - shutter array ) of the real flight model instrument .
This ETU has been subject to an extensive series of tests at the Astrium and IABG facilities in Munich , Germany .
These tests included vibration tests at room temperature , thermal vacuum and optical performance tests at cryogenic temperatures , and electromagnetic characterisation tests at room and cryogenic temperatures .
At the end of this test campaign the flight model representative Collimator and Camera optical systems , built from SiC - the material that will be used for the flight elements - were removed and replaced by dummy masses .
The ETU will be shipped , later this year , to NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Centre for pre-integration testing with the Integrated Science Instrument Module ( ISIM ) , a key element of the JWST observatory which houses the four science instruments ( NIRSpec , NIRCam , MIRI , and TFI ) , the associated electronics , and other components .
Progress on the NIRSpec flight model
In the meantime the NIRSpec flight model optical bench is beginning to take shape with integration and alignment activities for several flight model subsystems underway at Astrium since January this year .
A comprehensive test campaign for the complete flight model will begin mid-2010 .
In early 2011 the complete NIRSpec flight model is scheduled to be delivered to NASA for integration with the flight model ISIM .
Elements of the observatory begin to take shape
This year has seen a number of key elements of the JWST observatory pass significant milestones :
September 2009 : The flight model of the ISIM is delivered to GSFC for testing
July 2009 : The JWST spacecraft passes its Preliminary Design Review
April 2009 : The first of 18 flight mirrors completes cryogenic testing
March 2009 : The sunshield passes the Preliminary Design Review and moves to the detailed design phase
February 2009 : Construction of the telescope backplane begins
JWST and NIRSpec
The JWST observatory is a joint project of NASA , ESA and the Canadian Space Agency .
It is scheduled to launch in 2014 and will carry four scientific instruments : NIRSpec ( a near - infrared spectrograph ) , NIRCam ( a near - infrared camera ) , MIRI ( a mid-infrared camera and spectrograph ) and TFI ( a tunable filter imager ) .
NIRSpec will be the principal spectrographic instrument on board the observatory .
It is built by European industry to ESA 's specifications and managed by the ESA JWST Project at ESTEC , the Netherlands .
The prime contractor is EADS Astrium GmbH in Ottobrunn , Germany .
The NIRSpec detector and Multi-Shutter Array subsystems are provided by NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center .

Podcast Transcription
Steve : Welcome to Science Talk , the weekly podcast of Scientific American posted on October 23rd , 2009 .
I 'm Steve Mirsky .
In this episode , we 'll talk human evolution with renowned anthropologist and Neandertal expert Chris Stringer and with Scientific American editor Kate Wong , coauthor of the new book Lucy 's Legacy : The Quest for Human Origins .
First up , Chris Stringer .
He is a fellow of the Royal Society and holds the title of research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum in London .
His most recent book is Homo Britannicus : The Incredible Story of Human Life in Britain and that 's the first subject of our conversation .
Stringer : Obviously there was an old view that when people got into Britain half a million years ago , they were always here right through to the present .
And we now know that 's completely wrong ; [ that ] actually what happened about every hundred thousand years , when there was the peak of an ice age , Britain got cleaned out of people entirely and then had to be recolonized all over again .
[ And ] remarkably , 125,000 years ago , when Britain seemed to be an island perhaps strongly for the first time , nobody got back .
So you had a warm period with hippos and elephants and tons of [ stuff for people to eat ] and no one was there , and the Neandertals did not have boats and they could n't get across the English channel .
Steve : Wow !
Stringer :
So for 100,000 years , Britain had no people on it even when the climate would have allowed it .
Eventually , the Neandertals made it back , when sea level fell again .
So you 've got these episodes of human appearance and then people just disappear .
People were only in Britain might be for 20 percent of the time in the last 700,000 years , which is incredible , you know , [ for ] the old idea of continuity of occupation .
Steve :
And by people you are including all Homo species .
Stringer : Yeah , so we think now obviously there 's the species identified from Southern Europe Homo antecessor , pioneer man , that the Spanish have identified at Atapuerca , and probably that could have been the first species into Britain moving up from Southern Europe in [ warm ] stages .
Then we think we have Homo heidelbergensis , such as a[t ] Boxgrove .
Then later on the Neandertals , so from about 400,000 on which whenever people were in Britain for 300,000 years , it 's Neandertals , evolving Neandertals .
And the Neandertals were in Britain until about 35,000 years ago and then at 30,000 years ago we become modern people as a ceremonial burial at Paviland of Cro-Magnons and it was in fact probably the first one ever found , and it was dug up in about 1822 , and because they had no concept then of what it was , it was thought to be perhaps a prostitute servicing the Roman army because this individual had red ochre powder on them and ivory jewelry .
So they thought it was a woman .
In fact it was a man , so it was nicknamed , it was called the " Red Lady of Paviland " .
In fact , you know , it 's a man .
We have learnt quite a lot since 1822 .
And that 's a [ burial that 's over ] 30,000 years old .
Then those modern people were in Britain , even they could n't survive the peak of the last ice age .
So about 20,000 years ago , the last ice age reaches its peak , even those people , the moderns , can't survive and Britain has to be recolonized [ all ] over again after the peak of the last ice age , so it is an amazing story .
Steve :
You mentioned evolving Neandertals ; so what you are implying there is , the Neandertals of 300,000 years ago were different from the Neandertals that were the last ones to be there 35,000 years ago .
Stringer : Yes certainly .
We contract the evolution of the Neandertals and [ obviously ] people use the term differently , so different people use different ways of defining what is a Neandertal .
For me , the Neandertal lineage , we can see it 's beginnings at Swanscombe in Kent at 400,000 years , and at Atapuerca , where there is this pit of bones full of the remains of fossils .
That 's the transition between Homo heidelbergensis and Neandertals .
They show [ a mixture of ] features of the two species .
So I think the Neandertals are beginning certainly by about 400,000 years ago , then they gradually evolve to the final Neandertals , the ones we know best from Europe in the last ice age .
And so the brain size increases , they develop more specialized body shape , the technology , [ of course , ] changes as well .
So the Neandertals are evolving through time in parallel with [ our own ] lineage because there was this split , it might be around 400,000 years ago .
So Homo heidelbergensis goes in two different directions , north of the Mediterranean , it becomes Neandertals , south of the Mediterranean in Africa [ it ] becomes us .
So I see these two species drifting apart more than some sudden schism .
What happens is that the Middle East and the Sahara gradually become more powerful barriers to human movement and so the former wide - ranging species , heidelbergensis , gradually gets divided , so in between the Middle East with increasing severe cold , as populations get separated increasingly and then go their own way .
Steve : [ I always ] think of Neandertal as the view back , the reflection in sort of a fun house mirror .
It 's almost us , but it is very different from us at the same time .
And as a person who researches the Neandertals , what is your , kind of , instinctive reaction when you study these people ?
These are human beings .
Stringer :
Well , yes , I mean they have obviously gone through , themselves , a lot of image transformations .
So in the late 1800s and early 1900s there were no really primitive humanlike fossils that we had ; nothing from Africa of the very early stages of human evolution .
So Neandertals were pushed into that position .
So around 1900 they are being reconstructed as ape men— stooping , hairy , grasping big toes and , you know , we know they are not like that .
They are very evolved humans , their brains was big as ours and in some cases even bigger than the modern average .
So they are actually highly evolved humans , but equally they are not the same as us and so Carlton Koons ' classic thing was , if you took a Neandertal and washed and dressed him with modern clothes , put him on the NYC subway and no one will bat an eyelid , and as I said yesterday , [ that ] probably says more about the NYC subway maybe than it says about Neandertals .
Steve : Nice .
Stringer : Because I think they would have been different .
I mean Steven Jones has made the point that , you know , again with the subway analogy , that if a Neandertal came in , if a Cro-Magnon came along and sat next to you on the London underground , you might move seats , because he [ would look ] a bit odd .
But if a Neandertal came [ and got on ] , you might change carriages .
That was so , I think they would have looked quite different .
Because in terms of time , allow in a separation .
If you think of the people that met each other in the colonization events of 200 or 300 years ago , so Europeans got to Australia and met the Aborigines , they got to the Americas and met the Native Americans .
Those populations had may be an effective separation time of , let us say 40,000 or 50,000 years with the spread of modern humans out of Africa .
When Cro-Magnons met Neandertals they were meeting groups that they have been effectively separated from may be for 300,000 years .
So you can multiply , however different we look to each other today and behave differently and cultural behavior everything , you could multiply that two or three times probably to project how different the Neandertals would have been .
And we can't imagine exactly but I think they would have , I think , would we have seen [ them as ] human ?
Yes .
I mean they walked upright , they obviously had technology and things like that , but I think they would have been more different than anything we can imagine today looking at the variation in modern people .
Steve :
You mentioned culture , now culture does not fossilize , behaviors do not fossilize .
We might have some archeological record , but it seems like the behavior armamentarium of the Neandertal was very different ; the cultural aspects of Neandertal life were very different from Homo sapiens .
And so how much of that do you think played a part in the fact that they are not here anymore versus just they are in physiology ?
Stringer : Yeah , I think obviously behavioral differences were also a big part of their story and , of course , we came out of the same sort of cultural background as the Neandertal .
So our ancestors obviously shared large bodies of behavior and technology .
And then even 100,000 years ago , if you could look just at the stone tools that modern humans are making in Africa and Israel , they are really hardly any different from what the Neandertals were doing .
But then things obviously increasingly changed , and so by the time you get to 40,000 years ago , [ in my view ] there is really quite a big gap that [ has ] developed between the modern humans and the Neandertals in terms of technology .
So when moderns come into Europe , there was a much bigger gap there then there was a 100,000 years ago between the two groups .
And I think that the reason why the Neandertals went extinct is it 's certainly not the simple thing that we thought even 10 years ago ; you know , I think , I would have said , well , yeah , moderns came in and Neandertals just very quickly just conceded , they were inferior , modern humans was superior technologically and the Neandertals just went under very quickly .
And we now know it is a more complicated story , and so I think that , we focus because the best evidence is in Europe , say 35,000 years ago that is obviously where if one focuses their attention , and it possibly was the very end of the Neandertal story .
I mean [ maybe ] they survived in pockets somewhere else , but that is where we know they survived last , so everyone focuses in on that time .
But of course , modern humans and Neandertals range much more widely than that , so when modern humans came out of Africa might be 50,000 years ago , 55,000 to 60,000 years ago , they would actually probably encountered Neandertals in Western Asia and as they moved eastwards and on to southern Asia , they may have encountered Neandertals in Uzbekistan and Siberia , so actually it probably was quite a wide - ranging process .
So as I said before the reason why Neandertals went extinct probably was not down to one single cause ; there would have been different causes at work and combination of causes in different places .
But in Western Europe , I think it was a combination of the arrival of people with superior technology and climate change so the Neandertals were doubly unlucky , because at the time modern humans came into Europe , the climate of Europe was extremely unstable .
It was fluctuating very rapidly , every few thousand years it would switch very quickly from relative warmth to deep cold .
Now they had coped with that before , by just retreating back into refugia , so they would just die out in wide areas including Britain and Northern Europe and they would retreat to the ( unclear 10:34 ) or the Mediterranean , and then when things improve [ d ] they [ 'd ] bounce back .
But 45,000 years ago there was another population [ that ] arrived and then they had to cope not only with these fluctuations but the competing population .
So [ at a ] time when the carrying capacity of the environment was crashing and it could support less people , less hunter - gatherers , suddenly there was another lot of people there .
So I think , it exacerbated the problems and by 30,000 years ago — I mean , modern humans would have been impacted by these severe changes too , and their populations crashed as well , but somehow we got through it and the Neandertals did not .
So I think it was that combination in Western Europe that did [ it ] for them , and if they [ had ] had a stable climate situation [ may ] be they would have partitioned the environment , the two species , and somehow both could have survived even until today , but that combination did [ it ] for the Neandertals .
I think , we , even a small percent of superiority in your ability to [ deal ] with cold , so we [ know ] modern humans had needles ; they probably had sewn clothing , whereas Neandertals probably fastened their clothing together .
If you can sew your clothing , you could make much better insulating clothing , much better tent structures to shelter .
Modern humans had much more complex technology , I mean , you can compare Neandertal technology , it was very good at what did .
Imagine a knife and fork they are really good at their jobs , but with modern humans you ['ve ] got like the equivalent of a whole tool box with spanners and pulleys and weaving and high temperature firing for even making clay statue[ ttes ] ; all of that technology I think , just takes moderns that bit further than Neandertals .
Steve :
All the geneticists , I know of who study this think that there is no genetic evidence for interbreeding between Neandertals and modern Homo sapiens , and from your point of view [ does ] that sound like a reasonable stance ?
Stringer :
Well , it is certainly , it a stance that I have argued for a long time , but on the other hand , to be fair to the geneticists there are some who , I mean , Henry Harpending has just published a book called , I do n't know , The Last 10,000 years of Human Evolution [ or something like that ] , where he argues that in fact Neandertals did contribute , and he is a distinguished geneticist .
So there are still some geneticists who argue somewhere there will be some surviv[ing ]
Neandertal genes but yes , I am with Svante Pääbo if you like on the conclusion at the moment , the evidence for interbreeding is very thin , it is minimal .
But that is not to say it did not happen .
So if we look [ at ] us and Neandertals , as we have said , I think they would have been quite different to modern humans in many ways .
But on the other hand , human behavior — say the vagaries of human behavior — imagine that these things could happen sometimes and genetically these populations are very close .
I mean even a separation time of 400,000 or 500,000 years , Neandertals were closer to us than even some groups of chimpanzees are genetically , you know , chimpanzees ' species have been diverging from more than a million years and zebras and horses for example , have been separated for more than [ a ] million years , yet they can still hybridize .
So for Neandertals [ and ] modern humans could be probably possible , but I think that for the populations , it probably was not something that was common both for physical differences and social reasons .
So you got to think that , you know , you could have perhaps hybrids being created , but if those hybrids do not breed back into the parent populations , because they look a bit different to normal , their combination [ of ] features , those genes will never penetrate the parent populations .
Steve :
And that 's , there are two different issues :
Whether or not there was intermixing , that could have happened without a genetic legacy being passed on but ...
Stringer : Yeah , there could be contact , but ...
Steve :
What we are talking about is , are their individuals alive today who carry Neandertal genes — did that lineage survive ?
Whether or not , you know , some Neandertal guy and Homo sapiens woman got together without leaving progeny — we can never know .
Stringer :
Well , yes .
I mean , you are right to separate those issues and there are some people who , my good friend , Erik Trinkaus , for example , thinks he can see in the early modern record , evidence of some Neandertal features showing up in odd places in the fossil record of the Cro-Magnons ; and he says that 's evidence of a phase of interbreeding .
And then I would say , " Well , okay those might be rare events , [ but ] it can't be too rare if they are showing [ up in ] fossils . "
I do n't agree with the interpretation , I have to say , with Erik .
I do n't think necessarily these features are coming from Neandertals .
They are probably the variation of modern humans and some of them are archaic features that could be retained from ancestors in Africa .
They do n't have to come from Neandertals , so that 's one issue .
But even allowing that there could be such hybrids and that there was a low level of contact as I had mentioned there were huge populations crashes in Europe around the peak of the last ice age .
Some people estimate may be 75 or 90 percent of Europeans died out at the peak of the last ice age as we retreated to refug[ia ] .
So imagine a small bit of Neandertal DNA in those populations before the maximum and then you lose most of those people — you could easily lose [ a little ]
Neandertal contribution in such a population crash .
So even if a little bit was there before then it does n't get through and the genome work so far suggests that even that little bit is not there , at least in these Neandertals as far as we can tell from Pääbo 's announcement so far .
He does not see evidence .
This is a female Neandertal from India that gives most of the genome data , that 's in a sense you would expect the female Neandertals to be showing signs of interbreeding more probably than the males do , if it is an asymmetric pattern .
[ It 's dangerous to ] make modern metaphors but if you look at colonial metaphors , when European travelers went to the Americas and to Australia , the gene flow tended to be more into the native groups than the other way around .
So by analogy of that we would expect the female Neandertal to be the most likely price to be looking for signs of gene flow , and it does not seem to be there so far .
But you never know , and I think we will agree that you need more samples ; you can't base this on just a small sample — we need more Neandertals and obviously [ Svante is ] working on enlarging the sample .
What 's incredible is that even in the Neandertal sample we have got , for some reason these Vendia remains , some of them , have many times better preservation of DNA than other specimens , and no one can say why that is .
It 's just chance events — even on the same bone , if you drill into some places you will find huge differences in the amount of DNA .
So basically he has got to just spread his net as widely as possibly and then try and pick up these chance remarkable preservations .
And , of course , we really need to have DNA from Neandertals over in Siberia .
More of that we know they seemed to get that far , so what were they like compared with the ones in Western Europe .
Hopefully , eventually there 'll be a whole genome data from those , and although unfortunately because of preservation conditions we are unlikely to get good DNA from tropical / subtropical Africa where our species originated , nevertheless , possibly in high - altitude caves in North Africa and South Africa there might be better DNA survival and certainly in places like China and Siberia , Mongolia , there are human fossils , there are like archaic people in China comparable to the Neandertals , those will be good candidates to look for ancient DNA as well and that would be very exciting because then we have got whole different bit possibly of the human lineage with DNA .
And then there is the Hobbit , of course , in Flores , whatever that is , the conditions there are poor for DNA preservation but it would be absolutely remarkable if DNA can be recovered from Homo floresiensis because that could be an even older branch of the human tree .
Steve :
This is a really remarkable times to be a Neandertal researcher .
Stringer : Absolutely , yeah .
I mean , I would say the whole last 30 years have been remarkable times because so many new techniques have come online : dating , CT studies , the synchrotron , allowing us to look [ at ] individual growth lines in Neandertal teeth , ... the ability to date things with much greater precision , and then DNA — and , you know , I was in Svante Pääbo 's press conference in London in 1997 when [ he ] announced the first mitochondrial DNA and I went on record saying it was the equivalent in paleontology if landing something or landing on Mars and who could have imagined 10 years later we talk about the whole genome ; it 's incredible .
Steve : Kate Wong is Scientific American 's go to person on human evolution .
She is also the coauthor of the new book Lucy 's Legacy : The Quest for Human Origins with the discoverer of the world famous Australopithecus skeleton known as Lucy , Donald Johanson .
The title is Lucy 's Legacy .
What is Lucy 's legacy ?
Wong :
It means a number of things .
First of all , when Johanson and Tom Gray discovered Lucy in 1974 , it prompted a decades long search for more information about her species , Australopithecus afarensis , that continues to this day and since then our researchers have unearthed an enormous amount of information about who Lucy was , who her species was , where it lived , how it behaved ; and so that 's one aspect of Lucy 's legacy .
Steve : Because we now have something like 360 specimens of afarensis .
Wong : Yeah , at last count there are 365 individuals represented by the fossils that have been collected of the species .
Many of them are very fragmentary but others are more complete , such as Lucy , and then there are of course there are other individuals that are represented by largely complete skulls and other material , as well .
Steve :
You know , we should probably back up because we both live in a world where there was n't Lucy and then there was Lucy .
You were a little kid but ...
Wong : ... I was just born .
Steve : Alright , so look , I mean take it back — I live in a world where there was n't Lucy and then there was Lucy .
But , you know , a lot of people listening have grown up where there was always the Lucy fossil , it 's the most famous human ancestor fossil in the world .
Wong :
It is and that 's partially because she is so complete and then she also — when she was discovered , answered a longstanding question about human evolution , which was , " Which of the two of our most salient features , upright walking or large brains , came first ? "
And Lucy showed without a doubt that upright walking preceded the evolution of large brain size .
Steve :
So before Lucy it just was n't clear which came first , the upright walking or the big brain , and Lucy decided it definitively .
Wong :
That 's right .
She decided it definitively because it 's absolutely clear from her pelvis and other features that she walked upright on two legs just like we do and yet her brain is no larger than a chimpanzee 's brain .
Steve : 3.2 million years ago ?
Wong : Yes , Lucy is 3.2 million years old , although her species has been found spanning a period of about 500,000 years .
Steve :
The subtitle of the book Lucy 's Legacy is The Quest for Human Origins and the book is as much a scientific evocation as it is sort of an adventure story .
Wong : Yeah , what we did in the book is to both recount what Johanson and his colleagues have been doing at Hadar — and the work still continues there — since 1990 , you know , unearthing [ clues ] about Lucy 's species ; but then , of course , when Lucy was found and analyzed she instantly begged the question of , " Well what came before her ? "
And although she was among the oldest hominids known when she was discovered , there are now putative human ancestors dating back as far as seven million years ago .
Steve :
Do chimps and humans have those as a common ancestor then ?
Wong :
No , those are not the remains so far as we know of the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans but they get that pretty close to where we think that last common ancestor was .
Steve :
You know , there is the traveling exhibit where the actual fossil remains of Lucy are going around the country and that 's in New York for the next couple of weeks , and I actually went to see it Friday night and it's an amazing thing to see because those are really her bones , you know , and she is small .
People might not realize how little Australopithecus afarensis is .
She was what , about three feet tall ?
Wong :
Yeah , probably about a meter tall but also probably fairly muscular .
Steve :
But she also kind of filled me with pity , actually , just to think about her actual life and how difficult it must have been .
There is this little , sort of , human just with nothing that we take for granted everyday — no clothing , no fire , no walk to the supermarket to get any food , I mean , every minute must have just been a hardship to live through , and that 's where we all come from .
We come from the survivors of all those hardships .
So Lucy 's legacy , I mean , we are Lucy 's legacy .
Wong :
We are Lucy 's legacy .
You know , Lucy is believed to be ancestral to all of the later Australopithecines species and also our own genus Homo which includes everything from us to Neandertals , to the little Hobbits of Flores and , you know , we cover all of this in the book , and it 's just incredible to see how much new information about all of Lucy 's descendants has been uncovered in the past couple of decades , truly an astonishing period for paleoanthropology .
Steve :
So how did you actually come to be to Johanson 's coauthor on the book ?
Wong :
Well , he and his agent were familiar with my work at Scientific American , where I have contributed a number of articles on human evolution and they approached me and asked me if I would be interested in collaborating on the project .
Steve :
There is a story in the book about him going back to Ethiopia after many years — the political climate there made it impossible for Johanson to do any field work in Ethiopia for a while — and when he got back and announced to the customs official that he was the discoverer of Lucy , that was like a really big deal .
So Lucy is a huge deal in Ethiopia where she was discovered .
Wong : Absolutely .
Ethiopians really have a huge appreciation of this incredible fossil that comes from their country .
And it 's not just Lucy , of course ; there have been a number of really important discoveries of human fossils in Ethiopia , the most recent of which — the most recently described of which — is of course the Ardipithecus fossil that was unveiled last week .
Steve :
And what 's the big deal about that fossil ?
Wong : Well , Ardipithecus comes from a slice of time in human evolution that was very poorly understood .
I alluded earlier to some putative hominin remains dating back as far as seven million years but those were only known from a skull in one case and some teeth and limb bones in another case , and Ardipithecus is a partial skeleton with many , many , many bones preserved .
Actually there are approximately 36 individuals represented by all of the Ardipithecus finds but the main find is a largely complete skeleton .
What 's really interesting about Ardipithecus is just how much more primitive it is than Lucy and other Australopithecine fossils .
It is clear from the pelvis that Ardipithecus was capable of walking around upright but it also has a number of primitive features that indicate that it climbed on the trees , as well .
Steve :
So the Ardipithecus — the way it moved is really interesting and there are some other aspects that we know about its behavior based on its physiology ; well not physiology but anatomy .
Wong : Yes , apparently Ardipithecus had small canine teeth .
It 's interesting because it gives us a potential insight into the behavior of the species , and that 's because in chimps and gorillas , for example , the males have these large , slashing , daggerlike canines , and they use them both for fighting and in aggression displays when they are competing for females .
Ardipithecus however — the males and the females have pretty similar canines , and they are small .
There was n't as much sexual dimorphism in Ardipithecus , which is to say there were fewer differences between males and females .
This was reflected not only in the teeth but also in the body size .
Males and females of Ardipithecus seemed to have overlapped a lot in body size , and what this suggests is that females were not selecting the biggest , most - aggressive males to [ mate ] with .
One of the points that is underscored by the Ardipithecus discovery is that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees did not look particularly like a chimpanzee , which is what some paleoanthropologists had speculated .
The researchers who described Ardipithecus argue that their discovery strongly implies that humans never went through a knuckle - walking phase over the course of evolution which is something that paleoanthropologists have been debating for a quite sometime .
Steve :
So in your lifetime there is Lucy , there is Ardipithecus , there is the Hobbit , which we were calling , what 's the official Latin name again for the Hobbit ?
Wong : Homo floresiensis .
Steve : Because it is from the tiny island of Flores .
So the world of paleoanthropology , the search for human fossil remains — it is like harder than ever right now .
Wong :
It is a really exciting time to be covering this field , especially with the discovery of the so - called Hobbits from Flores , the island of Flores and Indonesia .
This is a find that really changes a lot of what paleoanthropologists thought they knew about human evolution and it ['s ] shake - ups like these that are the really thrilling things to cover as a journalist and , in fact , in the November issue , I have an article that talks about some of the most recent discoveries that have [ been ] made about the Hobbits since they were first analyzed in 2004 .

Now it 's time to play TOTALLY ....... Y BOGUS .
Here are four science stories , but only three are true .
See if you know which story is TOTALL ....... Y BOGUS .
Story number 1 : Catnip chemicals discourage flies that annoy cows .
Story number 2 : A home run by Yankee first baseman , Mark Teixeira in the first round of the play offs against the Twins left the ballpark in just 2.88 seconds , making it the fastest homer of the year .
Story number 3 : Our biggest defense against fungal infections appears to be our ability to move which limits spores ' ability to gain a foothold , or whatever kind of hold a footless [ spore ] gets .
And story number 4 : Election outcomes affect men's testosterone levels .
We 'll be back with the answer , but first , I want to thank all the listeners who wrote in about last week 's episode .
We had mentioned a century - old Scientific American item suggesting that images be put on the walls of subway lines so that the effect for the rider would be movies to watch .
Numerous people wrote into point out that such images actually do exist today in subway lines around the world ; they are mostly ads but they are fun .
Check out the comments on the October 14th podcast .
You will find links to see the videos .
You can find the October 14th Science Talk page at www.SciAm.com/podcast
Time is up .
Story number 1 is true .
USDA scientists have identified two chemical compounds found in catnip that stable flies really hate .
The compounds stops most flies from biting cattle and also keeps most females from laying eggs .
It 's estimated that stable flies [ cost ] the U.S. cattle industry two billion dollars annually in reduced milk yield and other production losses .
The research will appear in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Medical and Veterinary Entomology .
Story number 2 is true .
Teixeira 's 2.88 - second homer went out faster than any other of the over 5,000 major league home runs of 2009 .
That 's according to the Web site www.hittrackeronline.com.
If you are a baseball fan do not go to that Web site , because you will be there for the rest of the day .
Story number 4 is true .
Election outcomes did affect men's testosterone levels according to research done last fall .
A study of 163 college - aged men found that Obama voters maintained stable testosterone levels while McCain voters saw their levels drop after the results were announced .
For more information check out the October 23rd article on our Web site called " Jock the Vote : Election Outcomes Affect Testosterone Levels in Men " .
All of which means that story number 3 about locomotion being the biggest reason we avoid most fungal infections is TOTALL ....... Y BOGUS .
Because a new study finds that it's our body temperature that keeps us from being widely colonized by fungi .
Most fungi do quite well up to about 86 degrees but survivors dropped 6 percent for every additional degree , so just being at 98.6 degrees renders most fungal species , well , dead .
The study appears in the Journal of Infectious Diseases .

No Deaths From Vitamins or Minerals
Poison Control Statistics Prove Supplements ' Safety ( OMNS , October 14 , 2009 )
There was not even one death caused by a vitamin or dietary mineral in 2007 , according to the most recent statistics available from the U.S. National Poison Data System .
The 132 - page annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers published in the journal Clinical Toxicology shows zero deaths from multiple vitamins ; zero deaths from any of the B vitamins ; zero deaths from vitamins A , C , D , or E ; and zero deaths from any other vitamin .
( 1 ) Furthermore , there were zero deaths in 2007 from any dietary mineral supplement .
This means there were no fatalities from calcium , chromium , zinc , colloidal silver , selenium , iron , or multimineral supplements .
There was one death from chronic overdose of magnesium hydroxide , commonly known as the laxative / antacid milk of magnesia , and it was inappropriately listed in the " dietary supplement " reporting category .
Nutritional supplements do not contain magnesium hydroxide .
Over half of the U.S. population takes daily nutritional supplements .
Even if each of those people took only one single tablet daily , that makes 154,000,000 individual doses per day , for a total of over 56 billion doses annually .
Since many persons take more than just one vitamin or mineral tablet , the numbers are considerably higher , and the safety of nutritional supplements is all the more remarkable .
61 poison centers provide coast - to - coast data for the U.S. National Poison Data System , which is then reviewed by 29 medical and clinical toxicologists .
In 2007 , NPDS reported 1,597 fatalities from drugs and other ingested materials .
Not one death was due to a vitamin or dietary mineral supplement .
If nutritional supplements are allegedly so " dangerous , " as the FDA and the news media so often claim , then where are the bodies ?

Phone conversation I had with my husband after I got lost for the 8,000th time …
Me : Hello ?
Victor :
Where are you ?!
You ’ve been gone an hour .
Me : I ’m lost .
Do n’t yell at me .
Victor :
You went to get milk , dude .
You ’ve been to that store a hundred times .
Me : Yes , but not at night .
Everything looks all strange and I could n’t see the signs and I guess I must ’ve taken a wrong street and I ’ve been driving aimlessly hoping for something to look familiar .
Victor :
How can you get lost every damn time you leave the house ?
Me : I do n’t even think I ’m in Texas anymore .
Victor : Motherfu-
Me : DON ’T YELL AT ME .
Victor : I ’m not yelling at you .
Just turn on the GPS and put in our address .
Me : I left it at home .
Victor :
What the hell is wrong with you ?!
Me :
You said you would n’t yell at me !
Victor :
That was before you left the Garmin at home .
I BOUGHT IT EXPRESSLY BECAUSE OF YOU .
Me : Ca n’t you just tell me how to get home ?
Victor : How am I supposed to help you get home , Jenny ?
I DON ’T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE .
Me : Okay … there are a lot of trees .
And bushes .
Or they might be horses .
It ’s too dark to tell .
Victor :
Oh yeah , I know exactly where you are .
Me : Really ?
Victor : No .
You ’re someplace where there may or may not be bushes .
How is that helpful ?
Me : Hell .
I need to find a street sign .
Victor : You NEED to remember to put the GPS in your car .
Me : No . I ’m not using it anymore .
Victor :
Why not ?!
Me :
It ’s trying to kill me .
Victor : *
Me : Remember last week when I had to go into town and I got the driving instructions from mapquest and you made me take the GPS as a back - up but then halfway there the GPS is all “ Turn left now ” and I ’m all “ No. Mapquest says to go straight ” and it ’s like “ TURN LEFT NOW ” and I ’m all “ No way , bitch ” and then she ’s all sighing at me like she ’s frustrated and she keeps saying “ Recalculating ” in this really judgey , condescending way and then she ’s all “ TURN LEFT NOW ! ” and then I ’m all freaked out so I turn left exactly like she says and then she ’s all “ Recalculating .
Recalculating . ” and I ’m like “ I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID TO DO .
WHAT’S WITH THE TONE , WHORE ? ”
Victor :
You ’re not using the GPS because you do n’t appreciate the tone of the robot ?
Me : No , that ’s just the start .
Because then she told me to turn on West Lion street but there was no West Lion Street so I kept making illegal u-turns and finally I realized that she was mispronouncing Wesley - Ann Street .
Probably on purpose .
Victor : It ’s “ Weslayan Street ” .
You still have n’t seen a street sign ?
Me : Oh. Sorry .
I kind of forgot I was driving .
Victor :
You forgot you were driving while you were driving ?
Me :
It ’s not like I ran into a cow .
I just forgot I was looking for signs .
Victor :
If you ever make it home I ’m hiding your car keys .
Me : Anyway , then I ’m all “ Okay , one of us is mispronouncing ‘ Wesley - Ann ’ and one of us is lost and I think they both might be me ” but that ’s when I came up with what might be the greatest invention in the history of the world .
Victor : Street signs .
Look for street signs .
Me : Have n’t seen any .
Feels like I ’m on a highway now .
Ask me what my great idea is .
Victor : No .
Me : GPS for Stupid People .
Victor : *
Me : I ’m totally serious .
Because I ’m no good with directions but I ’m really good with landmarks so if you tell me to go “ North on Main ” I ’m fucked but if you say “ Turn at that Burger King that burned down last year ” I totally know what to do so we should build a GPS system that does that .
Victor : * sigh *
Me :
And here ’s the genius part : we make it able to learn so it adapts to you personally .
So like if I say “ Huh .
There ’s a homeless guy masturbating ” it ’ll put that in it ’s data - banks and then when I want to go somewhere later , instead of just naming random streets it ’s all “ You know where that homeless guy was masturbating ?
We ’re going there .
Turn left at that Sonic you like .
Turn right at the burrito place you took Sarah to that time she was dressed all slutty .
Yield at the place you gave that guy a hand job . ”
Victor :
What the fuck ?!
Me : Exactly .
See that ’s the downfall of this system because really I just gave a guy a hand by telling him how to get a job .
But robots do n’t get the subtle intricacies of human languages so there ’d be a learning curve .
We ’d have to put that in the brochure .
Like a disclaimer .
Victor :
How long do you have to be missing before I can start dating again ?
Me : I ’m just saying this robot is n’t perfected yet , dude .
It ’s close though .
I would n’t use it with your mom in the car though , just in case .
OHMYGOD I TOTALLY KNOW WHERE I AM !
Victor :
You ’re at the place you gave that guy a hand - job ?
Me : No . I ’m at that abandoned building that looks like it ’s owned by Branch - Davidians .
Victor : Huh .
The rest of the world calls that “ Dallas Street “ .
So can you get home now ?
Me : I think so .
Left at that spooky bar that looks like it ’s out of Scooby - Doo , left at the place we saw that wild boar that turned out to be a dog , right at the corner where I threw up that one time .
Right ?
Victor :
You make my head hurt .
Me : DUDE , WE ARE GOING TO BE MILLIONAIRES .
Epilogue : I made it home *.
Victor duct - taped the GPS to my windshield and refused to build me a robot .
It ’s like he wants us to be poor .
* Disclaimer : By “ made it home ” I mean I got lost again and Victor had to come find me so I could follow him home .
The point is , I made it home .
And that I had no robot .
This whole post is kind of a tragedy .
Victor says he agrees but probably not for the same reasons .
Comment of the day :
My mom would so buy your landmark robot GPS .
She gives me directions to things like “ Turn left at Bobby McGillicutty ’s old house then go past that place where we gave them the dog then turn at the Thriftway and go about how long it takes to walk to Grams and then turn left and you ’ll see the house that looks like that house that I like and then one more right and you ’re there . ”
And I ’m all WHO THE FUCK IS BOBBY FUCKING MCGILLICUTTY ?
And it turns out it ’s some guy she went to kindergarten with .
Because obviously I would know that .
And that dog ?
Was easily 30 years ago .
And the Thriftway burned down in 1983 and is now an LA fitness , and whose walking are we timing here ?
So then I ’m all , lets just drink whiskey for dinner and then she ’s all “ I DON ’T EVEN KNOW WHY I TRY ” .

Woohoo !
Stand For Marriage Maine has started running this ad .
This despite the fact that Maine ’s own Attorney General published a Legal Opinion stating :
“ Whatever the benefits and burdens of the civil institution of marriage , the state ’s definition of marriage has no bearing on the curricula in our public schools , either under current law or under LD 1020 .
Neither the Parker decision nor passage of LD 1020 “ requires ” or “ allows ” the teaching of any particular subject in our schools , in answer to the citizen question attached to your letter . ”
I suppose when you ca n’t make logical arguments to support your case , you have to resort to FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty , and Doubt ) .
I just hope the independent minded citizen of Maine take the time to read the Maine AG ’s legal opinion and see this ad for the FUD that it is .

Whenever I learn a new language I always want to know how the language does its work at more than just a superficial level .
I admit that if you want to just be a casual user of a language ( or library for that matter ) , this is not really necessary , but if you want to take a step towards mastering a language this is required knowledge .
For my latest dive into Ruby , I decided to look at the the ruby installation and how we load the various libraries that we use .
The Ruby Installation
If you want to know where things live in your Ruby installation , there is an easy way to find out .
Ruby stores a lot of information about itself in a big hash ( just like environment variables ) :
Update :
As per the comments below , Config is an object provided by the RubyGems library , so you will likely need to require ‘ rubygems ’ before you will be able to use it .
Config:: CONFIG
If you get a list of keys from this hash , you can find out about all sorts of interesting info that Ruby knows about itself , but the most interesting bits are probably the following :
Config:: CONFIG [ ' bindir ']
Config:: CONFIG [' rubylibdir ']
Config:: CONFIG [' sitedir '] / Config:: CONFIG [' vendordir ']
Config:: CONFIG [ 'archdir ' ]
Feel free to explore the others though there are interesting things to find there .
bindir – this is where the ruby installation will have it ’s executables , such as the interpreter – ruby , irb , ri , rdoc etc. ( in my case C:/ruby1.8/bin )
– this is where the ruby installation will have it ’s executables , such as the interpreter – etc. ( in my case ) rubylibdir – this is where most of the Ruby standard libraries live ( in my case C:/ ruby1.8/lib/ruby /1.8 ) .
I say most because most Ruby libraries are written in Ruby as you would expect , however some are written in C and are therefore specific to the installation of Ruby ( i.e. what platform you ’re on ) , these do n’t live here but instead reside in ‘ _archdir_ ’ .
– this is where most of the Ruby standard libraries live ( in my case ) .
I say most because most Ruby libraries are written in Ruby as you would expect , however some are written in C and are therefore specific to the installation of Ruby ( i.e. what platform you ’re on ) , these do n’t live here but instead reside in ‘ _archdir_ ’ .
archdir – this is the brother of ‘ rubylibdir ’ for all native libraries that are written in C ( in my case C:/ ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32 ) .
You ’ll mostly find a bunch of C header files ( .h ) here as well as . so ( in my case ) or potentially some others ( .dll maybe ? ) .
– this is the brother of ‘ ’ for all native libraries that are written in C ( in my case ) .
You ’ll mostly find a bunch of C header files ( .h ) here as well as . so ( in my case ) or potentially some others ( .dll maybe ? ) .
sitedir / vendordir – these are actually two separate directories , but ‘ vendordir ’ is only applicable to Ruby 1.9 .
Essentially any extensions you develop yourself ( or find lying around I guess :) ) that are not gems will find a home here .
These will be similar in structure to ‘ rubylibdir ’
Ruby native stuff will go directly here but there will also be an ‘ archdir ’ equivalent for your architecture specific stuff .
My ‘ sitedir ’ was C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/ site_ruby .
But what about gems ?
Well , that brings us to how we use the various libraries in our ruby programs .
Require vs Load
Normally when we want to use a feature in our Ruby program ( be it gem or standard library ) , we would include it in our file using the require keyword , ( we are all aware that load exists , but require is what all the big boys use ) .
So what is the difference ?
Load
To load a file we use the load method :
load ‘ blah.rb ’
Note that we must supply the extension when we use it .
When Ruby encounters a load , it will read in the contents of the file you ’re trying to load .
It will do this every time .
No matter how many times you load the same feature , Ruby will read the file in every time it encounters a load .
You ’re not limited to just supplying a name and extension though , you can navigate directories e.g. :
load ‘../../blah.rb’
or even give an absolute path :
load ‘/a/b/c/blah.rb’
But how will Ruby find these files ?
How Ruby Finds Stuff
By default Ruby has a list of directories that it searches to find features you want to load – the load path .
This is stored in a special variable :
$ :
By default the load path will include the ‘ rubylibdir ’ , ‘ archdir ’ , ‘ sitedir ’ , ‘ vendordir ’ etc .
The last thing on the load path will always be the current working directory ( i.e. . – ‘ dot ’ ) , which is the directory from which you launched your application ( unless you jump directories as your program is executing ) .
The load path will not by default include anything to do with ruby gems .
So how does Ruby find anything to do with gems ?
Lets talk about require before dealing with gems .
Require
No matter how many times you require the same feature in your program , only the first time is significant .
Ruby will not re-read a file a second time , this is the first fundamental difference from how load works .
The other obvious difference is the fact that you do n’t need to supply an extension when you require a feature :
require ‘ blah ’
This allows us to treat features written in Ruby in exactly the same way as extensions written in C , Ruby is smart enough to work it out .
These are basically the two major differences between require and load .
Obviously as I mentioned , require is what most people will use day - to - day , but as long as we are aware of the differences , load can be useful too .
And by the way , just like load , you can supply a relative or absolute path to require ( as long as you leave the extension off ) .
How Ruby Finds Gem Stuff
As I mentioned the load path does not contain anything to do with gems by default .
This is due to the fact that you can have multiple versions of the same gem installed on your system ( and can actually use any of the versions you have installed ) , and so the load path is appended to ( actually it is prepended to rather than appended to ) dynamically as the program executes when you want to include a feature provided by a gem .
By default when you install gems they will go into the same place where ruby is installed , one level back from where ‘ rubylibdir ’ is , in my case ( C:\ruby1.8\lib\ruby\gems ) .
Ruby will know about this when it needs to dynamically modify the load path , this is where it will look for gems .
Ruby will not by default know that it needs to look for gems , so you will need to tell it to do so .
There are several ways of doing this :
use require ‘ rubygems ’ in your code , before you include any features from gems .
This is fine for your own code , but programs that you download that did not do this , will not work .
in your code , before you include any features from gems .
This is fine for your own code , but programs that you download that did not do this , will not work .
use – rubygems command like option when you launch your Ruby program .
command like option when you launch your Ruby program .
use the RUBYOPT environment variable ( e.g. RUBYOPT=rubygems ) .
This is probably the easiest and most painless way .
If you have this set up then when you require something from a gem , Ruby will know to search the place where your gems are and will modify the load path dynamically to include the location of the gem you want ( if there are multiple versions of the same gem , by default Ruby will use the latest version ) .
For example :
>> puts $ : C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8 C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/i386-msvcrt
C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8 C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32 . >> require ' hpricot ' >> puts $ : C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/hpricot-0.8.1-x86-mswin32/bin
C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/hpricot-0.8.1-x86-mswin32/lib
C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8 C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/i386-msvcrt
C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/site_ruby C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8 C:/ruby1.8/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mswin32 .
One final caveat to be aware of is this .
If you ca n’t install gems into the default location , you will need to tell Ruby where the gems will go ( and where to find them subsequently ) .
You do this using the GEM_HOME environment variable .
As long as you have it set , everything will still function as expected .

IT LOOKS inconsequential enough , the faint little spot moving leisurely across the sky .
The mountain - top telescope that just detected it is taking it very seriously , though .
It is an asteroid , one never seen before .
Rapid - survey telescopes discover thousands of asteroids every year , but there ’s something very particular about this one .
The telescope ’s software decides to wake several human astronomers with a text message they hoped they would never receive .
The asteroid is on a collision course with Earth .
It is the size of a skyscraper and it ’s big enough to raze a city to the ground .
Oh , and it will be here in three days .
Far - fetched it might seem , but this scenario is all too plausible .
Certainly it is realistic enough that the US air force recently brought together scientists , military officers and emergency - response officials for the first time to assess the nation ’s ability to cope , should it come to pass .
They were asked to imagine how their respective organisations would respond to a mythical asteroid called Innoculatus striking the Earth after just three days ’ warning .
The asteroid consisted of two parts : a pile of rubble 270 metres across which was destined to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa , and a 50 - metre - wide rock heading , in true Hollywood style , directly for Washington DC .
The exercise , which took place in December 2008 , exposed the chilling dangers asteroids pose .

C++版のOpenCVを使ってカラーヒストグラムを用いた類似画像検索を実験してみました。バッチ処理などのスクリプトはPythonを使ってますが、PerlでもRubyでも似たような感じでできます。
指定した画像と類似した画像を検索するシステムは類似画像検索システムと言います。GoogleやYahoo!のイメージ検索は、クエリにキーワードを入れてキーワードに関連した画像を検索しますが、類似画像検索ではクエリに画像を与えるのが特徴的です。この分野は、Content-Based Image Retrieval ( CBIR ) と呼ばれており、最新のサーベイ論文（Datta,2008）を読むと1990年代前半とけっこう昔から研究されてます。
最新の手法では、色、形状、テクスチャ、特徴点などさまざまな特徴量を用いて類似度を判定するそうですが、今回は、もっとも簡単な「色」を用いた類似画像検索を実験してみます。つまり、指定した画像に色が似ている画像を検索します。
カラーヒストグラムの計算 カラーヒストグラムとは、画像中に各色が何ピクセルあるか数えて作成した棒グラフです。画像はカラーヒストグラムで表せます。たとえば、
のカラーヒストグラムを描画すると となります。各棒は特定の色が画像中に何ピクセルあるかをカウントした値です。上のヒストグラムで突き出ているのは青色ですね！このヒストグラムの形がお互い似ているほど色が似た画像になります。カラーヒストグラムは、各ビンのY軸の値だけ保存しておけばよいので上の図の場合、64次元ベクトルで表せます。
画像の減色 今回対象とするカラー画像は赤成分 （R）、緑成分 （G）、青成分（B）は各8ビット（256通り）ですので、表示できる色数は256x256x256=16777216通りになります。これは、色数があまりにも多すぎる（ヒストグラムの棒が16777216本、16777216次元ベクトル）のでばっさり切って64色まで減色します。 減色はRGBの各成分を4等分して中央の代表値に置き換えることで行います。Rが4通り、Gが4通り、Bが4通りなので表示できる色数は4x4x4=64通りになります。オリジナル画像のRGBは減色後の代表値に置き換えます。たとえば、あるピクセルの輝度がRGB=(58 , 150 , 238 ) だったら64色RGB=( 32 , 160 , 224 ) に置き換えます。
※カラー画像の減色を改変 OpenCVを使って減色によって画像がどう変わるか試してみます。
左がオリジナルの画像で右が64色に減色した画像です。まあ64色あればそこそこ分かりますね！以下、64色減色画像を描画するOpenCVプログラムです。
#include " cv.h " # include " highgui.h " # include < cstdio > uchar decleaseColor ( int value ) { if ( value < 64 ) { return 32 ; } else if ( value < 128 ) { return 96 ; } else if ( value < 196 ) { return 160 ; } else { return 224 ; } return 0 ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { IplImage *img = cvLoadImage ( " Data / dolphin_image_0001.jpg " , CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR ) ; if ( img == NULL ) { printf ( " cannot load image
" ) ; return 1 ; } IplImage * outImage = cvCreateImage ( cvGetSize( img ) , img -> depth , 3 ) ; for ( int y = 0 ; y < img -> height ; y++ ) { uchar * pin = ( uchar *)( img->imageData + y * img->widthStep ) ; uchar * pout = ( uchar *)( outImage->imageData + y * out Image -> widthStep ) ; for ( int x = 0 ; x < img -> width ; x++ ) { int blue = pin [ 3 * x+ 0 ] ; int green = pin [ 3 * x+ 1 ] ; int red = pin [ 3 * x+ 2 ] ; pout [ 3 * x+ 0 ] = decleaseColor ( blue ) ; pout [ 3 * x+ 1 ] = decleaseColor ( green ) ; pout [ 3 * x+ 2 ] = decleaseColor ( red ) ; } } cvNamedWindow ( " Original Image " , CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE ) ; cvNamedWindow ( " Declease Color Image " , CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE ) ; cvShowImage ( " Original Image " , img ) ; cvShowImage ( " Declease Color Image " , outImage ) ; cvWaitKey ( 0 ) ; cvSaveImage ( " original.jpg " , img ) ; cvSaveImage ( " color64.jpg " , outImage ) ; cvDestroyAllWindows ( ) ; cvReleaseImage ( &img ) ; cvReleaseImage ( &outImage ) ; return 0 ; } k-Meansというクラスタリングアルゴリズムで減色するサンプルがありました。これは、今回の目的には合わないと思います。画像によって用いる64色（パレット）が異なってしまうからです。これでは、異なる画像間でカラーヒストグラムを比較できなくなってしまいます*1。
ヒストグラムの計算 ヒストグラムは各色（64色）が画像中に何ピクセルあるか数えたものです。先ほど、64色に減色したので各色に0から63番まで番号をつけてヒストグラムのビン番号とします。たとえば、ピクセルのRGB値が RGB=( 58 , 150 , 238 ) だったら減色すると( redNo, greenNo, blueNo ) =( 0,2,3)になります（下の画像を参照）。この色を0-63までのビン番号に変換するには、
redNo * 4 * 4 + greenNo * 4 + blueNo でできます。このように定義すると、( redNo, greenNo, blueNo ) = ( 0,0,0 ) の色は0番、( redNo,greenNo,blueNo ) = ( 3,3,3 ) の色は63番に割り当てられます。先ほどの(redNo,greenNo,blueNo ) = ( 0,2,3 ) は11番になりますね。 下は、オリジナル画像のRGB輝度値からヒストグラムのビン番号を求める関数です。 int rgb2 bin ( int red , int green , int blue ) { int redNo = red / 64 ; int greenNo = green / 64 ; int blueNo = blue / 64 ; return 16 * redNo + 4 * greenNo + blueNo ; } 次に、画像中の全ピクセルを走査して各色が何ピクセルあるか数えてカラーヒストグラムを作ります。OpenCVで画像をロードし、画像の各ピクセル値にアクセスして、ビン番号に変換してから数え上げています。カラーヒストグラムを作るだけなら先ほどのようにわざわざ減色画像を作る必要はありません。 int calcHistogram ( char * filename , int histogram [ 64 ] ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 64 ; i++) { histogram [ i ] = 0 ; } IplImage * img = cvLoadImage ( filename , CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR ) ; if ( img == NULL ) { cerr << " cannot open image : " << filename << endl ; return - 1 ; } for ( int y = 0 ; y < img ->height ; y++ ) { uchar * pin = ( uchar *)( img->imageData + y * img->widthStep ) ; for ( int x = 0 ; x < img -> width ; x++ ) { int blue = pin [ 3 * x+ 0 ] ; int green = pin [ 3 * x+ 1 ] ; int red = pin [ 3 * x+ 2 ] ; int bin = rgb2 bin ( red , green , blue ) ; histogram [ bin ] += 1 ; } } cvReleaseImage ( &img ) ; return 0 ; } この関数を実行す るとhistogramには各ビンのピクセル数が格納されます。カラーヒストグラムは64次元ベクトルです。histogram[0]は0番目の色のピクセル数、histogram[63]は63番目の色のピクセル数です。
このヒストグラムは、検索時にいちいち再計算していては大変なのでファイルに保存しておきます。各数値を各行に出力した64行のファイルです。 int writeHistogram ( char * filename , int histogram [ 64 ] ) { ofstream out File ( filename ) ; if ( outFile.fail ( ) ) { cerr << " cannot open file : " << filename << endl ; return - 1 ; } for ( int i = 0 ; i < 64 ; i++) { out File << histogram [ i ] << endl ; } out File.close ( ) ; return 0 ; } 以上の手続きをまとめたメイン関数です。 main.cpp
int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { int ret ; if ( argc < 2 ) { cerr << " usage : hist.exe [ image file ] [ hist file ] " << endl ; return - 1 ; } char * imageFile = argv[ 1 ] ; char * histFile = argv[ 2 ] ; cout << imageFile << " -> " << histFile ; int histogram [ 64 ] ; ret = calcHistogram( imageFile , histogram ) ; if ( ret < 0 ) { cerr << " cannot calc histogram " << endl ; return - 1 ; } ret = writeHistogram ( histFile , histogram ) ; if ( ret < 0 ) { cerr << " cannot write histogram " << endl ; return - 1 ; } cout << " ... OK " << endl ; return 0 ; } コンパイルする とexeファイルができます。（注
）OpenCVのインストールとリンカの設定が必要です。EclipseでOpenCV（2009/10/16）参照。
hist.exe dolphin_image_0001.jpg dolphin_image_0001.hst のように使います。dolphin_image_0001.hstはヒストグラムを格納するファイル名です。
カラーヒストグラムの一括計算 次は、さっき作ったカラーヒストグラムを求めるhist.exeを使って、画像からヒストグラムを一括計算します。フォルダ処理とかはC++よりPythonの方が楽なのでPythonスクリプトからhist.exeを実行するようにしました。histフォルダを作成してから実行するとcaltech101フォルダの全画像のヒストグラムファイルが作られます。ファイル名は、xxx.jpgならxxx.hstです。うちのマシンは、CPUがCore i7 8コア、メモリが3GBですが、9000枚の画像のヒストグラム変換処理に25分40秒かかりました。 import codecs import os TARGET = " caltech101 " OUTDIR = " hist " for file in os.listdir( TARGET ) : image_file = " %s/ %s " % ( TARGET , file ) hist_file = " %s/%s.hst " % ( OUTDIR , file [:- 4 ] ) os.system ( " hist.exe %s %s " % ( image_file , hist_file ) )
画像の類似度 これで全画像のカラーヒストグラムを計算してファイルへ格納できました。次は、いよいよ類似画像検索します。画像間の類似度にはSwain,1991で提案されているHistogram Intersectionを使ってみます。 Histogram Intersectionは、2つのカラーヒストグラムが与えられたときの類似度を与えます。類似度なので2つのヒストグラムが似ているほど大きな値になります。定義は単純で2つのヒストグラムをH1,H2、ヒストグラムHのi番目のビンの値をH[i]と定義すると です。min(X , Y ) はXとYの小さい方の値を返す関数です。つまり、2つのヒストグラムの対応する各ビンの値で小さい方を足し合わせていけばいいわけですね。どうしてこれでよいかは少し悩んでしまいますが・・・ヒストグラムはどこかが出っ張るとどこかが引っ込む性質があるのがミソかな？2つのヒストグラムがまったく同じ場合に最大値をとります。
ただし、ヒストグラムはピクセル数なので画像サイズが大きいほどヒストグラムが高くなってしまいます。そこで、ピクセル数によって値が変わらないように下のように正規化します。正規化するとHistogram Intersectionの値は0.0から1.0の値になります。1.0のとき2つのヒストグラムは完全に一致します。
類似画像検索 クエリとして与えた画像とその他全部の画像と
のHistogram Intersectionを計算し、類似度が高い順に上位10位を返すPythonスクリプトです。Pythonの画像処理ライブラリPIL
( Python Image Library ) を使うので別途インストールしてください。全画像のヒストグラムはあらかじめメモリにロードしておきます。メモリに載せられないと結果が返ってくるのがすごく遅くなると思います。もっと大量の画像になったらメモリに載るようにもっと高度な工夫が必要になるかも。 import codecs import os import sys from PIL import Image IMAGE_DIR = " caltech101 " HIST_DIR = " hist " def load_hist ( ) : hist = {} for file in os.listdir( HIST_DIR ) : h = [ ] print " load %s ...

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) is breaking free of the US Department of Commerce .
The many - times - amended Memorandum of Understanding between the two groups was replaced today with a new Affirmation of Commitments that gives international stakeholders more say in how ICANN oversees the worldwide domain name system ( DNS ) .
The US government has exerted control over ICANN since the nonprofit group was set up in 1998 .
Though DNS was a worldwide system , ICANN was answerable only to the Department of Commerce , and it faced significant criticism for being slow to adopt measures useful to Web browsers in other countries — non-English characters in domain names , for instance .
Under the new agreement , ICANN remains a private nonprofit , but its accountability shifts away from the Department of Commerce .
While the US government still has an oversight position , ICANN 's internal reporting will now go to reviewers selected by its own Government Advisory Committee , and foreign governments and companies should have more of a say in the process .
Previous reviews went only to the Department of Commerce .
This worried some US senators , who expressed their concerns in a letter this summer .
One of those concerns was that ICANN remain physically headquartered in the US , and ICANN has committed to doing so .
The agreement " recognizes the importance of global Internet users being able to use the Internet in their local languages and character sets , and endorses the rapid introduction of internationalized country code top level domain names ( ccTLDs ) , provided related security , stability and resiliency issues are first addressed . "
And ICANN CEO Rod Beckstrom today reaffirmed his commitment to " fully supporting different scripts and languages in domain names . "
In 2010 , Chinese and Russian characters will at last be supported in domain names .
ICANN's new agreement has attracted praise from Internet luminaries such as Vint Cerf , who helped invent the ' Net , and Google boss Eric Schmidt .
More interesting was the ( muted ) praise from EU Commissioner Viviane Reding , who called the Affirmation " an historic opening ... things are moving in the right direction . "

With no carnivorous equivalent to the Master of Wine , he is self - taught .
Nonetheless , his renowned perfect palate for tasting meat – which enables him to tell sex , age and breed ( among other things ) from a single bite of steak – was long ago snapped up by Bristol University to assist them with studies on taste and flavour of meat , and more recently by Scotch Beef .

I 've met farmers and butchers who can immediately identify the same things I can , but they do it informally , " he tells me as we sit in London 's Landmark Hotel waiting for executive chef Gary Klaner to rustle up the first few cuts .
" In any case , I want people to understand the differences in beef so they can find their favourites .
You would n't pick up any old red wine without thinking about your preferences .
Why should n't the same go for beef , which after all , tends to be the most expensive food in your shopping trolley ? "
Keen to set the record straight on one of the greatest myths about beef , Vernet has organised for our first three steaks to have differing levels of maturation .
Beef , like any food , has fashions .
The current hit , especially in London butchers , is 46 - day maturation .
A mere nine days is , in some circles , now considered so bland that you might as well chuck it in the kids ' packed lunch .
Vernet disagrees and he 's right that while its taste lingers for a shorter time than its two longer - matured equivalents , it is juicier and melts in the mouth .
" Beware of the butcher that says all his beef is matured for x number of days , " cautions Vernet .
" The reality is they should get to know the individual carcasses , checking them every day , recognising every animal is different in terms of its premium state . "
The second steak , matured for 21 days , definitely has stronger tastes – hints of mushroom and a discreet malt finish .
Vernet says he'd have it with some Chanterelles .
Meanwhile , the super - strength 46 - day steak is just that – firm and bitter , even like liver .
" I 'm getting cold sweat flavour and a sour milk aftertaste , " says Vernet .
He 's right , yet it tastes good – although I agree it's not superior to either of the others .
" Ultimately , it comes down to individual preference , " he says .
" Provided it 's good - quality well - reared beef , you can't ( as some butchers and chefs do ) say one type is categorically better than another . "
Preference itself is a loaded concept in the world of beef .
Indeed , in Vernet 's first desk job , where he was tasked with selling the abattoir 's meat to different countries , he soon learned that while the Italians , for example , favour very light flavours in their beef , people across the French border in Bordeaux – so not very far away – accept nothing less than , as Vernet puts it , " in your face flavours " .
Scotland is another good example .
" Traditionally , those on the Scottish west coast eat stronger beef .
Game is plentiful there and in days gone by , eating beef or lamb just did n't happen unless they were a casualty , which usually meant the animal was older and therefore tasted stronger .
Meanwhile , the grazing on the east coast means it 's possible to rear more animals , which is why they have a preference for milder flavours . "
In his next job , for the Meat Commission of Northern Ireland , Vernet travelled the world exploring the potential for beef sales ( which , after BSE , never took off ) .
" It was here that I learned about the Americas , " he says .
" North America , for instance , tends to favour juiciness , sweetness and the taste of fat , which comes from being used to animals fed on grain , usually natural grain like maize .
England is similarly conservative on the whole .
New Zealand , for example , loves to include the flavour of apple in their meat artificially but that would n't go down well here . "
At Bristol University , Vernet started discovering subtle effects on beef like , for instance , the fact that " stressed " meat ( an animal suffering any sort of pain or discomfort prior to being put down ) has an excessively sweet flavour and squeaks against your teeth like polystyrene .
Vernet declares it 's time to talk sex over our next three steaks .
The first has a slight metallic taste , which I learn is due to female hormones , while saltiness in the second steak points to the animal being a bull .
Both have a distinct sourness ( in a good way ) , which is typical , apparently , of younger animals , especially in the spring when they are full of hormones .
The third is quite different .
Not only are the fibres a brighter red , but there 's a milky flavour .
And when you chew , the texture is almost like the soft back of leather .
Vernet is keen to know if I like it .
Yes , it 's delicious .
He smiles , telling me the differences in colour , texture and taste are due to it being a cow bred to have babies and therefore very active .
" And critically , while the other two animals were no more than 24 months old , this was over seven years old . "
Just because an animal is older , it does n't automatically mean it will be like eating old boots .
" Some butchers boast that their beef is no older than x months old – often 26 or 36 .
But you need to know more about the context .
What 's the breed , for example ?
Pure breeds taste better younger , for example , while with cross breeds , it does n't matter so much . "
What you 're looking for in a good steak is three to four chews per mouthful , he says .
" You chew beef at the back of your mouth and if it 's too tough , you get beyond about four chews and automatically bring it forward .
That 's when you know you have a problem .
But that 's not necessarily anything to do with age . "
Our final three steaks are different breeds – Aberdeen Angus ( nice marbled meat , full of sweet dairy flavours ) , Limousine ( cattle that originally came from France and give a more delicate meat due to thinner muscle fibres ) and Charolais ( also originally from France and whose muscles deliver strong toffee flavours and a tobacco aftertaste ) .
" A lot of people wo n't touch the last two because they say they 're reared away from their natural habitat .
A worthy complaint if it were true , because it does affect taste , but they 've been in this country for over 100 years , for goodness sake , " says Vernet .
" They 've got long hair because they 've adapted to the weather .
In fact , I would never ask a butcher for a particular breed .
When I see restaurants specialising in one breed , I think why ?
Variety is the spice of life and much of what we eat is cross - bred . "
He believes that feed is more significant to the taste of the meat than breed .
" When I worked in the abattoir and the occasional animal escaped into the garlic field , you certainly knew about it once it had been slaughtered .
The smell ! "
However , the idea that animals should only be fed grass is another current trend that Vernet disagrees with .
" They need other things in winter and turnips or barley – two examples – develop sweetness and a nice marbling , which ultimately give more juiciness . "
In fact , Vernet has no time for fear of fat , pointing out that if all traces of marbling and fat are stripped from a piece of lamb and a piece of beef , it is almost impossible to tell them apart .
He admits to being miffed by what he calls " the rush for fillet " in preference to sirloin or rump .
" Sure , it 's lean and tender – it's a part of the body cows do n't use – but there 's very little flavour . "
Perhaps the biggest irony about Britain 's relationship with beef , Vernet says , is that while supermarkets ( " even the most unexpected ones " , although he wo n't say which ) are now more inclined to inform customers about the origins and circumstances of the beef they sell , many catering colleges are n't even teaching chefs about beef .
" They say it 's too expensive , so they focus on chicken instead . "
The perfect steak : Vernet 's tips
Use the right pan :
For juicy cuts , use a griddle .
For dryer steaks , use a flat pan .
If you place a juicy steak on a flat pan , the liquid will boil and ruin taste and texture .
If you put a dry steak on a griddle , you 'll make it even dryer .
If you 're not sure which category your steak fits into , ask your butcher .
Alternatively , go by the rule that the more marbling , the more juice .
Get your temperatures right : Your pan needs to be very hot .
Top chefs think nothing of heating the pan five to ten minutes before putting the steak anywhere near it .
The steak itself should ideally be room temperature .
If it 's too chilled , the meat fibres will contract together and produce a massive release of juice , potentially drying out your steak .
Cooking your meat : Steaks can be trimmed of fat before or after cooking .
The latter option adds a little more flavour .
Lightly coat the steak with oil before placing on your pan / griddle and allow the meat to cook until the desired amount of browning occurs .
Go by the rule of two - and - a - half minutes each side for rare ; 3 - 4 minutes each side for medium rare ; 4 for medium ; 5 for medium well ; and 6 for well done .
If using a griddle , rotate the steak 45 degrees while cooking for a criss - cross effect .
Bone or no bone ?
Some butchers say steaks best retain their flavour when cooked on the bone , but there 's no evidence or logic to suggest this is true .
Since butchers have to pay to dispose of bones , they may have an ulterior motive .
That said , bones are always good for stock or soup .
For all the plausible reasons a broadband supplier might block a Web site , including the desire to give preference to its own competing voice or television service , there have n't been many such crimes against " net neutrality " to justify the enormous amount of wind spent on this particular threat to human freedom .
Such worries so far have been assuaged by competition — consumers can be counted on to abandon a carrier that blocks access to services they crave .
Guess what ?
The latest panic about wireless net neutrality is already ...
Mr Micheletti became interim leader following the army - led coup on 28 June
The interim leader of Honduras says he is ready to sign a pact to end its crisis which could include the return of ousted President Manuel Zelaya .
Roberto Micheletti said the agreement would create a power - sharing government and require both sides to recognise the result of November 's presidential poll .
Mr Zelaya said the deal , which requires the approval of the Supreme Court and Congress , would be signed on Friday .
The president was forced out of the country on 28 June .
His critics said he was seeking to amend the constitution to remove the current one - term limit on serving as president , and pave the way for his re-election .
ANALYSIS Stephen Gibbs , BBC News
The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has described this agreement as " historic " , that suggests we are extremely close to a deal .
It is also significant that both sides say that the Congress of Honduras has to approve this .
That could mean a slight delay , but it might actually also have been the key to the solution .
Neither side could agree and so ultimately , perhaps to save face , they had to leave it to others finally , and symbolically , to make an agreement .
It appears the US government put the pressure on the Micheletti government to say leave this to the Honduran Congress .
And although the Congress initially voted to remove President Zelaya from power , now it wants him back , as everyone understands that it is the only way out of this .
Q&A : Crisis in Honduras Mr Zelaya returned covertly to Tegucigalpa on 21 September and has since been holed up in the Brazilian embassy .
He says he has returned " for the restoration of democracy " .
His term of office is due to finish at the end of January .
Negotiators for Mr Zelaya and Mr Micheletti resumed talks in the capital on Thursday in an attempt to resolve the political crisis which has gripped Honduras since the army - backed coup four months ago .
The opponents had earlier been told by US Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon that they had to reach an accord in order to ensure international support for the election on 29 November .
Afterwards , Mr Micheletti announced that a power - sharing deal had been reached that included a " significant concession " .
" I have authorised my negotiating team to sign a deal that marks the beginning of the end of the country 's political situation , " the interim leader told a news conference .
" With regard to the most contentious subject in the deal , the possible restitution of Zelaya to the presidency " would be included , he said .
Mr Zelaya said the agreement would restore democracy to Honduras Mr Zelaya described the accord as a " triumph for Honduran democracy " , and said he was " optimistic " of returning to power .
The US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , meanwhile said she wished to congratulate both sides on " reaching an historic agreement " .
Mr Micheletti said the ousted president would only be able return to office after a vote in his favour in Congress that would first have to be authorised by the country 's Supreme Court .
The Supreme Court ruled that Mr Zelaya had violated the constitution in June , while Congress voted to remove him from office .
Mr Micheletti - who as the speaker of Congress was constitutionally second - in - line to the presidency - was sworn in by Congress as interim leader following the coup .

The perpetually declining cost of data storage has made our lives , especially the online versions of them , more savable and searchable than ever before .
Server farms are growing faster than strawberries on FarmVille , with demand for data storage doubling every 18 to 24 months .
But exactly what are we saving ?
Along with Google ’s mission to archive and organize every bit of information in the world and Wikipedia ’s quest to wrangle humanity ’s knowledge into a single searchable database , startup Silentale aims to store every digital conversation that you have .
Ever .
Founded by a Paris - based French Canadian , Silentale is an aggregator for your life , or at least the increasingly large part of it that streams across the inter -tubes .
But rather than archiving your blog comments or flickr posts , Silentale archives only “ digital conversations , ” meaning basically anything that can be construed as a dialogue with others : Twitter , Facebook , email , and even SMS messages sent via your phone .
Any attachments riding along with your messages are archived too , and eventually that content will even be searchable as well .
The idea is to organize the disjointed dialogue that takes place across various Internet and phone networks .
A Firefox extension watches you while you watch others ; go to a friend ’s Facebook or Linked In profile and Silentale will pull up that person ’s contact info and shared correspondence from your archive , not just from the network you ’re viewing , but SMS messages , emails and tweets as well .
The address book function pulls in all your contacts across all networks and eliminates duplicates automatically , creating a single channel for each of your contacts ’ many profiles .
Click on one name , and get every bit of correspondence you ’ve shared across several platforms organized into a chronological timeline to create a seamless dialogue .
Sound cool ?
It is , for a variety of reasons .
For one , being able to search through all your social nets , email , and SMS for a particular phone number , link , or business contact is a tantalizing prospect given that many Web 2.0 - ers have spread their online personas across several platforms .
The ability to mesh mobile communications like SMS with our Web correspondence also allows for a higher degree of organization for our many digital missives ; as smartphones proliferate , it makes sense that we begin blending our phones ’ functions with our computers ’ in a meaningful way .
But aggregators like Silentale also raise serious privacy concerns .
So much information concentrated in a single place could create a data thief ’s bazaar .
Further , once users give access to all their online correspondence to a single source for archival purposes , there ’s no going back .
A collective gasp went up recently from privacy advocates when it was discovered that two popular child monitoring software packages , Sentry and FamilySafe , are selling information gleaned from children ’s private chats via Yahoo , MSN Messenger , or AOL Instant Messenger to market researchers .
When all your correspondence is archived , the temptation to tap that information by means legal or not will be great .
Silentale ’s private beta is underway now .
The beta is free , but once the site goes public it will likely employ a freemium model that keeps up to two months of correspondence for free , with a paid option ( rumored to be about $ 50 USD per year ) to archive dialogue going back further .
[ NOTE :
This post is both personal and medical in nature and only about hacking in the sense that it is about searching for a solution to a complex problem .
Some of the “ HN is for hacking only ” –types may not want to waste their time reading it .
It ’s also extremely long , but I do n’t have or want a blog right now .
You ’ve been warned . ]
This is my answer to apu's question to me on another thread about ALS ( and , specifically , my misdiagnosis with ALS and other illnesses ) : Q : " If you do n't mind me asking , what was the final diagnosis ?
How was it discovered ?
And how are you coping ? "
A : Basically I had multiple infections ( both viral and bacterial ) that were slowly eating me alive .
I started having migratory shooting pains , chronic joint pain , extreme fatigue , and rapid weight gain years ago .
( I gained 100 pounds in about 4 months , with absolutely no change in my diet or exercise program .
I went from somewhat athletic to fatigued fat - ass that slept 20 hours a day after a brief flu - like period . )
They initially tested me for thyroid and pituitary tumors .
That first MRI is how they found the first spots on my brain - before they were full - fledged lesions .
They were just hyper - intensive spots and ' plaques . '
It 's more common , by the way , to lose tons of weight with infections , but the infections affected my hormones in a way that made me balloon up .
I kept getting new symptoms over the years .
Sleep disorders , aphasia , tremors , severe chest pains , left arm paralysis , left side of body paralysis , neck - down paralysis , memory loss , tinnitus , passing out , chemical sensitivity , etc. etc .
In the end , I probably could have been Stephen Hawking 's stunt double appearance - wise .
As I said in the other thread , I was ( mis ) diagnosed with Parkinsons , Alzheimers , MS , CFS / FM , and ALS along the way - each time based on my symptom progression and test results .
Technically , I still have many of the other things I was diagnosed with based on symptoms and test results - by clinical definition - but they were not the underlying , causative issues .
They were just the icing on the cake .
I saw at least 22 doctors over the years , including some at top hospitals ( Mayo , etc . )
A few of the doctors thought I was nuts , because of the sheer number of symptoms .
One doctor did n't even finish the exam and commented that it was either all psychosomatic or else I was the unluckiest bastard ever and I had 25 + different diseases .
Most doctors would just space out at some point and start treating whatever their specialty ( or first thought ) was .
I had enough symptoms and bad test results to keep them all busy .
If I was seeing an endocrinologist , for example , she would try to treat just the endocrine issues ( the infections affected my endocrine system , so my hormones were waaaaaay out of whack .
One endocrinologist said I should be in medical textbooks because of my crazy high / low hormone levels . )
I tested positive for some autoimmune disorders , so the rheumatologist kept busy .
I have sleep disorders ( again because of the infections ) , so I was given a CPAP and sleep meds by a sleep specialist .
I have severe migraines ( lesions ! ) , so migraine specialists put me on migraine meds .
Etc. etc .
Not all these meds at once , of course .
The infections were playing havoc with my brain , heart , and nervous system ... and my endocrine and immune system were along for the ride .
I had a 2 - 3 year period where it felt like I was having multiple heart attacks every day .
I ’m amazed my wife did n’t leave me .
The multi-systemic nature and the fact that certain symptoms tends to reinforce or mask each other made it very difficult to figure anything out .
When you have certain infections , for example , your body will naturally retain heavy metals and toxins from the environment - all on its own - in a self - protective attempt to kill off the invaders .
So I tested off the charts for toxic metals and the ‘ environmental specialist ’ thought that was the underlying problem .
But , of course , it was n't .
They cleared most of the metals and I still had all the symptoms .
I had all of these heart symptoms , but most of my tests came back normal .
Normal stress test , normal basic EKG , etc .
They did n’t find any heart issues until they did less - common tests ( tilt - table testing , etc . )
I had enormous trouble finding a physician who was willing to really try to figure out the underlying cause of everything instead of just treating individual symptoms .
I did n’t want to be on 80 + meds for the rest of my ( possibly short ) life and not even know what the hell was wrong with me .
I eventually narrowed down what I personally thought I had , based on my own research and background .
Neuroborreliosis ( neurologic Lyme disease ) was one of my guesses , because I had done an extensive forestry research project at one point before my illness and I knew I had been bitten by ticks that may have been infected .
I had never had a rash , though .
And I did n't think any of my ‘ guesses ’ , individually , could explain my vast array of symptoms .
I finally went to this doctor that was supposed to be an amazing diagnostician - “ Dr. House without the ' tude ” , I was told .
I started reading him my list of symptoms - in chronological order .
( It was one of the ways I had learned to cope with the discouraging doctor visits ... if I was staring at a sheet of my notes , I could n't get pissed because the doctors were rolling their eyes at me .
I also needed the notes because my memories , and sometimes my speech , were completely shot . )
Usually , the doctors would stop me fairly quickly when I started listing symptoms .
This guy listened intently , and then started accurately guessing the next symptom on the list before I could even say it .
He did that for about 7 - 8 symptoms .
He gave me the most accurate description of some of my symptoms ... more accurate than I could even muster .
[ " Does it feel like someone is squeezing your heart with their hands and wo n't let it expand ? "
" Does it feel like you 're being stabbed with a cattle prod right here ? " etc. ]
I often had trouble choosing the proper words to convey certain symptoms , in part because I knew it sounded crazy .
But he was nodding the whole time and seemed sincere .
He said he thought I had a major environmental toxin problem ( heavy metals , chemical sensitivity , etc. ) OR I had one or more vector - borne infectious diseases .
He said either thing could potentially explain all of my symptoms , and that he leaned toward the latter because of the migratory nature of some of the symptoms .
He was amazed I had never been tested for some infections , despite having been to some of the top hospitals in the country .
The fact that my shooting pains were often migratory was one of the main things that had made some of the doctors think I was a loon .
This doctor says , “ Uh , DUH , it usually feels like the pains are moving around because they are - the things that are causing them are moving around , both in your body and in your brain ! ”
I had already been down the toxin path , so I was tested for a range of vector - borne diseases .
I had almost all of them that I was tested for .
Lyme , Babesia , Ehrlichiosis , etc. etc .
Plus a liberal dose of virii at very high levels .
I had had some of them so long that I was no longer showing a normal antibody response , but I had other telltale markers ( specific cell parts on tests , etc. ) .
[ The accuracy , availability , and expense of these tests is another tangent I ’ll avoid right now . ]
Oddly enough , once this doctor correctly diagnosed me he refused to treat me .
The insurance companies really give doctors who treat chronic infections a hard time , because the long - term treatment of certain infections is more expensive that treating a late - stage AIDs or brain cancer patient .
Some doctors - including at least one Nobel laureate nominee - have lost their medical licenses or been forced to stop treating infected patients because of insurance company influence .
It 's a very complicated , political issue .
Very frustrating .
Too complicated to get into here .
Anyway , this doctor said he wanted to treat me , but was literally scared to do so for fear of losing his medical license or his ability to offer insurance plans .
[ There is an award - winning documentary called UnderOurSkin ( http://underourskin.com/) that explores " chronic Lyme " , and it gets into the insurance , political , and patent issues , etc .
It also explores a theoretical link between Lyme and other diseases .
It 's very good .
It does n't go into the co-infection issue much , because it is Lyme- specific - but it gives a great overview .
The documentary trailer is at : http://underourskin.com/watch.html
One of the guys in it is a physician that was also misdiagnosed with ALS , and there ’s a baseball player that was misdiagnosed , Amy Tan ( Joy Luck Club author ) is also in it .
Anyway , I tested positive for at least a dozen viral and bacterial infections , but they could have potentially all come from one tick bite .
I think the estimate is that 30 % of all infected ticks carry at least one other co-infection .
So , theoretically , I could have been bitten by just one really ' sick tick . '
Or I could have picked up other infections once my immune system was compromised by an initial infection .
No way to know for sure .
[ Oh , and the fact that I never had a rash did n’t mean anything because 50 % or more of infected ticks do n’t cause a rash at all . ]
Only a certain percentage of people that are infected with some of these diseases develop chronic issues , so I may have had a weak spot in my immune system due to genetics or something .
That ’s one area of research they ’re exploring .
I know they ’ve found at lease one statistically significant genetic anomaly that predisposes you to getting sicker with at least one of the viruses .
Some people - even lauded medical professionals - think that most infections can be killed off fairly easily with short - term antibiotics or antivirals ( which is part of the debate in that documentary I mention . )
That ’s one of the arguments the insurance companies use .
There are many mitigating factors , though , and most animal studies / vivisections say something else entirely .
Some infections have biofilms that protect them .
Some form cysts that protect them .
Some infections grow drug - resistant .
Some meds do n't cross the blood - brain barrier .
Different people have different immune responses .
Etc. etc .
The medicines themselves are very dangerous long - term , and you also have the serious problem that the infections release toxins as they die off ... so by killing them you usually get worse in the short - term .
The toxins released can kill additional tissue or trigger a stroke or heart attack because of the other symptoms .
It 's a weird balancing act between getting a medicine to work without making the infections resistant or triggering too much of a toxin / autoimmune response .
It ’s drug hacking , in a way .
I ’ve had two strokes .
One because of a misdiagnosis when they put me on steroids and I had a major inflammatory response and once after I was properly diagnosed because I was n't fast enough on the trigger to recognize a change in symptoms when I was pulsing between two antibiotics .
By the time I was properly diagnosed , I had permanent damage to my brain ( lesions , some may heal ) , heart ( cardiomyopathy , etc. ) , mitochondria ( extrinsic mitochondrial disease - the infections ate the lipids from cells , among other things ) , and central nervous system ( advanced neuropathy , etc . )
I also have the hormone , sleep , and autoimmune issues .
I 've been on various antibiotics , antifungals , and antivirals for about 15 months .
And pain meds .
I only decided I had my final , correct diagnosis because this was the first logical answer that explained literally everything , had confirming test results , and allowed me to actually start getting better over time once I started treatment , toxin setbacks aside .
Some of my symptoms have completely disappeared , but some remain .
Mobility - wise , I 've went from a wheelchair to a walker to now only needing a cane sometimes .
I still have some memory loss , some aphasia , some numbness , some shooting pains , etc. - but I 'm 80 - 90 % better than when I started treatment .
Not only in frequency of symptoms that remain , but in their actual intensity .
I mainly see an infectious diseases specialist now , and he keeps warning me that I will not continuously get better but will instead have a rollercoaster ride until I level off at my final “ condition ” – because of the toxins , immune response , and residual damage .
They 're not sure exactly how much of the damage is permanent .
Some of the lesions are , for sure , and the mitochondrial damage is fairly severe ( I technically have a small fraction of the energy , literally , of a normal person . )
I 'm amazed by the improvements already , so I 'm still hopeful .
My wife is pregnant with out first child , and everyone is scared / nervous how I will handle it .
I still pass out occasionally , so some family members do n't want me to hold my own kid .
( Admittedly , I 've fallen down stairs a few times after passing out . )
Insurance has already stopped paying on certain meds and will most likely eventually stop on others .
One of my antibiotics is $ 2500 a week , because the stent goes directly by the heart and you have to have a home health nurse change it to ( ironically ) reduce the risk of infection .
I ’m relatively fortunate that I ’ve been able to get and afford my treatments thus far .
I ’m very fortunate that I did n’t have a completely untreatable disease .
I also think this post should win an award for biggest “ TMI ” ( Too Much Information ) ever in the history of HN .

Late last night , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two major solar initiatives involving a feed - in tariff for utility companies and surplus electricity generated by customers .
It was the last day to sign bills from this year ’s legislative session .
AB 920 requires utility companies to pay households or businesses for any extra electricity produced by the customer ’s solar power system .
Supporters said the bill would encourage customers , who previously had no incentive to use less electricity than was generated , to be more efficient .
SB 32 expands the feed - in tariff program for large - scale solar facilities from 1.5 megawatts to 3 megawatts , potentially pushing utilities to construct massive solar installations on unused spaces like parking lots and warehouse roofs .

The LCROSS spacecraft will be giving it all up for science Friday morning when it and the second stage of the Centaur rocket impact Cabeus crater on the Moon ’s south pole , searching for possible water ice hidden inside the perpetually dark portions of the crater .
Since we ’ll never see LCROSS again , its only fitting to take a good long , last look at her .
Solar System Ambassador and Planetary Society volunteer Ken Kremer had the wonderful opportunity to see both LCROSS and her sister ship the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) in the Astrotech Space Operations Facility clean room in Titusville , FL earlier this year before the dynamic duo launched together on June 18 .
Ken has graciously given permission to allow us to publish these images ( which were previously posted on the Planetary Society website ) so we can all remember what she looked like .
Above is a side view of LCROSS wrapped in gold multi-layer thermal insulation .
The solar array is on the left side .
Science instrument , avionics , navigation , communication and thruster equipment panels encircle and are attached to the central payload adapter ring .
The star tracker is on the right side , and the payload fairing halves sit at either side .
More images below .
Here ’s a picture of Ken with the two spacecraft .
Visible are the solar arrays for LRO ( top , left ) and LCROSS ( bottom , left ) .
Visible is the LCROSS panel with the 9 science instruments ( gold color ) which run on just 100 watts of power .
Above Ken ’s head is the visible light camera .
This image really provides a reference to how big these two spacecraft actually are .
Note the person in the bunny ( clean ) suit standing next to LRO ( gray ) and LCROSS ( yellow ) lunar spacecraft stacked adjacent to Atlas V payload fairing .
And since we ’ve now seen LCROSS up close , here ’s a few new close - up images just released by NASA of Cabeus crater .
This visualization image gives a bird ’s - eye view of Cabeus crater and the target zone for the crash site .
A 3.5 - kilometer - wide “ flagpole ” marks the targeted location within the crater .
Colored stripes on the pole indicate one kilometer steps in elevation above the crater floor , black stripes indicate 5 kilometer steps .
The pole stands 25 kilometers tall , and the blue rings mark heights of 50 and 100 kilometers above the impact site .
This image shows key lunar landmarks used to locate Cabeus crater .
The yellow scale shows angular distances in the plane of the impact site ; blue arcs show heights 50 , 100 and 200 kilometers above it .
And click here for a link to a video visualization that zooms into Zoom into the Moon as it might look shortly after the LCROSS impact .
Blue arcs represent 50 , 100 and 200 kilometer heights above the crash site .
Hopefully the telescopes trained on this region of the Moon will give us the real images of this event !

All Developers Should Know How They Learn Best ( this post ) The Secret Of Being A Great Mentor The Secret Of Being A Great Apprentice Become A Better Developer By Indexing Your Brain Learn More – Faster By Using The World - Wide Community What Playing Cards Can Teach Us About Ramping - Up And Transferring Knowledge
Software development is one of those industries where you can’t really help it but be constantly learning .
No matter how knowledgeable you are with the technologies you currently work with you still daily discover new , better , more efficient ways of doing what you do .
It is even more hectic when you move to a new environment or end up on a new project where the technologies may not be as familiar , ( or you could be a downright newbie ) the domain is completely different and you have to work extra hard to get across everything in order to become effective as fast as possible .
But how do you make sure that you ’re getting across all this new stuff as quickly as you can be ?
You probably have some personal strategies that you have developed over time that work well for you .
Maybe you start doing a lot of relevant reading or maybe you browse the source code / unit tests in your free time or maybe you just ask a bunch of questions over beers after work ( and some just simply wait and wait until they begin to grok what ’s going on ) .
We normally do n’t know why a particular strategy works for us , we just know that we learn faster and better when we employ it .
But it is actually not that hard to figure out why certain things work for you and why others do n’t and if we knew this we could probably streamline our learning even more ( and not just the on - the - job learning that we do , but out personal learning endeavors as well ) .
There are a number of theories about what makes people learn best and what personality traits effect learning .
Some are better , some are worse , some have been criticized while others have been praised .
I am a believer in balance in all things , so rather than subscribing to one particular learning theory , I prefer to examine myself with regard to several which in the end , gives me a broader understanding of what it is about me that effects how I learn and what strategies I would need to employ to make sure I am getting the most bang for my buck ( so to speak ) .
I would recommend all developers go through a similar exercise if only to be more aware of what makes you tick and why your favorite strategies are infact best .
To that end , here is an outline of some of my favorite learning theories .
Your Personality
Personality can have a major affect on how a person learns , this just makes sense and so some of the earliest and most well known theories are centered around this .
Some of the oldies ( but still goodies ) that most people have probably heard of are Myers - Briggs Type Indicator and the Keirsey Temperament Sorter .
Both of these are based around 4 personality dimensions each of which can have one of two values :
Energizing – how a person is energized or motivated Extroverted – draw energy from people and like to discuss their thoughts and ideas with others when learning
Introverted – expend energy while with people , like to think through new ideas by themselves Attending – what makes a person pay attention Sensing – focus on what their senses tell them , notice the details
Intuiting – focus on the possibilities and the ‘ big picture ’
Deciding – how someone makes decisions Thinking – use logic and structure to make decisions
Feeling – tend to use value - judgments to make decisions , i.e. ethical or moral concerns Living – a person ’s lifestyle Judging – have a structured and organized approach to living and decision making
Perceiving – are a lot more flexible , tend to explore possibilities before committing to a course of action
You pick your leanings in each of the four categories which gives you your personality classification ( e.g. if you ’re extroverted , sensing , feeling , judging you would be a ESFJ ) .
Based on the descriptions of the various traits you can combine them to figure out what kind of approach to learning can work for you .
For example , you may need to walk through the big picture in a logical and structured fashion , all the while discussing your thoughts with others .
Or you may need to sit down by yourself and explore the various possibilities and the details of what effect they would have .
There is no right or wrong way , but knowing what kind of personality profile you have can help you focus on the most effective way for you to absorb and retain new information .
Are You A Left - Brainer Or A Right - Brainer ?
These days everyone is aware that our brain has two hemispheres .
This was originally proposed by Dr. Roger Sperry who in 1981 won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work .
For most people one side of the brain tends to dominate even though everyone uses both in their day to day life .
Despite what some would have you believe you do n’t need to be either a left - brainer or right - brainer to be a good developer .
You ’ve probably met developers in your work who like to dive into code and explore and who tend to almost intuitively find solutions to problems ( these were probably right - brain dominant ) .
You ’ve also probably met developers who like to work through the details and approach their problem solving in a logical and systematic fashion ( these were the left - brain dominant ) .
Left - Brain Dominant
If you ’re left brain dominant you probably like to walk through your learning step by step .
You like resources that break down the information into a series of tasks and guide you through those tasks in a sensible fashion .
You will also tend to work and learn well with other people who think the same way as you ( other left brainers ) .
Right - Brain Dominant
If you ’re right brain dominant you will prefer to know the big picture as well as see examples and case studies of best practice .
You learn well from observing and discussing and are happy to start work when only a broad goal or outline exists , filling in the details as you go .
Neither of these is inherently better but it does pay to know what works best for you .
On any team you work either one or the other style will tend to dominate , if it is not your style it is up to you to make sure that your style is also represented in some fashion .
Maybe you may need to fill in a little more detail and come up with a little more structure to help the left - brainers on the team when you have a goal you need to achieve .
Or maybe you need to zoom everyone out a little to make sure the right brainers are represented when everyone seems to be too focused on the detail .
Who The VARK Are You ?
VARK is one of the most common categorizations of learning styles .
VARK was created by Neil Fleming and is based on the Neuro - linguistic programming ( VAK ) learning model .
VARK is an acronym where each letter stand for a particular type of learning style .
Visual Learners – prefer visual representation of information and tend to remember things better if they are organized visually ( i.e. charts )
– prefer visual representation of information and tend to remember things better if they are organized visually ( i.e. charts ) Auditory Learners – learn better when they hear information ( i.e. learn well through talking and discussion )
– learn better when they hear information ( i.e. learn well through talking and discussion ) Reading / Writing - preference Learners – this one is pretty self - explanatory , these types of people need to read and / or write to learn and remember something
– this one is pretty self - explanatory , these types of people need to read and / or write to learn and remember something Kinesthetic Learners – require action and movement to learn things , they need to try things out to learn and remember them
You ’re probably noticing by now that there is some cross-over with the previous models that we discussed .
For example auditory learners may tend to be more extroverted while reading / writing preference learners will tend to be more left - brain and thinking ( as opposed to right - brain and feeling ) .
The categories with this one are very broad and you may once again not fall neatly into just one , but as always it is best to be aware which style works for you and make sure that you give yourself the best opportunities to learn and retain new information .
So , if your current environment does not provide the kind of information that works best for you ( i.e. there is not enough charts or not enough discussion is going on ) , it is up to you to remedy that .
You ’re Suffering From Multiple Intelligences
The theory of multiple intelligences was proposed by Howard Gardner .
Basically the theory states that there are 7 different aspects to our intelligence that can be measured separately .
We use all these intelligences in our day - to - day life but we have an affinity for one or several and therefore find them easier to use .
This means that particular learning styles will work better for us .
The 7 intelligences are :
Logical / Mathematical – like information to be presented logically and systematically , they like to problem solve and make connections between concepts Verbal / Linguistic – learn best through reading , writing and discussion .
This intelligence incorporates abstract thought and reasoning Musical – for this intelligence learning is enhanced when new material is associated with sound and music ( this should certainly be familiar to many people who like to study with music ) Visual / Spatial – here learning involves creating visual representations of content , such as graphs and charts as well as mind - mapping and content - mapping techniques Interpersonal – people who are dominant in this intelligence like to learn in groups , talking and interacting with others Intrapersonal – people who dominate with this one like to learn by themselves , they concentrate and process information better when they are alone Bodily / Kinesthetic – here people like to learn by doing , movement and action , they need to try things to retain and absorb information
Once again there is a significant amount of cross-over with the other theories but hopefully having several presented at once helps to clarify in your own mind what kind of person you are .
What it also teaches us is the fact that there is no one best way to work in a team ( whether it ’s a software team or any other ) .
Some people learn better in groups while others learn best by themselves , so you need to provide time for group work as well as personal work .
So for example , if you always work by yourself ( in your workplace ) and group time is not provided ( and you ’re and Interpersonal learner ) you need to make the group time yourself .
The same could be said about all the other intelligences .
If music works best for you then make sure you bring your iPod with you .
If you ’re visual then push for creating more charts and doing more mind - mapping exercises .
If you ’re kinesthetic , then maybe you need to introduce role playing exercises to the team etc .
There are many other intelligence and learning theories out there ( such as the 4 - MAT system , Experiential Learning etc. ) , some are a lot more complex than the four above .
The reason the above 4 are good , aside from the fact that they are the most well known ones , is the fact that we can easily classify ourselves according to all 4 which can give us a reasonable understanding of the kind of personality we have and therefore what kind of activities can help us learn better .
We can possibly do more with the more complex systems , but in my opinion the law of diminishing returns kicks in , we expend a little effort to know enough rather than expending a whole lot to learn just a little more .
Of course just like with everything we will never be able to neatly pigeonhole ourselves , we are often both thinking and feeling , or visual and auditory in equal measure .
But knowing this also tells you much , such as the fact that both a visual and an auditory learning style can work for you ( i.e. explanation and diagrams ) so maybe next time in addition to drawing a diagram you can look really weird and talk yourself through it while doing it , you ’d be surprised at the difference it can make .
I hope this has helped you become more aware of how you learn and retain information and why certain strategies work best for you .
If you ’d like to share your experiences with learning or if you know of other theories that are easy and work really well ( perhaps you have one of your own ) feel free to share them in the comments .
Otherwise , stay tuned for the next post in the teaching and learning series title – The Secret Of Being A Great Mentor .

A cell in the eye may be worth two in the beak , at least when it comes to a migratory bird ’s magnetic compass .
In European robins , a visual center in the brain and light - sensing cells in the eye — not magnetic sensing cells in the beak — allow the songbirds to sense which direction is north and migrate correctly , a new study finds .
The study , appearing Oct. 29 in Nature , may improve conservation efforts for migratory birds .
“ This is really fascinating science , ” says biophysicist Klaus Schultenof the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , who was one of the first to suggest that migrating birds can sense magnetic fields .
Researchers have known that built - in biological compasses tell migrating birds which way to fly , but the details of how birds detect magnetic fields has been unclear .
“ This is basically the sixth sense of biology , but no one knows how it works , ” says study co-author Henrik Mouritsenof the University of Oldenburg in Germany .
“ The magnetic sense is by far the least - understood sense in the natural world . ”
Some researchers had proposed that iron - based receptors in cells found in the upper beaks of some migratory birds sense the magnetic field and send that information along a nerve to the brain .
Other scientists favor the hypothesis that light - sensing cells in birds ’ eyes sense the magnetic field and send the information along a different route to a light - processing part of the brain called cluster N .
Special proteins called cryptochromes in the birds ’ eyes may mediate this light - dependent magnetic sensing , Mouritsen says .
Light hitting the proteins produces a pair of free radicals , highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons .
These electrons have a property called spin which may be sensitive to Earth ’s magnetic field .
Signals from the free radicals may then move to nerve cells in cluster N , ultimately telling the birds where north is .
To find the location that houses the magnetic compass , Mouritsen and his colleagues caught 36 migratory European robins and made sure that the birds could all orient correctly under natural and induced magnetic fields .
Next , the researchers performed surgeries on the birds to deactivate one of the two systems .
The team either severed the nerve that connects the beak cells to the brain , or damaged the brain cells in cluster N that receive light signals from cells in the eye .
Birds with the severed beak - to - brain nerve — called the trigeminal nerve — still oriented perfectly , Mouritsen says .
“ No information from those iron crystals could get to the brain , but the birds oriented just as well , ” he says , suggesting that the beak cells are not important for orientation .
On the other hand , birds with damaged cluster N regions could no longer sense and orient to magnetic fields .
These robins failed to pick up both the Earth ’s natural magnetic field and the artificial fields created by the researchers .
The new study “ nicely confirms that the trigeminal nerve is not involved in this direction sensing , ” says John Phillips , a neuro - ecologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg .
“ This is an important advance in what we know about these systems . ”
Mouritsen thinks the cells in the beak might play a different role in magnetic sensing , such as picking up minor changes in the strength of the magnetic field along a north - south axis , he says .
Understanding more about how birds navigate and sense the environment may have important conservation implications , Mouritsen says .
Migratory birds that humans have relocated often fly back to the original migratory grounds .
But if researchers can figure out how the birds navigate , conservationists may be able to trick the birds into staying where it ’s safe .

Apparently acknowledging shadow inventory is like holding onto childhood superstitions like believing in Santa Clause or the financial Easter Bunny .
Over the last week , many of you have sent me articles where many authors both amateur and professional have started attacking shadow inventory and started proclaiming that it was a myth .
Shadow inventory does not exist according to these new articles .
Some of these authors went ahead and made up their own definitions of shadow inventory which in itself is curious since this inventory supposedly does not exist .
The problem of course is that there are many definitions of what shadow inventory is so I will try to reiterate what I have been talking about for months .
Here is how I define this category of inventory :
“ ( Doctor Housing Bubble )
What is shadow inventory ?
First , shadow inventory is housing units that are not making it onto the public market for one reason or another .
There is speculation surrounding why this is happening .
Lenders are overwhelmed and simply do not have the human capital to handle the glut so goes one theory .
Others speculate that lenders are simply too incompetent to have a system in place to handle the mess they created . ”
This is rather clear and many people when referring to shadow inventory are discussing it by this definition .
Essentially shadow inventory encompasses housing inventory that is n’t viewable by the public or measured in more historical standards .
Calculated Risk does an excellent job breaking down some of the categories :
“( Calculated Risk )
There are several categories of shadow inventory :
REOs .
There are bank owned properties that have not been put on the market yet .
Several sources have told me the number is growing – no one knows why except possibly for accounting reasons ( the banks might have to take an addition write down when they sell the property ) .
Foreclosures in process .
The delinquency rate has continued to rise , and this will probably lead to many more foreclosures later this year .
The number of foreclosures depends somewhat on the success of the modification programs .
Last year many delinquent homeowners listed their homes as “ short sales ” – so those homes were not shadow inventory , however fewer delinquent homeowners are listing their homes now as they try to work with their lenders on a modification .
Some percentage of these homes are shadow inventory .
New high rise condos .
These properties are not included in the new home inventory report from the Census Bureau , and do not show up anywhere unless they are listed .
Homeowners waiting for a better market .
This was the group mentioned in the Reuters story ( the article also mentioned foreclosures ) .
These are homeowners waiting for better market conditions to sell .
Inventory is usually the best metric to follow for the housing market – and according to recent releases inventory is declining for both new and existing homes – however shadow inventory clouds this picture . ”
I would also add homeowners that have stopped paying but banks are simply not contacting them .
In fact , according to Amherst Securities Group LP the foreclosure process now takes 18 months to 2 years , up from 15 months only a year ago .
2 years !
I have had many e-mails from people telling me they have been in their homes without making a payment for 12 months .
Amazing .
Others have stopped making payments and the banks have yet to contact them .
The bottom line , there is shadow inventory .
These are homes that in every other time in history would have been on the market as additional inventory .
I am open to debating the amount of shadow inventory but to say it is a myth is non-sense .
In fact , to think there is no shadow inventory is to believe in banking data and give the crony capitalist the benefit of the doubt that they are handling things correctly .
In addition , the crux of the argument for those stating the non-existence of shadow inventory is narrow in focus .
What they are arguing is basically one angle of the story .
Their point is that banks are not hoarding REOs and there will be no flood of inventory in the next few months .
On this point , they are correct .
That however does not mean there is no shadow inventory or that somehow it is a myth .
Let us run a quick little experiment shall we ?
Let us look at an area facing tough times right now here in Southern California , Compton :
MLS Inventory : 465
Of this , 114 are listed as short sales and 48 are listed as foreclosures
So this is the public data .
But let us look at what is going on in the shadow inventory :
So how many properties show signs of distress ?
This is exactly what I am talking about .
The public can see 465 homes with 114 short sales and 48 foreclosures .
But the reality is , there are some 1,639 properties either in pre-foreclosure , default , or bank owned .
Now , if we remove the public listings that would leave us with 1,477 homes not showing up .
Given the entire MLS inventory is 465 I would say that is a rather significant number .
Most of these homes will default .
This is something we already know .
This is in fact shadow inventory .
Banks are simply self - serving and are holding off on foreclosing on homes because to do so , would implode their business .
That is , they would need to take an immediate and gigantic write - down .
And banks are getting their hands slapped but nothing is being done .
Timothy Ward who is the deputy director of the Office of Thrift and Supervision even acknowledged the shady practices currently going on at banks :
“ ( OTS Letter )
The following practices are considered weak and do not appear to be in accordance with GAAP and / or supervisory guidance .
1 ) Institutions charge - off losses only at foreclosure or when deemed uncollectible .
A sound practice is to establish charge - off policies in accordance with the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy ( CEO Memo # 128 , July 27 , 2000 ) .
Institutions should assess the current value of the collateral and selling costs when a loan is no more than 180 days past due .
Any loan balance in excess of that assessment should be classified Loss . ”
180 days past due ?
You mean 6 months ?
Well we just found out the foreclosure process is taking 18 months to 2 years ( assuming banks even start the process which we now know in many cases they are not ) .
What we need is a heavy crack down but with suspension to mark to market , banks are playing fast and loose with their data .
If you recall , the public private investment program ( PPIP ) was set to move forward in July .
It is still having the kinks worked out apparently .
I guess they still have n’t figured out how to fleece the public enough .
Many banks were assuming they were going to dump all their toxic waste onto taxpayers .
And to acknowledge toxic waste while the stock market is rallying like it just took some speed might throw a wrench into the party .
Also , I think some confusion came from the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami that I have talked about for nearly a year .
This is not a myth and the tsunami is already here :
These loans are going into distress as expected .
This is happening in California and also nationwide :
The question whether banks are foreclosing on these homes is another thing entirely .
In fact , the way things are playing out not paying your mortgage seems to be an actual solution to the crisis for banks .
Most are betting their cronies will come through and they can suddenly dump the waste onto the public .
At a certain point however , you have to get to price discovery .
To think that loan modifications or sales are fixing the imbalance is naïve and misses the entire scope of the problem .
Currently , the market still has $ 1.1 trillion in active Alt - A and subprime loans .
That is an enormous number .
Let us not even talk about the rising number of prime defaults which is another major issue in itself .
And to clarify , pay option ARMs can also be Alt - A loans .
Not all pay option ARMs are Alt - A loans and vice versa .
Alt - A is simply a category called Alternative A - paper meaning banks played fast and easy with the underwriting .
There are a few general reasons a loan would fall into the Alt - A category :
> Less than full documentation
> Lower credit scores
> Higher loan - to - value ratios
> More investment properties
So you can technically have a high credit owner with an option ARM that is n’t an Alt - A product .
Or you can have a low credit owner with an option ARM that is an Alt - A product .
This is rather clear .
Option ARMs are a small part of the toxic mortgage world .
The bottom line is we have some $ 1.1 trillion of extremely toxic mortgages floating in the market and most of the Alt - A loans are here in California :
So the flood of problems are already starting .
Banks are simply operating under incompetent rules and mixed standards where one bank might foreclose on a regular timeline while another bank might be doing absolutely nothing .
In fact , I have gotten a few e-mails from those in the industry stating that banks are simply waiting to “ see where the market goes ” in the next few months .
This confirms what was said in a recent American Banker article , Postponing the Day of Reckoning ( August 26 , 2009 – subscription required ) :
“ Deferring foreclosures could have bottom - line benefits experts say .
With fewer foreclosed properties hitting the market , housing prices have rebounded slightly .
Moreover , properties might recover more of their value later on , so by waiting , banks may be able to cut their ultimate losses .
“ Everybody is waiting to see what the market is going to do from a property perspective , ” Volez said , “ At some point , they have to liquidate these assets . ”
That is the main issue right there .
Here in California , many of those Alt - A loans will never recover .
A property that sold for $ 400,000 in the Inland Empire that is now going for $ 150,000 is going to cause the bank a loss no matter what .
At a certain point , having so many borrowers not paying is going to cause massive cash flow problems .
This will drain your capital as well .
Some think that by delaying foreclosure that banks are being creative and smart .
They are basically trading a sudden punch to the head with death by a thousand mortgage payments .
That is n’t a solution .
That is praying the government and the taxpayer bail you out once again .
And then what ?
The government owns these toxic mortgages ?
At a certain point the home has to be valued at non -bubble prices .
In places like California with an 11.9 percent unemployment rate , prices may not recover for a decade .
Let us look at another prime location to see some more shadow inventory if you still have some doubts .
Many are itching to buy in Culver City so we ’ll use that as an example :
Culver City MLS listings : 101
2 listed as a foreclosure and 12 listed as short sales
Now let us look at properties in distress :
How many properties are we looking at above ?
170 properties .
Keep in mind that only 14 of these are on the MLS .
Take out the 2 foreclosed homes and 11 short sales and you have 157 properties not viewable by the public .
Given there are only 101 properties on the MLS , there are more properties in the shadows than in the public view .
22 homes sold in Culver City last month .
This is the difference between 4.5 months of inventory ( low ) and 12 months of inventory ( high ) .
Big difference and the shadow inventory does exist .
I know it was painful to hear as a child that there was no Santa Clause but you can feel comforted that shadow inventory is the real deal .

The music industry needs a " radical overhaul " to its products if it wants to revive sales , and that overhaul revolves around actually catering to consumer needs .
That 's the argument in a new report from market research firm Forrester , which says that the music business needs to give up being obsessed with itself in favor of letting users create their own music experiences with ease .
This goes far beyond offering mere albums for purchase — Forrester suggests users be allowed to completely customize and share their music in an extremely open , platform - agnostic manner .
First and foremost , the firm says consumers have the " right " to a unique music experience .
This means that they should be able to completely customize what they 're looking at and listening to by having lyrics , on - demand live footage , photos , live chat with other fans , expandable music / video players , and more right at their fingertips .
Imagine the recently introduced iTunes LP , but with much more content to choose from and fully customizable .
Logically , the next step would be to allow users to share their creations with others .
Forrester argues that this is a key element to this music product overhaul — not only should users be able to make mashups and remixes , they should also be able to share their arrangements with each other .
" In this age of mashups and remix stems , artists no longer have a monopoly on the creative process , " writes Forrester .
" All music fans should have the chance to create , even if the only creating they do is sharing in someone else ’s creation . "
Needless to say , doing all of this involves the true death of DRM as we know it — or , as Forrester says , a makeover of DRM .
Instead of keeping users from doing things like mixing and sharing , it should " primarily be an enabler of the consumer experiences , creative processes , and sharing . "
Theoretically , this would enable the solution to be cross-platform , not just on multiple OSes , but multiple devices as well .
" Music products will look a lot like mobile apps , " says the firm .
On one hand , it 's easy to dismiss these suggestions as pie - in - the - sky fantasies .
To be sure , the music industry is very resistant to this kind of major change and would love it if buyers would just keep listening to CDs ( or , better yet , vinyl albums ) forever , without ever going on the Internet .
That world no longer exists , though — as Forrester points out , the music experience changed the minute MP3s started making their way across the Web and people started cherry picking their favorite songs ( let 's not even get into mashup culture , either ) .
In a way , iTunes LP does make a baby step into the territory that Forrester talks about , but it 's still very limited in terms of customizability ( it has none ) .
What it does offer , though , is more than the typical album — lyrics , videos , and more come as part of the overall music experience .
If artists see some success there , the music industry may indeed be open to taking more steps to offer content in ways that users can customize and share with friends .

On the 5th , Network World ran the article Three Reasons Why iPhone Wo n’t Get Adobe Flash .
The reasons were : Apple does n’t want Flash on the iPhone , the iPhone is created so it wo n’t support Flash ( the article cites Apple not allowing plug- ins for mobile Safari ) , and Apple is betting on a different standard ( HTML 5 ) .
Funny that they missed out the most likely reason : Flash on the Mac — specifically the Flash plug - in — sucks .
On Leopard , the Flash plug - in is so unstable that Apple sandboxed browser plug-ins in Snow Leopard ’s Safari .
Interestingly , I ’ve had one Safari crash since upgrading to Snow Leopard , compared to at least one per hour on Leopard .
The Flash plug - in process , however , keels over with alarming regularity .
Also , put a PC next to a Mac and run some complex Flash content .
Watch in horror as a knackered old PC outperforms a shiny new Mac — something that just does n’t happen elsewhere .
Apple might be a huge control freak , but it ’s proved plenty of times in the past that it will let other companies into its play - pen .
However , said companies have to prove themselves worthy .
I have no doubt that if the Flash plug - in was an amazing piece of Mac engineering , Apple would — at least now the App Store is hugely successful — allow Adobe to create the equivalent for iPhone and iPod touch .
But since the Mac version of the plug - in is such a buggy , sluggish pile of garbage , why would Apple let the Flash plug - in anywhere near the mobile version of Safari , where it could at a stroke create the impression that Apple ’s handheld platform and browser are slow , bug - ridden and unstable ?

Public Health Leaders Propose Soda Tax
Tax on soda seen as a way to fight obesity , raise money for prevention programs .
Sept. 17 , 2009  --
Several of the nation 's leading health experts are calling for a tax on soda as a means of curbing America 's obesity - epidemic .
Their paper , appearing in the most recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , calls for a tax on " sugar - sweetened " drinks in order to reduce the consumption of the drinks and lower health costs as well as fund government - run health programs .
" A tax on sugar - sweetened beverages is really a double - win , " said Dr. David Ludwig , a co-author of the paper and director of the Optimal Weight for Life program at Children 's Hospital , Boston .
" We can raise much - needed dollars while likely reducing obesity prevalence , which is a major driver of health care costs , the paper states .
" Ultimately the government needs to raise more money to cover the deficit , and in terms of ways of raising that revenue , a tax on sugar sweetened beverages is really a no - brainer . "
Such a tax has been proposed in the past .
In a perspectives article in the New England Journal this past April , Kelly Brownell of Yale University , one of the current paper 's authors , along with then - New York City health commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden , co-authored an article advocating a tax on " sugared beverages . "
Frieden has since become head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
A spokesman for the CDC noted that taxing sweetened beverages is not part of the current administration 's position .
However , in at a conference on obesity in July of this year , Frieden responded to a question on the issue saying :
" I think anything that increases the availability and decreases the relative price of healthy foods and anything that decreases the availability and increases the price of unhealthy foods is likely to be effective .
The challenge , I think , is a political one of getting that approved as well as there are very important administrative and operational issues with implementation of such a tax . "
Frieden 's successor in New York , Dr. Thomas Farley , is one of the authors of the current paper .
Ludwig noted that the authors focused exclusively on beverages that contained sugar , and not diet substitutes for sugar .
" The evidence is much stronger for sugar sweetened beverages than diet beverages , " he said .
" It 's not to say that the question of diet beverages is n't interesting and important , and there is much research going on . "
But while many public health advocates support a sugared - beverage tax , the idea has drawn concern and outright opposition .
" If your goal is to reduce obesity , this wo n't work , because most people wo n't stop drinking soda , " said Richard Williams , managing director of the regulatory studies program and government accountability project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University .
" You ca n't change people 's taste buds . "
While acknowledging the cost difference , he said he did n't think it was likely that people would turn away from soda as quickly as hoped .
" I do n't think it 's necessarily true that the poor have n't heard that water 's cheaper than soda , " said Williams .
Martin Binks , director of behavioral health and research director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center , expressed skepticism that a taxation and health education program would achieve its goals .
" I would fear that without a concentrated commitment to educating the public about healthier options that the choices made may shift away from high caloric beverages -- yet land on equally unhealthy alternate choices , " he said in an e-mail to ABC News .
Noting that " fast food , candy bars and countless other snack foods are likely equally culpable , " Binks concluded that " Of course , any approach would require careful thought and planning -- but it seems that focusing discouraging single food classes is not the answer to such a multifaceted issue . "
Is Drinking Coke Like Smoking ?
Most doctors contacted by ABC News expressed approval of the idea of taxing sugary drinks .
" I strongly agree .
It will clearly take public health measures with some teeth to tame the obesity crisis , " said Dr. Ken Fujioka , director of nutrition and metabolic research at Scripps Health in San Diego .
" I think it 's a fine idea , " said Dr. Meir Stampfer , a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health , although he noted some of the authors are colleagues and friends .
" The head of Coke likened this to the Soviet Union , but there is plenty of precedent for taxation like this . "
The most common analogy drawn by advocates and opponents of the measure is to smoking , which has been taxed heavily .
Doctors affiliated with the study say the beverage industry has manipulated public opinion to oppose a tax .
" I think the main opposition comes from the sugar and soft drink industry , which has apparently engaged in a multimillion - dollar lobbying campaign to oppose this effort , " said Ludwig .
The beverage industry has countered that such taxes undermine personal choice .
" A tax will cause real harm to hard - working American families at a time when they are already struggling to stay afloat during a recession , " said Susan Neely , president and CEO for the American Beverage Association , in a statement issued Wednesday .
" The American public views it as an over - reach when the government tries to tell them what to eat and drink . "
Some researchers argued that tobacco is not an apt analogy .
" I think steep taxes on foods are problematic , because even ' bad ' food is not tobacco , " said Dr. David Katz , director of medical studies in public health at Yale University .
" Tobacco can be avoided altogether -- and indeed , should be -- and thus , steep taxation is justifiable .
Food cannot be avoided , so it comes down to choices -- and taxing people into choices is fraught with challenges and hazards . "
While many states currently have taxes on sugary drinks , the authors of the paper say that such taxes are not high enough to effect change in dietary patterns .
Taxes on sugary beverages appear to be favored by a slight majority of Americans .
In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in August of this year , 53 percent of respondents favored an increased tax on soda and sugary drinks , while 44 percent were opposed to such a measure .
A Small Part Of A Larger Problem
Despite some support for the tax , other researchers questioned whether it would work at all .
" I do n't see how anyone would go with attacking the beverage industry and taxing a single food , and I do n't think the evidence is there to support taxing a soft drink , " said Theresa Nicklas , an epidemiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine .
" Why are we targeting sweetened beverages ?
What about Twinkies , what about happy meals , what about chocolate candy ? "
Instead , she said , efforts needed to be focused on education and self - responsibility .
" We should spend our money on educating the public on ways in which they can maintain a healthy weight , teach our children how to live a healthy lifestyle .
Certainly taxing soft drinks is not a way to teach our children how to live a healthy lifestyle , " said Nicklas .
" Where does self - responsibility come in ?
Why can't people take some of the responsibility for their health and making healthier choices ? "
Nicklas said drinking soda and other sugar - containing beverages only accounted for a small part of what makes a person obese .
On that point , she had some agreement with doctors who supported the tax , but said it was just one step .
" It is not the only solution , but as for smoking , it is one part of the effective plan , " said Madelyn Fernstrom , director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 's weight management center .
She disagreed with Nicklas , however , on the role of sugary drinks in obesity .
" There is ample evidence that liquid calories contributes to the obesity epidemic -- not the only cause , but one of them , " said Fernstrom .
" So , a plan to try to alter change ' in the wallet ' is a good one .
In our country , people seem to respond to that kind of plan . "
Katz agreed that taxes would help , but only provide part of the solution to obesity .
" Note that just as taxes are at best a small part of the solution , soda is , at worst , a small part of a very pervasive problem , often referred to as the ' typical American diet . ' "
Questions :
How to encourage academics to contribute to Wikipedia ?
How to increase the amount of good quality articles in Wikipedia ?
Issues :
In order to demonstrate the work they have undertaken ( to funding organisations , to their university , for promotion , for their professional reputation ) academics require :
a ) to be named as authors of their work ,
b ) that their work be their own rather than a mass collaboration ,
c ) that their work be in an academically reputable publication .
[ Note !
All of these issues were raised at GLAM - WIKI ( i.e. I ’m not just making them up ) and all of them can be solved and still remain compliant with the requirements of a free - culture license ( e.g. CC - by - SA ) .
Also , I must mention that the original concept for this proposal grew out of working on The Sydney Journal , a side - project of the Dictionary of Sydney . ]
Problem :
Wikipedia currently has no way of addressing any of these issues due to the very nature of it being an “ anyone can edit ” wiki .
This alienates a large number of academics who are already very interested in learning about and contributing to Wikipedia but have difficulty justifying it as legitimate work .
Quite simply , academics in many countries / institutions must earn “ points ” each year to prove they ’ve been working and thereby justify to government why their institution should continue to receive funding .
The points system is an an effort to provide a fair comparison between qualitatively different fields of academic inquiry but in practice can turn academia into a numbers game .
Some things that earn points are publishing a book , teaching courses and writing scholarly journal articles .
One thing that certainly does n’t earn points is helping to maintain the quality of the content on Wikipedia in the academic ’s area of expertise – this is despite the fact that that is precisely where 90 % of their students will turn to first to get some background information .
A Solution :
“ The Wikipedia Journal ”
Proposal :
The creation of peer - reviewed scholarly e-journal .
Academics would be encouraged to write encyclopedic articles on their area of expertise in accordance with our editorial principles ( including Neutral POV , Verifiability and No Original Research ) and the Wikipedia manual of style .
Their article would be submitted to blind peer - review , as per the best - practices of any academically - rigorous journal , by both relevant academics and also a Wikipedian who had been a major contributor to a Featured Article on a similar topic .
The final articles would be published in an edition of the “ Wikipedia Journal ” ready and available to merge into the existing Wikipedia article on that topic .
[ Note : this proposal is not the same as “ WikiJournal ” on Meta ( the purpose of which is to encourage Original Research scholarship ) or “ Wiki Journal ” on WikiVersity / Wikia ( the purpose of which is to publish articles about Wiki- related scholarship ) . ]
The subjects particularly sought would be intentionally diverse and come in two main forms :
1 ) in part from Wikipedians ’ demand for expert input on a topic ( e.g. articles high on the importance scale but currently low on the quality scale ) and ,
2 ) in part from academics ’ interest in participating ( e.g. to be able to legitimately integrate their previously - published research into Wikipedia ) .
If there were enough content to warrant it the Journal could have themed editions ( e.g. January edition = Psychology , March edition = Astronomy ) or each edition could be broken up into sections based roughly along the academic faculty structure ( Commerce , Law , Medicine , Humanities , Engineering … ) .
The Journal itself would , of course , be Gold Access , under the CC - by - SA license and be registered with an ISSN .
Furthermore , it is probable that the Journal would gain academic prestige ( or at least notoriety ! ) due to three factors :
a ) the number of reputable scholars who have indicated their support for Wikipedia ( and might conceivably be willing to write for the Journal ) giving it credibility by association ;
b ) the likely very high citation impact of the Journal ( a corollary of the popularity of Wikipedia itself ) and our ability to give precise statistics on hits , clickthroughs and utility ( via the currently - being - tested “ reader feedback ” extension ) ;
c ) the virtually unlimited scope of Wikipedia would mean that any academic in any discipline could potentially write an article for the Journal .
Articles , once published , could then be merged into the existing Wikipedia article ( or a new article created if one did not exist before ) and appropriate attribution placed in the external links section of the Wikipedia article to the Author and journal edition .
Also , it might be nice to have a talkpage template indicating that an academic had made substantial contributions to the article .
* Hopefully * the newly refurbished Wikipedia article could then be taken to Featured Article candidacy relatively quickly .
But , the Journal articles would not get any special rights to overwrite the existing article .
It would be up to the Wikipedians who look after the relevant article to decide whether to incorporate the text .
The academic would be encouraged to use make use of the information and references in the existing article ( and read the talkpage debates ) so as not to lose the good work that has already gone before .
Other benefits “ The Wikipedia Journal ” would provide :
– a different media format for people to be able to access the free - culture content of the Wikimedia movement ;
– increased credibility to the Wikimedia movement ;
– an increased awareness in academia about free - culture generally and about Wikipedia ’s editorial standards / requirements specifically ;
– an entry - point for recruiting academics to improve Wikipedia .
After all , authors would have an incentive to monitor the progress of their article once it was merged into Wikipedia and might continue editing more broadly ;
– a product scalable to multiple languages / areas of expertise / countries at minimal cost to Wikimedia funds .
Set Up :
In order to be given up - front academic legitimacy the Journal would need to be sponsored by an academic research funding body ( e.g. the Australian Research Council ) and perhaps also a reputable research - based University .
The research funding would be used to employ an editor ( see below ) and the university required in order to provide a workspace and employment administration ( insurance , superannuation , etc. – assuming a Chapter or the Foundation could n’t / would n ’t / does n’t supply these things ) .
The Journal could be set up as a project of a Wikimedia Chapter , of the Wikimedia Foundation or independently of any existing structure – after all , anyone can write Wikipedia articles !
It would nevertheless , require trademark approval from the Wikimedia Foundation .
The academic legitimacy is much more important here than the funds themselves but the funds would be useful if for no other reason than it avoids having to use money donated by individuals to the Wikimedia movement to pay for it .
It is possible that the research funding organisation would require that the journal be of specific benefit to the research community of that nation , in which case it would be a matter of publishing subjects that were demonstrably of national relevance and / or only accepting authors of that nation ’s universities .
For example , if the Australian Research Council funded / sponsored the Journal then it may require that the articles be in some way related to the Wikipedia [ [ category : Australia ] ] ( or one of its many many sub- categories ) and or be written by an academic employed at one of the Universities in Australia .
If this restriction was placed upon the Journal then would simply give greater impetus for many of the Wikimedia Chapters to organise for funding in their own countries resulting in a whole series of Journals !
The Journal could be administered using the Open Journal System ( which is , of course , F / LOSS ) and published on an instance of Media - Wiki ( perhaps at journal.wikimedia.org or at a sub-domain of the sponsoring Wikimedia Chapter or of the sponsoring university ) .
Articles , editions and volumes could be downloaded in PDF / ODF etc .
Articles would have a named author and author biography and they would have flagged revisions enabled in such a way that people would always see a version approved by the author ( of course , the article would be available for editing at the equivalent Wikipedia article to which it would be linked ) .
The official editions would be archived in journal databases such as google .
scholar , and the Directory of Open Access Journals .
The Role of the Editor :
I suspect that this project would require one person whose responsibilities would be to :
– work with potential authors and find peer - reviewers ;
– manage the editorial workflow ;
– copyedit and wikify the text ;
– manage copyright permissions ;
– publish and distribute the editions through various forms ( blog , email , notification at relevant wiki - projects / academic newsletters ) ;
– ‘ hand - hold ’ academics / reviewers to explain Wikipedia ’s editorial style , especially WP : NOR ( although referencing their own previously published original research would be encouraged ) ;
– encourage the conversion of Journal articles to Wikipedia articles and ( hopefully ) have them listed for Featured Article status ;
– report to the Wikimedian and academic communities about the project ’s progress at conferences , media etc .
– answer the phone …
Having a contactable person you can talk to might be a more comfortable way for some to approach wikipedia rather than through OTRS , mailing lists or talkpages .
Future Potential / Alternative Models :
If demand / funding warranted it the journal could be a series of separate journals for specific topics ( e.g. Molecular Biology , Paleontology , Constitutional Law… ) and / or in different languages .
The former could be achieved through partnership with specific research institutes that would be willing to provide the academic credibility / sponsorship to the publication whilst the latter could be achieved through the support of the Wikimedia Chapters and various nations ’ research funding organisations .
Indeed , it is quite possible that a whole network of peer - reviewed Wikipedia Journals might be established to cater for different languages and different areas of expertise all categorised at journal.wikimedia.org .
It could even become a project that each Wikimedia Chapter sponsors in its own country / language .
[ Edit 1 : Since publishing , I ’ve been made aware of the fact that by and large you can have a “ commissioned journal ” or a “ peer reviewed journal ” but not both at the same time .
This is on the basis that if someone ’s been commissioned to write then they ca n’t be rejected later on by a reviewer .
Perhaps this is a fundamental flaw in my proposal or perhaps this is something that does n’t apply in this case because the subject matter is encyclopedic articles rather than Original Research .
I ’ve since decided to remove the word “ commissioned ” from the proposal completely .
Of course , in practice you can always encourage people to write , it just means they wo n’t necessarily pass the peer - review . ]
[ Edit 2 : After talking with a lot of people it looks like the idea is coming clearer .
The Journal would be peer - reviewed not commissioned .
The Journal would be broad ranging in subject areas .
However , the Journal would be restricted in scope to one country in order to make it managable – therefore it would be called “ the [ insert country name ] Wikipedia Journal ” .
It would not necessarily need research funding , merely the funding and academic legitimacy provided by a university .
It would need a strong and well respected editorial board – this will be the trickiest thing to put in place . ]
The idea , ultimately , is to build a drone that will stay in the sky for five years or more .
But in the meantime , Pentagon wild research arm Darpa will just have to settle for a solar - powered robotic aircraft that flies for a month a time .
Not bad , considering that 's nearly 10 times the current drone endurance record of 3 days , 10 hours .
Darpa just launched the $ 155 million second phase of the project , dubbed " Vulture . "
The idea is to build a drone that can carry a thousand - pound payload for at least thirty days .
If phase one is any guide , ideas for the long - fliers will be pretty wild .
Lockheed 's proposal included a robo - plane with rotating tails that swiveled to collect sunlight .
Aurora Aerospace 's Odysseus concept ( see illo above ) counts on sending three vehicles into the air , and then have them dock together in the stratosphere , Voltron - style .
" This avoids having to fly that huge wing through the turbulent lower atmosphere , and allows an individual section to undock and fly home for repair if needed , " Aviation Week noted .
If that idea sounds too crazy even for the military 's mad scientist bureau , consider this : former Darpa director just joined Aurora 's board .

Comments
Well , it seems Congressman Alan Grayson has breached the unwritten law of modern parliamentary procedure –he told the truth !
He said it bluntly and with nary an “ Esteemed Colleagues ” either .
Well , not the whole truth–he did say that the Republican Health Plan was “ Do n’t get sick , but if you do , die quickly . ”
He forgot the part about “ Work when you should take sick leave or we ’ll dock your pay . ”
I know about that part , I once worked at a company that told that to someone who had flu and then DIED .
Quickly , I might add .
This is n’t merely amazing Democrats , but it ’s absolutely infuriating Republicans .
According to The Nation , NRCC spokesman Ken Spain called it pathological behavior , and Congressman Tom Price of Georgia has introduced a resolution accusing Grayson of “ a breach of decorum and ( degrading ) the integrity and proceedings of the House . ”
Wow .
He should read some of the antics that went on in the 20th century ( or is that too retro ? ) !
Hell , he should turn on C - Span and watch one of the debates in Parliament !
Hey , Tom !
This is n’t the Senate , this is the House !
The People ’s Chamber !
You ’re allowed not to wear a gray suit–and you get much less under - the - table to boot !
Grayson was given a chance for a mea culpa on Wolf Blitzer where he offered an apology –not to the Republicans who demanded it , but to the 44,000 people who die each year under our current excuse for health care .
At the suggestion that he was as bad as Joe Wilson–naturally the Republicans did n’t actually call Joe BAD–Grayson patiently explained the difference between telling the truth and publicly calling the President a liar–to his face –in front of millions of people when Wilson himself did n’t even have the facts straight .
Personally , I think Wilson jumped his cue–which was why the handsitting members of his party gave him dirty looks–it was n’t the point where they had expected to leap from their chairs and cry “ Woot ! ”
But like I said , Alan even amazed Democratic strategist James Carville–never exactly known for being a shrinking violet himself –who , although he admired Grayson ’s courage , said he would have called the Republicans “ regressive ” instead of “ knuckle - dragging Neanderthals “ .
I might be forced to agree with Jim–calling this bunch of obstructionists Neanderthals does a disservice to cavemen everywhere –despite how bad their TV show was !
The cavemen’s , not the Republicans ’ .
While Republicans are united in their own lack of cojones–as long as we all agree to say no , who needs them ?
–the Democrats DO have another guy with brass ones –I ’m referring to Senator Baucus , who presided over the voting down of the public options amendments –the option that most Americans want and 3 out of 4 doctors recommend !
–explaining that he did n’t think they would be able to get 60 votes .
Max–it takes only 51 votes to pass a bill , it only needs 60 when you ’re trying to get it to a vote against a filibuster threat .
Thanks for telling us that not only would you not vote for real healthcare reform , but you ’d side with those who did n’t even want it to be voted on !
Man , the health care lobby has gotten its money ’s worth from YOU !
But the one person in the Democratic Party who SHOULD be showing some nads is the one who ’s showing them the least –the ostensible head of the Party–yes I mean you , Barry ( not that you read any blogs anymore ) .
I know you ’d rather be having photo ops with cute kids and HuffPost readers , but dammit , campaigning ended almost a year ago–it ’s time to be fulfilling some of that hope oil you sold us !
I mean , even Netanyahu knows you ’d never DO anything to back up your pursed lips .
Take a stand on this and ACT on it .
The time for inspiring words alone is passed .
Otherwise , your party ’s leadership is going to pass to a freshman Congressman who actually has the steel ones to stand up for what he says instead of just playing pocket billiards .
Rack ‘em up again , boys , we got a live one .
There has been talk in recent days about the McLaren engine supply .
My German colleagues are adamant that the relationship between McLaren and Mercedes is going to end in divorce as quickly as is “ decently ” possible as Mercedes has found exactly what it wants in buying into Brawn GP .
Everyone is saying all the right things at the moment but beneath the surface of F1 ’s water the legs of the swans are busy , busy , busy .
The fact is that for some time it has been clear that the strategies of McLaren and Mercedes - Benz have been heading in different directions .
Both want to build supercars , but they do n’t appear to want to do it together , as they are both busy developing their brands and they need to be selfish .
The launch of the new McLaren MP4 - 12C the other day ( just before Mercedes pulled the covers off the SLS AMG at the Frankfurt Motor Show ) was a sign of where things are going in the road car markets and that has to have an effect in F1 .
My theory on the subject was that as the McLaren road car now features a McLaren - badged engine the company ’s future in F1 is not going to be with another manufacture .
The engine may be built by sub-contractors but it is clear that McLaren ’s ambition is to become Britain ’s version of Ferrari and designing engines is part of that .
The next step in the brand development of McLaren must be for the company to build McLaren F1 engines .
In any case by going down the chosen path McLaren has narrowed the number of possible F1 engine partners dramatically as no- one will want an alliance if they are selling competing road cars .
And McLaren is not going to gain much in image terms by going to mass market car brands when they are positioning their automotive brand in a much higher and exclusive niche .
Ironically , if McLaren does start making its own engines it more logical , rather than less , for its road car rivals to launch F1 programmes against them and Ferrari – because the likes of Aston Martin , Lamborghini and Porsche are facing stronger competition in the marketplace and so need to create compelling reasons why customers would buy their products , rather than those of their racier rivals .
A successful F1 programme is a very good way of achieving this .
So my feeling is that McLaren ’s future is building its own engines .
Now is a great time to buy up necessary elements to achieve that strategy .
There are good people , great intellectual property and basic hardware ( such as dynos ) available now as manufacturers get out of F1 .
It is therefore entirely logical for McLaren to try to grab some of it .
These things rarely make big news .
I seem to recall that in 1992 Honda withdrew from F1 and sold some of its V12 data to Ferrari , which made sense .
I had a long chat about this subject with McLaren types ( no names ) over the Suzuka weekend and while they accepted that the argument I am putting forward is logical , they are not ready to confirm that this is what is happening .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Many prehistoric Australian aboriginals could have outrun world 100 and 200 meters record holder Usain Bolt in modern conditions .
A cover illustration from Australian anthropologist Peter McAllister 's new book entitled " Manthropology " and sub- titled " The Science of the Inadequate Modern Male . "

Some Tutsi men in Rwanda exceeded the current world high jump record of 2.45 meters during initiation ceremonies in which they had to jump at least their own height to progress to manhood .
Any Neanderthal woman could have beaten former bodybuilder and current California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in an arm wrestle .
These and other eye - catching claims are detailed in a book by Australian anthropologist Peter McAllister entitled “ Manthropology ” and provocatively sub- titled “ The Science of the Inadequate Modern Male . ”
McAllister sets out his stall in the opening sentence of the prologue .
“ If you ’re reading this then you -- or the male you have bought it for -- are the worst man in history .
“ No ifs , no buts -- the worst man , period ... As a class we are in fact the sorriest cohort of masculine Homo sapiens to ever walk the planet . ”
Delving into a wide range of source material McAllister finds evidence he believes proves that modern man is inferior to his predecessors in , among other fields , the basic Olympic athletics disciplines of running and jumping .
His conclusions about the speed of Australian aboriginals 20,000 years ago are based on a set of footprints , preserved in a fossilized claypan lake bed , of six men chasing prey .
FLEET-FOOTED ABORIGINALS
An analysis of the footsteps of one of the men , dubbed T8 , shows he reached speeds of 37 kph on a soft , muddy lake edge .
Bolt , by comparison , reached a top speed of 42 kph during his then world 100 meters record of 9.69 seconds at last year ’s Beijing Olympics .
In an interview in the English university town of Cambridge where he was temporarily resident , McAllister said that , with modern training , spiked shoes and rubberized tracks , aboriginal hunters might have reached speeds of 45 kph .
“ We can assume they are running close to their maximum if they are chasing an animal , ” he said .
“ But if they can do that speed of 37 kph on very soft ground I suspect there is a strong chance they would have outdone Usain Bolt if they had all the advantages that he does .
“ We can tell that T8 is accelerating toward the end of his tracks . ”
McAllister said it was probable that any number of T8 ’s contemporaries could have run as fast .
“ We have to remember too how incredibly rare these fossilizations are , ” he said .
“ What are the odds that you would get the fastest runner in Australia at that particular time in that particular place in such a way that was going to be preserved ? ”
Turning to the high jump , McAllister said photographs taken by a German anthropologist showed young men jumping heights of up to 2.52 meters in the early years of last century .
STARK DECLINE
“ It was an initiation ritual , everybody had to do it .
They had to be able to jump their own height to progress to manhood , ” he said .
“ It was something they did all the time and they lived very active lives from a very early age .
They developed very phenomenal abilities in jumping .
They were jumping from boyhood onwards to prove themselves . ”
McAllister said a Neanderthal woman had 10 percent more muscle bulk than modern European man .
Trained to capacity she would have reached 90 percent of Schwarzenegger ’s bulk at his peak in the 1970s .
“ But because of the quirk of her physiology , with a much shorter lower arm , she would slam him to the table without a problem , ” he said .
Manthropology abounds with other examples :
* Roman legions completed more than one - and - a - half marathons a day carrying more than half their body weight in equipment .
* Athens employed 30,000 rowers who could all exceed the achievements of modern oarsmen .
* Australian aboriginals threw a hardwood spear 110 meters or more ( the current world javelin record is 98.48 ) .
McAllister said it was difficult to equate the ancient spear with the modern javelin but added : “ Given other evidence of Aboriginal man ’s superb athleticism you ’d have to wonder whether they could n’t have taken out every modern javelin event they entered . ”
Why the decline ?
“ We are so inactive these days and have been since the industrial revolution really kicked into gear , ” McAllister replied .
“ These people were much more robust than we were .
“ We do n’t see that because we convert to what things were like about 30 years ago .
There ’s been such a stark improvement in times , technique has improved out of sight , times and heights have all improved vastly since then but if you go back further it ’s a different story .
“ At the start of the industrial revolution there are statistics about how much harder people worked then .
“ The human body is very plastic and it responds to stress .
We have lost 40 percent of the shafts of our long bones because we have much less of a muscular load placed upon them these days .
“ We are simply not exposed to the same loads or challenges that people were in the ancient past and even in the recent past so our bodies have n’t developed .
Even the level of training that we do , our elite athletes , does n’t come close to replicating that .
“ We would n’t want to go back to the brutality of those days but there are some things we would do well to profit from . ”
BRUSSELS 
After months of complaints by European dairy farmers angry over low prices , protesters in Brussels on Monday poured milk onto the streets , hurled eggs and other missiles , and started fires that filled the air with black smoke .
Police helicopters hovered overhead as hundreds of tractors  and some cattle  blockaded the area outside the European Union ’s headquarters while agriculture ministers met in an emergency meeting .
The gathering of ministers , convened after pressure from France , failed to produce any breakthroughs apart from a decision to set up a committee to report on the dairy industry in June .
Monday ’s protest was the latest by farmers who dumped around three million liters of milk on fields in Belgium last month .

Note : the discussion below applies to work in progress that might show up in Firefox 3.7 .
It does not describe features in Firefox 3.6 .
This post is from Jonathan Kew and John Daggett .
He ’s supplied a 5 minute video that shows some of the features on the fly .
If you ’re a total font nerd and you enjoy a soothing British accent , you might want to watch it .
Using @font - face allows web designers a wide palette of font choices and with commercial font vendors supporting the WOFF font format , the set of font choices should improve even more .
So the next step is clearly to try and make better use of features available in these fonts .
For many years , “ smart ” font formats such as OpenType and AAT have provided font designers ways of including a rich set of variations in their fonts , from ligatures and swashes to small caps and tabular figures .
The OpenType specification describes these features , identifying each with a unique feature tag .
But these have typically only been available to those using professional publishing applications such as Adobe InDesign .
Firefox currently renders using font defaults ; it would be much more interesting to provide web authors with a way of controlling these font features via CSS .
Håkon Wium Lie of Opera , based on discussions with Tal Leming and Adam Twardoch , proposed extending the CSS ‘ font - variant ’ property to include values for font features .
Mozilla is actively working on a new proposal along these lines .
This is a fairly big addition to CSS , so it will most likely involve some complex discussions about how best to support these features .
Experimental Implementation
As part of this effort , Jonathan Kew has been working on porting a portion of the Pango library for use with handling complex scripts and to enable the use of font features on all supported platforms .
He currently has an experimental build that uses a special CSS property to associate a list of OpenType features with specific elements in a page .
This is not the proposed format , it simply provides a better way of discussing possible sets of font - variant properties and the OpenType feature settings to which they should map .
.altstyles { /* format : feature - tag= [ 0,1 ] with 0 to disable , 1 to enable */ - moz - font - feature - opentype : " dlig=1,ss01=1 " ; }
The feature setting string above implies rendering with discretionary ligatures ( dlig ) and the first set of stylistic alternates ( ss01 ) .
An example using Jack Usine ’s MEgalopolis Extra :
This font makes extensive use of OpenType features ; the homepage of the font contains a sample rendering that uses many of these features .
Below is a rendering of the same sample written in HTML with OpenType features enabled :
Tabular Figures for Numerical Alignment
OpenType features also enable better control over alignment .
When numbers are listed in tabular form , proportional forms often result in the misalignment of digits across rows , making the list harder to scan .
With tabular alignment enabled , individual digits are rendered using a fixed width so that digits align across rows :

Automatic fractions are also possible with OpenType features , note the inline use of fractional forms in the recipe ingredient list below :
Language Sensitivity
OpenType also includes support for features on a per-language basis .
This is important for rendering text correctly in some languages .
For example , Turkish uses both a dotted - i and a dotless - i , so the distinction needs to be preserved when rendering ligatures or small caps .

Historical Text
The way text is rendered constantly evolves ; glyphs once in common use often morph into other forms , making the historical forms distinct from their modern forms .

Berkeley --
A study led by researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , has identified critical biochemical pathways linked to the aging of human muscle .
By manipulating these pathways , the researchers were able to turn back the clock on old human muscle , restoring its ability to repair and rebuild itself .
The findings will be reported in the Sept. 30 issue of the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine , a peer - reviewed , scientific publication of the European Molecular Biology Organization .
" Our study shows that the ability of old human muscle to be maintained and repaired by muscle stem cells can be restored to youthful vigor given the right mix of biochemical signals , " said Professor Irina Conboy , a faculty member in the graduate bioengineering program that is run jointly by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco , and head of the research team conducting the study .
" This provides promising new targets for forestalling the debilitating muscle atrophy that accompanies aging , and perhaps other tissue degenerative disorders as well . "
Previous research in animal models led by Conboy , who is also an investigator at the Berkeley Stem Cell Center and at the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences ( QB3 ) , revealed that the ability of adult stem cells to do their job of repairing and replacing damaged tissue is governed by the molecular signals they get from surrounding muscle tissue , and that those signals change with age in ways that preclude productive tissue repair .
Those studies have also shown that the regenerative function in old stem cells can be revived given the appropriate biochemical signals .
What was not clear until this new study was whether similar rules applied for humans .
Unlike humans , laboratory animals are bred to have identical genes and are raised in similar environments , noted Conboy , who received a New Faculty Award from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine ( CIRM ) that helped fund this research .
Moreover , the typical human lifespan lasts seven to eight decades , while lab mice are reaching the end of their lives by age 2 .
Working in collaboration with Dr. Michael Kjaer and his research group at the Institute of Sports Medicine and Centre of Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , the UC Berkeley researchers compared samples of muscle tissue from nearly 30 healthy men who participated in an exercise physiology study .
The young subjects ranged from age 21 to 24 and averaged 22.6 years of age , while the old study participants averaged 71.3 years , with a span of 68 to 74 years of age .
In experiments conducted by Dr. Charlotte Suetta , a post - doctoral researcher in Kjaer 's lab , muscle biopsies were taken from the quadriceps of all the subjects at the beginning of the study .
The men then had the leg from which the muscle tissue was taken immobilized in a cast for two weeks to simulate muscle atrophy .
After the cast was removed , the study participants exercised with weights to regain muscle mass in their newly freed legs .
Additional samples of muscle tissue for each subject were taken at three days and again at four weeks after cast removal , and then sent to UC Berkeley for analysis .
Morgan Carlson and Michael Conboy , researchers at UC Berkeley , found that before the legs were immobilized , the adult stem cells responsible for muscle repair and regeneration were only half as numerous in the old muscle as they were in young tissue .
That difference increased even more during the exercise phase , with younger tissue having four times more regenerative cells that were actively repairing worn tissue compared with the old muscle , in which muscle stem cells remained inactive .
The researchers also observed that old muscle showed signs of inflammatory response and scar formation during immobility and again four weeks after the cast was removed .
" Two weeks of immobilization only mildly affected young muscle , in terms of tissue maintenance and functionality , whereas old muscle began to atrophy and manifest signs of rapid tissue deterioration , " said Carlson , the study 's first author and a UC Berkeley post - doctoral scholar funded in part by CIRM .
" The old muscle also did n't recover as well with exercise .
This emphasizes the importance of older populations staying active because the evidence is that for their muscle , long periods of disuse may irrevocably worsen the stem cells ' regenerative environment . "
At the same time , the researchers warned that in the elderly , too rigorous an exercise program after immobility may also cause replacement of functional muscle by scarring and inflammation .
" It 's like a Catch - 22 , " said Conboy .
The researchers further examined the response of the human muscle to biochemical signals .
They learned from previous studies that adult muscle stem cells have a receptor called Notch , which triggers growth when activated .
Those stem cells also have a receptor for the protein TGF - beta that , when excessively activated , sets off a chain reaction that ultimately inhibits a cell 's ability to divide .
The researchers said that aging in mice is associated in part with the progressive decline of Notch and increased levels of TGF - beta , ultimately blocking the stem cells ' capacity to effectively rebuild the body .
This study revealed that the same pathways are at play in human muscle , but also showed for the first time that mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase was an important positive regulator of Notch activity essential for human muscle repair , and that it was rendered inactive in old tissue .
MAP kinase ( MAPK ) is familiar to developmental biologists since it is an important enzyme for organ formation in such diverse species as nematodes , fruit flies and mice .
For old human muscle , MAPK levels are low , so the Notch pathway is not activated and the stem cells no longer perform their muscle regeneration jobs properly , the researchers said .
When levels of MAPK were experimentally inhibited , young human muscle was no longer able to regenerate .
The reverse was true when the researchers cultured old human muscle in a solution where activation of MAPK had been forced .
In that case , the regenerative ability of the old muscle was significantly enhanced .
" The fact that this MAPK pathway has been conserved throughout evolution , from worms to flies to humans , shows that it is important , " said Conboy .
" Now we know that it plays a key role in regulation and aging of human tissue regeneration .
In practical terms , we now know that to enhance regeneration of old human muscle and restore tissue health , we can either target the MAPK or the Notch pathways .
The ultimate goal , of course , is to move this research toward clinical trials . "

Other co-authors of the EMBO Molecular Medicine paper include Abigail Mackey at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , and Per Aagaard at the University of Southern Denmark .
The National Institutes of Health , the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine , the Danish Medical Research Council and the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research helped support this research .
Scientists have identified a cluster of galaxies further from earth than anything else that has ever been detected in the skies .
The cluster now known as JKCS041 is so far away that it has taken three quarters of the lifetime of the universe for its light to reach earth .
Its distance , 10.2 billion light years away , beats the previous record by about a billion light years .
It is also of almost unimaginable size , containing hundreds of galaxies , though at such a distance it cannot be seen directly even through the most powerful telescope .
Its existence has been deduced from data obtained with optical and infra red telescopes by Nasa 's Chandra X - Ray Observatory .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
JKCS041 was first detected in 2006 by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope , in Hawaii .
Originally , scientists were not sure that it was a true galaxy cluster , rather than one caught in the process of forming when the universe was still comparatively young .
It was also impossible to tell simply from telescope observations how far away it was .
Dr Ben Maughan , from the University of Bristol , carried out a long - term analysis of the Chandra X - ray data which has finally proved JKCS041 was a fully - formed cluster , less than four billion years after Big Bang .
At that distance , the cluster could add to what scientists know about the origin of the universe .
Ten billion years ago is reckoned to be right at the beginning of the epoch when star clusters , the largest gravitationally - bound objects in the universe , first started to form .
Studying its composition , mass and temperature should therefore reveal something about how the universe was formed .
The search is on for other galaxies at extreme distances .
Before JKCS041 , the most distant one known to science was XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 , discovered in 2006 by the European Space Agency 's X - ray satellite observatory , XMM - Newton .
It was 9.2 billion light years away , beating the previous record by 0.1 billion light years .
Dr Maughan said : " This discovery is exciting because it is like finding a Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil that is much older than any other known .
" One fossil might just fit in with our understanding of dinosaurs , but if you found many more you would have to start rethinking how dinosaurs evolved .
The same is true for galaxy clusters and our understanding of cosmology . "
Stefano Andreon of the National Institute for Astrophysics ( INAF ) in Milan , Italy , said : " This object is close to the distance limit expected for a galaxy cluster .
We do n't think gravity can work fast enough to make galaxy clusters much earlier .
" What 's exciting about this discovery is the astrophysics that can be done with detailed follow - up studies . "
The discovery is another coup for the Chandra observatory , which has just passed its tenth anniversary .
It was launched into orbit aboard a space shuttle in July 1999 , ushering in what scientists say has been an unprecedented decade for discovering the high energy universe .
Chandra has an unrivalled capacity to create high resolution X ray images , which have advanced the study of phenomena as diverse as comets , black holes , dark matter and dark energy .
You know what , is IS like he stepped on a kitten .

The report into how allegations of child sex abuse by priests in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin were dealt with by the State and church authorities is expected to be published by the Government late next week .
The report is likely to be discussed by the Cabinet on Tuesday after the High Court ruled yesterday that most of it can be published .
Mr Justice Paul Gilligan excluded from publication , at least until May 5th next , one chapter relating to a particular priest on grounds it could prejudice criminal proceedings against that cleric .
He also directed that some 21 references to the same individual in other parts of the report should also not be published for now .
The Commission of Investigation , Dublin Archdiocese , chaired by Ms Justice Yvonne Murphy and assisted by barrister Ita Mangan and solicitor Hugh O’Neill , began its inquiry in March 2006 .
It investigated how allegations of child sex abuse against a sample of 46 priests were handled by State and church authorities in the Dublin archdiocese between January 1975 and April 2004 , when Cardinal Desmond Connell retired as archbishop .
The commission presented its report to Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern last July .
On the advice of Attorney General Paul Gallagher , he sent it to the High Court .
Under the Commission of Investigation Act , 2004 , the Minister for Justice must seek direction from the High Court before publishing a commission report which it is believed could prejudice criminal proceedings .
It is believed that at least four of the priests investigated by the Dublin commission face abuse charges , though it is understood that yesterday ’s High Court decisions concern just one man .
His trial is scheduled for April 2010 .
At private hearings on October 1st and 2nd last , Mr Justice Gilligan heard submissions on the report from the Attorney General , the Director of Public Prosecutions and representatives of those against whom criminal proceedings are pending .
He heard further submissions yesterday before delivering his written judgment , publicly , in the afternoon .
His ruling was welcomed by Marie Collins and Andrew Madden , both of whom were abused by priests of the Dublin archdiocese , and by Mr Ahern , as well as One in Four and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre .
The report is over 700 pages long and is expected to name 14 priests / former priests who served in the archdiocese , 10 of whom have been convicted of abuse .
It is understood the commission investigation paid particular attention to the handling of allegations by State and church authorities including 19 bishops , four of them archbishops of Dublin .
These are Archbishop John Charles McQuaid , Archbishop Dermot Ryan , Archbishop Kevin McNamara and Cardinal Desmond Connell .
Thirteen of the remaining 15 bishops were or are auxiliary bishops of Dublin .
They include Bishop Joseph Carroll ( deceased ) , Bishop Brendan Comiskey ( who resigned as bishop of Ferns in 2002 ) , Bishop Martin Drennan ( Galway ) , Bishop Patrick Dunne ( deceased ) , Bishop Ray Field ( a current auxiliary bishop of Dublin ) , Bishop Laurence Forristal ( retired bishop of Ossory ) .
Also involved are Bishop James Kavanagh ( deceased ) , Bishop Jim Moriarty ( Kildare and Leighlin ) , Bishop Donal Murray ( Limerick ) , Bishop Dermot O’Mahony ( retired ) , Bishop Fiachra Ó Ceallaigh ( retired auxiliary bishop of Dublin ) , Bishop Eamonn Walsh ( a current auxiliary bishop of Dublin and apostolic administrator to Ferns diocese from April 2002 to April 2006 ) , and Bishop Desmond Williams ( deceased ) .
Father Sinnott has spent over 40 years helping various Filipino communities The Philippines has asked the country 's largest Muslim separatist group to help find and free a kidnapped Irish priest .
Reports say Michael Sinnott was seized by gunmen in Zamboanga then put on a speedboat and taken to Lanao , both on the southern island of Mindanao .
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has vowed to work to free Reverend Sinnott .
A Philippine military spokesman says it has not ruled out the abductors could be Muslim rebels who have disobeyed a guerrilla edict on ransom kidnappings .
Military intelligence suggests a " notorious pirate " in Zamboanga , Guingona Samal , was behind the plot and provided the speedboat used by up to six armed gunmen to whisk Michael Sinnott away , reports say .
Samal is said to be well known in the region for robberies against fishermen and kidnap - for - ransom attempts .
' Heart problems ' Father Sinnott - a Columban priest who is in his late seventies - is being held in a jungle camp somewhere near Sultan Naga Dimaporo , where rebels of the MILF have a heavy presence , Maj Gen Benjamin Dolorfino said .
" He is very frail because of recent heart surgery .
We will exhaust all peaceful means to get him , although there is always [ the ] military option , " he added .
A senior rebel commander with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front , Mohaqher Iqbal , says forces have been mobilised to pinpoint the exact location of the Catholic priest .
" We are ready to help the government recover the priest , " the rebel leader told reporters .
The Philippine military says hundreds of army troops have circled the area where Father Sinnott is believed held and that their greatest concern is that the abductors may have dealings with the radical Abu Sayyaf group , who have links to al - Qaeda .
A tentative ceasefire is still in place between the Philippine army and rebels of the MILF , believed to number around 11,000 , who just a few months ago were involved in heavy fighting in the south of the country in which hundreds of people were killed and hundreds of thousands more displaced .

There is a nice selection of Android Phones available and upcoming , but everybody wants to know when we ’ll get a nice bump from the seemingly standard 528 MHz processor to something a bit beefier .
Well if the name has anything to do with it , the HTC Dragon could come with Qualcomm ’s 1GHz processor which I think is safe to say would be awesome .
But right now , this is just rumor topped with speculation from a few modders with a leak .
Reignzone ( and a few others ) from XDA Developers got ahold of an experimental HTC build and the rest is history :
So , what I ’ve got here is a little build we ’re referring to as the “ Pet Dragon ” .
It ’s highly experimental at the moment … and from what I have noticed after reviewing the build .
prop files from this “ system dump ” of the device I spoke of earlier today … HTC Dragon .
( dubbed “ Zoom 2 ″ ) —> the screen resolution is 800×480 … which as you can tell is quite an impressive resolution .
Judging from the release keys , it ’s also a capacitive touch screen device .
Now , having said all this …it IS NOT the HTC Leo , HTC Desire , or Passion .
Because this device is in fact operating on the “ 2.0 ″ firmware along with the HTC Sense user interface applied for style .
So , it ’s like an “ Eclair Hero ” .
Lol .
Unzip the packaged files , and enjoy .
But again , bare with me …it ’s still very “ bare bones ” and needs a lot of work … but this device is going to be a GAME CHANGER !
Perhaps more so than the HTC Leo !
I ’m liking that “ GAME CHANGER ” name .
Here are some screenshots with a device purportedly running the build .
Remember … they do n’t have the HARDWARE in hand but instead are running the HTC Dragon software on existing hardware :
You can see the above image says “ 1.5 ” but they say that its operating on the 2.0 firmware with HTC Sense which is curious .
They also say it will ship with the “ latest ” version of Android when it launches … whatever that might be – probably 2.0 .

The find has been likened to the discovery of a treasure trove Geologists in southern India say they have found hundreds of dinosaur egg clusters which could be about 65 million years old .
It was a chance find discovered when a team of scientists were locating a place to excavate an ancient riverbed in the state of Tamil Nadu .
As they dug deeper they saw layers of what looked like fossilised eggs .
The photos and samples were then sent to various universities who confirmed that they were dinosaur eggs .
Each egg is the size of a football - about 13 to 23cm in diameter , lying buried in sandy nests .
The leader of the team , MU Ramkumar , told the BBC the finding is significant and could help to unravel the mystery about the extinction of dinosaurs .
' Infertile '
" The important finding is that these eggs have been found in different layers that means the dinosaurs came to the place over and over year after year , " he said .
Sauropods are renowned for their size " The second important thing is that we have got volcanic ash deposits on the eggs which suggests that volcanic activity could have caused their extinction .
" The other thing we have found is that all these eggs are unhatched and infertile .
So what made the eggs infertile ?
We need to carry out further studies to learn more from the findings . "
Scientists believe the eggs belong to the docile leaf - eating Sauropod branch of dinosaurs .
Their remains have been dug up on every continent , including Antarctica .
Palaeontologists use the term to describe large , four - legged , plant - eating dinosaurs with bulky bodies , long necks and tails and tiny heads with relatively small brains .
Dr Ramkumar and his team have called on the central and state governments to protect what they are calling a " Jurassic treasure trove " .
The presence of dinosaur eggs was first recorded in the same district by a British geologist in the 1860s .
In the 1990s a dinosaur egg was found in a government - owned factory in the state .

Sept. 21 , 2009  --
On five Sunday talk shows , Barack Obama has perhaps appeared before the American people more often than any modern president at this point in his term -- by some estimates , three times as much as his predecessors , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
The media blitz also included stints on Jay Leno and The David Letterman Show on Monday .
" My calculation is that , at the end of today , the president will have appeared , in terms of national print and broadcast media , about 124 times , up to this point in his term , " Robert Reich , co-founder of The American Prospect and former labor secretary in the Clinton administration .
But in all this zeal to reach the American public , Obama 's ability to articulate his wide - reaching agenda pushes some analysts to ask if he has overloaded his political plate .
The president who promised change has a super agenda : health care , the economy , Afghanistan , the European missile defense system , the Middle East and climate change , not to mention issues of racism and a swine flu pandemic .
Some Charge Overexposure in Media
Media overexposure , say some , is the least of his problems .
" Most people say you have to break some eggs to get an omelet , but with Obama , the eggs are broken and the omelet is still far from made , " said presidential historian and ABC News consultant Richard Norton Smith .
" To some degree we are in uncharted water , " he told ABCNews.com .
" History suggests that particularly in hard times , it becomes more difficult for a president to implement so ambitious an agenda . "
In the inevitable comparisons to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt , which brought seismic change to American government after three years of the Great Depression , Obama 's presidency is unique .
" Roosevelt had three years of economic despair to capitalize on , " said Smith .
" He was able to tap into the anger . "
Obama , on the other hand , worked closely with the Bush administration in its final months to bail out the banking system .
" Obama is paying the price for being responsible , " said Smith .
" It 's really not much of a rallying cry under the slogan , ' It could have been worse . ' "
Frustration with Obama 's health care agenda mounted last week , as he deflected former President Jimmy Carter 's charges that those angered by the president 's attempt at reform were " racist . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lip quivered when she wondered aloud if violence could ensue , remembering the slaying of gay activist Harvey Milk in San Francisco in 1978 .
" Mrs. Pelosi had a point , " said Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan , who served as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
" Things get high , " she said on ABC's " This Week " with George Stephanopoulos , " It 's always good to cool things down .
But , essentially , what we have here is a very new president .
He 's only been here for 10 months .
He is a young man .
He did n't have deep , long , profound experience . "
Noonan suggested that important issues are being clouded because Obama 's ambitious agenda appears all over the map .
" He is attempting right now to change , what is it , 17 percent , 18 percent of the GNP of the United States of America , changing how it works , health care , " she said .
" But on top of that , people are thinking about -- in America -- the economy , unemployment , war and peace , two wars that are going . "
" This president , who is new and young , comes along and says , " Oh , that 's not the issue .
The issue is health care . "
It seems not like a program , but a non sequitur , " Noonan said .
Obama admitted in a Sunday interview with ABC News that he needs to do a better job of communicating his vision for health care reform and said the popular uproar had been " humbling . "
Obama Worries He 's ' Not Breaking Through '
" I think there have been times where I have said I 've got to step up my game in terms of talking to the American people about issues like health care , " he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos , who asked if the president had " lost control " of the debate .
" Well , not so much lost control , but where I 've said to myself , somehow I 'm not breaking through , " Obama responded .
Noonan said most modern presidents overdo it on the media circuit .
" They get their face in your face every day , all the time , " she said .
" It 's boorish , and it makes people not lean towards you , but lean away from you , no matter what the merits of the issue . "
But Reich , her co-panelist on the ABC round table , disagreed , saying that " the face that we see is one of dignity and gravitas and utter reasonableness .
" He is taking the initiative , " said Reich .
" He knows that if there 's any lull right now , his opponents are going to jump into that lull .
And it 's very important that he educate the public about what 's going on . "
Obama Super Agenda At Risk
What 's going on is enough to cause the most experienced politician presidential stress .
Though the president said in his Sunday interviews he was confident he would sign a health care bill into law , and welcomed Republicans to the effort , he added , " I do n't count on them . "
On the defense front , Obama girded for criticism over scuttling a plan under President George W. Bush to deploy 10 missile interceptors in Poland and a related radar installation in the Czech Republic .
He told CBS 's " Face the Nation , " " My task here was not to negotiate with the Russians .
The Russians do n't make determinations about what our defense posture is . "
On Afghanistan , now being called " Obama 's War , " the president told ABC he is " skeptical " about sending in more troops .
On CNN's " State of the Union " with John King , he said he did n't want to be rushed to commit to a new strategy until General Stanley McChrystal , commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan , makes an assessment of the recent addition of 21,000 troops .
Other crises out of the president 's control have also weighed heavily on his agenda .
Obama has pledged to check the global spread of swine flu by making 10 per cent of the H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization .
And as the United States enters the fall flu season and infections rise , Americans are waiting for the October delivery of the swine flu vaccine .
Obama was asked if he wanted his own family vaccinated .
He told CNN the vaccine will go to high - risk groups first .
" We want to get vaccinated , " he said of his own family .
" We think it 's the right thing to do .
We will stand in line like everybody else and when folks say it 's our turn , that 's when we 'll get it . "
And though Obama admits he has n't followed the case of the activist group ACORN closely , he said there should be an investigation into the hidden - camera video involving ACORN employees and a couple posing as a prostitute and her pimp .
This week , Congress cut off funding to the activist group , which had nearly $ 1 million embezzled by its founder 's brother and has been accused of voter registration fraud .
Bigger Problems , Bigger Government ?
As Obama 's problems get bigger , columnist Noonan said she worries that government will also get bigger .
" I understand the anger , " she said .
" They 're going to make it more expensive now , " she said of fears about health care reform .
" And they 're going to make it more intrusive in my life , forcing me to buy , say , insurance if I do n't want to or a penalty if I do n't , " she said .
" Do I want that now , with the economy in the shape it's in and with being worried about my nephew , who 's over in Afghanistan and is he coming back ?
No , I do n't think that 's where people are . "
Obama Likely to Win Health Reform
She said the president will likely win some sort of health - care reform .
" There will be a headline that says ' Obama gets health insurance ' -- or whatever he gets , however it 's put -- but I think it will be a sort of victory that makes people think , ' That 's not what we need . ' "
But Robert Shrum , who was a senior adviser to Al Gore 's 2000 presidential campaign , said Obama should continue to use what he called the " biggest megaphone " to push for change .
" He does n't have any choice about what 's on his plate , " Shrum told ABCNews.com .
" He understands that if he does not do health care in the first year alone , it wo n't be done at all .
" He has to do the economy and he has to do financial reform and he has to deal with foreign policy crises and the climate change imperative , " said Shrum , who expects Obama to pass health care reform and get a fight over climate change next year .
He compared the current president to John F. Kennedy who got " almost every big decision right -- on the new economics and on civil rights and trade and the Cuban missile crisis . "
" You do n't pick these things , " said Shrum .
" Bill Clinton said his greatest regret was being president in quiet times . "
His mission is to convey the rarely told story of professional basketball ’s roots .
“ Everybody thinks it started in 1947 , with the N.B.A. , and they have no idea what professional basketball was like prior to the N.B.A. ” Abdul - Jabbar , a Hall of Fame center who is now an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers , said during an interview at the Armory .
“ In that era , it was a time when sports were segregated .
A lot of people I talked to , interviewing them for the documentary , did n’t even know that the N.B.A. itself was segregated for its first three years of existence . ”
Abdul - Jabbar , the film ’s producer , said he always wanted to make the documentary first .
“ But given that nobody knows the story , this story is so obscure , I had to put it in writing first , ” he said , chuckling .
The Rens won the first professional basketball title in 1939 , defeating the Oshkosh All - Stars at the Chicago Coliseum .
Last week , the Armory served as a stand - in for the Coliseum as a handful of former college players , dressed in tight jerseys and shorts , re-created the scene , with crisp passing , two - handed set shots and almost no dribbling .
Abdul - Jabbar interviewed dozens of people for the film , including the N.B.A. legends Bill Russell , Jerry West and Julius Erving , the musicians Wynton Marsalis and will .i.am , the poet Maya Angelou , the actor Samuel L. Jackson and the director Spike Lee .
He also interviewed John Wooden , his former coach at U.C.L.A. , who played against the Rens ; and John Isaacs , a key Rens player , who died this year at age 93 .
“ They called him the Boy Wonder , ” said Abdul - Jabbar , who sat down with Isaacs two years ago , during the early stages of filming .
“ We were lucky to get that . ”

It 's Breast Cancer Awareness Month again and from shore to shore the country is awash in a sea of pink - from pink ribbons and donation boxes to pink products , charity promotions , celebrities by the score and even pink cleats on NFL players .
Tragically , most people are unaware of the dark history of Breast Cancer Awareness Month ( BCAM ) and of the players past and present who have misused it to direct people and funds away from finding a true cure while covering up their own roles in causing and profiting from cancer .
Most people are unaware that the BCAM idea was conceived and paid for by the British chemical company Imperial Chemical Industries ( ICI ) , a company that both profited from the ever - growing cancer epidemic and contributed to its causes .
The American subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries , ICI / Astra -Zeneca , manufactures tamoxifen , the world`s top - selling cancer drug used for breast cancer .
ICI itself is in the business of manufacturing and selling synthetic chemicals and is one of the world 's largest producers and users of chlorine .
Although BCAM was co-founded along with two non-profit organizations and although some big name companies were quick to associate with BCAM , for the first several years , BCAM`s bills were paid by ICI 's Zeneca Pharmaceuticals .
As the controlling sponsor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month ( BCAM ) , Zeneca was able to approve - or veto - any promotional or informational materials , posters , advertisements , etc. that BCAM uses .
The focus is strictly limited to information regarding early detection and treatment , avoiding the topic of prevention and the role toxins may play .
A further look at the major players in breast cancer awareness may give plenty of insight as to why a growing number of critics are asking why such is the case .
Take Zeneca for example ; it later merged into Astra - Zeneca and in 2008 , ICI / Astra-Zeneca changed its name to AzkoNobel and reported annual sales of over 22 Billion Dollars .
ICI has long been among the world 's largest manufacturers of pesticides , plastics , and pharmaceuticals .
Its Perry , Ohio , chemical plant was once identified as the third - largest source of potential cancer - causing pollution in the United States , releasing 53,000 pounds of recognized carcinogens into the air in 1996 .
After Zeneca acquired the Salick chain of cancer treatment centers in 1997 and then merged with the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra to form AstraZeneca , creating the world`s third - largest drug concern , Dr. Samuel Epstein , a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois School of Public Health stated , " This is a conflict of interest unparalleled in the history of American medicine . " " You`ve got a company that`s a spinoff of one of the world`s biggest manufacturers of carcinogenic chemicals , they`ve got control of breast cancer treatment , they`ve got control of the chemoprevention [ studies ] , and now they have control of cancer treatment in eleven centers - which are clearly going to be prescribing the drugs they manufacture .
" The breakdown of $ 14 Billion in profits for ICI in 1997 was 49 percent from pesticides and other industrial chemicals , another 49 percent from pharmaceutical sales , and the remaining 2 percent from health care services including 11 cancer treatment centers .
Zeneca 's herbicide acetochlor is classified by the EPA as a " probable human carcinogen " , and AstraZeneca sold it until a corporate reorganization in 2000 , accounted for around $ 300 million in sales in 1997 .
Their product tamoxifen citrate ( Nolvadex ) accounted for $ 500 million in 1997 sales .
Cancer prevention would clearly conflict with Zeneca 's business plan .
Quickly jumping onboard the tamoxifen bandwagon was the National Cancer Institute , which announced in April 1998 that breast cancer could be " prevented " by treating women continuously with a powerful drug called tamoxifen .
The New York Times editorialized on April 8th that treating women with tamoxifen is a " breast cancer breakthrough . "
However , The Times acknowledged that treating 1,000 women with tamoxifen for five years would prevent 17 breast cancers but would cause an additional 12 cases of endometrial cancer and 20 cases of serious blood clots in the same 1,000 women .
As recent studies have shown , the risks implied in those less - than breakthrough figures were vastly understated .
Last month , Natural News reported a study just published in Cancer Research which concluded that long - term use of tamoxifen increases the risk of getting aggressive cancer in the other breast by 440 percent .
See :
Other large corporations which contribute to breast cancer awareness also have a vested interest in breast cancer .
General Electric sells upwards of $ 100 million annually in mammography machines .
General Electric has also been a major polluter of carcinogenic PCBs in the Hudson River .
An estimated million pounds of PCBs lie buried at the bottom of a 40 - mile stretch of the Hudson , where GE dumped PCB oil until the mid-1970s , contaminating the entire 200 - mile length of the river below Hudson FallsDuPont , another huge chemical company and major polluter , supplies much of the film used in mammography machines .
Both DuPont and GE aggressively promote mammography screening of women in their 40s , despite the risk of its contributing to breast cancer in that age group .
And while biotech giant Monsanto sponsors Breast Cancer Awareness Month 's high profile event , the Race for the Cure , it continues to profit from the production of many known carcinogens .
Another large player is Bristol - Myers Squibb ( BMS ) , with their Tour of Hope and promotions such as 10 cent donations for drug store sales of selected BMS products .
BMS is also the manufacturer of Taxol ( under the trade name of Paclitaxel ) , considered to be " the gold standard " of chemo drugs .
As Natural News reported earlier this month , the so - called gold standard has more than lost its luster , as was presented at 27th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium : " German investigators from Friedrich - Schiller University in Jena , have shown that taxol ( the " gold standard of chemo " ) causes a massive release of cells into circulation .
" Such a release of cancer cells would result in extensive metastasis months or even years later , long after the chemo would be suspected as the cause of the spread of the cancer .
This little known horror of conventional cancer treatment needs to be spread far and wide , but it is not even listed in the side effects of taxol .
" See :
The list of corporate donors and players in Breast Cancer Awareness goes on and on , including other chemical and pharmaceutical companies , cosmetic companies , fast food restaurants , donut and cookie makers , and many more .
They all share the common traits of promoting " awareness " which does not include the role their own products play , and promoting early screening through mammograms .
Likewise , other charities and foundations , and their sponsors , have joined the pink bandwagon .
Once again , they have common links of promoting early detection , primarily through mammograms , and of remaining mostly silent about toxins and other environmental factors .

DOE Introduces Big Oil to New Energy Source : Waste Heat Geothermal
October 4th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Every barrel of oil extracted in the US also produces ten barrels of hot fluids in addition to the oil .
Why not use that potential energy in the waste heat ?
Rather than discard that “ geothermal ” resource created by the process of oil extraction , the DOE is going to show the traditional energy industry how to tap into those waste fluids to power equipment at the site .
The renewable energy division ( EERE ) of Steven Chu ’s energetic new Department of Energy is buying the waste heat geothermal unit from Ormat Technologies to do the demo .
Ormat makes both geothermal and combined heat and power units .
The DOE ’s Geothermal Technologies Program at the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ( EERE ) will collaborate with Office of Fossil Energy to make low temperature geothermal power from waste drilling fluids using a waste heat geothermal unit .
The electricity produced would be used to power field production equipment , which would offset purchased electricity .
Because this would reduce the fossil energy needed to extract each barrel of oil , this would reduce the pollution costs the traditional oil industry would be liable for under new legislation pending .
If the Clean Energy Jobs & American Power Act passes , there will be an incentive to reduce carbon pollution .
They will use co-produced fluids from oilfield operations at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center .
The testing center has a producing oilfield , and long - standing expertize with fossil energy , so it provides an opportunity for the Fossil Energy Dept at the DOE to make a contribution to emerging energy fields .
The system will turn an unavoidable byproduct into a new energy resource for the oil industry ; one that is relatively “ renewable . ”
It is not a natural source because it would stop once oil extraction stopped .
It is created by the process of oil extraction itself .
Yet it creates no new carbon emissions , so it effectively lowers the carbon cost of each barrel of extracted oil .
Now that we are down to literally scraping the bottom of the barrel , the CO2 emissions from squeezing oil out of rocks are almost twice as high as for even regular oil extraction .
Waste heat reuse for electricity is one way to get CO2 emissions down in the traditional fossil energy industry .
The results of this carbon mitigation effort will be made available to any interested parties on the DOE website .

' A Mission of Honor ' Key Players Recall Romania 's Bloody Revolution
The fall of the Iron Curtain manifested itself violently 20 years ago in Romania , with the execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife .
Two decades after , some of the key players in the revolution recall the murky events that saw the toppling of the leader and bloodbath across the country .
About 5:00 pm on September 30th , a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck just offshore of the town of Padang in Sumatra , Indonesia .
The quake toppled buildings and started many landslides , smashing homes and swallowing up entire villages .
The following day , As rescue workers arrived and residents tried their best to dig out and help the survivors , another unrelated quake with a magnitude of 6.6 struck less than 1,000 km south of the original epicenter .
Each of the two quakes had at least one aftershock greater than 5.0 as well .
Over 1,000 people are known to have died , an additional 3,000 still missing .
Today , October 5th , officials called off the search for survivors in Padang , and are focusing now on caring for the living and coordinating with international relief agencies .

This tale begins during and shortly after 9/11/2001 , when a writer named Randy Lavello published a story at Prison Planet , Bombs in the Building : World Trade Center ‘ Conspiracy Theory ’ is a Conspiracy Fact .
Among the many tales in this article , a number of which were picked up in Mike Rivero ’s web site , what really happened , is a conversation between Lavello and Lieutenant Fireman and former Auxiliary Police Officer , Paul Isaac Jr. It ’s a head - spinner …
The Woolsey gag order created an Omerta - like mob silence that Firefighters and Police Officers have had to deal with to this day .
“ [ Lieutenant Fireman and former Auxiliary Police Officer , Paul Isaac Jr. ] explained to me [ Lavello ] that , ‘ many other firemen know there were bombs in the buildings , but they ’re afraid for their jobs to admit it because the ‘ higher - ups ’ forbid discussion of this fact . ”
Paul further elaborated that former CIA director Robert Woolsey , as the Fire Department ’s Anti-terrorism Consultant , is sending a gag order down the ranks .
‘ There were definitely bombs in those buildings , ’ he told me . ”
Isaac also addressed the FBI gag order in an article by Greg Syzmanski , saying “ It ’s amazing how many people are afraid to talk for fear or retaliation or losing their jobs . ”
He mentions that the FBI gag order placed on law enforcement and fire department officials prevented them from openly talking about any inside knowledge of 9/11 .
Syzmansky praised Isaacs in a highly interesting article titled One - Man Investigative Team .
Syzmansky wrote that “ When he [ Isaacs ] worked as an auxiliary fireman specializing in emergency and disaster communications response , Isaac said after 9/11 he began monitoring all emergency units to see if any patterns or information about the perpetrators could be learned .
“ Over the last four years he ’s compiled information and names of civilians and firefighters , whose identities he keeps anonymous for their safety , who all claim to have either witnessed explosions in the towers or have information that a controlled demolition took place . ”
Isaacs is quoted as saying , “ It ’s just amazing how many people are afraid to talk for fear of retaliation or losing their jobs , ” again regarding Woolsey ’s FBI gag order placed on law enforcement and fire department officials , preventing them from openly talking about any inside knowledge of 9/11 .
Researcher Vincent Sammartino , also in attendance at the WTC ‘ open grave site ’ on September 11 , 2005 , wrote the following on APFN , “ I just got back from Ground Zero .
People know the truth !
Half of the police and firemen were coming up to us and telling us that they know 9/11 was an inside job .
They were told not to talk about it .
But they were supporting what we were doing !
I had tears in my eyes . ”
So , why would former CIA director Woolsey , as the Fire Department ’s Anti-terrorism Consultant , be gagging Isaac and his colleagues about what they saw and heard , i.e. bombs exploding in the building if not to cover up the government conspiracy , the inside job behind the supposed demolition of the WTC by two jetliners , whose fuel fire supposedly melted the redundant steel frames which caved and caused a pyroplastic free - fall of each building in some ten seconds .
All at once the conspiracy of the lone Muslim airliner hijackers destroying the towers goes down the drain , glub , glub !
That ’s why Firefighters and Police Officers were gagged .
In fact , click Rivero ’s “ what really happened ” site above to get to get more linked interviews of Firefighters talking about explosions shortly after 9/11 occurred .
Rivero is amazing at collecting data , classifying it , and incorporating it into his encyclopedic 9/11 site .
Read what the heroes had to say .
For instance , “ Lou Cacchioli , Firefighter in WTC 1 : At that point , Cacchioli found one of the only functioning elevators , one only going as high as the 24th floor … ‘ Tommy Hetzel was with me and everybody else also gets out of the elevator when it stops on the 24th floor , ’ said Cacchioli .
‘ There was a huge amount of smoke .
Tommy and I had to go back down the elevator for tools and no sooner did the elevators close behind us , we heard this huge explosion that sounded like a bomb .
It was such a loud noise , it knocked off the lights and stalled the elevator . ’
Lou continues , ‘ Luckily , we were n’t caught between floors and were able to pry open the doors .
People were going crazy , yelling and screaming .
And all the time , I am crawling low and making my way in the dark with a flashlight to the staircase and thinking Tommy is right behind me …
I somehow got into the stairwell and there were more people there .
When I began to try and direct down , another huge explosion like the first one hits .
This one hits about two minutes later , although it ’s hard to tell , but I ’m thinking , ‘ Oh . My God , these bastards put bombs in here like they did in 1993 ! ’ ”
Unfortunately , the bastards in 1993 and in 2001 had considerable help from the bastards in our government .
The Woolsey gag order created an Omerta - like mob silence that Firefighters and Police Officers have had to deal with to this day .
Imagine their anger , seeing their buddies disappear in explosions , fire and smoke .
Imagine having to swallow that anger , that grief and humiliation , for the grand purpose of America sinking into the grizzly War on Terror in a matter of days .
Imagine having to work on the pile at Ground Zero knowing what you knew .
Or having to play deaf , dumb and blind , as 340 Firefighters died , two fire paramedics and one FDNY Chaplain and as 23 New York Police officers and 36 Port Authority officers went down .
Not to mention the 2800 plus civilians taken from their lives senselessly .
Is it any wonder then that Justice John Lehner recently killed the NYC CAN ballot initiative to reinvestigate 911 .
The Justice called the initiative “ irrelevant , ” and rejected the will of 80,000 New Yorkers who had signed petitions to make it to happen .
Is it the specter of James Woolsey gagging the Justice , or Mayor Bloomberg ?
Bloomberg rejected the will of the people after they had twice voted against a third term for New York Mayors .
And since Mayor Bloomberg is in the middle of a political campaign for his illegal third term , he might want to assure us that we ’re not being gagged , like Justice Lehner or the Fire and Police Departments .
We would like to hear the full 9/11 story presented by a truly independent and expert commission .
What Bush did , what is still being done , is in keeping with Hitler ’s axiom :
If you tell a lie , make sure it ’s a big lie , and keep telling it till everyone believes or has to believe it for fear of seeming unpatriotic .
And so it ’s time to take the gag off , one way or the other .
Let those Firefighters and Police officers speak without fear of retribution .
Let the facts , the real facts of 911 , gathered by engineers , architects , pilots , retired military men , first responders , citizens of New York and the world , speak for once loud and clear .
New Yorkers should take to the streets to protest the Justice ’s gag order .
Case in point : a few days ago the governor of Puerto Rico announced that he would fire 20,000 government workers to close his $ 4 billion deficit , once again balancing deficits on the backs of labor .
This caused the people of Puerto Rico to pour into the streets in a spontaneous one - day strike !
In fact , their Puerto Rican brothers and sisters in New York City joined in a March at the Puerto Rican government offices here .
Their collective reaction made waves from the mainland to the island .
We do n’t want to end up with an Emperor instead of a duly - elected Mayor , Governor , or President , and silence instead of justice .
Why not bring the wheels of New York to a squealing halt in a similar strike ?
So for once we can hear the voice of truth on those scratchy fire and policeman ’s walkie talkies .
Then Mr. Woolsey can gag his old friends at the CIA or his new friends at the Wall Street Journal where he now writes guest columns .
Or perhaps be gagged himself by Rupert “ The Fox ” Murdoch , yellow press media mogul of our time .

Institute for the Future teamed up with Sun Microsystems and Boing Boing Video to co-host the Digital Open , an online tech expo for teens 17 and under around the world .
In today 's episode , you 'll meet the " Funky Shiitake Mushrooms , " a group of young people from a Fremont , CA high school who build robotic blimps .
The one you see in this video also doubles as a fashionable hat , as you can see from the photo inset at left ( that 's me with the headgear ) .
The blimp in this episode is named " Skittles the Second , " after the popular , cartoon - colored candy .
They 'd made an earlier version of " Skittles , " but that one floated away .
In fact , it floated all the way to a farm near Yosemite .
The farmer found an ID tag on the floataway airship , and phoned a teacher at the high school to advise .
The teen makers were eager to road trip out there and pick it up , but only one of them was old enough to drive .
Their energy and inventiveness was inspiring .
I hope you enjoy the video as much as we enjoyed making it .

WASHINGTON -- Rahm Emanuel once sent a dead fish to a live pollster .
Now he 's put a horse 's head in Roger Ailes ' bed .
Not very subtle .
And not very smart .
Ailes does n't scare easily .
The White House has declared war on Fox News .
White House communications director Anita Dunn said that Fox is " opinion journalism masquerading as news . "
Patting rival networks on the head for their authenticity ( read : docility ) , senior adviser David Axelrod declared Fox " not really a news station . "
And Chief of Staff Emanuel told ( warned ? ) the other networks not to " be led ( by ) and following Fox . "
Meaning ?
If Fox runs a story critical of the administration -- from exposing White House czar Van Jones as a loony 9/11 " truther " to exhaustively examining the mathematical chicanery and hidden loopholes in proposed health care legislation -- the other news organizations should think twice before following the lead .
The signal to corporations is equally clear :
You might have dealings with a federal behemoth that not only disburses more than $ 3 trillion every year but is extending its reach ever deeper into private industry -- finance , autos , soon health care and energy .
Think twice before you run an ad on Fox .
At first , there was little reaction from other media .
Then on Thursday , the administration tried to make them complicit in an actual boycott of Fox .
The Treasury Department made available Ken Feinberg , the executive pay czar , for interviews with the White House " pool " news organizations -- except Fox .
The other networks admirably refused , saying they would not interview Feinberg unless Fox was permitted to as well .
The administration backed down .
This was an important defeat because there 's a principle at stake here .
While government can and should debate and criticize opposition voices , the current White House goes beyond that .
It wants to delegitimize any significant dissent .
The objective is no secret .
White House aides openly told Politico that they 're engaged in a deliberate campaign to marginalize and ostracize recalcitrants , from Fox to health insurers to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
There 's nothing illegal about such search - and - destroy tactics .
Nor unconstitutional .
But our politics are defined not just by limits of legality or constitutionality .
We have norms , Madisonian norms .
Madison argued that the safety of a great republic , its defense against tyranny , requires the contest between factions or interests .
His insight was to understand " the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties . "
They would help guarantee liberty by checking and balancing and restraining each other -- and an otherwise imperious government .
Factions should compete , but also recognize the legitimacy of other factions and , indeed , their necessity for a vigorous self - regulating democracy .
Seeking to deliberately undermine , delegitimize and destroy is not Madisonian .
It is Nixonian .
But did n't Teddy Roosevelt try to destroy the trusts ?
Of course , but what he took down was monopoly power that was extinguishing smaller independent competing interests .
Fox News is no monopoly .
It is a singular minority in a sea of liberal media .
ABC , NBC , CBS , PBS , NPR , CNN , MSNBC vs. Fox .
The lineup is so unbalanced as to be comical -- and that does n't even include the other commanding heights of the culture that are firmly , flagrantly liberal : Hollywood , the foundations , the universities , the elite newspapers .
Fox and its viewers ( numbering more than CNN's and MSNBC 's combined ) need no defense .
Defend Fox compared to whom ?
To CNN -- which recently unleashed its fact - checkers on a " Saturday Night Live " skit mildly critical of President Obama , but did no checking of a grotesquely racist remark CNN falsely attributed to Rush Limbaugh ?
Defend Fox from whom ?
Fox 's flagship 6 o'clock evening news out of Washington ( hosted by Bret Baier , formerly by Brit Hume ) is , to my mind , the best hour of news on television .
( Definitive evidence :
My mother watches it even on the odd night when I 'm not on . )
Defend Fox from the likes of Anita Dunn ?
She 's been attacked for extolling Mao 's political philosophy in a speech at a high school graduation .
But the critics miss the surpassing stupidity of her larger point :
She was invoking Mao as support and authority for her impassioned plea for individuality and trusting one 's own choices .
Mao as champion of individuality ?
Mao , the greatest imposer of mass uniformity in modern history , creator of a slave society of a near - billion worker bees wearing Mao suits and waving the Little Red Book ?
The White House communications director cannot be trusted to address high schoolers without uttering inanities .
She and her cohorts are now to instruct the country on truth and objectivity ?
Rapists , Sex Offenders , Even Regular Perverts , March For Polanski
( ACPA - Paris ) Hundreds of rapists , sex offenders , even ordinary everyday perverts took part in demonstrations across France and Switzerland in a show of support for recently arrested Hollywood director , Roman Polanski .
The marches were organized by the French Society for the Advancement of Humanity and took place in Paris , Cannes and Zurich .
Slogans such as ' Abolish the Age of Consent ' and ' Support the real Victims ' adorned placards and marchers demanded that the Swiss government release the celebrity filmmaker immediately .
Jacques Bois , a Parisian pervert , who likes to expose himself to schoolgirls at bus stops , told a reporter , " Roman has had a hard life , I mean , if my family died in Auschwitz I would definitely rape someone . "
Another marcher , who refused to be identified for fear of reprisals , said that he was marching to make a statement about the unjust harassment of Polanski .
" It 's time to let bygones be bygones , he has n't raped anyone for years . "
Fr. Joseph Devine , an Irish priest accused of molesting a teenage boy at a religious seminar , said he had come out of hiding to take part in the Zurich march .
" If they extradite him , next it 's going to be religious persecution .
I have to take a stand . "
However , there were dissenting views among the marchers .
One man acknowledged that raping a teenage boy was " totally disgusting , bastards should be castrated , " but countered that " if it 's a girl , it 's not the same thing , everyone knows that . "
A written message of support from imprisoned Max Factor cosmetics heir Andrew Luster was read out to the marchers .
Luster , who drugged and raped several women before fleeing to Mexico where he was cornered by Dog the Bounty Hunter , wrote , " Roman , do n't be afraid to be unconventional .
Stay strong and help us set a new legal standard . "
Meanwhile in Hollywood , a group of Pornographic Movie Directors have started a petition to have Polanski expelled from the Director 's Guild of America .
A spokesman for the group explained , " He 's giving movie - makers everywhere a bad name . "

LONDON ( AP ) 
Top finance officials debated the next steps for the recovering global economy on Friday , with European countries pushing for a crackdown on bankers ' bonuses while the U.S. stressed the need to boost bank reserves to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis .
The Group of 20 countries were also discussing so - called exit strategies from the recent massive economic stimulus , although all agreed that withdrawing the massive amounts of money injected into the ailing world economy any time soon could risk a double - dip recession .
Developing countries , meanwhile , used the gathering to press for reform of global financial governance , proposing shifts in voting power at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in favor of developing countries .
Finance ministers and central bank officials from rich and developing countries representing 80 % of world economic output are convening in London through Saturday amid mounting signs of at least a modest economic upturn , with Japan , Germany , France and Australia all recording growth in the second quarter .
Britain is widely expected to do so in the third quarter .
But the mood remained subdued , with a uniform warning that it is too early to declare the end of the crisis .
" The global economy still faces great uncertainty , and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability , " Brazil , Russia , India and China — the so - called BRIC quartet — said after they held a mini-summit ahead of the main G - 20 talks .
The timing of a so - called exit strategy is not yet agreed among finance officials .
Germany has pushed for G - 20 nations to start talking about when and how they will withdraw stimulus measures , but other EU nations were cool to that , saying they wanted talk and not action right now .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said she is happy to discuss coordinating an exit strategy but stressed that the timing was something that " God only knows . "
European countries have stressed the role that excessive payouts to banking executives played in the current crisis by fueling risk - taking , and called for bonuses to be severely curbed .
G - 20 leaders promised at their London meeting in April to pass " tough new principles on pay and compensation , " but little progress has yet been made .
" Individual compensation is generally key to determining the behavior and the risk adopted by a trading room , " Lagarde told reporters .
Under government pressure , France 's largest bank BNP Paribas has halved bonus payments this year and , along with others , agreed to link bonuses to performance .
But the European push on bonuses has received a lukewarm response elsewhere within the G - 20 .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has not raised the bonus issue , preferring instead to focus on U.S. attempts to start talks on a new international accord to increase banks ' capital reserves .
Geithner says the accord would put in place " a more conservative framework of constraints on leverage in the financial sector across the major globally active financial institutions . "
The Obama administration 's proposal would establish stronger international standards for the reserves banks are required to hold to cover potential loan losses .
The U.S. wants to reach agreement on an accord by the end of 2010 , with countries agreeing to implement the plan by the end of 2012 .
British Treasury chief and meeting host Alistair Darling said that both bonuses and boosting capital were international issues that need to be addressed as the banking sector is key to any economic recovery .
" Nowadays , no one large bank can simply operate in a vacuum , they operate right across the world , so this truly is an international problem , " Darling told BBC radio on Friday .
But Britain has stopped short of some of the more stringent rules proposed on curtailing bonuses .
The big emerging economies like China , India and Brazil have their own agenda at the London meeting , most clearly faster action on changes to give them a greater say in governance of financial markets .
The G - 20 countries have agreed to review the leadership of institutions like the World Bank and IMF , which has received pledges of more money to help struggling countries .
The IMF is customarily headed by a European and the World Bank by an American .
The BRIC quartet , which argues that reform of international financial institutions is crucial to ensuring a stable and balanced global economy , want a shift in voting power in favor of developing countries .
" The IMF can not emerge from this crisis unchanged , " said Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee .
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said that the presence of Geithner at the end of the quartet 's meeting — at the U.S. official 's request — showed positive support for the proposals .
The G - 20 includes 19 countries : Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , Britain and the United States .
The European Union , represented by its rotating presidency and the European Central Bank , is the 20th member .

Almost half of all car owners will be up to £ 245 worse off under plans for massive increases in road tax , the Treasury admitted yesterday .
And fewer than one in five will benefit from the controversial move , which was sold as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
The Government ’s own figures demolish ministers ’ claims that Budget plans to overhaul vehicle excise duty will have little impact on motorists .
In the Commons last month , Gordon Brown said : ‘ The majority of drivers will benefit from it . ’
But in an apparent contradiction yesterday , Treasury minister Angela Eagle admitted to MPs that from April 2010 it will cost more to keep 43 per cent of all cars on the road – some 9,423,450 vehicles .
More than one million drivers of cars registered between 2001 and 2006 will see road tax jump from £ 210 to either £ 430 or £ 455 depending on emissions , while others face hikes of between £ 10 and £ 155 .

The Great Government Swine Flu Conspiracy
The Great Government Swine Flu Conspiracy
by Walter Brasch
More than 230,000 cases of the Swine Flu have been confirmed world wide .
About 2,100 persons have died .
As much as one - fourth of America 's workforce may be infected by Swine Flu when it peaks in Winter , according to studies conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
CDC scientists isolated and developed the seed strain of swine flu .
Working furiously to manufacture the vaccine are five major drug companies , which received about $ 1.8 billion in federal funding to produce the anti-virus .
Leading the testing , analyses , and education campaigns about the swine flu , in addition to the CDC , are the U.S. Public Health Service , the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , the Federal Drug Administration , and the U.S. Department of Agriculture , in addition to the Department of Health and Human Services , which developed the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza protection .
Testing of the vaccines on human subjects is being done at eight major U.S. universities and hospitals , which received federal funding .
The federal government is also providing about $ 260 million in grants to state health departments to give the vaccine at no charge to people who do not have insurance or whose insurance does not cover vaccinations .
In several European countries , which are producing about 70 percent of all vaccines for a worldwide population , most research and production is being funded and carried out by government agencies .
But if you listen to the multi-millionaire conservative bloviators of talk radio and Fox News , or the shrill screeching of a minority of tea - baggers and conservatives at dozens of town hall meetings , you hear one theme .
These right - wing loonies say they do n't want the government involved in health care .
No government .
Get government out of their lives .
Government is evil !
The well - orchestrated campaign against health care reform focuses upon shouting over any attempt by members of Congress to present the truth about health care bills .
Apparently , they believe the health care crisis is a sports game ; whoever shouts the loudest to drown out everyone else gets the most points .
If these harpies of the right are all - so - determined to stop universal health care , if they do n't want the government in health care , then I have a couple of suggestions .
First , because the baggers scream " socialist " at anything they do n't approve , they should refuse to accept Social Security or Medicare when eligible .
If they 're veterans , they should refuse any VA medical programs , and reject any disability income .
Next , when the swine flu vaccines are ready for distribution in Fall , the opponents of health care reform should refuse to be vaccinated .
That 's right .
They need to stand by their principles , and not get the vaccines .
After all , by their bastardized strain of logic , anything with a government stamp on health care must be suspect .
They may even believe the massive public education campaign by the federal government is just a scare tactic , that the vaccines — primarily researched , tested , and funded by the federal government — may even be part of a secret conspiracy by the federal government to control Americans ' minds and make everyone Communists .
Nevertheless , whatever their beliefs , when the Swine Flu vaccine is ready , the opponents of the " intrusion " of the federal government into health care just need to say " NO " !
but do n't say " no " for the rest of us .

Racism Is Still Alive In America
A Louisiana judge , Keith Bardwell , from the Tangipahoa parish is yet another symptom that racism is still a problem in America in 2009 , despite the election of the first African - American President .
Justice of the peace Bardwell is now in the middle of a growing controversy , likely to end his career , after refusing to give a marriage license to an interracial couple .
Barwell said he denied the license “ out of concern for the couple ’s future children . ”
Bardwell insists that he is not a racist , and that he has a lot of Black friends that he “ welcome to his house , and even let them use the bathroom . ”
“ There is a problem with both groups accepting a child from such a marriage .
I think those children suffer and I wo n’t help put them through it , ” said Bardwell .
What Mr. Bardwell should comprehend is that one of the children of such marriages , between a white women & a black man , is our current President .
It seems that he did pretty well in compensating for what Mr. Bardwell views as a birth handicap .
The couple , Beth Humphrey and Terrence McKay , has expressed that they will contact the US Justice Department to file a discrimination complaint .
“ That was one thing that made this so unbelievable .
It is not something you expect in this day & age , ” said Humphrey .
The ACLU has asked the Louisiana Judiciary Committee for an investigation in the case .
“ It is really astonishing and disappointing to see this come up in 2009 .
The Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that the government cannot tell people who they can or cannot marry , ” said ACLU ’s Katie Schwartzmann .
She is referring to the case of Mildred Loving and her husband Richard , whose landmark lawsuit against the State of Virginia led to a Supreme Court decision in 1967 in favor of interracial couples ’ right to marry .
The ruling was 42 years ago , and it was critical in the overall context of the civil rights movement .
However , this case is a reminder that America has still a very long way to go , even 42 years later , to become a color blind society .
To the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of " real materials " - to the dry - land ecologists , wherever they may be , in whatever time they work , this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration .
In the week before their departure to Arakis , when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy , an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy , Paul .
A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct ... from " Manual of Muad'dib " by the Princess Irulan

In other news , butter futures are at an all time high .
Seasteading did n't quite work out for libertarian ideologue Andrew Ryan in BioShock , the creepy game released in 2007 to widespread acclaim .
Ryan 's underwater utopia collapsed , thanks in part to genetic enhancements that gave superhuman powers to the denizens of Rapture , turning it into a saltwater kill zone .
In BioShock 2 , one of the most anticipated game sequels ever , you awake eight years after the original left off .
You 're missing all your memories but you know what you are : a Big Daddy , one of the giant , metal - suited monstrosities that kept order in Rapture before the fall .
See also : First Look : BioShock 2 Takes Bold Trip Back to Rapture
Who are you ?
Where 's your Little Sister ?
Plenty of obstacles float between you and the truth .
Drugged - out Splicers still roam the city , and there 's a new antagonist : a hard - left propagandist who believes in collectivism by any means necessary .
And she 's got an army of Big Sisters aimed at taking you down .
Wait a minute .
Big Sisters ?
There 's been a major change to the sequel 's story line since the last time we looked at BioShock 2 .
Originally , the central character was Big Sister , one of the creepy little enslaved girls from the first game that had come back to Rapture with a hidden agenda .
Big Sister was envisioned as something like Terminator 's T - 1000 : a nearly impossible - to - defeat enemy that would stalk the player throughout the game .
BioShock 2 lead level - designer J.P. LeBreton says that this idea was scrapped for reasons that had to do with both the gameplay and the story line .
" In the game , when the player defeats a Big Daddy , they get that satisfaction , that reward , " he says .
" What we did n't want was a scripted story boss to show up every level without fail and then run away , and constantly deny you that . "
As for how the increase in number of Big Sisters will affect the game 's story when BioShock 2 arrives in 2010 ( it 's slated for release on Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 and PC on Feb. 9 ) , 2K Games is n't saying anything .
The company 's silence is for the best .
For many of us who played the first game , the wholly unexpected plot twists proved to be its strongest and most compelling aspect .
For all its tangled narrative strings , BioShock 's most profound climactic moment did n't have much of anything to do with Randian objectivism or the relative merits of saving or harvesting creepy barefoot children .
It was when we found out that our main character was a puppet , following all the hypnotic suggestions of the game 's antagonist .
In that moment , the medium became the message : BioShock drove home the point that as videogame players , even in a game that leads us to believe that we are making autonomous choices , we 're still just doing whatever the game tells us to , killing whoever we 're told to kill , just as long as it tells us to in such a way that we never question it .
Can BioShock 2 pull off that feat again ?
Our somewhat limited hands - on experience with the sequel is n't about to answer that question .
What it did show is that we 're about to get another taste of Rapture 's ruined underwater paradise , with all the highly detailed scenery and trappings that made exploring it such a chilling pleasure last time .
From the first loading screen — in which the snappy , upbeat lyrics of 1940s period music stands in sharp contrast to the oppressive gloom and decay — you know you 're back .
The BioShock 2 demo saw us exploring Ryan Amusements , a learning museum for the children of Rapture .
In true Ryan style , it 's actually a propaganda pit :
It teaches children all about the oppressive world of big government and welfare , to thoroughly scare the crap out of them in the hopes that they 'll never want to leave the city .
If you 'd just like to blaze through the museum and finish the mission , you can .
But BioShock 2 is filled with lots of extra story for players who want it .
Throughout the game , you 'll find audio diaries left by citizens that will flesh out various aspects of the story .
In this particular level , you 'll be able to stop at all the museum exhibits and watch as the animatronic robots act out little scenes , telling the story of how Rapture was built and fleshing out Ryan 's political philosophies .
Big Sisters do n't like you gallavanting around with Little Sisters , and they will come and find you .

Of course , Ryan is n't in charge anymore ( the last game 's main character beat him to death with a golf club ) .
The antagonist this time is Dr. Sophia Lamb .
She 's as hard - core as Ryan about her political ideology , but at the other extreme .
Lamb 's brought back the Big Daddies and Little Sisters into Rapture , and they 're all part of her plan .
As a rogue Big Daddy with free will , you 'll end up having to fight your brainwashed brothers , because you 're the wrench in Lamb 's plan .
You were n't supposed to still be around .
In fact , your Little Sister is a big part of whatever Lamb 's cooking up .
Her followers have built churches in Rapture , all devoted to worshiping your Little Sister , who they believe will lead them to salvation .
" She 's gotten a hook into people 's minds in a very different way than Ryan did , " LeBreton says .
Meanwhile , there 's Sinclair , a guy in your earpiece on the radio who 's telling you what you need to do to keep progressing in the game .
BioShock players know not to trust people like this , but for now , he 's all you 've got .
" Sinclair is this guy who contacts you early on because he realizes that you and he have a common interest , " says LeBreton .
" Friendly but sort of shady , he 's part of this organization that gets stuff done no matter the costs ethically .
He 's a pragmatist who sits in contrast with the other characters of the world , " who are ideologues .
As the demo begins , Sinclair lets you know that if you 're going to escape the propaganda playground , you 'll need the Incinerate power .
Plasmids , the aforementioned suite of genetic enhancements , are again a big part of BioShock 's first - person shooter gameplay .
As a Big Daddy , you 've got a couple of awesome built - in weapons .
There 's your massive drill - hand , which you can use to charge enemies and put big holes in them , but it requires fuel .
And there 's your rivet gun .
But you 'll also need to splice your genes to do things like throwing fire or freezing people into blocks of solid ice .
Before you get hooked up with Incinerate , you 'll need to creep through the museum , taking out the insane Splicers that still roam the halls , finding audio diaries , listening to Sinclair 's and Lamb 's rantings and generally soaking up the atmosphere .
BioShock is n't specifically a horror game , but the original had some great cheap , scary moments .
So did this demo :
At one point , while exploring the women 's bathroom ( what , like that 's not the first thing you do in any game ? ) , I looked up from a toilet stall to see , perfectly outlined in a flickering shadow , a Splicer with an ax raised , ready to strike .
I wheeled around frantically , having not seen it coming .
What you 'll always see coming are the monstrous Big Daddies .
As with the previous game , until you attack them , they wo n't hurt you .
So when you see one gallivanting about with his Little Sister , you 'll have time to prepare by healing yourself and buying ammunition from the vending machines that are scattered about the world .
Like in the last game , you can " hack " any of these machines to give yourself lower prices .
This mechanic has been totally changed — instead of playing an occasionally lengthy puzzle game , you play a very short , timing - based game in which you attempt to stop a fast - moving needle in the green area of a gauge .
Hit green and the hack is successful ; hit red and you 'll just damage yourself in the attempt .
Hit the very small blue areas and you 'll get a bonus .
Even though you 're a Big Daddy yourself , fights against your hulking brethren are going to be some of the toughest encounters in BioShock 2 .
Image : 2 K Games
Once you take down a Big Daddy , you have the choice of either adopting or harvesting his Little Sister .
This is n't as simple a choice as in the last game , because if you decide to adopt her , you 'll actually have to accompany her around the level as she gathers more Adam , the extremely important substance that lets you upgrade your genetic abilities .
This means finding a dead body and protecting your Little Sister for a short span of time while she goes to work .
At this point , you 'll want to use some of the booby traps in your arsenal , like " trap rivets " that will explode on contact with invading Splicers who want the Adam for themselves .
This adds a different gameplay mechanic , one in which the enemies wo n't stop coming and you can't leave your position until the harvest is done .
If all this sounds like a bit too much to deal with , you can just harvest the Little Sister , killing her and taking her Adam .
But BioShock has a way of causing bad moral choices like that to come back and bite you in the ass later .
Either way , Lamb does n't like you being involved with her Little Sisters :
No matter what you do , a Big Sister is going to eventually come after you .
You do n't get extra time to prepare for these fights , and the Big Sisters are faster , stronger and more deadly than any Big Daddy .
They 'll jump around the level and raise hell while you 're desperately trying to take them down .
If you see a Big Daddy in a multiplayer game , your team must work together to take him down .
Image : 2 K Games
After our 90 minutes in the world of BioShock 2's single - player game , we got to try the new multiplayer mode .
This is something of a persistent online experience — rather than just jumping in and playing a few matches , you 're actually building up your character 's array of weapons and Plasmids every time you play .
The next time you jump in , you 'll be more powerful .
We saw three different types of multiplayer .
Two of them , deathmatch and team deathmatch , probably do n't need to be described .
You can create custom " loadouts , " combining the different gear and abilities at your disposal , then swap between these sets every time you die , which will probably be pretty often .
Some abilities let you recharge your health faster , or dash and jump away from enemies with superhuman speed .
The original BioShock 's " research " mechanic , in which you take photographs of dead enemies , makes a return here .
Taking a picture of a corpse from another team lets you get a damage bonus on them once they 've respawned .
The most interesting multiplayer mode thus far is a variation on Capture the Flag , but what you 're capturing is a Little Sister .
Each round , one team tries to capture the Little Sister while the other tries to defend her .
The team on defense will begin each round with a random member appearing as a Big Daddy .
And unless this person is a total stupid idiot , you 'll have to band together with your team to kill him before you even attempt to take the Little Sister , as the Big Daddy will pretty much always be able to stop anyone from getting near her if he stays by her and protects her .
I can't say I 'm entirely sold on the idea : Multiplayer mode in BioShock seems like it was added purely for marketing concerns , as if the game would n't sell enough as a purely single - player experience .
If it gets the sequel into more people 's hands , that 's probably worth it .
But from my time with both modes , single - player seems like the big draw for BioShock 2 .
My favorite part of that single - player demo was the moment that you learn about the Incinerate power .
When you finally get your hands on Incinerate , there 's a little sequence , like something out of Disney 's Tomorrowland , that teaches you about the wondrous things you can do around the house with the ability to throw flames .
A nuclear family of mannequins sits around a fireplace .
Just ignite the wood and give them a nice toasty fire , says the tinny voice over the PA .
So I do , but unfortunately the little window display has fallen apart and been vandalized over the years .
Specifically , an oil spill in front of the fireplace catches ablaze and lights the whole family on fire , burning the mannequins to a blackened crisp .
It 's a perfectly BioShock moment : A tutorial for how to use a vital gameplay mechanic that simultaneously fleshes out the story while delivering a bit of commentary on the unintended consequences of progress .
If 2 K can keep that level of subtlety and surprise up throughout the whole game , it could have a worthy follow - up on its hands .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
A key committee on Wednesday morning approved legislation that would impose new regulations on credit rating agencies , which have been taken to task over unrealistically rosy ratings on sub - prime - mortgage securities and other toxic assets .
The Houses Financial Services Committee approved the bill , which would still set up a number of requirements for raters , including a provision requiring each rater to set up a board of directors of which one - third of the members made up of independent directors with little or no ties to the corporation .
A key feature of the legislation would bar rating firms from providing consulting services to corporations they are also rating .
Investors would also be permitted to file suits against raters for failing to carry out their methodologies , based on another provision .
The panel voted 49 to 14 .
An innovative diagnostic technique invented by a Monash University researcher could dramatically fast - track the detection of mental and neurological illnesses .
Monash biomedical engineer Brian Lithgow has developed electrovestibulography which is something akin to an ' ECG for the mind ' .
Patterns of electrical activity in the brain 's vestibular ( or balance ) system are measured against distinct response patterns found in depression , schizophrenia and other Central Nervous System ( CNS ) disorders .
The vestibular system is closely connected to the primitive regions of the brain that relate to emotions and behaviour , so Lithgow saw the diagnostic potential of measuring and comparing different patterns of electrovestibular activity .
Working with psychiatry researchers at Monash University 's Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre ( MAPrc ) in Melbourne , Australia , he tested volunteers and found distinct response patterns , or " biomarkers " , that distinguished different CNS diseases from each other and from regular electrovestibular activity .
Monash has teamed up with corporate partner Neural Diagnostics to develop and patent electrovestibulography , or EVestG™ .
It is hoped the simple , quick and inexpensive screening process for CNS diseases will eventually become standard practice in hospitals around the world .
" The patient sits in a specially designed tilt chair that triggers electrical responses in their balance system .
A gel - tipped electrode placed in the individual 's ear canal silences interfering noise so that these meaningful electrical responses are captured and recorded , " the Monash researcher said .
" The responses are then compared to the distinct biomarkers indicative of particular CNS disorders , allowing diagnosis to be made in under an hour . "
Neural Diagnostics CEO
Dr Roger Edwards said the implications of the new technique were huge .
" This could be one of the most significant inventions ever to come out of Monash .
CNS disorders cost upwards of $ US2 trillion globally and affect one in four people sometime in their lifetime .
At present , diagnosing these conditions is done almost exclusively by qualitative measures , through questions and interviews , and it can take many years for sufferers to be correctly diagnosed , " Dr Edwards said .
The technique is already attracting international interest and , if further testing goes to plan , it could be adopted in Australian and overseas hospitals within a few years .
" We are doing the necessary research and development and getting independent expert reports done , but results so far are cause for great optimism , " Dr Edwards said .
MAPrc Director Professor Jayashri Kulkarni said , " Engineering and psychiatry are two disciplines that do not usually work together , but here at MAPrc , through our collaboration , we are at the forefront of translating biotechnology into clinical tools for psychiatric practice .
While there is more work to be done , electrovestibulography could provide a major breakthrough in the diagnosis of mental illnesses " .
Thanks to technology , America need not fear energy dependence on foreign powers .
Innovations in extracting natural gas from shale , which the U.S. has in abundance , recently increased the world 's proven natural gas reserves by 60 - years ' worth of supply , or 1.2 trillion barrels .
Telegraph : " There has been a revolution in the gas fields of North America .
Reserve estimates are rising sharply as technology unlocks unconventional resources , " he said .
This is almost unknown to the public , despite the efforts of Nick Grealy at " No Hot Air " who has been arguing for some time that Britain 's shale reserves could replace declining North Sea output .
Rune Bjornson from Norway 's StatoilHydro said exploitable reserves are much greater than supposed just three years ago and may meet global gas needs for generations .
" The common wisdom was that unconventional gas was too difficult , too expensive and too demanding , " he said , according to Petroleum Economist .
" This has changed .
If we ever doubted that gas was the fuel of the future – in many ways there 's the answer . "
Far flung future dreams ?
Not at all .
For example , US liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) imports from Qatar have already fallen to almost nothing .
As many know , natural gas prices have also collapsed ( though they partly rallied back lately ) .
The US Department of Energy expects shale to provide the U.S. with 50 % of its natural gas needs within twenty years .
Still , some believe that shale will perform below expectations , and is being over - hyped by executives eager to stimulate stock prices .
Durango Herald : Art Berman of Labyrinth Consulting Services struck out at Dea and other natural - gas optimists .
His study of the Barnett shale field in Texas – the only mature shale play in the country – showed that the wells decline much faster than companies like to admit , and less than a third of the wells drilled will produce enough gas to break even .
Nevertheless , should shale proponents prevail , it will be great news for the U.S. and Europe , yet very bad news for Russia .
Perhaps its time to remove them from the BRICs story .
Also , while natural gas prices may remain depressed , new technology might cap the upside for investment vehicles such as United States Natural Gas ( UNG ) .
Telegraph :
If the new forecasts are accurate , Gazprom is not going to be the perennial cash cow funding Russia 's great power resurgence .
Russia 's budget may be in structural deficit .
As for the US , we may soon be looking at an era when gas , wind and solar power , combined with a smarter grid and a switch to electric cars returns the country to near energy self - sufficiency .

U.S. military officials in Afghanistan have halted the practice of releasing the number of militants killed in fighting with American - led forces as part of an overall strategy shift that emphasizes concern for the local civilian population ’s well - being rather than hunting insurgent groups .
The decision has triggered a quiet but fierce debate among military officers comparing the current situation with the U.S. experience in Vietnam , when military officials exaggerated body counts and used them as a measure of success .
Under the order , issued last month by Navy Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith , the military will not release specifics on how many insurgents are killed in fighting , and instead will give general estimates .
The change is part of the focus on making the Afghan population feel safer and comes as U.S. commanders are taking new steps to avoid civilian casualties .

“ We send the wrong message if all we talk about is the number of insurgents killed .
It does n’t demonstrate anything about whether we have made progress , ” said Smith , who arrived six weeks ago to overhaul U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization communications efforts .
“ We want to shift the mind - set . ”
Smith has asked commanders to issue fewer news releases and to focus on improvements in security where international forces are operating .
“ We have to show we are here to protect the people , ” he said .
The changes come as the Obama administration is adjusting the U.S. role in Afghanistan .
A troop buildup is expected to boost the number of U.S. military personnel in the country to 68,000 by year ’s end .

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said this month that U.S. - led forces must show progress by next summer to avoid the public perception that the conflict has become unwinnable .
Officers who have favored releasing insurgent death tolls said the disclosures were not intended to demonstrate military progress , but to counter and even preempt extremist propaganda alleging that international forces are killing innocent civilians .
“ It is the first version that sticks , ” said Col. Greg Julian , outgoing military spokesman .
He favored releasing the information , but he agreed that the policy should be changed under the new strategy emphasizing protection of the population .
Afghan and U.S. officials have sometimes disagreed sharply on civilian casualties .
Advertisement
In May , Afghan officials said at least 140 civilians , many of them women and children , were killed in the village of Garani .
They said it might be the worst case of civilian casualties since the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001 .
Although residents insisted that U.S. bombardment killed the civilians , the U.S. military disputed the death toll and said Taliban fighters were responsible for at least some of the deaths .
Throughout the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the military has periodically taken to reporting insurgent death tolls for specific clashes .
Last year , the 101st Airborne Division began releasing numbers of militants killed , and the practice soon spread among U.S. forces .
Public affairs officials in the 101st Airborne began publicizing militant deaths to counter the perception among Americans that the U.S. military was losing in Afghanistan .
Advertisement
The division command never used casualty figures as a measure of its progress , believing they had little relevancy .
But public affairs officers considered a high enemy death toll an easy way for the American public to understand that U.S. forces had won an engagement .
Army Lt. Col. Rumi Nielson - Green , the former spokeswoman for the 101st , said the reports were necessary to undercut insurgents ’ propaganda .
“ Without our reports , the absence of enemy fatalities could leave a false impression that the only ones that suffer losses are the Americans and NATO , ” she said in an e-mail .
“ When we know what we inflict upon the enemy and report the facts without embellishment or exaggeration or spin then I believe it is the right thing to do -- not because the winner is the one with the least amount of dead , but because we can be counted upon to tell the truth and the enemy cannot , ” she said .
Advertisement
In 2005 , as U.S. fortunes in Iraq spiraled downward , body counts crept into military news releases .
Similarly , public affairs officials said then that although casualty counts were not a measure of overall progress , they served the purpose of showing the success of individual missions .
Aides to Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan , believe that , as in Vietnam , measuring or discussing the numbers of insurgents killed can undermine the war effort .
It is a tenet of counterinsurgency warfare that operations designed to kill militants end up creating more fighters than they eliminate .
“ If you are focused on killing the enemy , you are going to kill millions of them , and there is always going to be more of them , ” said Army Col.
James Creighton , an advisor to McChrystal .
Advertisement
Julian , the outgoing spokesman , agreed that using casualty figures to show military success would be ill advised .
He said he released the figures to offset extremist propaganda .
“ I felt we were reporting each discrete incident like a police report : one robber was killed , one was captured , one got away , ” Julian said .
“ We were clear and transparent about it . ”
NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force has at times kept careful track of the number of insurgents killed in confrontations with international forces , but it no longer does .
Nicholas Williams , a NATO official in Afghanistan , called the counts “ a false metric . ”

Afghanistan ’s own security forces routinely report how many militants they have killed in their engagements .
For the Afghan forces , it is a sign of their determination and bravery in the face of sometimes steep losses , alliance officials said .
“ The Afghans have a different perspective , ” said Brig .
Gen. Eric G. Tremblay , ISAF spokesman .

Stem cells point to space ills
Stem cells exposed to microgravity express different proteins than those grown in normal gravity , say Australian researchers .
The finding may explain why long - term exposure to microgravity causes astronaut health issues such as loss of bone density and muscle wasting .
The research , led by biologist Dr Brendan Burns of the University of New South Wales in Sydney , will be presented this week at the 9th Australian Space Sciences Conference .
Burns , along with graduate researchers Elizabeth Blaber and Helder Marcal , used a NASA rotating - wall vessel to simulate microgravity , which is experienced by astronauts in low Earth orbit , to analyse its effect on human embryonic stem cells .
Stem cells are cells that have yet to differentiate into cells with specialised functions .
The researchers isolated and identified proteins expressed by the cells and compared these to proteins from cells grown under normal gravity conditions .
Their results showed 75 % of the proteins from the cells exposed to microgravity were not found in those grown under normal gravity .
" A lot of work has been done on microgravity at a systemic level , such as the effects on the immune system .
No one has really looked at the effect of microgravity at a cellular level and we think that is a huge gap , " says Burns .
Less antioxidants
" What we 've found is a range of different proteins that are potentially important for astronaut health were more or less predominant in terms of different gravity . "
In particular , cells exposed to microgravity produced more proteins that negatively regulate bone density .
In the human body , these changes in bone tissue could result in decreases in bone density , leading to osteoporosis .
" Although it has long been known that microgravity affects bone density , what kinds of genes and proteins that are affected by microgravity to cause this condition is n't known , " says Burns .
The microgravity - exposed cells also produced fewer proteins with antioxidant effects , he says .
Antioxidants protect the body from reactive oxidants that can damage DNA .
" We 're trying to get down to the nuts and bolts of what is causing these issues at a cellular level , " says Burns .
Novel approach
Associate Professor Ernst Wolvetang of the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland says while it 's difficult to judge the research prior to publication , it is a " novel idea " .
" If the right controls were done , and they find 75 % different protein expression , especially if they include bone morphogenic proteins [ such as those that regulate bone density ] , that would be a significant discovery , " says Wolvetang .
He says as far as he knows microgravity studies had been done mostly on functional bone building cells , and in that sense the research is novel .
" How relevant this will be to space flight itself is a whole different matter , because we do n't have embryonic stem cells in our adult bodies anymore , " he says .
It has often been taken for granted that China and India will rise simultaneously and peacefully in the 21st century .
But a recent flare - up challenges that view .
Thirty - seven years after the two countries fought a border war and 28 years since they opened settlement negotiations , the entire frontier from Kashmir to Burma remains in question .
It would be dangerous to ignore this festering sore any longer .
The dispute stretches back to the British Raj , when colonial official Sir Henry McMahon drew the boundary between India and Tibet at the Shimla Convention in 1913 .
China has never recognized the McMahon Line , and regards the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh as part of its Tibetan Autonomous Region .
Lately the border has been arousing more fervent passions than usual .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the state of Arunachal Pradesh earlier this month , irking Beijing and prompting New Delhi to assert " Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India . "
Earlier this year , Beijing attempted to block a $ 1.3 billion loan to India by the Asian Development Bank , part of which was meant for a watershed project in Arunachal Pradesh .
The war of words is likely to escalate as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama plans to visit Arunachal Pradesh next month .
Beijing is pressuring India via diplomatic protests and a media campaign to make the Dalai Lama abandon his planned trip .
The causes for the recent deterioration in relations are complex .
China perceives India as the weakest link in an evolving anti-China coalition of democratic and maritime powers ( the United States , Japan , Australia and India ) .
Viewing India as a pawn in Western designs to encircle and contain China , Chinese leaders worry about the ramifications of India 's power particularly in Tibet , a concern fanned by the March 2008 uprisings there .
A common theme in state media this year is the desire to capture the lost lands and crush India for daring to compete with China .
Meanwhile , Beijing 's influence in Pakistan , Nepal , Bangladesh , Burma and Sri Lanka — all of whom have relationships with India that range from strained to downright hostile — fuels Indian anxieties .
Beijing 's opposition to India 's membership in regional institutions like the East Asia Community and international forums like the United Nations Security Council ; China 's attempts to scuttle the U.S. - India nuclear deal at the Nuclear Suppliers Group ; and Chinese naval forays into the Indian Ocean region all have reinforced Indian suspicions that China seeks to deny India its proper place in the international system .

So , they ’ve got a Bible verse about seeing Satan as lightning from the heavens , and claiming the Hebrew word for lighting is “ baraq ” and the word for heights ( not “ heavens , ” but hey , it ’s sort of close , right ? ) is “ bamah , ” so in Hebrew the name of the Antichrist would be “ Baraq U Bamah . ”
Gee , it ’s good to know it ’s not our current president — after all , his name is Barack Obama , and presumably an all - knowing and all - powerful God who was writing a Bible would know how to spell his name , if he were the guy .
Or maybe God is just teasing us , making the name close enough , but still different enough , that even
He has plausible deniability .
Or maybe it ’s just His idea of a big practical joke .
Maybe Regina Spektor is right —
God can be hilarious .
Seriously , though , this is what I ’m wondering : The Bible ’s been around quite a while , and the Hebrew language has as well .
If the name of the Antichrist could be figured out by applying those two things , why did n’t anyone do it before 2009 ?
Why did n’t they do it 100 years ago ( or 200 , or 800 ) , and then keep their eyes open for someone with a name like that taking prominence on the national / international stage ?
I ’m sorry it took so long but I had more stuff to write about in the mean time , and I ’m really posting stuff as it comes with some pretty randomly ordered things .
In the post about the Portage Tree size I blandly and incompletely separate the overhead due to the filesystem block allocation from the rest of size of the components themselves .
Since the whole data was gathered a night I was bored and trying to fixing up my kernel to have both Radeon ’s KMS and the Atheros drivers working , it really did n’t strike as a complete work , and indeed it was just to give some sense of proportion on what is actually using up the space ( and as you might have noticed , almost all people involved do find the size , and amount , of ChangeLogs a problem ) .
Robin then asked for some more interesting statistics to look at , in particular the trend of the overhead depending on the size of the filesystem blocks .
This post , which comes after quite some angst is going to illustrate the results , although they do tend to be quite easy to see with the involved graphs .
I hope this time the graphs do work for everybody out of the box ; last time I used Google Docs to produce the output and linked it directly , this saved a lot of traffic on my side , but did n’t work for everybody .
This time I ’m going to use my blog ’s server to publish all the results , hoping it wo n’t create any stir on it …
First of all , the data ; I ’m going to publish all the data I collected here , so that you can make use of it in any way you ’d like ; please note that it might not be perfect , knowledge about filesystems is n’t my favourite subject , so while it should be pretty consistent , there might be side - effects I did n’t consider ; for instance , I ’m not sure on whether directories have always the same size , and whether that size is the same for any filesystem out there ; I assume both of these to be truths , so if I did any mistake you might have to adapt a bit the data .
I also has n’t gone considering the amount of inodes used for each different configuration , and this is because I really do n’t know for certainty how that behaves , and how to find how much space is used by the filesystem structures that handle inodes ’ and files ’ data .
If somebody with better knowledge of that can get me some data , I might be able to improve the results .
I ’m afraid this is actually pretty critical to have a proper comparison of efficiency between differently - sized blocks because , well , the smaller the block the more blocks you need , and if you need more blocks , you end up with more data associated to that .
So if you know more about filesystems than me and want to suggest how to improve this , I ’ll be grateful .
I ’m attaching the original spreadsheet as well as the tweaked charts ( and the PDF of them for those not having OpenOffice at hand ) .
This first graph should give an idea about the storage efficiency of the Gentoo tree changes depending on the size block size : on the far left you got the theoretical point : 100 % efficiency , where only the actual files that are in the tree are stored ; on the far right an extreme case , a filesystem with 64 KiB blocks … for those who wonder , the only way I found to actually have such a filesystem working on Linux is using HFS +
( which is actually interesting to know , I should probably put in such a filesystem the video files I have … ) ; while XFS supports that in the specs , the Linux implementation does n’t : it only supports blocks of the same size of a page , or smaller ( so less than or equal to 4KiB ) —
I ’m not sure why that ’s the case , it seems kinda silly since at least HFS + seems to work fine with bigger sizes .
With the “ default ” size of 4 KiB ( page size ) the efficiency of the tree seems to be definitely reduced : it goes down to 30 % , which is really not good .
This really should suggest everybody who care about storage efficiency to move to 1KiB blocks for the Portage tree ( and most likely , not just that ) .
This instead should show you how the data inside the tree is distributed ; note that I dropped the 64 KiB - blocks case , this because the graph would have been unreadable : on such a filesystem , the grand total amounts of just a bit shy of 9GB .
This is also why I did n’t go one step further and simulated all the various filesystems to compare the actual used / free space in them , and in the number of inodes .
* This is actually interesting , the fact that I wanted to comment on the chart , not leaving them to speak for themselves , let me find out that I did a huge mistake and was charting the complete size and the overhead instead of the theoretical size and the overhead in this chart .
But it also says that it ’s easier to note these things in graphical form rather than just looking at the numbers .*
So how do we interpret this data ?
Well , first of all , as I said , on a 4 KiB - sized filesystem , Portage is pretty inefficient : there are too many small files : here the problem is not with ChangeLog ( who still has a non-trivial overhead ) , but rather with the metadata.xml files ( most of them are quite small ) , the ebuilds themselves , and the support files ( patches , config files , and so on ) .
The highest offender of overhead in such a configuration is , though , the generated portage metadata : the files are very small , and I do n’t think any of them is using more than one block .
We also have a huge amount of directories .
Now , the obvious solution to this kind of problems , is , quite reasonably actually , using smaller block sizes .
From the reliability chart you can see already that without going for the very - efficient 512 bytes blocks size ( which might starve at inode numbers ) , 1 KiB blocks size yields a 70 % efficiency , which is not bad , after all , for a compromise .
On the other hand , there is one problem with accepting that as the main approach : the default for almost all filesystems is 4 KiB blocks ( and actually , I think that for modern filesystems that ’s also quite a bad choice , since most of the files that a normal desktop user would be handling nowadays are much bigger , which means that maybe even 128 KiB blocks would prove much efficient ) , so if there is anything we can do to reduce the overhead for that case , without hindering the performance on 512 bytes - sized blocks , I think we should look into it .
As other have said , “ throwing more disks at it ” is not always the proper solution ( mostly because while you can easily find how to add more disk space , it ’s hard to get reliable disk space .
I just added two external WD disks to have a two - level backup for my data …
So comments , ideas about what to try , ideas about how to make the data gathering more accurate and so on are definitely welcome !
And so are links to this post on sites like Reddit which seems to have happened in the past few days , judging from the traffic on my webserver .
Nearly four months after deadly ethnic riots in China 's Muslim region led authorities to shut off the Internet there , local residents are still barred from sending text messages and getting online .
The clampdown on telecommunication in China 's western Xinjiang province , where rioting claimed nearly 200 lives in early July , has hurt local businesses and cut residents off from many nongovernment sources of news and other information .
The rioting between Uighurs , a mostly Muslim minority group native to Xinjiang , and Chinese Han , the country 's ethnic majority , also led China to block various social networking Web sites nationwide .
Twitter , similar Chinese services and Facebook all remain inaccessible in the country .
China has blamed communication on such Web sites for helping lead to the riots , which were sparked by an ethnic brawl in far - away southern China .
Observers have cited a series of sensitive anniversaries this year as a reason for the blockages , but those dates , including China 's 60th anniversary of communist rule on Oct. 1 , have passed .
" The unfortunate truth is that the Chinese government can impose and sustain this kind of Internet service disruption ... for as long as it feels it 's necessary , " said Phelim Kine , a researcher in Hong Kong for New York - based Human Rights Watch .
" The government is impervious to concerns from the business sector and certainly those of ordinary citizens . "
Some companies have been allowed to communicate via a regional network in Xinjiang , said the marketing manager for one local company when reached by phone .
The manager predicted that regular Internet access could return in around one month .
" It 's relatively calm on the streets of Xinjiang now , " he said .
The manager 's company , which sells make - up and other cosmetic products online , is one of many that have had to relocate staff outside of Xinjiang to continue operations , he said .
The owner of another online store , which sells dried fruits , nuts and other snacks , said she did not know of any regional network in Xinjiang .
Most of the store owner 's staff remain in neighboring Gansu province , she said .
China has given little sign of when it will lift the Internet restrictions but said it will gradually do so as Xinjiang stabilizes .
When it comes to which shopping holiday will save you more — Black Friday vs. Cyber Monday — for years , Black Friday dominated , a tried and true tradition for many deal - saavy families .
However , as retailers have rolled out sales on Thanksgiving ( and even earlier ) and more people have gravitated to online shopping , Cyber Monday has become a big draw for those who want to forgo the early wake - up call and long lines , and shop from the comfort of their couch .
With Prime Pantry , which also launched in 2014 , Amazon honed its focus on competing with the Walmarts and pharmacies of the world by giving Prime subscribers an easy way to fill one giant box with household supplies and other nonperishable goods .
In 2015 , Amazon launched a home services arm for everything from house cleanings and oil changes to furniture assembly and theater installation .
Alex Ikonn and his wife Mimi launched Luxyhair.com after they realized how hard it was to find great hair extensions in the marketplace .
This hair extensions ecommerce retailer has built their business on the fan audience they ’ve attracted through YouTube tutorial videos .
They have a serious following , which is exactly what has enabled them to grow their business to seven figures since 2010 !
That same year , the company launched Dash buttons for instant reordering of products like laundry detergent , and it ’s more recently been investing in new services that let package - carrying couriers unlock the truck of your car and even your front door .
Most recently , Amazon has signaled an intention to disrupt health care by purchasing online pharmaceutical startup PillPack .
All of this has helped Amazon grow its North American retail operation at an unbelievable pace ; annual sales for the division more than doubled from $ 50.8 billion in 2014 to $ 106.1 billion last year .
In early 2018 , President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon 's use of the United States Postal Service and pricing of its deliveries , stating , " I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy , " Trump tweeted .
" Amazon should pay these costs ( plus ) and not have them bourne [ sic ] by the American Taxpayer . " [ 167 ]
Amazon 's shares fell by 6 percent as a result of Trump 's comments .
Shepard Smith of Fox News disputed Trump 's claims and pointed to evidence that the USPS was offering below market prices to all customers with no advantage to Amazon .
However , analyst Tom Forte pointed to the fact that Amazon 's payments to the USPS are not public and that their contract has a reputation for being " a sweetheart deal " .

Currently , individuals can sell goods in some 20 categories , while professional sellers have been approved to sell items in more than 15 additional categories .
Individual - approved categories include books , consumer electronics , tools and home improvement , and toys and games .
On the other hand , professionals must meet various requirements to sell beauty products , clothing , fine art and wine .
Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites .
The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers .
Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price . [ 148 ]
Amazon also employs the use of drop shippers or meta sellers .
These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members .
These meta sellers may have millions of products listed , have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time .
Markup is anywhere from 50 % to 100 % and sometimes more , these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true .
As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years .[ citation needed ]
You can save even more money by shopping with discounted gift cards .
“ Companies like CardCash and Raise offer gift cards up to fifty percent off , so a one - hundred - dollar gift card could be purchased for only fifty dollars , ” says Conway of Slickdeals .
“ Some gift cards to popular merchants may be a lesser savings , but every dollar counts , especially if you 're making a larger purchase . ”
Make sure there are enough funds in the account .
Amazon tends to cancel orders until all funds can be paid out of your account .
Contact Amazon for full details of what you can do to help them create the order , so you can get it to ship .
Amazon does n't take any money from you until the item ships .
For those that are not " fulfillment by Amazon , " you 'll have to wait at least 30 minutes for the item to complete the transaction - These Marketplace sellers do n't see any of your order until that window is clear .
Amazon , with its unfettered access to troves of valuable consumer and seller data , came upon a rather interesting business model around 2009 , when it launched a private label division under the name AmazonBasics .
It started first with the items the company noticed people most often purchased without thinking too hard about the brand name , like batteries and HDMI cables .
But as The New York Times reported this past summer , this proved to be a way to fast track a fledgling product category into a massive money - making top seller — AmazonBasics ’
AA batteries now outsell Duracell and Energizer on Amazon.com after just a few years .
Vince Offer is a famous director , comedian , and commercial pitchman who made his name promoting the ShamWow .
Using his natural charisma and his ability to add double entendres to his pitches , Vince turned the commercial into a major career move .
The ShamWow itself is one of the most successful cleaning products on the market today , and Vince himself has gone on to pitch several other As Seen on TV products .
Even so , the first infomercial of the same type we see on TV today , aired in 1982 and was for a hair growth supplement called “ New Generation ” which was marketed by entrepreneur Robert E. Murphy Jr .
It was such a success that other companies quickly began following suit and purchasing program - length commercial air time .
At this time infomercials used to commonly be shown during late night / early morning hours , although stations discovered success showing them at other times when they learned that the majority of purchases were made in the morning , during the day , and around primetime .
Olivia Judson on the influence of science and biology on modern life .
Say “ eeee . ”
Say it again .
Go on : “ eeee . ”
Maybe I ’m easy to please , but doing this a few times makes me giggle .
“ Eeee . ”
Actually , I suspect it ’s not just me .
Saying “ eeee ” pulls up the corners of the mouth and makes you start to smile .
That ’s why we say “ cheese ” to the camera , not “ choose ” or “ chose . ”
And , I think , it ’s why I do n’t get the giggles from “ aaaa ” or “ oooo . ”
The mere act of smiling is often enough to lift your mood ; conversely , the act of frowning can lower it ; scowling can make you feel fed up .
In other words , the gestures you make with your face can — at least to some extent — influence your emotional state .
( The notion that facial expressions affect mood is n’t new .
Edgar Allan
Poe used it in his story “ The Purloined Letter ” : one character reports that when he wishes to know someone ’s mind , he attempts to compose his face to mimic the expression of that someone — then waits to see which emotions arise .
And the idea was developed , in different ways , by both Charles Darwin and William James .
But telling stories and developing arguments is one thing .
Showing , experimentally , that making a face can make a mood is harder ; it ’s only in the past 30 years or so that data have started to accumulate . )
Exactly how frowns and smiles influence mood is a matter of debate .
One possibility is classical conditioning .
Just as Ivan Pavlov conditioned a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the expectation of food , the argument goes , so humans quickly come to associate smiling with feeling happy .
Once the association has been established , smiling is , by itself , enough to generate happy feelings .
Another possibility is that different facial gestures have intrinsic properties that make them more or less pleasant , perhaps by altering the way that blood flows to the brain .
But here ’s what interests me .
As anyone who has tried to learn a foreign language will know , different languages make you move your face in different ways .
For instance , some languages contain many sounds that are forward in the mouth ; others take place more in the throat .
What ’s more , the effects that different languages have on the movements of the face are substantial .
Babies can tell the difference among languages based on the speaker ’s mouth movements alone .
So can computers .
Which made me wonder : do some languages contain an intrinsic bias towards pulling happy faces ?
In other words , do some languages predispose — in a subtle way — their speakers to be merrier than the speakers of other languages ?
As far as I can tell , no one has looked at this .
( It does n’t mean no one has ; it just means I have n’t been able to find it . )
But I did find a smidgen of evidence to suggest the idea ’s not crazy .
A set of experiments investigating the effects of facial movements on mood used different vowel sounds as a stealthy way to get people to pull different faces .
( The idea was to avoid people realizing they were being made to scowl or smile . )
The results showed that if you read aloud a passage full of vowels that make you scowl — the German vowel sound ü , for example — you ’re likely to find yourself in a worse mood than if you read a story similar in content but without any instances of ü.
Similarly , saying ü over and over again generates more feelings of ill will than repeating a or o .
Of course , facial gestures are n’t the whole story of emotions ; moreover , languages can potentially influence emotions in many other ways .
Different languages have different music — sounds and rhythms — that could also have an emotional impact .
The meanings of words may influence moods more than the gestures used to make them .
And just as the words a language uses to describe colors affects how speakers of that language perceive those colors , different languages might allow speakers to process particular emotions differently ; this , in turn , could feed into a culture , perhaps contributing to a general tendency towards gloom or laughter .
Separating these various factors will be difficult , and the overall impact on mood through the facial gestures of a language may well be small , if indeed it exists at all .
Nevertheless , I ’d love to know whether some languages , by the contortions they give the mouth , really do have an impact on their speakers ’ happiness .
If it turns out that there is a language of smiles , I ’d like to learn it .
In the meantime : have a giggle with “ meeeeeee . ”

This paper describes what happens if you read stories full of the “ ü ” sound , or are made to repeat it over and over again .
The idea that the words in a language can affect the thought processes of the speakers is often attributed to Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf ; it has been controversial .
However , some recent experimental evidence supports it , at least when it comes to processing colors .

The iPhone is so totally not my spiritual soulmate .
I refuse to become dependent on apps grown in their environment .
To me it 's like contributing to the enslavement of my brother and sister programmers .
I do n't care how sexy the environment is as a user or a developer , the fact that Apple holds up apps and rejects them often because they compete with their own software is to me like buying a coat made of the skins of endangered species .
I wo n't use iPhone apps for ecological reasons .
I use my iPhone as a : 1 . Phone .
2 : Camera that can communicate ( very valuable feature to me ) .
3 . A Bluetooth tethering device for places my Sprint MiFi does n't work ( and that 's a lot of places ) .
For that I pay about $ 100 per month .
I think I 'm being ripped off .
( Sure of it . )
Okay Scripting
News readers -- tell me I 'm crazy but I want a divorce .
Enough of this bullshit .
But I need a phone that does 1 , 2 and 3 .
What will I fall in love with ?
PS : I have my contacts in GMail .
Must be able to synch with them .

The Iranian Time Frame and the Russian Role
A Question of Timing
Possible Outcomes
Twomajor leaks occurred this weekend over the Iran matter .
In the first , The New York Times published an article reporting that staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the U.N. nuclear oversight group , had produced an unreleased report saying that Iran was much more advanced in its nuclear program than the IAEA had thought previously .
According to the report , Iran now has all the data needed to design a nuclear weapon .
The New York Times article added that U.S. intelligence was re-examining the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) of 2007 , which had stated that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon .
The second leak occurred in the British paper The Sunday Times , which reported that the purpose of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's highly publicized secret visit to Moscow on Sept. 7 was to provide the Russians with a list of Russian scientists and engineers working on Iran 's nuclear weapons program .
The second revelation was directly tied to the first .
There were many , including STRATFOR , who felt that Iran did not have the non-nuclear disciplines needed for rapid progress toward a nuclear device .
Putting the two pieces together , the presence of Russian personnel in Iran would mean that the Iranians had obtained the needed expertise from the Russians .
It would also mean that the Russians were not merely a factor in whether there would be effective sanctions but also in whether and when the Iranians would obtain a nuclear weapon .
We would guess that the leak to The New York Times came from U.S. government sources , because that seems to be a prime vector of leaks from the Obama administration and because the article contained information on the NIE review .
Given that National Security Adviser James Jones tended to dismiss the report on Sunday television , we would guess the report leaked from elsewhere in the administration .
The Sunday Times leak could have come from multiple sources , but we have noted a tendency of the Israelis to leak through the British daily on national security issues .
( The article contained substantial details on the visit and appeared written from the Israeli point of view . )
Neither leak can be taken at face value , of course .
But it is clear that these were deliberate leaks — people rarely risk felony charges leaking such highly classified material — and even if they were not coordinated , they delivered the same message , true or not .
The message was twofold .
First , previous assumptions on time frames on Iran are no longer valid , and worst - case assumptions must now be assumed .
The Iranians are in fact moving rapidly toward a weapon ; have been extremely effective at deceiving U.S. intelligence ( read , they deceived the Bush administration , but the Obama administration has figured it out ) ; and therefore , we are moving toward a decisive moment with Iran .
Second , this situation is the direct responsibility of Russian nuclear expertise .
Whether this expertise came from former employees of the Russian nuclear establishment now looking for work , Russian officials assigned to Iran or unemployed scientists sent to Iran by the Russians is immaterial .
The Israelis — and the Obama administration — must hold the Russians responsible for the current state of Iran 's weapons program , and by extension , Moscow bears responsibility for any actions that Israel or the United States might take to solve the problem .
We would suspect that the leaks were coordinated .
From the Israeli point of view , having said publicly that they are prepared to follow the American lead and allow this phase of diplomacy to play out , there clearly had to be more going on than just last week 's Geneva talks .
From the American point of view , while the Russians have indicated that participating in sanctions on gasoline imports by Iran is not out of the question , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev did not clearly state that Russia would cooperate , nor has anything been heard from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on the subject .
The Russian leadership appears to be playing " good cop , bad cop " on the matter , and the credibility of anything they say on Iran has little weight in Washington .
It would seem to us that the United States and Israel decided to up the ante fairly dramatically in the wake of the Oct. 1 meeting with Iran in Geneva .
As IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei visits Iran , massive new urgency has now been added to the issue .
But we must remember that Iran knows whether it has had help from Russian scientists ; that is something that can't be bluffed .
Given that this specific charge has been made — and as of Monday not challenged by Iran or Russia — indicates to us more is going on than an attempt to bluff the Iranians into concessions .
Unless the two leaks together are completely bogus , and we doubt that , the United States and Israel are leaking information already well known to the Iranians .
They are telling Tehran that its deception campaign has been penetrated , and by extension are telling it that it faces military action — particularly if massive sanctions are impractical because of more Russian obstruction .
If Netanyahu went to Moscow to deliver this intelligence to the Russians , the only surprise would have been the degree to which the Israelis had penetrated the program , not that the Russians were there .
The Russian intelligence services are superbly competent , and keep track of stray nuclear scientists carefully .
They would not be surprised by the charge , only by Israel 's knowledge of it .
This , of course leaves open an enormous question .
Certainly , the Russians appear to have worked with the Iranians on some security issues and have played with the idea of providing the Iranians more substantial military equipment .
But deliberately aiding Iran in building a nuclear device seems beyond Russia 's interests in two ways .
First , while Russia wants to goad the United States , it does not itself really want a nuclear Iran .
Second , in goading the United States , the Russians know not to go too far ; helping Iran build a nuclear weapon would clearly cross a redline , triggering reactions .
A number of possible explanations present themselves .
The leak to The Sunday Times might be wrong .
But The Sunday Times is not a careless newspaper :
It accepts leaks only from certified sources .
The Russian scientists might be private citizens accepting Iranian employment .
But while this is possible , Moscow is very careful about what Russian nuclear engineers do with their time .
Or the Russians might be providing enough help to goad the United States but not enough to ever complete the job .
Whatever the explanation , the leaks paint the Russians as more reckless than they have appeared , assuming the leaks are true .
And whatever their veracity , the leaks — the content of which clearly was discussed in detail among theP - 5+1 prior to and during the Geneva meetings , regardless of how long they have been known by Western intelligence — were made for two reasons .
The first was to tell the Iranians that the nuclear situation is now about to get out of hand , and that attempting to manage the negotiations through endless delays will fail because the United Nations is aware of just how far Tehran has come with its weapons program .
The second was to tell Moscow that the issue is no longer whether the Russians will cooperate on sanctions , but the consequence to Russia 's relations with the United States and at least the United Kingdom , France and , most important , possibly Germany .
If these leaks are true , they are game changers .
We have focused on the Iranian situation not because it is significant in itself , but because it touches on a great number of other crucial international issues .
It is now entangled in the Iraqi , Afghan , Israeli , Palestinian , Syrian and Lebanese issues , all of them high - stakes matters .
It is entangled in Russian relations with Europe and the United States .
It is entangled in U.S. - European relationships and with relationships within Europe .
It touches on the U.S. - Chinese relationship .
It even touches on U.S. relations with Venezuela and some other Latin American countries .
It is becoming the Gordian knot of international relations .
STRATFOR first focused on the Russian connection with Iran in the wake of the Iranian elections and resulting unrest , whena crowd of Rafsanjani supporters began chanting " Death to Russia , " not one of the top - 10 chants in Iran .
That caused us to focus on the cooperation between Russia and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on security matters .
We were aware of some degree of technical cooperation on military hardware , and of course on Russian involvement in Iran 's civilian nuclear program .
We were also of the view that the Iranians were unlikely to progress quickly with their nuclear program .
We were not aware that Russian scientists were directly involved in Iran 's military nuclear project , which is not surprising , given that such involvement would be Iran 's single - most important state secret — and Russia 's , too .
But there is a mystery here as well .
To have any impact , the Russian involvement must have been under way for years .
The United States has tried to track rogue nuclear scientists and engineers — anyone who could contribute to nuclear proliferation — since the 1990s .
The Israelis must have had their own program on this , too .
Both countries , as well as European intelligence services , were focused on Iran 's program and the whereabouts of Russian scientists .
It is hard to believe that they only just now found out .
If we were to guess , we would sayRussian involvement has been under way since just after the Orange Revolution in Ukraine , when the Russians decided that the United States was a direct threat to its national security .
Therefore , the decision suddenly to confront the Russians , and suddenly to leak U.N. reports — much more valuable than U.S. reports , which are easier for the Europeans to ignore — cannot simply be because the United States and Israel just obtained this information .
The IAEA , hostile to the United States since the invasion of Iraq and very much under the influence of the Europeans , must have decided to shift itsevaluation of Iran .
But far more significant is the willingness of the Israelis first to confront the Russians and then leak about Russian involvement , something that obviously compromises Israeli sources and methods .
And that means the Israelis no longer consider the preservation of their intelligence operation in Iran ( or wherever it was carried out ) as of the essence .
Two conclusions can be drawn .
First , the Israelis no longer need to add to their knowledge of Russian involvement ; they know what they need to know .
And second , the Israelis do not expect Iranian development to continue much longer ; otherwise , maintaining the intelligence capability would take precedence over anything else .
It follows from this that the use of this intelligence in diplomatic confrontations with Russians and in a British newspaper serves a greater purpose than the integrity of the source system .
And that means that the Israelis expect a resolution in the very near future — the only reason they would have blown their penetration of the Russian - Iranian system .
There are two possible outcomes here .
The first is that having revealed the extent of the Iranian program and having revealed the Russian role in a credible British newspaper , the Israelis and the Americans ( whose own leak in The New York Times underlined the growing urgency of action ) are hoping that the Iranians realize that they are facing war and that the Russians realize that they are facing a massive crisis in their relations with the West .
If that happens , then the Russians might pull their scientists and engineers , join in the sanctions and force the Iranians to abandon their program .
The second possibility is that the Russians will continue to play the spoiler on sanctions and will insist that they are not giving support to the Iranians .
This leaves the military option , which would mean broad - based action , primarily by the United States , against Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Any military operation would involve keeping the Strait of Hormuz clear , meaning naval action , and we now know that there are more nuclear facilities than previously discussed .
So while the war for the most part would be confined to the air and sea , it would be extensive nonetheless .
Sanctions or war remain thetwo options , and which one is chosen depends on Moscow 's actions .
The leaks this weekend have made clear that the United States and Israel have positioned themselves such that not much time remains .
We have now moved from a view of Iran as a long - term threat to Iran as a much more immediate threat thanks to the Russians .
The least that can be said about this is that the Obama administration and Israel are trying to reshape the negotiations with the Iranians and Russians .
The most that can be said is that the Americans and Israelis are preparing the public for war .
Polls now indicate that more than 60 percent of the U.S. public now favors military action against Iran .
From a political point of view , it has become easier for U.S. President Barack Obama to act than to not act .
This , too , is being transmitted to the Iranians and Russians .
It is not clear to us that the Russians or Iranians are getting the message yet .
They have convinced themselves that Obama is unlikely to act because he is weak at home and already has too many issues to juggle .
This is a case where a reputation for being conciliatory actually increases the chances for war .
But the leaks this weekend have strikingly limited the options and timelines of the United States and Israel .
They also have put the spotlight on Obama at a time when he already is struggling with health care and Afghanistan .
History is rarely considerate of presidential plans , and in this case , the leaks have started to force Obama 's hand .
Like a lot of kids in the summer of 1972 , I was riveted by a strange spectacle unfolding in Iceland : a chess match between Soviet grandmaster Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer , the mercurial young American .
The games were n’t televised -- Fischer permitted no cameras -- so chess experts replayed the moves on public television using oversize boards .
Through long summer days , I puzzled over poisoned pawns and bishop pairs as Fischer , after nearly walking out on the match , crushed the Russian champion .
Through solitary study and determination , Fischer had toppled a Soviet chess establishment that had every advantage : better coaching , state stipends , access to the latest games and opening theory .
I got caught up in the chess mania that swept the country after Fischer ’s victory .
The craze quickly faded , but my fascination with Bobby never did .
Over the years , I read everything I could find about him , replayed his most famous games and talked with friends of his who frequented the Marshall Chess Club in New York , scene of some of his triumphs .
In time , my interest shifted from Fischer ’s chess to a much murkier aspect of his life : the identity of his father .
Bobby ’s life story , like his behavior , was bizarre and complicated .
At the height of his powers , he abandoned the game and went into seclusion , surfacing periodically to spout paranoid , anti-Semitic screeds and to denounce the United States .
He died last year at 64 in Iceland , the only country that would have him .
It seemed to me that if I was to get a better grasp of this elusive figure , I needed to know more about his origins .
Bobby was born in Chicago and raised in Brooklyn by a single mother , Regina Fischer .
She told people his father was a German biophysicist named Gerhardt Fischer .
The couple divorced when Bobby was a toddler .
That ’s about all that was known .
The dearth of details about Gerhardt and his role in Bobby ’s life whetted my curiosity .
What was he like ?
Did he share his son ’s intellectual gifts ?
What kind of relationship did they have ?
My wife , fellow journalist Clea Benson , came to share my interest , and before long it morphed into something of an obsession .
We became part of a subculture in which Fischer fanatics dissect his old games like sacred scrolls , pay tens of thousands of dollars for his old notebooks and argue ceaselessly about whether later champions could have held their own against him .
In search of Fischer arcana , we ’ve been to the Chess Hall of Fame in Miami , whose dominant architectural feature is an oversize rook .
We ’ve pored over records at the New York Public Library .
We ’ve hired Hungarian translators and sifted through 70 - year - old letters stored at the National Archives in Maryland .
In 2002 , I even made a pilgrimage to Reykjavik to see the chess board where Fischer and Spassky squared off 30 years before .
That same year , I resolved to get more serious about my research on Gerhardt .
Enough amateur sleuthing .
Now I would use my reportorial skills to gather every available fact about the man .
FBI dossiers are often a rich source of information .
I thought it unlikely the bureau had a file on Gerhardt , but Regina was well - known in her day .
Whatever information the FBI had collected about her might shed light on him .
I requested the file under the Freedom of Information Act .
A few months later , it arrived in the mail -- 900 heavily redacted pages reflecting the ideological phobias of a bygone era .
Regina was a European Jew who immigrated to the U.S. as a child , traveled widely and earned nursing and medical degrees .
She married Gerhardt in Moscow in 1933 , and the couple lived there for several years .
She returned to the U.S. at the outset of World War II .
The FBI , suspecting she was a Soviet agent , read her mail and tracked her movements for years .
( In the end , agents concluded she was not a spy . )
The file has little to say about Gerhardt .
But its pages are crammed with details about a man Clea and I had never heard of : Paul Felix Nemenyi .
Born to a prominent Jewish family in Hungary in 1895 , he was brilliant .
At 17 , he was co-winner of a national math and physics competition .
He had a special gift for spatial relations -- a skill important to chess players .
In the 1920s , he became a university lecturer in Berlin .
Nemenyi lost his position in 1933 , when “ non-Aryans ” were purged from German universities .
He settled in the U.S. , and in 1942 he was teaching at what was then Colorado State College in Fort Collins .
Regina was studying at the University of Denver .
They appear to have met and had an affair .
Gerhardt , unable to obtain a visa to enter the U.S. , was in Chile at the time , according to the FBI file .
In 1943 , Regina moved to Chicago , alone .
Bobby was born there in March of that year .
His birth certificate lists Gerhardt as the father .
FBI agents doubted that was possible , since their records indicated he had never set foot in the U.S .
Regina herself told conflicting stories about the father ’s identity .
She was itinerant , shuttling between jobs and schools all over the country .
She would often turn to Jewish social service agencies for advice and financial aid .
From employees at these agencies , the FBI learned that Regina once told a social worker that she had n’t seen Gerhardt since 1939 , four years before Bobby was born .
On another occasion , she said Bobby was conceived when she visited Gerhardt in Mexico .
Nemenyi visited some of these same agencies , according to the FBI file .
He arranged to pay child support and told social workers he was unhappy with how Regina was raising Bobby .
He once grew so upset describing his quarrels with Regina , according to one document , that he began “ weeping . ”
On the Internet , Clea and I found an obituary of a civil rights activist from North Carolina named Peter Nemenyi -- Paul Nemenyi ’s son from an early marriage .
Peter , who died in 2002 , was about 15 years older than Bobby and had told friends he was Fischer ’s half - brother .
He had a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University and supported himself teaching .
Clea ran his name through a database of university archives and discovered that some of his personal papers were at the University of Wisconsin .
An archivist faxed us the file .
It contained a letter that Peter wrote after his father died in 1952 .
Bobby was 9 at the time .
Peter was writing to the boy ’s psychiatrist for advice .
Regina had asked him to break the news of Paul ’s death to Bobby , and he was n’t sure how to do it .
He had met Bobby only a couple of times .
“ I take it you know that Paul was Bobby ’s father , ” Peter wrote .
The file also contained a letter to Peter from Regina .
She said she was destitute because of Paul ’s death -- Paul had been paying for Bobby ’s schooling .
Clea and I wrote a story about these discoveries in 2002 for the Philadelphia Inquirer , where we both worked at the time .
For a pair of Fischer obsessives , it was a heady feeling .
We ’d uncovered information that suggested the generally accepted outline of Fischer ’s life was wrong in one very important detail :
His father was not Gerhardt Fischer , but rather Paul Nemenyi .
If our conclusion held up , it could change the popular understanding of Fischer and the formative influences on him .
Response to our disclosure was mixed .
Friends of Bobby were skeptical .
Fischer himself did not react publicly from his overseas exile :
We sent him letters in Budapest and Tokyo , cities where he had been seen , but got no reply .
In subsequent articles , some writers referred to our findings about Nemenyi as a theory , nothing more .
So we kept at it .
Clea went back online and discovered that letters Paul had written to the Hungarian - born engineer Theodore von Karman were stored at Caltech .
She contacted the school in 2005 and it sent us copies .
Inside the package we were stunned to find a photograph of Paul Nemenyi -- the first we ’d ever seen .
He had enclosed it with one of his letters to Von Karman .
The resemblance to Bobby was striking : the same deep - set , burning eyes , the same facial structure , even the same unruly shock of hair .
Next , we pulled Nemenyi ’s probate file from court archives in Washington , D.C. , where he died .
It contained a petition by the executor of Nemenyi ’s estate -- a lawyer hired by his son Peter -- stating that Bobby had been born to Regina and Nemenyi “ out of wedlock . ”
Now we felt we had proven the case beyond any doubt .
We presented our findings at a Bobby Fischer symposium at the Marshall Chess Club in March .
We set up a projector for our PowerPoint slide show on the same chess table where Fischer , in 1965 , had played by teletype in a tournament hosted by Cuba .
The audience was polite and largely accepting of our conclusion .
But in the wider world , doubts persisted .
An online skeptic wrote : “ The only way you can really say ‘ beyond all doubt ’ is by testing the DNA . ”
We had another line in the water , however .
A few months earlier , we ’d realized there was a potential source of information we had n’t tapped .
Perhaps the FBI did have a file on Gerhardt .
We sent a request to the bureau just in case .
There was such a file , it turned out , and it arrived in the mail in July .
Included was a copy of a letter , dated May 22 , 1959 , from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to his counterpart at the CIA , detailing recent surveillance of Regina and Bobby .
In an aside , Hoover wrote : “ It is interesting to note that investigation has established that the father of Robert James Fischer is not [ Gerhardt ]
Fischer as represented by Mrs. Fischer .
Investigation has established that Robert James Fischer ’s father was one Paul Felix Nemenyi . ”
The letter does n’t say how the FBI reached this conclusion .
But it seems likely that agents learned the truth from social service agencies that dealt with Regina and Nemenyi .
Why did Regina maintain the fiction that Gerhardt was the father ?
Russell Targ of Palo Alto , who was married to her daughter , Joan , for nearly 40 years , thinks Regina wanted to avoid the stigma of an out - of - wedlock birth .
“ She wanted to say the man she was married to was the father of the baby , ” he said .
Did Bobby know Nemenyi was his father ?
Eva Stallings , a close friend of Bobby , offered a clue when I reached her by phone in New York this summer .
In 2004 , Bobby was detained by the Japanese for traveling without a valid U.S. passport .
The State Department had revoked his passport because of an outstanding arrest warrant .
Fischer was wanted on federal charges that he had violated U.S. economic sanctions by traveling to Yugoslavia in 1992 for a rematch with Spassky .
He was at risk of being deported to the U.S. and put on trial .
Stallings was among a group of friends who tried to find him a haven in Germany .
She told me she drafted a request to the German government for Gerhardt ’s birth certificate , hoping it would help Bobby make his case for refuge .
When she showed him the letter , he made a telling alteration , she said .
He crossed out a passage that identified Gerhardt as his father , writing instead that Gerhardt was “ listed on my U.S. birth certificate as my father . ”
Stallings thinks Bobby was signaling that his real father was someone else .
“ That ’s the conclusion I would draw , ” said Stallings , now an employee of the German consulate in New York .
Another close friend says Bobby shared memories of Nemenyi with her .
Zita Rajcsanyi , a Hungarian chess player , gave several interviews to Hungarian journalist Tivadar Farkashazy for a book he published in 2008 .
Rajcsanyi declined our request for an interview , but told us the book is accurate .
We had the relevant parts translated into English .
According to the book , Bobby told her that a man named Paul with a thick Hungarian accent would show up at the Brooklyn apartment he shared with his mother and sister and take him on outings .
Bobby told Rajcsanyi that Paul once took him to a restaurant and scolded him for spreading butter on the outside of the bun rather than the inside -- “ as is customary in better cultural circles . ”
When Bobby was 9 , Nemenyi disappeared from his life .
It was only then that Bobby learned the truth , according to the book .
He asked his mother why Nemenyi had stopped visiting , and she told him he had died .
“ He was your father , ” Regina told her son , according to Rajcsanyi .
“ Did n’t you know ? ”
How was Bobby affected by the secrecy and the contradictions surrounding his father ’s identity ?
What was it like for him to learn that the man whose name he bore was not his father -- and to find out only after Nemenyi ’s death that this mysterious figure with the thick accent was his flesh and blood ?
There is no way to know .
But these experiences may help explain Fischer ’s venomous anti-Semitism and his denial of his own Jewish ancestry .
As a teenager , he told a magazine writer he was Jewish only on his mother ’s side .
Years later , he wrote to the Encyclopedia Judaica asking that he not be listed as a Jew .
When he returned from his victory in Iceland in 1972 , he stayed with his sister and her husband in Palo Alto .
Bobby ’s anti-Semitic tirades grew so unbearable that Joan kicked him out , Targ recalled .
“ It was almost like Tourette ’s , ” Targ said .
“ He could n’t control himself . ”
On a Philippine radio show in 1999 , Fischer denied the Holocaust and said that he was the victim of a Jewish “ conspiracy . ”
Such outbursts seem all the more strange in light of how his father ’s family suffered under the Nazis .
Paul Nemenyi ’s mother and brother -- Bobby ’s grandmother and uncle -- were held in a concentration camp .
The uncle ’s art collection , which included works by Klimt , Kandinsky and Matisse , was stolen and never recovered , according to Hungarian art researchers .
To this day , Fischer exerts a powerful hold on the imagination , despite ( or perhaps because of ) the tragic arc of his life after Reykjavik .
My wife and I believe there ’s more to be learned about Nemenyi ’s role in that life .
We ’re thinking about a trip to Hungary , where he was born .
Who knows what we might find ?

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
In a patchwork of agricultural fields outside Seville , Spain , two otherworldly towers rise above the plain .
Nearby arrays of mirrors reflect light onto the towers , illuminating the water vapor and dust suspended in the air and creating visible beams .
Within the towers , the thermal energy from the concentrated light creates steam , and the steam powers turbines to generate electricity .
Known as PS10 and PS20 , the mirror - tower networks are part of a larger project intended to meet the energy needs of some 180,000 homes — roughly the energy needs of Seville — by 2013 , without greenhouse gas emissions .
The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this false - color image of PS10 and PS20 on August 29 , 2009 .
Red indicates vegetation , shades of brown indicate bare ground and / or fallow fields , and blue indicates water .
Human - made structures appear in shades of blue - gray .
PS10 and PS20 appear as approximate circles punctuated by towers on their southern ends .
Although less conspicuous than the circular arrays , rectangular arrays of mirrors operate south of the towers .
The mirrored heliostats that make up the arrays track the Sun ’s position throughout the day and send concentrated energy to the nearby towers .
A BBC correspondent who ascended PS10 in the spring of 2007 recorded sauna - like temperatures and searing ladder rungs near the tower ’s top , and a mirror - illuminated glow to the entire area .
PS20 began operating two years later .
As this image shows , the network for PS20 is larger than that for PS10 .
The tower sizes and energy capacities differ as well .
Reaching a height of 115 meters ( approximately 380 feet ) , PS10 is powered by 624 heliostats .
Reaching a height of 165 meters ( approximately 540 feet ) , PS20 is powered by 1,255 mirrored heliostats .
PS20 was designed to produce twice the energy of its smaller , 11 - megawatt neighbor .
The towers both produced more energy than expected during trial tests .
Although not the world ’s first power towers , PS10 and PS20 became the first project executed on such a large scale .

Where I live ( the Netherlands ) , if you were to call NATO the world ’s most dangerous institution , a consensus would quickly form to conclude that you must have lost your marbles .
Yet , without NATO we would not have a Ukraine crisis , and no speculations about the possibility of war with Russia .
Taking nuclear war seriously as a policy option should be listed in psychology handbooks as indicative of complete insanity or lethal ignorance .
This has not stopped newspaper editors from speculating about it in their headlines , as they fill in the blanks of what a number top officials on both sides of the Atlantic have recently been half - saying or implying .
With no NATO they would not have had occasion or reason to do so .
Ukraine ’s Deputy Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko recently said : “ Everybody is afraid of fighting with a nuclear state .
We are not anymore ” .
Political insanity can exist independently of NATO , but the least one can say is that it has become a facilitator of that insanity .
It would therefore be a momentous development for what is still called ‘ the West ’ if last week ’s Der Spiegel signals a relevant German awakening .
The weekly magazine published a hard hitting article in which the Supreme Allied Commander Europe , General Breedlove , is accused of undermining Chancellor Merkel ’s attempts to find a solution to the Ukraine crisis through diplomacy .
The military head of NATO , with his exaggerations and untruths about Russian troop movements , spouts “ dangerous propaganda ” according to officials in Merkel ’s Chancellery , as quoted by the magazine .
In other words , he can no longer be trusted .
Lies coming out of Washington that portray Putin as the grand aggressor are nothing new ; for about a year they have formed a constant stream , from the lips of the Vice President , the Secretary of State , and in a milder form from the President himself .
As a result the idea of Russian aggression has become close to an article of faith in Northern Europe ’s mainstream media .
But by singling out Breedlove , the German fingerpointing is directed at NATO , and Obama and Co may draw their own conclusions from it .
An assortment of conflicts have gone into the Ukraine crisis , but the two that now appear to have become fundamental to it play themselves out far away from that tragic country .
One is centered in Washington where an out - of - his - depth president must decide whether to become realistic or give in further to right - wing forces that want to give the Kiev regime the weapons needed to continue its war in Eastern Ukraine .
The second conflict is an incipient one about NATO – meaning European subservience to the United States – begun by Angela Merkel ’s and Francois Hollande ’s recently formed Peace Party , of which their mission to the Kremlin , Merkel ’s joint press conference with Obama and the abovementioned German reporting are early signs .
Until now Obama has given as good as free rein to the liberal hawks and neocons in his own government .
The War Party .
A prominent member of that group , Victoria Nuland , who played a central role in helping to organize the coup d’état in Kiev last year , is eager to give Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko the means to survive the onslaughts of supernationalists in his own environment and to subdue , finally , the anti-regime troops in South East Ukraine .
Nuland works closely with Breedlove , and both have expressed themselves in denigrating terms about European recalcitrance in the face of what they want to accomplish .
Should Obama choose to become realistic , it would require measures to show the world
Here in Theo Walcott 's own words , and those of his family and friends , is the story of the Arsenal and England forward 's rise – from pillow - fighting star of the Southampton youth team to self - effacing international
Theo Walcott
When I was 10 years old my teacher got us to imagine our future .
I drew a timeline of the rest of my life .
I had just started playing football , so I drew pictures of me as a professional footballer .
I imagined I 'd drive a nice car , have a nice house , and win the World Cup with England .
I 'd have two wives – one would die and so I would get remarried ( I have n't told my girlfriend Mel that bit yet ) – and then I 'd die aged 90 .
It was all very far - fetched , but the footballer part has come true .
As a little kid , I was n't even interested in football .
The first time I played I was nine and I volunteered to go in goal thinking it would be exciting to save penalties .
In fact , it was really boring .
Up until then football had just been having a kickaround in the playground at lunchtime .
We used to pretend we were making our own Nike adverts ; 10 years later , I made one for real .
My friend Adam gave me my first chance to play in an organised match , for Steventon , when I was 10 .
The team were one player short and I joined in .
I had never played before , but I came on and scored a perfect hat - trick : header , left foot , right foot .
At the time I did n't even know what that was .
I can't explain how I did it ; it just seemed to come naturally to me .
I 'll never forget that moment .
Don Walcott , dad
That was the first time we ever watched Theo play a match .
He scored a hat - trick and it was a big surprise .
Newbury wanted to sign him after that , and I said I did n't even know he could play football .
Steve Taylor , AFC Newbury coach
We had a six - a - side the following Sunday , and Theo came along .
He was very raw , but showed so much potential .
I remember saying to his dad : " Don , he 'll play professional football one day " .
Don said , " You 've got to be joking " , but I meant it .
The thing that stood out about Theo was his unbelievable pace .
He looked like an Olympic sprinter .
He ran as fast with the ball as without it , which is quite an art .
He knew where to run and the ball just seemed to stick to him ; he was a joy to watch .
We signed him there and then and brought him along to play Hungerford .
I said to the opposition : " We 've got a Brazilian " – that was what we called Theo – and he went and scored a hat - trick in his very first game for us .
Theo Walcott I did n't really have a clue what football was about at that time .
Dad had an old video of him playing for the RAF , doing this one skill he had – I call it the Don Walcott special – and he made me watch that a lot .
Otherwise my biggest inspiration was Michael Owen , because he made football look easy .
When I was 11 I was invited to be a ballboy at Stamford Bridge when Chelsea played Liverpool .
I was a Liverpool fan , so I was gutted that they lost 2 - 0 .
Afterwards , I was introduced to the players – I found it terrifying .
I can remember walking into the dressing room and the first thing I saw was Zola 's bum as he reached for his towel !
I felt like a scared little pup , because there were so many people in one room .
I got to meet Michael Owen , though , and we had our picture taken together .
Six years later , at the World Cup in Germany , I brought out that photo and showed it to him .
It was a funny moment .
Lynn Walcott , mum I realised Theo had a special talent when he was 13 .
I remember saying to Don : " He 's going to make it " , but Mr Negative here said : " No , we must n't say that . "
People kept telling us he was special for his age .
There was this term his coaches used : " the full package " .
There were lots of boys with skills , but the difference , we were told , was his character .
Andy Ritchie , youth coach at Southampton FC academy
The first time I heard about Theo was when he trialled at Southampton .
The U13s had just played Chelsea and we won 5 - 2 .
That was unusual ; we rarely scored that many against Chelsea .
Then my friend told me that this young lad called Theo Walcott had scored three .
He had n't even signed for us yet .
I 've worked in football for 17 years at Crystal Palace , Charlton , Chelsea and Southampton and I 've never met a boy like him , even at Chelsea where John Terry was in my youth team .
As soon as I saw Theo play he just looked so natural .
It 's something you can't teach .
Like that run he made against Liverpool in the Champions League ; it was George Best all over – riding scything tackles , he just kept going .
To have someone like that in your team as a coach … oh , you 're very lucky .
Jumpers for goalposts : Theo Walcott .

Theo Walcott Playing youth football meant a lot of goals , and a lot of travelling .
My dad drove me everywhere and we got through quite a few cars as a result .
Once , on our way to Eastleigh to play Arsenal , we broke down and I was distraught because we were going to miss the start of the game .
We had to call grandad to rescue us .
After the World Cup I bought my dad a car to make up for all the ones that had blown up over the years .
In my second season at Southampton , aged 13 , my dad bet me £ 100 I could n't score 30 goals in one season .
I was like , " Wow , that 's a lot of money . "
The very last game we were playing Tottenham and I was on 28 goals .
My dad was filming the game and as I scored my 29th you could hear him getting nervous about losing the bet .
In the last five minutes , I won a penalty .
My dad started mumbling on the tape : " If he scores this , he gets £ 100 . "
Instead , I hit the bar .
Andy Ritchie
He was 15 years old when it finally sunk in just how special he was .
We were playing Arsenal in an FA Youth Cup game at St Mary 's and Theo scored the winning goal with his weaker foot after an incredible first touch .
To do that against Arsenal , against boys three years older , outpacing them , and in that stadium in front of a number of high - profile people … that was when I knew that he was different .
It was n't just about pace then – he had delivered on the biggest stage .
It was then that I knew Southampton could n't keep him .
Jake Thomson , best friend from Southampton
When we first met at Southampton everyone knew he was going to play professionally , you could see he had that little something extra .
When we turned 16 we all moved into digs called the Lodge .
That was a lot of fun – water fights and pillow fights , lads messing about .
Theo shared a room with Gareth Bale and I was next door .
He was training with the first team by then , but back at the Lodge he was just one of us .
He called himself the " underwear bandit " ; he put pants on his head , like a mask , and went in people 's rooms and hit them with towels !
Theo Walcott
It was only when I started playing for Southampton reserves , aged 15 , that the thought of becoming a professional began to seem real .
At 16 , I moved into digs with the other players my age , and we had a great time .
We had pillow fights – some people used to turn the pillow cases round so that you got hit with the zip , all those stupid things you do as a kid .
Before Gareth Bale and I left we signed our names on the wall of our room .
Georges Prost , Southampton U17s
For a coach , he was a wonderful lad to work with – he had such enthusiasm .
English lads are always good in motivation and discipline , but Theo had one other advantage : technique .
Whereas in France we have lads training every day , even at U13 level , in England they are not so technically aware ; they are only doing two training sessions a week .
Theo , however , was different because he always played up an age group .
We did a lot of repetition – right foot , left foot , control , always working with the ball .
I think playing above his age really helped him to develop very quickly .
Lynn Walcott
The day that he signed for Arsenal we knew everything was going to change for the whole family .
I remember that day : 20 January 2006 .
I was in Sainsbury 's with my daughter and I got a call from Don .
He said : " Quick , you 've got to get to Hertfordshire now !
It 's going ahead , he 's signing ! " I whizzed out the shop .
He was only 16 at the time ; he was n't even old enough to drive .
The next thing we knew Theo was called up for the World Cup squad and we had journalists camping out in our village day and night , knocking on the door .
Jake Thomson
All of a sudden , he was off to Arsenal .
It was strange – I was used to seeing him every day , then he was gone .
He came to say goodbye and someone said : " Oh you 'll probably go to the World Cup . "
His dad was in the kitchen and said : " Do n't be stupid ! "
When I heard he got the call - up I could n't believe it .
Theo Walcott Moving to Arsenal was a big contrast , from running around with your mates to being serious .
I had to grow up fast .
I was really quiet , as you would be walking into the changing room with Thierry Henry , Robert Pirès and Freddie Ljungberg there .
I was starstruck .
On the pitch I also struggled to be myself .
In a reserve game for Southampton , against Portsmouth , I had injured my shoulder when Linvoy Primus fell on my arm .
Southampton said it was just a dead arm , but when I went to Arsenal it came up on the medical that I was going to have problems with both shoulders .
It was n't Linvoy 's fault , it was just genetics .
That first season at Arsenal I dislocated my shoulder in every game .
Nobody knew at the time , but my shoulder kept popping in and out during matches ; it was very painful and I could n't play at my best .
I had to hold it when I was running .
Don Walcott
What I really admire about Theo is his attitude .
The way he handled the World Cup situation , at 17 , I do n't think many people could do that .
His view on life , his respect for other players , and how he conducts himself – I think that is all very important .
He 's had to be like that since he was 16 , and that is quite something .
And he 's never changed .
I 'm not sure I would have been like that .
It 's a unique gift that will take him a long way in life .
David James , England team - mate
There was an understanding from very early on that Theo had his head screwed on .
He did n't play at the 2006 World Cup , but I saw him do some amazing things in training .
I remember we had a little five - a- side , and I literally threw a ball at him and he volleyed it first time into the back of the net .
I thought , " That 's not bad . "
Theo Walcott
If I was quiet at Arsenal , I was even quieter with England .
During that 2006 World Cup , I made a DVD diary .
I filmed the fans as I was looking out from the team bus , and interviewed the players , but I felt more like a fan myself .
I was just a little kid , and it was strange for me .
When I watch it back now I see myself looking into the camera talking about whether I 'll play .
It was sad in the end , not getting the chance .
I 'll definitely do another diary for the World Cup next year , if I make it .
Even now , with England , it can still be a bit daunting .
I always sit next to David Beckham when we eat – my sister gets really jealous when I tell her .
I 'm there staring at his tattoos thinking , " Wow , they 're fantastic . "
He definitely influenced me to get mine .
David always looks after me ; he 's a really nice guy .
Steve Taylor
I 'm not at all surprised at how far he 's got .
If ever anyone criticised him , he always came back stronger , let his feet do the talking .
He did the same thing for England , came back and scored a hat - trick against Croatia after all that criticism .
That result was a big stepping stone for England .
David James
Theo reminds me of Michael Owen .
Michael never shouted the odds across the table ; he always kept himself to himself .
Theo is the same – even after the Croatia game , he went there , scored three goals and went home .
There was n't any change in him .
The lads started calling him Lewis Hamilton – because he 's quicker than Lewis 's car .
With all that , you could excuse a young player for being a bit big - headed , but he was exactly the same afterwards .
A mature , quiet , sensible young lad – I genuinely like him .
Jake Thomson
I always say the only thing that 's changed about Theo is that his wallet 's got bigger .
He 's a top guy , with a great family .
I have never seen him as " Theo Walcott " ; he 's just my friend .
We still mess about like kids .
He 's very mature when he needs to be , but around people who know him he 's silly .
When someone says something boring we shut our eyes and pretend to go to sleep .
Lynn Walcott
I still get a kick out of walking behind Theo , and seeing people 's faces turn .
I never tire of that being really funny .
I never worried about him being a footballer – how many people get paid to do something you love so much ?
Andy Ritchie
He 's great with the supporters , he just has that human touch .
He 's a marketing man 's dream , he is Beckhamesque in that respect – a great ambassador for the game of football .
Theo Walcott I 'm still only 20 , but I feel like I 'm coming into my own now .
There 's a lot more for me to achieve with Arsenal , and England , but I do n't think I 'm seen as a kid any more , I 'm more established .
Remembering back to how I used to check the squad list every week at Arsenal , to see if my name was on it , now it feels good to know that I 'm always there .
Still , I sometimes check just to make sure .
All those years ago , when I was 10 and planned out my life story , I predicted that England would win the World Cup .
I do n't think I was clever enough to write down the year it would happen , but it would be a dream come true if it was 2010 , and I was a part of it .

The electric vehicle community cheered when President Obama declared his goal of seeing one million plug - in vehicles for sale by 2015 .
It was reminiscent of President Bush 's support of hydrogen in 2003 and of ethanol in 2007 , but with a different interest group celebrating .
It 's a road we 've traveled before , but this time we need to get it right .
The Obama Administration has certainly put its money where its mouth is with respect to the pledge Obama made ( .pdf ) in August , 2008 .
Consumers are eligible for up to $ 7,500 in federal tax credits for plug - in hybrid and battery electric vehicles , a subsidy designed to offset the high cost of batteries .
This is certainly very helpful toward achieving the goal of electrification , but it falls short in some significant ways .
Congress can and should modify the credit to better support the broad adoption of electric vehicles in the United States .
The $ 7,500 tax credit ( for vehicles with battery capacity of 16 kilowatt - hours or more ) should be an instant rebate at the time of purchase , not a personal income tax credit applied at tax time the following April .
As structured , the tax credit does not reduce the sticker price for consumers .
They 've still got to come up with the full amount in cash or financing to purchase the car .
An instant rebate would be a much more powerful driver for sales , especially for the mainstream customer who will rely on financing to buy the vehicle .
To make this incentive even more effective , the tax credit also should be structured so a commercial entity can claim it if they purchase the battery pack for the purpose of leasing it back to a consumer .
Currently , the tax credit only applies to personal income tax .
Such a change will provide a pathway for financing companies to more cost effectively lease batteries to customers , as we have seen in the solar industry .
Neither of these changes would increase the cost of the incentive to taxpayers , but they would greatly improve the effectiveness of the program to drive sales of electric cars to mainstream customers .
Acting now , in advance of the market launch of " affordable " electric cars from Nissan , General Motors and Coda Automotive next fall will surely accelerate adoption of electric vehicles .
Darryl Siry was the chief marketing officer of Tesla Motors from December 2006 until December 2008 and is a special advisor to the board of Coda Automotive .

Since last year , the WordPress themes market has grown incredibly .
The reason ?
Great designs , of course , but also a lot of amazing new functionality .
Top WordPress developers are always looking to get the most out of WordPress and use all of their knowledge to find ways to make their favorite blogging engine even more powerful .
In this article , we have compiled ten useful WordPress code snippets , hacks and tips to help you create a WordPress theme that stands out from the crowd .
1. Style Posts Individually
The problem .
Your blog has a lot of posts , but the posts are n’t all of the same type .
To give special styling to one or more of your posts , you can take advantage of both the post_class ( ) function and the post ID .
The solution .
To apply this trick , just open your single .
php file , find the loop and replace it with the following :
<? php if ( have_posts ( ) ) : ?> <? php while ( have_posts ( ) ) : the_post ( ) ; ?> < div <?php post_class ( ) ?> id =" post -<?php the_ID ( ) ; ?> " > < h3 >< a href= " <? php the_permalink ( ) ?>" ><? php the_title ( ) ; ?></a></h3 > <? php the_content ( ) ; ?> </div > <? php endwhile ; else : ?> <? php _e ( ' Sorry , no posts matched your criteria . ' ) ; ?> <? php endif ; ?>
Code explanation .
The important part is mostly in line 3 .
Here , we have added the PHP post_class ( ) function .
Introduced in WordPress 2.8 , this function adds CSS classes to the post .
For example , it can add :
. hentry
. sticky
.category - tutorials
.tag-wordpress
With these CSS classes now added , you can now give a custom style to all posts that have the sticky tag or those that belong to the tutorials category .
The other important piece of this code is id = " post -<? php the_ID ( ) ; ? > " .
By displaying the ID of the post here , we ’re able to style a particular post .
As an example :
# post - 876 { background : #ccc ; }
Source :
2. Display Related Posts … With Thumbnails !
The problem .
After they have read your latest post , what do your readers do ?
That ’s easy : most of them simply leave .
A great way to keep them interested is to display a list of related posts .
Many plug-ins can do that , but for those who like to know how things works , here is some nice code to get related posts and their thumbnails .
The solution .
Simply paste this code after the the_content ( ) function in your single .
php file :
<? php $ original_post = $ post ; $ tags = wp_get_post_tags ( $ post ->ID ) ; if ( $ tags ) { echo ' < h2 > Related Posts < / h2 > ' ; $ first_tag = $ tags [ 0 ] -> term_id ; $ args=array ( ' tag__in ' => array ( $ first_tag ) , ' post__not_in ' => array ( $ post ->ID ) , ' showposts '= > 4 , ' caller_get_posts '=> 1 ) ; $ my_query = new WP_Query ( $args ) ; if ( $ my_query -> have_posts ( ) ) { echo " < ul > " ; while ( $ my_query ->have_posts ( ) ) : $ my_query -> the_post ( ) ; ?> < li><img src= " <?php bloginfo( ' template_directory ' ) ; ?>/timthumb/timthumb.php?src=<?php echo get_post_meta( $ post ->ID , " post-img " , true ) ; ?>&h=40&w=40&zc=1 " alt= " " />< a href= " <? php the_permalink ( ) ? > " rel= " bookmark " title= " Permanent Link to <?php the_title_attribute ( ) ; ?> " ><? php the_title ( ) ; ?></a></li> <? php endwhile ; echo " < /ul > " ; } } $ post = $ original_post ; wp_reset_query ( ) ; ?>
Code explanation .
First , this code makes use of TimbThumb , a PHP image - resizing script .
We have used it to automatically resize images to 40 by 40 pixels .
Once this code is pasted in your theme , it uses the first tag of the post to fetch related posts .
In this example , four related posts are displayed .
You can change this number on line 10 .
Also , notice that I have cloned the $ post variable at the beginning of the script and restored it at the end .
This prevents problems that may occur with the loop , such as comments being assigned to the wrong post .

3. Alternate Post Styling On Your Home Page
The problem .
Many new WordPress themes have an amazing way of displaying posts on the home page .
For example , we can display the first three posts bigger than the rest , with images and extended text , with the remaining posts shown more simply .
I have seen many themes in which developers use two distinct loops to achieve this , which is n’t necessary and can cause further problems .
Let ’s use a much simpler method .
The solution .
Here is a custom loop that displays the first three posts different than the rest .
You can replace the existing loop in your index .
php file with this code .
<? php $ postnum = 0 ; while ( have_posts ( ) ) : the_post ( ) ; ?> <? php if ( $ postnum <= 3 ) { ?> < div <?php post_class ( ) ?> id =" post -<?php the_ID ( ) ; ?> " > < div class = " date " >< span ><? php the_time ( 'M j ' ) ?></span></div> < h2 >(<? php echo $ postnum ; ?> ) < a href= " <? php the_permalink ( ) ?>" ><? php the_title ( ) ; ?></a></h2 > < div class=" post - image " style = " text - align : center ; " > < a href= " <? php the_permalink ( ) ?>" >< img src= " <? php bloginfo( ' template_directory ' ) ; ?>/timthumb.php?src=<?php echo catch_that_image ( ) ; ?>&w=500&h=200&zc=1 " alt= " <? php the_title ( ) ; ? > "
/></a> </div> < p ><? php the_content ( ' Read the rest of this entry »' ) ; ?></p> < p class = " more " >< a href= " # " >
Read More</a></p> </div> </div > <? php } else { < div <? php post_class ( ' single ' . $ end ) ; ?> id =" post -<?php the_ID ( ) ; ?> " > < div class= " post - content " > < h3 > < a href= " <? php the_permalink ( ) ?>" >(<? php echo $ postnum ; ?>) <? php the_title ( ) ; ?></a> <? php edit_post_link ('_' , ’ , ’ ) ; ?></h3 > < p><?php the_excerpt( ’ ) ; ?></p> < p class = " more " >< a href= " # " >
Read More ?</a></p> </div> </div><!--
End post --> <? php } endwhile ; ?>
Code explanation .
Nothing hard here !
We just created a PHP variable , named $ postnum , which is invoked at the end of the loop .
If $ postnum is less than or equal to 3 , the post is displayed in full .
Otherwise , it is displayed in its more compact form .
4. Using Multiple Loops
The problem .
When coding complex WordPress pages with more than one loop , it can happen that one of the loops does n’t behave as expected : for example , unwanted offset , repeated posts , etc .
Happily , with a bit of knowledge and a very useful function , we can avoid this .
The solution .
The following example features two distinct loops .
Notice the rewind_posts ( ) function on line 8 .
This example can be used on any WordPress file as is : index. php , single .
php , etc .
// First loop ( get the last 3 posts in the " featured " category ) <?php query_posts ('category_name=featured&showposts=3 ' ) ; ?> <? php while ( have_posts ( ) ) : the_post ( ) ; ?> <!--
Do stuff ... --> <? php endwhile ; ?> //loop reset <?php rewind_posts ( ) ; ?> // Second loop ( Get all posts ) <? php while ( have_posts ( ) ) : the_post ( ) ; ?> <!--
Do stuff ... --> <? php endwhile ; ?>
Code explanation .
This piece of code does n’t use any hacks ; rewind_posts ( ) is a standard WordPress function .
The purpose of rewind_posts ( ) is to “ clear ” a loop that has been previously used ( like the first loop in our example above ) , allowing you to use a second loop that is n’t affected by the first loop ’s results .

5. Overwrite Post Titles Easily
The problem .
the_title( ) is a basic but very useful WordPress function : it displays the post or page ’s title .
No more , no less .
But hey , have you ever wished you were able to display the full title in your listing of posts and a custom title on the actual post ’s page ?
If so , find out how right here .
The solution .
In your single . php file , find the call to the the_title ( ) function and replace it with the following code :
<? php $ title = get_post_meta( $ post ->ID , " custom - title " , true ) ; if ( $ title != " " ) { echo " < h1 > " .$ title . " </ h1 > " ; } else { ? > < h1 ><? php the_title( ) ; ?></h1 > <? php } ?>
Once that ’s done , you can rewrite the post ’s title by creating a field named custom - title .
Its value will be your custom title for this post .
Code explanation .
When this code loads , it retrieves the meta field named custom - title .
If this meta field exists and is n’t blank , it is displayed as the post ’s title .
Otherwise , the the_title ( ) function is called , and the post ’s regular title is displayed .

6. Add Multiple Sidebars
The problem .
Sidebars are great because they allow you to display a lot of useful info , such as related posts , author info , a blog roll , 125x125 - pixel ad spaces and so on .
But sidebars can quickly become very busy , and readers may be hard - pressed to find what they ’re looking for .
So , what about having different sidebars available and displaying the most appropriate one for the post ?
The solution .
To apply this hack , duplicate your sidebar .
php file and fill it with whatever information you would like to appear .
Save the file as sidebar - whatever .
php .
Once that ’s done , open your single .
php_* file and find the call to the get_sidebar ( ) function :
<?php get_sidebar( ) ; ?>
Replace it with :
<?php $ sidebar = get_post_meta( $ post ->ID , " sidebar " , true ) ; get_sidebar ( $sidebar ) ; ?>
Now when you write a post , create a custom field named sidebar .
Set its value as the name of the sidebar that you want to include .
For example , if its value is right , WordPress will automatically include sidebar - right . php as a sidebar .
If no custom sidebar field is found , WordPress automatically includes the default sidebar .
* The same can be done with page . php .
Code explanation .
This trick is quite simple .
The first thing we did was look for a custom field named sidebar and get its value as a variable .
Then , the variable is used as a parameter for the WordPress function get_sidebar ( ) , which allows us to specify a particular file to use as a sidebar .

7. Display Content Only To Registered Users
The problem .
As you probably know , WordPress lets you decide whether to allow readers to create accounts and sign in to your blog .
If you want to increase your blog ’s registered readers or would just like to reward existing readers , why not keep some content private , just for them ?
The solution .
To achieve this hack , we ’ll use a shortcode .
The first step is to create it .
Open your functions .
php file and paste the following code :
function member_check_shortcode( $atts , $ content = null ) { if ( is_user_logged_in ( ) && !is_null ( $ content ) && !is_feed ( ) ) { return $ content ; } else { return ' Sorry , this part is only available to our members .
Click here to become a member !' ; } add_shortcode ( ' member ' , ' member_check_shortcode ' ) ;
Once that ’s done , you can add the following to your posts to create a section or text ( or any other content ) that will be displayed only to registered users :
[ member ]
This text will be displayed only to registered users .
[ / member ]
That ’s it .
Registered users will see the text contained in the shortcode , while unregistered users will see a message asking them to register .
Code explanation .
The first thing we ’ve done is create a function named member_check_shortcode , which checks whether the current user is logged in .
If they are , then the text contained in the [ member ] shortcode is displayed .
Otherwise , the message on line 5 is shown .
If you ’d like to know more about WordPress shortcodes , you should definitely have a look at our Mastering WordPress Shortcodes post .

8. Display Your Most Popular Content In The Sidebar
The problem .
If you want to feature your best content and help readers discover more articles from your blog , you might want to display a list of your most popular posts , based on the number of comments they ’ve received , in your sidebar .
The solution .
This code is really easy to implement .
Just paste it wherever you ’d like your popular posts to appear .
To get more or less than five posts , just change the value of the SQL limit clause on line 3 .
<h2 > Popular Posts </ h2 > < ul > <? php $ result = $ wpdb->get_results ( " SELECT comment_count , ID , post_title FROM $ wpdb->posts ORDER BY comment_count DESC LIMIT 0 , 5 " ) ; foreach ( $ result as $ post ) { setup_postdata ( $ post ) ; $ postid = $ post -> ID ; $ title = $ post -> post_title ; $ commentcount = $ post->comment_count ; if ( $ commentcount !=
0 ) { ? > < li >< a href= " <? php echo get_permalink ( $ postid ) ; ? > " title= " <? php echo $ title ? > " >
<? php echo $ title ?></a> {<? php echo $ commentcount ?>}</li > <? php } } ? > </ul >
Code explanation .
In this code , we use the $ wpdb object to send a custom SQL query to the WordPress database .
Then we verify that the results are n’t empty ( i.e. that no posts are without comments ) , and finally we display the list of posts .

9. Create A Drop - Down Menu For Easy Tag Navigation
The problem .
Tags are cool because they allow you to categorize content using precise terms .
But displaying tag clouds is a problem : they are ugly , not easy to use and can be extremely big .
So , what ’s the solution ?
Simply create a drop - down menu for your tags .
That way , they do n’t get in the way , but people still have easy access to them .
The solution .
To create our drop - down menu of tags , we first have to paste the two functions below into the functions .
php file of our WordPress theme :
<?php function dropdown_tag_cloud ( $ args = ’ ) { $ defaults = array ( ' smallest ' => 8 , ' largest ' => 22 , ' unit ' => ' pt ' , ' number ' => 45 , ' format ' => ' flat ' , ' orderby ' => ' name ' , ' order ' => ' ASC ' , ' exclude ' => ’ , ' include ' => ’ ) ; $ args = wp_parse_args ( $args , $ defaults ) ; $ tags = get_tags ( array_merge ( $args , array ( ' orderby ' => ' count ' , ' order ' => ' DESC ' ) ) ) ; //
Always query top tags if ( empty ( $ tags ) ) return ; $ return = dropdown_generate_tag_cloud ( $ tags , $ args ) ; //
Here 's where those top tags get sorted according to $args if ( is_wp_error ( $ return ) ) return false ; else echo apply_filters ( ' dropdown_tag_cloud ' , $ return , $ args ) ; } function dropdown_generate_tag_cloud ( $ tags , $ args = ’ ) { global $ wp_rewrite ; $ defaults = array ( ' smallest ' => 8 , ' largest ' => 22 , ' unit ' => ' pt ' , ' number ' => 45 , ' format ' => ' flat ' , ' orderby ' => ' name ' , ' order ' => ' ASC ' ) ; $ args = wp_parse_args ( $args , $ defaults ) ; extract ( $args ) ; if ( ! $tags ) return ; $ counts = $ tag_links = array ( ) ; foreach ( ( array ) $ tags as $ tag ) { $ counts [ $tag - > name ] = $ tag -> count ; $ tag_links [ $tag -> name ] = get_tag_link ( $ tag-> term_id ) ; if ( is_wp_error ( $ tag_links [ $tag -> name ] ) ) return $ tag_links [ $tag -> name ] ; $ tag_ids [ $tag - > name ] = $ tag -> term_id ; } $ min_count = min( $ counts ) ; $ spread = max ( $ counts ) - $ min_count ; if ( $ spread <= 0 ) $ spread = 1 ; $ font_spread = $ largest - $ smallest ; if ( $ font_spread <= 0 ) $ font_spread = 1 ; $ font_step = $ font_spread / $ spread ; // SQL cannot save you ; this is a second ( potentially different ) sort on a subset of data . if ( ' name ' == $ orderby ) uksort ( $ counts , ' strnatcasecmp ' ) ; else asort ( $ counts ) ; if ( ' DESC ' == $ order ) $ counts = array_reverse ( $ counts , true ) ; $ a = array ( ) ; $ rel = ( is_object ( $ wp_rewrite ) && $ wp_rewrite->using_permalinks ( ) ) ? ' rel= " tag " ' : ’; foreach ( $ counts as $ tag => $ count ) { $ tag_id = $ tag_ids [ $tag ] ; $ tag_link = clean_url ( $tag_links [ $tag ] ) ; $ tag = str_replace ( ' ' , ' ' , wp_specialchars ( $ tag ) ) ; $ a [ ] = " t < option value= ' $ tag_link ' > $tag ( $ count ) < / option > " ; } switch ( $ format ) : case ' array ' : $ return =& $ a ; break ; case ' list ' : $ return = " < ul class= ' wp - tag - cloud ' > nt < li > " ; $ return .= join ( " < / li>nt < li > " , $ a ) ; $ return .= " </ li>n</ul>n " ; break ; default : $ return = join ( " n " , $ a ) ; break ; endswitch ; return apply_filters ( ' dropdown_generate_tag_cloud ' , $ return , $ tags , $ args ) ; } ?>
Once you ’ve pasted this function in your functions .
php file , you can use it to create your drop - down menu of tags .
Just open the file where you want the list to be displayed and paste the following code :
< select name= " tag - dropdown " onchange= " document.location.href=this.options[this.selectedIndex].value ; " > < option value= " # " >
Liste d'auteurs </ option > <?php dropdown_tag_cloud('number=0&order=asc ' ) ; ?> </ select >
Code explanation .
To achieve this hack , we take the wp_tag_cloud ( )
WordPress function and rewrite it to make it display tags in an HTML “ Select ” element .
Then , we just call the newly created dropdown_tag_cloud ( ) in our theme to display the drop - down menu items .

10 . Auto - Resize Images Using TimThumb And WordPress Shortcodes
The problem .
A good blog post needs images , whether screenshots or simple eye - candy .
Readers always prefer articles with nice pictures to plain boring text .
But images can be a pain to deal with , especially because of their various sizes .
So how about we create a WordPress shortcode that uses Timthumb to automatically resize images ?
The solution .
The first thing to do is create the shortcode .
Paste the following code in your functions .
php file :
function imageresizer ( $ atts , $ content = null ) { return ' < img src= " https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10//timthumb/timthumb.php?src='.$content.'&w=590 " alt= " " />' ; } add_shortcode ( 'img ' , ' imageresizer ' ) ;
Now , you can use the following syntax to add an automatically resized image to your blog post :
[ img ]
http://www.yoursite.com/yourimage.jpg[/img]
Code explanation .
You have probably already noticed how cool WordPress shortcodes are and how they make your blogging life easier .
This code simply creates a shortcode that takes a single parameter : the image ’s URL .
Please notice that it ’s not a good idea to resize large images this way as it unnecessarily increases the server load – in such cases it ’s better to create and upload smaller images instead .
TimThumb resizes the image to 590 pixels wide , as specified on line 2 ( w=590 ) .
Of course , you can change this value or add a height parameter ( e.g. h=60 ) .

Astronauts captured this view from the International Space Station .
Scientists are debating whether the break in the cloud layer above the volcano is related to the eruption or simply the result of the normal way that ocean air dries as it moves over an island .

John Kerry and Lindsey Graham offer bi-partisan proposal on climate legislation
Democrat John Kerry and Republican Lindsey Graham do n’t agree on much .
The above photo from FOX News Sunday shows the two Senators sparring in the fall of 2008 .
The two Senators , however , have teamed up to write a compelling Op - Ed in today ’s New York Times in which they argue for a bi-partisan approach to addressing climate change legislation .
This is a must - read for anyone who cares about this issue , and it could offer some real momentum for an issue that many believe will be stalled in the Senate .
If Lindsey Graham is on board , one would think that he could bring along more Republicans .
One reason Graham is on board , and there ’s hope to bring along more Republicans , is the emphasis on using nuclear power as one of the options .
The left needs to become pragmatic over nuclear power , and realize that it offers the key to obtaining broad support .
Kerry and Graham also signal that a compromise is needed on domestic drilling .
The clean energy revolution will not happen over - night , and if we need to rely in the short term on some fossil fuels , it ’s better for the U.S. economy to use more domestic oil .
We certainly should n’t subsidize it , but in the context of a carbon tax or cap - and - trade , permitting more domestic production makes tons of sense , particularly given the current economic crisis .
Hopefully , this can be the starting point for a grand bargain on energy .
Building a Random Number Generating Geiger Counter
After a customer suggested that we carry Geiger - Muller tubes for detecting ionizing radiation , I looked into the possibility of building a Geiger counter .
Little did I know , this project would turn into so much more .
A Geiger tube is far from your basic digital sensor .
Most Geiger tubes need 100s of volts to create enough of a potential to detect an ionizing event within the Geiger tube .
Once a gamma ray , alpha , or beta particle hits one of the atoms of gas inside the tube , an electron is knocked off and the atom has been ionized .
Since the gas is under a large potential ( 100s of volts ) , the electron cascades rather quickly through the rest of the atoms in the gas .
Once this happens , an avalanche of electrons is created and a pulse of current is formed on the output of the Geiger tube along with each event .
Designing the high voltage power source and a simple digital output would be fun in itself , but I thought that a random number generator would make more use out of the random events the Geiger counter would detect .
What is the point of making a random number ?
Computer encrytption is based on random number generation .
Simulating complex behaviors requires a uniform distribution of numbers .
For instance , chaotic systems like a flag waving in the wind or instabilities in fluids use random numbers to help better measure dynamical properties .
Monte Carlo simulations use random numbers to approximate physical constants like Pi ( which we will get to ) or the acceleration of the universe .
And even music and art have components of randomness that give each piece it 's own uniqueness .
This project is broken up into three sections : a high voltage power supply , digital output , and random number generator .
The sections will incorporate high voltage analog electronics , digital electronics , statistics , and a radioactive test source .
High Voltage Power Supply
There are many ways to turn a low voltage into a very high voltage .
An oscillator attached to a simple voltage multiplier would do the trick , as this is a common approach .
A quick search on the web ... Wow !
There are many really good resources online as to how to build high voltage sources for Geiger Tubes .
Techlib has a great site and provided some great example circuit diagrams .
Safety Note : Before jumping head first into high voltage power supplies , check out this safety information .
The Geiger tube I am using is an end window alpha - beta - gamma detector from LND Inc. ( COM - 08875 ) and recommends 500V across the anode and cathode .
Here are the two main parts of the high voltage supply ; the oscillator and the voltage multiplier .
Here is my schematic :
And here is what it looks like assembled on my breadboard .
( Hmm , now which wires should I not touch ? !)
It is really cool that with just a handful of components , you can generate such a high voltage .
Imagine if I just made some small changes and threw a few more caps and diodes onto the voltage multiplier , I could make myself a Tesla Coil !
Kinda creepy .
After assembling the components together I double checked all of my connections and probed for shorts ( this breadboard has survived me since junior year in college and I could swear some of the conductive lines are damaged . )
Everything looks good .
We are dealing with a high voltage , but a rather small current ( micro amps ) , which is one reason why the power loaded on the caps really is n't much to worry about .
Remember , static electricity contains 1000s of volts , but a tiny amount of current !
When measuring this low of an output current , a regular multimeter might load the output enough to really drop the voltage , therefore I added a series 10 M Ohm resistor in line with my multimeter .
Assuming my multimeter has a DC resistance of 10 MOhm , I basically just constructed a voltage divider .
Whatever I see on the multimeter , I can assume that I am reading close to double the unloaded voltage output of the supply .
Here is what I got :
Pretty close to half of 500V !
I can assume my supply is outputting around 500V give or take 50 or so volts , which is within spec of the Geiger tube .
Another Safety Note : After building the completed Geiger counter , I was getting zapped when I would turn the device off .
The zap was n't much really , I would rate it a little more powerful than a good static shock , although it was considerable enough that I felt a short surge of heat .
What was happening was that the big 0.01 uF caps were holding charge and floating waiting to stop my heart .
To prevent this , when I switched off the Geiger counter , I connected the high voltage line to a 100k Ohm bleed resistor to ground .
This allowed the remaining current to dissipate through the resistor instead of me .
Now it is time for me to test the Geiger tube .
I used the manufacturers suggested schematic , which was simply a series 1MOhm and 10 Mohm resistor divided by a 50 pF cap for the output .
I attached the output to the o-scope and saw these noisy blips every few seconds .
Looks kind of odd , but the infrequent behavior of these blips and the amount ( about 20 counts per minute ) seemed reasonable for background radiation levels .
Background radiation is due to radioactive sources that are all around us , close and far .
It is found inside our bodies , in lima beans and beer ( mmm radiation ) , in wood , in anything that is a living organism , in the earth 's crust , in our atmosphere , all over outer space , and of course from human technology .
Here are some fun facts : 1 gram of lima beans have about 4.6 pCi of Potassium - 40 , which comes out to about 1 decay ( 1 particle ) every 5 - 6 seconds of a beta particle .
Beta particles are actually used to treat certain types of cancer and can , coincidentally create cancer or mutations in healthy tissue , but there is really no reason to be afraid of a bowl of lima beans .
One main reason : probability .
First , there is a chance the particle could interact with something before it hits you ( not so much the case with gamma rays ) .
The intensity decreases as one over the distance squared ( 1/r2 ) and the chances of one particle being emitted directly at you is very low ; it could be emitted in the opposite direction of you .
If the beta particle happens to hit you , there is even less of a chance that the particle will happen to hit the part of your DNA that will harm you .
One of the reasons radioactive sources like x-rays could give you cancer is that there are so many particles hitting you , there is a greater chance of one striking your DNA .
And finally our body already contains about 100,000 pCi of Potassium - 40 !
To be sure I was actually seeing background radiation in the form of gamma , alpha , or beta particles .
I would need to have a piece radioactive material .
The most common alpha emitter is Americium , found in common ionizing smoke detectors .
I decided to get one and crack it open to get the Americium pellet , since it was the fastest and cheapest way to get my hands on radioactive material .
However , we have heard that this might be a bad idea and could infringe on some federal regulations , so we do n't suggest doing this , there are other radioactive sources that can be purchased .
In addition , if the dust or particles from Americium were ingested from handling you would have extra radiation implanted in your body .
Not good .
Anyway , here is what it looks like :
When I held this little thing in front of the Geiger Counter I saw this on the o-scope :
Then I noticed my hand glowing and feelings of nausea .
Not really .
Just making sure you were paying attention .
That readout convinced me the Geiger Counter was actually working to some extent !
The next step was to turn the signals into a usable digital waveform .
Digital Output
In order to resolve the small pulses of current from the Geiger tube , the first thing I tried was a simple resistor - transistor logic circuit .
If there is a small current entering the base of the transistor , the collector will be amplified , thus forward biasing the emitter base junction .
Connecting the collector in series with a resistor and 5V power source and the emitter to ground , the output line will be at 5 V until a pulse from the Geiger tube is present on the base of the transistor , then the line will be pulled to a noisy low state .
To clean the output in its low state , I basically formed a low pass filter with a capacitor in parallel to the collector resistor .
After trying a couple of capacitor values , I got a nice quick charge curve on the rising edge of the pulse .
This is what I saw .
Much better !
Looks pretty good .
Next step was to hook up an LED to the output as shown in the above schematic , ( sorry no classic buzzer , buzzers annoy me and people around me ) .
Sure enough , the LED stays off until a pulse comes along and pulls the LED to GND , thus lighting the LED .
Next , I hooked the output up to an IO pin on my ATMega168 .
The edges were clean enough to register an event on the input pin .
My next move was to design a compact unit that will take the pulses and output a random number over USB .
Below is a picture of my prototype , here is the one we currently sell .
Random Number Generator
Now that I have random bits that can be seen by my micro , I can now create an algorithm that will give me a random number .
According to Jon von Neumann , “ Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is , of course , in a state of sin . ”
Since I am already starting out with a truly random source , I want to make very basic assumptions about how to create random numbers .
Let me comment on the difference between truly random sources and pseudorandom sources .
Computers programs will generate pseudo random numbers using mathematical formulae ( unless the random number generation is based on quantum mechanical effects , like shot noise ) .
They are , therefore very fast at doing so , but unfortunately more deterministic than a truly random source .
A true random event is something like a coin flip , a lightening strike , noise in our atmosphere , or background radiation .
True random number generation does generally have a downside .
It can take a long time to get many random numbers , since events can be sparse .
A truely random event alone does n't have any random information .
What is random is the time between events .
All I need to do is measure the time between event 1 and event 2 , then measure the time between event 2 and event 3 and so on .
If the time between events 1 and 2 is less than 2 and 3 , output a 0 .
If the time between events 1 and 2 is greater than 2 and 3 , output a 1 .
T1 < T2 output 0
T2 > T3 output 1
I now have a random bit generator .
The first event I disregard , since I do n't want to start comparing times until at least two events happen .
Then , after an arbitrary amount of events , I can look at the bits accumulated .
With 8 bits , which takes less than 30 seconds to obtain , there are 256 possible numbers that could occur .
If I let the bits accumulate over time , I can create huge random values .
How random are the numbers ?
There is a really nice pseudorandom number test program called ENT you can download .
With this tester , I can measure the entropy in my bit stream , Chi squared distribution , Monte Carlo simulated value for pi , and the arithmetic mean ( 50/50 distribution ) .
Here is my C code for an ATMega168 , it 's not perfect and results in a slightly non-random output .
I probably could of used the hardware timer on the ATMega to improve the randomness , but there is another element that takes some of the randomness out of detecting truly random background radiation ; the Geiger tube .
The tube has a specification called the minimum dead time .
When an event occurs in the Geiger tube , it takes a certain amount of time ( ~90 microseconds with this tube ) for the particle to create the current pulse and for the gas to quench itself after the ionizing event .
During this time , another event can not be detected .
Although , we might miss very few events compared to how many collected , this inherent artifact in the tube does have an affect on the randomness .
Send us your results , let us know if you create any code that improves the randomness .
Cheers !

Dude .
IT IS normally hard to get excited about encyclopaedias .
Indeed , in the internet age , it is quite hard to sell them at all .
But in Macedonia , a new national encyclopaedia has sparked a row worthy of the 19th century , with furious denunciations , forced resignations , hurried political intervention and appeals to outsiders to join in the condemnation of insulting entries .
The row underlines Macedonia 's still - fragile national identity .
Here is a non-exclusive list of possible views .
One is that Macedonia does not exist at all .
It is simply a bit of Bulgaria , amputated by the rise of post - war Yugoslavia and then hijacked by self - interested local politicians ( some Romanian nationalists see Moldova the same way ) .
Those who think they are Macedonians are “ ethno- politically disorientated ” Bulgarians .
AFP
A Macedonia by any other name ?
From another point of view , the country 's existence is not in doubt , but the name is an insult to Greece .
Hardline Hellenes think that the “ Skopjans ” are cheeky Slavs trying to hijack the name of Macedonia , which was , is and will always be an inalienable part of Greece .
Another view comes from Albania , Macedonia 's western neighbour .
From an Albanian nationalist point of view , Macedonia is not a state , but a compromise , and perhaps only a temporary one .
A much - abused ethnic Albanian minority has finally managed , partly by force of arms and partly thanks to international pressure , to gain some constitutional rights , which must be defended vigilantly .
But what about the majority ethnic grouping in this country of 2 m people ?
That is where the encyclopaedia comes in .
Published by the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts , it trod hard on some sensitive toes .
For a start , it asserted that the Albanians were relative newcomers to the territory , settling it only in the 16th century .
From an Albanian point of view , that is exactly the wrong way round : it was the Slavs who are the newcomers , and who should behave themselves in the company of their hosts .
Worse , the encyclopaedia also referred to the Albanians as “ highlanders ” .
That , apparently , is an insult .
Another entry describes Ali Ahmeti , the leader of the ethnic Albanian insurgency in 2001 , as a war - crimes suspect .
Many may query the methods he and his fighters used , but he has never been indicted , and he now heads the junior party in the country 's coalition government .
Amid student demonstrations and other protests , Albania 's prime minister , Sali Berisha , called the book “ absurd and unacceptable ” and complained about “ identity based on the forgery of history . ”
The encyclopaedia is now being hastily rewritten .
But it would be nice to think that some of the energy on display could be directed toward bigger issues .
One is sorting out the name dispute with Greece .
The new centre - left government in Athens may soften the Greek insistence that its northern neighbour drop “ Macedonia ” before joining international organisations .
Macedonia could clear up a couple of troubling human - rights cases , such as that of Spaska Mitrova , a young mother who has lost custody of her two - year - old daughter , in a dispute with strong political overtones ( she identifies herself as Bulgarian , and says Macedonians have ill - treated her in retaliation ) .
From the Albanian side , Mr Berisha could be more careful in describing all of his compatriots as members of “ one nation ” .
Silly rows about encyclopaedia entries are not just distracting .
They also damage outside perceptions of the region and thus its chances of integration into the rest of Europe .
The sensible response to a bad book is to yawn , or to produce a competitor .
And by complaining so loudly , critics have given the encyclopaedia publicity that most booksellers could only dream of .

Hundreds of outraged residents turned out for a vigil last week for Kiwane Carrington , an unarmed Black teenager who was killed by police , reports Brian Dolinar .
CHAMPAIGN , ILL. , police say it will take a month for an investigation into the " officer - involved shooting " of Kiwane Carrington , an unarmed 15 - year - old African American youth .
There has been an outpouring of support for young Kiwane from friends and family who knew him .
The community anxiously awaits an answer to what happened that rainy afternoon .
On Friday , October 9 , Champaign police responded to a reported burglary at 906 W. Vine St. The first to arrive on the scene was Champaign Police Chief R.T. Finney , who confronted two 15 - year - olds in the backyard .
Classes in the Regional Educational Alternative for Developing Youth program that Kiwane attended were cancelled that day for teacher instruction .
Kiwane , whose mother passed away last year from pancreatic cancer , was staying at his aunt 's home .
He had eaten breakfast there that morning .
When he arrived home in the afternoon , the house was locked , and he had forgotten his key .
It was raining outside , and the two were looking for shelter .
Hundreds of people attended a vigil for Kiwane Carrington on October 14
When Chief Finney arrived at approximately 1:20 p.m. , he knew only that a neighbor had reported a burglary .
Soon after , a witness reportedly heard police yelling out , " Get on the ground .
Get on the ground . "
It had been raining for two days , and the ground was wet and muddy .
When one of the young men tried to walk away , Finney grabbed him and a struggle ensued .
Another officer appeared on the scene -- Daniel Norbits , a 14 - year veteran of the force .
Although neither of two boys had a weapon , Norbits apparently drew his gun , and , according to a press statement released by Champaign police , it " discharged , resulting in the fatal wounding of one of the subjects . "
An autopsy showed that the bullet went through Kiwane 's left elbow and passed through his heart .
The News - Gazette reported that Norbits had previously been involved in the case of Greg Brown , a developmentally disabled man who died of a heart attack after he was beaten in an alley by Champaign police back in 2000 .
Witnesses said they heard Brown calling out for help that night .
What you can do On Tuesday , October 20 , join supporters of Kiwane Carrington and his family in calling for justice at 7 p.m. at the Champaign City Council .
On October 22 , there will be a rally at the Champaign City Building , in downtown Champaign , as part of the National Day of Protest Against Police Brutality .
Wear black and meet at the Illinois Terminal at 4 p.m. for a march to Champaign police station .
At 5 p.m. , join activists for a speak - out at the Boys and Girls Club to record personal testimonies of police misconduct .
A memorial fund for Kiwane Carrington has been set up at Busey Bank for anyone who would like to contribute .
Donations can be dropped off at any Busey Bank location or you can call 217-365-4544 .
For video and audio of the press conference at the IMC , as well as up - to - date information , go to ucimc.org .
Virtually no other information has been provided by the Champaign police about Kiwane 's death ; they claim they do n't want to impede the investigation being headed by the Illinois State Police .
Yet Chief Finney was on the scene and saw everything that happened .
Did Norbits follow policy as practiced by the Champaign Police Department ?
Is it police policy to pull guns on youth ?
Or is this just the way that Champaign police treat Black youth ?
Chief Finney must reveal the truth of what occurred that day .
To remain silent only fuels suspicion .
For Kiwane 's family , it adds insult to injury .
Champaign - Urbana Citizens for Peace and Justice ( CUCPJ ) held a press conference on October 12 at the Independent Media Center .
Present were Kenesha Williams , the legal guardian and older sister of Kiwane ; Christine Williams , his grandmother ; Rhonda , his aunt ; Deborah Thomas , owner of the house where the incident occurred ; Laura Manning , mother of the other youth involved ; Aaron Ammons , co-founder of CUCPJ ; Terry Townsend , longtime community activist ; Seon Williams , owner of The Whip barbershop ; and Dr. Evelyn Underwood , president of the Ministerial Alliance .
Behind them was a line of Kiwane 's friends holding signs that read , " We want answers . "
One of the young people stepped up to address the cameras :
All the police are real slick with their badges .
You see this on cameras , but you do n't see what we see every day .
You do n't see how they come harass us every day on the block .
It 's to the point that I get harassed by my first name .
I come outside , they follow me to the gas station .
That 's not cool for anybody to live their life .
Every boy behind me has been harassed by " Champaign 's finest . "
THE STORY of Kiwane 's death at the Urbana - Champaign Independent Media Center was receiving 1,000 hits per day after the incident .
Some of those who knew him left messages .
One of them wrote , " God bless you Kiwane and your mother .
May both of you rest in peace together . "
On Wednesday , October 14 , a vigil was held at the house where the shooting occurred .
Several hundred youth , neighborhood residents and community members came to pay their respects to Kiwane 's memory .
After the vigil , the crowd marched up Prospect Avenue , with many of the youth spilling into the street .
Champaign County sheriff 's deputies were there to direct traffic ( Champaign police were nowhere to be seen ) .
The crowd was managed by several members of the Nation of Islam , who had come from Chicago and throughout the region to serve as security for the event .
Many people filled the congregation hall at New Hope Church of God to hear state senator and vice president of Operation Push , Rev. James Meeks , give a rousing speech .
Meeks lamented the death of young Kiwane .
" This is what it sounds like , " he preached , " when blood cries . "
He insisted that the community seek answers : " Put the police department on notice that we are n't going to accept open season on Negro people . "
Meeks called for an independent police review board , which Urbana has established , but Champaign has refused to accept .
" The worst thing in the world , " Meeks said , " is to have the police police the police . "
He also demanded more Black officers be hired for the police force .
The other 15 - year - old involved in the incident has been released from juvenile detention .
Although a charge of burglary has been dropped , State 's Attorney Julia Rietz has decided to prosecute him for aggravated resisting a police officer -- a felony that carries a possible three - year sentence .
His next court date is November 12 .
The planet Kalgash is on the brink of chaos - but only a handful of people realize it .
Kalgash knows only the perpetual light of day ; for more than two millennia , some combination of its six sons has lit up the sky .
But twilight is now gathering .
Soon the suns will set all at once - and the terrifying splendor of Nightfall will call forth a madness that signals the end of civilization .
Can the believers of legend pull their planet through the crisis ?

ITALY'S AMAZING AMATEUR SPACE WATCHERS
By J. D. Ratcliff
With homemade electronic equipment , two young Italians are keeping tabs on Russian satellites and making some startling discoveries
here is an eerie possibility that a long - dead Russian astronaut is today hurtling silently through space at thousands of miles an hour - the victim of a Soviet space shot that went wrong .
His body perfectly preserved by intense cold , he may be a lonely wanderer in space for centuries to come .
Evidence that such a macabre voyager may exist comes from an exciting new band of hobbyists : amateur space watchers .
Like the early ham - radio operators , these talented enthusiasts build their own equipment , often creating for a few hundred dollars - out of such cast - off junk as chicken wire , used pipe , second hand radios - instruments that would cost a government hundreds of thousands .
Their eavesdropping on astronauts and their satellite - tracking achievements are impressive even to professionals .
Of the many amateur tracking stations now scattered over the earth , one of the most striking and complete is located in the peaceful little village of San Maurizio Canavese , 12 miles outside Turin , Italy .
Although much of the equipment is either homemade or dates back to World War II , it looks thoroughly efficient .
Inexpensive kitchen clocks on the wall give Greenwich Mean Time , local time in Moscow , Cape Kennedy and Turin .
Operators wear white lab coats .
The tracking console faithfully copies the one at Cape Kennedy - ingeniously modeled after photographs and scaled down to one fifth size .
The builders of this remarkable station are two brothers , Achille and Gian Battista Judica - Cordiglia .
They got interested in radio as a hobby in 1949 while living at Erba , near Lake Como .
Achille was 16 , Gian only 10 .
When they tried to wheedle funds from their physician father to build a shortwave station , he reacted as most fathers would - " Do n't waste time when you should be studying . "
They had better luck with their mother .
The U. S. military was then selling off surplus radio equipment at the knockdown price of five cents a pound .
The boys bought 300 pounds .
After rebuilding it to their own needs , they were soon conversing in code with newfound friends the world over .
In 1959 the family moved to Turin .
Satellite launchings had begun , and the boys were fascinated .
" There was a new world out there , " says Gian , " and we wanted to be a part of it . "
They decided to concentrate on Soviet rather than U. S. space efforts , because Russia was closer , and because the Russians were secretive , never publicizing shots in full technical detail as the United States does .
They installed crude listening equipment in an old World War II German bunker , and shivered through the winter of 1960 - 61 while they perfected their apparatus .
Achille spared all the time he could from medical school ; Gian signed up for a correspondence course in engineering , so he could study at the station with his headphones on .
Better quarters came the next year when their father took over a convalescent home in a rambling 16th - century villa at San Maurizio Canavese .
Now the boys christened their station Torre Bert ( Torre for tower , Bert for Villa Bertalazona , the original name of the convalescent home ) .
They already had a number of striking achievements to their credit .
They could listen to conversations between astronauts and ground stations for a few fleeting seconds as the space vehicles passed over Turin .
But they wanted to listen longer and to be able to track satellites .
This meant they must have a " movable dish " antenna , which could follow objects across the sky and scoop up even the faintest electronic signals from space .
Governments spend millions for such things installed in elaborate layouts - Britain spent $ 4,500,000 at Jodrell Bank , the U. S. Air Force 15 million at Tyngsboro , Mass .
A Turin contractor offered to build a dish antenna for $ 3200 .
The boys checked their Torre Bert bank balance - $ 30 .
The only solution , of course , was one they had become accustomed to : build their own .
From junkyards they came back with pipe for the antenna framework , an auto steering wheel that could be used to turn it , and truck bearings to carry the ton - and - a - half contrivance .
With extraordinary ingenuity they built other equipment : a 4 - by - 12 foot screen that would light up to show the position of a satellite at any given moment ; a second screen to follow moon shots ; a listening console with three secondhand recorders to tape messages from satellites .
In sum , it was a remarkably faithful model of the tracking control room at Cape Kennedy , the far off wonderland of their dreams .
Lacking a library or funds to buy technical journals , the young space watchers had to invent much equipment already in existence , but about which they knew nothing .
One example was a filtering device to screen out unwanted noises coming in from space .
They also developed methods of determining whether a signal came from the ground or from a moving vehicle .
But one of their biggest achievements , which required superb detective work , was determining the frequencies of Russian tracking stations .
At present they know the frequencies of six of them and can tune in at will .
As their station grew in complexity , it became clear to Gian and Achille that help would be needed for its operation .
Fifteen space enthusiasts , mostly in their early 20's , were recruited .
The boys ' sister , Maria Theresa , a pert and pretty teen - ager , got one of the most difficult assignments .
She was to learn Russian so she could translate messages from manned Soviet flights .
She is now fluent in the language .
Next , the boys wanted to organize electronic coverage of the entire earth .
Gian 's fiancée , Laura Furbatto , was given the job of enlisting other amateur space watchers scattered around the world - from Tahiti in the Pacific , to Angola in Africa , to Argentina in South America .
Thus the 17 - station Zeus amateur network was born , hooked together by shortwave radio .
Now , when the operators of the little Italian station discover that the Russians are going through a pre - launch rehearsal , they alert the other Zeus stations so that they can be ready to start tracking when the time comes .
Normally on a 12 - hour schedule , Torre Bert goes on 24 - hour alert when Soviet ground stations become active .
Every team member has his assigned post : two men monitor voices and signals and make tape recordings ; two work the dish antenna ; and one of the most talented members of the team , a math wizard , operates a hand - cranked calculating machine to figure speed and orbital path .
( Professionals use electronic computers . )
The team 's accuracy is such that they were able to predict , 12 hours in advance , that Russia 's Lunik IV would miss the moon by 5000 miles .
The actual miss : 5281 miles .
Most man - carrying satellites circle the earth in 90 to 120 minutes .
By the time the second orbit begins , the busy little station has already calculated its basic tracking information , and the screen on the wall lights up , showing minute to minute location .
In its short span of life , Torre Bert has plucked some remarkable messages from space .
On November 28 , 1960 , for example , there was the cryptic message : " SOS to the entire world . "
It came from a moving space vehicle and was repeated three times .
Amateurs in Texas and Germany picked up the same message .
Three days later Russia admitted a launch which had ended in failure - but did not mention a man aboard .
On May 17 , 1961 , the voices of two men and a woman were heard in desperate conversation - " Conditions growing worse why do n't you answer ?
... we are going slower ... the world will never know about us . . . ”
Then silence .
The same words were picked up in Alaska and Sweden .
Their meaning ?
No one will know until the Russians choose to talk .
Perhaps the most moving message of all was a wordless one made early in February 1961 .
Tapes , which I myself heard at Torre Bert , recorded the racing beat of an over - exerted heart ( the hearts of all astronauts are monitored automatically ) and sounds of labored breathing .
The Judica - Cordiglia brothers took the tapes to famed heart surgeon Dr. A. M. Dogliotti .
His verdict : " This is the heart of a dying man . "
The brothers are firmly convinced that the Russians have spent freely of human life to achieve their space successes .
Accumulated evidence indicates that there may have been at least ten deaths .
The young men of Turin spent a long time admiring the U.S. space program from a distance before they finally got an opportunity to see it last year .
Italian TV put on a space - quiz program with a $ 3000 prize .
The Judica - Cordiglia brothers won in a walk and promptly bought plane tickets for America .
Visiting space centers in Alabama , Florida , Maryland and Texas , they deeply impressed American space scientists .
" They have done a remarkable job , " says Harry J. Goett , director of the Goddard Space Flight Center .
At Cape Kennedy the brothers played tapes they had made of John Glenn 's conversations with the ground .
Professional spacemen were mystified .
The United States never announces radio frequencies until after a flight for fear of causing traffic congestion on the particular wavelength .
How had the boys determined this one ?
Easy , the Judica - Cordiglias said ; they had seen a pre - flight picture of the Glenn capsule and had figured the frequency from the size of the capsule 's antenna !
The future ?
The busy little tracking station will be only a hobby for Achille , who now has his medical degree and hopes to specialize in space medicine .
But for Gian , a hobby has become a career .
" The further you go with this , the stronger is the urge to continue , " he says .
He hopes for a job offer from the United States .
Meanwhile , he and his fellow space watchers around the globe are keeping their eyes on the sky and providing the scientific world with its most striking example of amateur ingenuity .

Aaron interviewed Elizabeth Warren on TechTicker yesterday .
As usual , she was n't afraid to speak her mind .
Aaron Task , TechTicker : Elizabeth Warren , chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel , is the rare public official who does n't mince words .
But Warren admits to being " speechless " at reports of record bonuses on Wall Street .
" I do not understand how financial institutions could think they could take taxpayer money and turn around and act like it 's business as usual , " Warren says .
" I do n't understand how they can't see that the world has changed in a fundamental way - it 's not business as usual .
All I can say right now is they seem to be winning this argument . "
In the accompanying video , taped at The Economist 's Buttonwood Gathering at Pace University , I asked Warren about Treasury Secretary 's claim at the same event that the government has been " remarkably effective " in combating the financial crisis .
" It is not the case people go to bed wondering if there will be an economy in the morning , " she quips , but " we still have lot of serious problems . "
Comparing the situation today vs. a year ago , Warren observes :
Even Too Bigger to Fail : A year ago the big concern was systemic risk and how to deal with ' too big to fail ' firms , she recalls .
Now " the big are bigger , we wiped out a lot of small folks and there 's more concentration " in the banking system .
A year ago the big concern was systemic risk and how to deal with ' too big to fail ' firms , she recalls .
Now " the big are bigger , we wiped out a lot of small folks and there 's more concentration " in the banking system .
Still Toxic : TARP was created explicitly to remove toxic assets from bank balance sheets .
" They 're still there by and large . "
TARP was created explicitly to remove toxic assets from bank balance sheets .
" They 're still there by and large . "
Stress Test Failure : Unemployment has " blown through " the worst - case scenario in the stress test from February , Warren notes .
But " we have n't repeated the stress test , or revealed any more information about what 's going on inside these financial institutions . "
In sum , " all the things going on [ a year ago ] that were serious , serious problems for the financial institutions seem to me are still serious , serious problems , " she says .
Finally , Warren pulls no punches when it comes to her criticism of former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson for his failure to put any restrictions on or monitoring of the initial TARP funds , and for using the money for something other than " toxic asset relief , " as originally intended .
" I have a real problem when we describe to taxpayers their money will be taken and used one way and in fact it 's used another way , " she declares .
So in the end , Warren did find her voice and spoke quite candidly , a very rare trait among public officials .

Making and constructing a silicone doll is the easy part .
The hard part is totally knowing every curve and shape of a woman 's body and shaping the outer core .
I can't teach you all the curves , this is something you will learn as you go .
The best way to learn all the curves and shapes of a woman 's body , is to study pictures and watch hot women in movies .
Order some hot movies from our " toys you can buy " link .
Read all the below information once , so you 'll have a better understanding of the procedures before you start .
Without this knowledge , you will not be able to make a doll ( I will refer to the sex toy information often . )
You will also need to read and understand all the sex toy information ( I will refer to the sex toy information often . )
Also , you can try to make this torso made from a couch cushion Getting started
The core body is made from PVC tubes , which you can find at most hardware stores .
The small T shape PVC is a 4 inch test tee w/o plug .
The 2 even smaller round pieces are 4 inch male adapters that screw into the 4 " test tee .
The large tube is 4 inches x 10 feet , sometimes hardware stores sell this in smaller cut sections for half the price .
Red dots and x's is where to cut the PVC tubes .
Use a circular saw , drill , hack saw , or jig saw .
Measure 17 inches of the 4 " x 10 large tube and cut .
( see picture below ) Screw the 4 " male adapter to the 17 inch piece of the 4 " test tee .
Insert large cut tube into the male adapters .
Cut a hole about the size of your fist on top for the neck and head .
Your fist should easily fit inside the tube .
Cut a hole 4.5 inches wide and 3 " up and down for the vagina .
Cut out the two red lines on the bottom of the body for the legs to be inserted .
After you make these cuts , use a steel file to smooth sharp plastic edges .
TORSO ONLY STEPS . ( If making a torso only without the neck and head , just cut out the hole for the vagina .
Skip the 2 strap hole steps . )
(
If making a torso only with a head , cut hole for neck and add one 2 strap hole Half way down the PVC tube . )
Two hole straps ( hardware stores ) .
The black 2 hole strap shape on the PVC is where to bolt these .
Any time you see this black drawing , attach a two hole strap .
Do not use sharp screws here , you will be reaching inside the PVC tube to attach and stretch bungee cords for the legs , arms and head .
Use a drill to make pilot holes for the two strap holes on the outside of the PVC , then bolt them on the inside .
Now you 're ready to start making the outer core body .
Wrap foam sheet ( sex toy info ) around PVC body , cut and duct - tape .
Duct - tape around the waist tighter and looser as you make your way up and down from the waist .
When using d-tape , cut off 12 inch sections of tape and apply to the doll .
For any extra foam around the arm holes and leg holes , push foam inside and d-tape .
You should use almost 1 roll of duct tape just for the torso alone .
Try not to use too much d-tape on the butt , to keep the butt soft as possible for a realistic feel .
Do not attempt to make the boobs while making the torso -- the boobs will be done later .
In some spots you may need to add more cut foam sheets and d-tape , to get that hour glass shape .
Experiment using different thickness of foam sheets , sometimes thinner foam sheets ( carpet stores ) are easier to make slight changes in the shape , but start off with the thicker foam sheet .
You can also hot glue cut foam pieces to the doll to make slight changes in the doll 's shape .
Do n't be afraid to cut out foam sections and d-tape over again , if it does n't look right to you .
I did this a few times see example below right .
I wanted the lower back smaller so I cut to the PVC and taped again .
To make that long crease in the middle of the back , and the front , I cut out a long line of tape and foam using a razor blade and taped the cuts .
Take your time with the torso , do n't rush it .
To make the butt round and plump looking , I used the sex toy boob procedure .
I glued a few pieces of foam sheet on top the butt and trimmed with scissors .
At the end of this info , I give some measurements for the torso , boobs and waist .
But the size and shape is all up to you .
If you do not know how to measure a women 's body , Google " Body measurements . "
( Making a Torso only doll , do the same as above .
Skip down to making boobs after finished with above steps . )
The legs and arms are made from a lounge chair with locking joints .
Make sure the chair you buy has both head and leg locking joints .
( wal - mart , seasonal )
If making a doll during winter months you may have to look on - line for this chair .
Thrift stores may also have this chair .
Cut fabric off chair , and use a hack saw or a circular saw with a steel blade to cut chair .
The red slashes is where to cut the steel .
When finished , you should have pieces that look like this .
These will be used for the arms and legs .
Pay attention how the leg and arm joints bend , make sure you have the right steel joints for your legs and arms .
The upper parts of the legs and arms may be a little shorter then picture below .
This is ok because you will add a 3/4 " PVC tube to make this part longer ( see below pictures ) .
Another option for legs and arms is a wood handle cut in half attached with corner braces .
Use nuts , bolts and washers .
Make everything tight .
Use the same measurements with the wood as you would with the steel .
I really prefer the steel joints , over time the wood joints can become loose .
Once the cuts are made , slide a 3 / 4 inch PVC tube over upper leg like in picture above .
Drill holes and insert screws to hold PVC to steel leg .
Use a drill bit made for steel .
This 3/4 " tube will also be used on the heads .
Wrap sheet foam around steel leg and d-tape to make the first layer tight .
Try to form somewhat of a leg shape .
Around the knee area , I pulled the tape tighter .
As I taped my way up , I used less pressure on the tape and foam .
Again if you need to add more cut foam pieces , do it and tape again .
The shape of you 're doll and body parts are all up to you .
Glue the 100 % polyester fleece from wal - mart ( sex toy info ) around the ankle and shin .
Use straight silicone , hot glue or an all purpose spray adhesive .
Do n't glue the fleece above the knee yet .
I glued this polyester fleece on most of the doll to help smooth out lumps , bumps and d-tape lines .
( I did not use this fleece around the upper thighs and butt ) .
This fleece will make it easier to skin your doll .
The glue I prefer is straight silicone , but use what you like .
Tie a bungee cord to the two strap hole on the leg .
Your bungee cord should be long enough to reach a 2 strap hole on the upper body with some pressure on the cord .
Your leg should fit snug inside the hip with good natural movement .
You may have to tape more fabric or cut some off , for the hip to fit snug in the hip hole .
Cut foam sheet so it will wrap around the upper leg and go over the front and butt cheek .
( above picture ) .
Straight silicone the foam around the thigh and insert the leg into the hip hole .
Attach leg bungee cord to a 2 strap hole .
D - tape around lower thigh , frontal area , and upper butt like picture below .
Hot glue the foam sheet edges together .
See on the thigh where there is not any d-tape .
You must try not to tape the area around the thigh , so your doll can bend .
Do the other leg just like this one .
Do the other leg just like this one .
Left leg attached , D - taped lower thigh frontal area and upper butt cheek .
ready to attach right leg .
This arm was made similar to the leg .
Attach the 2 hole strap with screws where you see the 2 strap pic .
Roll foam sheet around the steel arm cut and d-tape to make arm shape .
See how the upper part of the arm looks round like a small ball .
You need get this shape for both arms to fit in arm holes snug .
To make this ball shape , use a tennis ball , cut 2 small round holes in the ball , so you can still attach a bungee cord to the 2 strap hole .
D - tape ball around 2 strap hole , leaving a small opening to add a bungee cord .

Straight silicone evenly over the whole arm ( use a craft stick to spread silicone ) and add the white fleece you see .
The fabric at the wrist is panty hose cut from a leg .
Evenly silicone arm again and pull panty hose up the arm .
Make sure the panty hose is glued snug around the arm .
This will make it easer for you to skin and smooth later .
The panty hose also holds everything together and keeps the shape .
Skin the arm using Method # 1 .
Do not skin the wrist just yet , this will be done when you add hands .
Before you skin , read and understand all the " sex toy info . "
If this is your first time skinning something , I recommend practicing on something other then your doll , to really understand how it all works .
Making boobs .
Make your boobs using " sex toy info " .
Other options are hair balls , and nerf balls Insert the pink hair ball in panty hose or a small sock and skin using Method # 1 . Use Method # 2 for the nipple .

Feet .
Make the feet the same way as making boobs in " sex toy info " with the foam sheet .
Glue 2 layers of foam sheet together and trim to shape feet .
Skin the feet using Method # 1 or # 2 and do the toes using # 2 .
When you skin the toes you may need to put dish soap on a craft stick .
Insert the stick between the toes to keep the skin from sticking to other toes .
Toe nails use Method # 5 , # 3 or buy fake nails and straight silicone nails on the toes .
Hands .
Use " sex toy info : mood hand " to make hands when making the hands , make sure you make a small loop and the bottom of the wrist ( see picture ) .
This loop will fit inside the steel wrist and will be held in place with a screw .
Head .

Cut the top and bottom off and slice cylinder from top to bottom .
Roll plastic in a narrow cylinder shape to fit around the neck .
D - tape the neck to keep its shape .
Remove the head and d-tape all around the outside and inside .
Tie a bungee cord to a spring lock ( picture of spring lock above ) and attach the spring lock to a lower 2 strap hole .
Make sure the cord has just enough pressure to hold the head snug in the neck .
The neck will be taped to the body later .
Just use the neck for now to attach the bungee cord .

The Rangers , who have all the leverage , are using it .
Brandon Dubinsky , who has none , is attempting to apply pressure he does n’t appear to have by staying away from training camp
It ’s difficult to envision an end - game to this contractual dispute that will work to the benefit of the 23 - year - old unsigned Group II free agent center , who will miss today ’s second day of camp , and counting .
“ It ’s killing me not to be in camp with my teammates .
I feel terrible about it , ” Dubinsky told The Post by phone from his apartment in the city while the Blueshirts undertook the first series of head coach John Tortorella ’s conditioning tests .
“ I did n’t come to New York three weeks ago to start skating and training in order not to be there , but we have n’t been able to reach a deal .
I do n’t want to comment on the negotiations , but this is all part of the business , and it ’s unfortunate . ”
The Post has learned that the Blueshirts on Friday increased their one - year offer from $ 522,500 to $ 700,000 .
Dubinsky , who earned $ 635,000 last year , including Entry Level bonuses , is seeking approximately twice that amount .
“ I get the team concept , I get the importance of being there with the guys and going through a tough camp with them from the get - go , ” Dubinsky said .
“ It ’s not a question of not wanting to be there .
Everybody knows how much I love New York and playing for the Rangers .
“ I understand what it means to be a team player .
It ’s just going to take some time .
I do n’t have a time frame on this , but I ’m urging my agent [ Kurt Overhardt ] to try and work this out as quickly as possible . ”
Tortorella said on Friday he would not hold a grudge against Dubinsky if he became the first Ranger since Mark Messier in 1994 to miss camp in a contract dispute .
Yesterday , the head coach made it clear he believes Dubinsky is making a bad mistake .
“ It ’s stupid , ” Tortorella said .
“ He ’s a young man who needs to be in camp with his teammates and understand the process of becoming a pro .
I ’m hoping he realizes that .
“ I think his agent is stupid , too . ”
Said Overhardt via text : “ I ’ve been called worse . ”
*
Marian Gaborik did not participate in the on-ice sprints due of a tender groin .
This is not related to previous hip problems .
“ We just want to be careful , ” Tortorella said .
“ We do n’t want to do anything stupid .
We want to get him ready for the regular season . ”
The Post has learned that the agent for Nikolai Zherdev , who rejected the Rangers ’ $ 3.25 million qualifier and then became a free agent when the team walked away from his $ 3.9 million arbitration award , called the club this week offering to return for $ 3.25 million .
The offer was refused .
Widespread reports that the Blueshirts are engaged in active bidding for Boston ’s Phil Kessel are inaccurate .

In yet another effort to fend off boredom , I tried to write a “ hello world ” in assembly , on FreeBSD 7.2/amd64 .
I wanted it to be a native 64 - bit ( more fun that way ) , so the developer ’s handbook was not too helpful .
And since by the logic of the Internet , there ’s someone somewhere right now is looking exactly for this , I thought I ’d share it here .
Aside : The Assembler used here is NASM .
I grew up on 8085 and Z80 , and find myself mentally exchanging the operands while reading gas - syntax assembly listings .
First off , the good old int 80h is not the way to make syscalls on the amd64 .
The SYSCALL instruction ( see the Intel docs ) is used instead .
From the Intel docs , SYSCALL looks to be lighter and faster than an interrupt ( should time it and compare sometime ! ) .
The SYSCALL clobbers RCX though , so libc saves RCX in R10 before the syscall .
That implies that R10 is preserved by the SYSCALL .
All this info was gathered from / usr / src/lib / libc / amd64/SYS.h .
In case you have n’t installed / usr / src , you really should be doing it now .
The arguments passed seems to be in accordance with the ( except - for - Windows - ) standard 64 - bit ABI ( specs here ) , although I could n’t find any documentation about this (! ) .
The register RAX holds the syscall number .
The full list of syscalls can be found at /usr / src/sys / kern/syscalls .
master .
Let ’s see the ones we need to use :
1 AUE_EXIT STD { void sys_exit ( int rval ) ; } exit \ sys_exit_args void 4 AUE_NULL STD { ssize_t write ( int fd , const void * buf , \ size_t nbyte ) ; }
Armed with this info , we can now write our assembler source :
section .data message : db ' hello , world ! ' , 0 section . text global _start _start : mov rax , 4 mov rdi , 1 mov rsi , message mov rdx , 13 syscall mov rax , 1 xor rdi , rdi syscall
The first call sets RAX=4 to invoke write , RDI=1 being the file descriptor of standard output , RSI to the address of the message to write , and RDX=13 bytes to write .
The syscall sets the carry flag on failure , so do a jb to catch errors .
The second call simply exits the process , RAX=1 corresponds to exit and RDI=0 is the exit code .
Assemble with :
~$ nasm -f elf64 - o p.o p.nasm
and then link with :
~$ ld -o p p.o
and have fun with :
~$ ./p hello , world ! ~$ echo $ ?
0
Yeah , that looks good !
Some asides :
_start is understood by ELF .
is understood by ELF .
The executable seems to have acquired a 2 - byte .bss (? ) and a 31 - byte .comment section along the way .
The comment contains " \x00 The Netwide Assembler 2.05.01\x00 " .
Could n’t find any NASM command - line options or directives to turn this off .
Not nice .
.

Strip off the unwanted sections with " strip -R .comment - R .bss . / p " to reduce the executable size .
It is now 536 bytes long .
( If you liked that , you might find this interesting . )
to reduce the executable size .
It is now 536 bytes long .
( If you liked that , you might find this interesting . )
Is it possible to avoid ‘ ld ’ and get NASM to directly generate an executable ELF ?
Heh .
That was fun .
Now let me quickly sneak out , grab lunch , watch a movie and get back to boredom .
The outer wall of the timber factory in the town of Velyky Berezny in western Ukraine has been turned into a shrine , as visitors leave bunches of flowers at the site they consider holy .
With the Industry Committee now scheduled to contact its final clause - by - clause review of Bill C - 27 on Wednesday , sources in the Liberal Party advise that its MPs plan to withdraw several controversial copyright lobby - inspired amendments to the computer program and spyware provisions .
Since first reported on Friday , thousands of emails and letters protesting the proposals have been sent to Industry committee MPs from all parties .
Sources indicate that the Liberals will withdraw three motions actively promoted by the copyright lobby :
a new definition of computer program that would have excluded surreptitiously installed DRM from the ambit of the bill
an exception to a ban on the " collection of personal information through any means of telecommunication , if the collection is made by accessing a computer system or causing a computer system to be accessed without authorization " in cases related to investigations of breach of agreements or laws
an exception for telecom providers to the requirement to obtain express consent before users install programs on their computers
While anything can be happen over the next 24 hours , the decision to withdraw the motions – in combination with the Conservatives reversal on several exceptions that watered down the bill – should mean that the Electronic Commerce Protection
Act is preserved as a consumer protection bill as it gets through committee .
However , the lobbying to water down the bill will no doubt continue as the bill moves to the floor of the House of Commons and then on to the Senate .
The price of gold struck an all - time high Tuesday as the dollar fell on a news report of a plan by Gulf states to stop using the greenback for oil trading .
Gold hit 1,045.00 dollars per ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange in late trades .
Hours earlier on the London Bullion Market , gold surged to 1,043.78 dollars beating the previous record high of 1,032.70 dollars an ounce struck in March , 2008 .

Barclays Capital precious metals analyst Suki Cooper said dollar weakness appeared to be related to reported secret talks about oil being priced in a basket of currencies including gold rather than the dollar ,
This “ has added to concerns about the future role of the dollar in international financial markets , ” Cooper said .
The dollar ’s future as the world ’s top currency was thrown into doubt on Tuesday as a report said Arab states had launched secret moves with China and Russia to stop using the greenback for oil trading .
Arab states have launched steps with China , Russia , Japan and France to stop using the dollar for oil trades , British daily The Independent reported on Tuesday , but the report was denied by Kuwait and Qatar and reportedly by other nations .
The Independent ’s Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk wrote in his paper : “ In the most profound financial change in recent Middle East history , Gulf Arabs are planning — along with China , Russia , Japan and France — to end dollar dealings for oil . ”

They would instead switch “ to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council ( GCC ) , including Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar , ” added Fisk .
Gold , viewed as a safe - haven investment , has won back favour in recent months as the global economy struggles out of its worst slump in decades .
The run-up in gold has been largely driven by weakness in the dollar , which makes dollar - priced commodities cheaper for holders of stronger currencies , boosting demand .
ADVERTISEMENT
Gold also wins support from fears about higher inflation because the metal is widely regarded by investors as a safe store of value .
Precious metals consultancy GFMS last month warned that the current upward trend in gold may not be sustainable should global stimulus packages fail to boost flagging demand in the battered world economy and inflation fall as a result .

The Group of 20 leaders of emerging and developed nations recently agreed at a summit in Pittsburgh not to roll back massive stimulus measures that helped contain a severe global recession .
Bats use echolocation to see in the dark , but unfortunately human scientists cannot do the same .
That poses a problem for ecologists who want to know , for example , how many Brazilian free - tailed bats live in the Carlsbad Caverns of New Mexico .
Researchers can't shine a light on them because that disrupts their behavior , but they can't see them without light .
The answer ?
Infrared cameras , of course .
By installing infrared sensors , life scientist Nickolay Hristov of Winston - Salem State University and Thomas Kunz of Boston University were able to study the bat colonies in great detail from less than 50 feet away .
They discovered that only something like 4 million bats live in the large colonies , an order of magnitude less [ pdf ] than previously estimated by visual inspection methods in the 1950s .
Beyond the science , their work also yielded tremendous video , which was posted at The Scientist .
Embedded above , the team 's infrared camera captured half a million bats emerging from the cave to feed at night .
The next step in this see - in - the - dark science will be taking data with multiple cameras , so that the scientists can triangulate the precise positions of the bats during flight , Hristov said .

Authorities said they received several emergency calls about the man , who witnesses say was standing at the corner of Route 83 and Regan Road at about 11 a.m .
Officers said they pulled out bean bag and taser guns , and the man became polite and cooperative .
The man could n't be reached Monday .
He has no public phone listing , and it's not clear whether he has a lawyer .
A White House panel charged with reviewing NASA 's exploration plans has dropped any hope of sending astronauts directly to Mars and found the space agency 's budget too slim to accomplish its goal of returning humans to the moon by 2020 .
After more than six hours of public deliberation on Wednesday , the 10 - member committee overseeing the Review for U.S. Human Space Flight Plans decided not to include a plan to send astronauts straight to Mars - called Mars Direct - on its list of options to be considered by President Barack Obama because of its daunting challenges and cost .
" We think Mars Direct is a mission that we 're really not prepared to take on technically or financially , and it would likely not succeed , " said the committee 's chairman Norman Augustine , a former Lockheed Martin CEO , late Wednesday after the televised meeting in Washington , D.C. " I really want to emphasize that we 're not giving up on Mars at all . "
A manned Mars mission is the ultimate goal , but shifting all of NASA 's focus on getting there as soon as possible is not feasible , he added .
The committee is expected to present its initial report to NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden and White House science adviser John Holdren on Friday and file a final version for President Obama 's review by the end of the month .
Funding woes
Augustine 's committee is reviewing NASA 's plan to retire its aging space shuttle fleet and replace it with a capsule - based Orion spacecraft as part of a larger effort to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 .
But NASA 's current budget for human spaceflight through 2020 is not enough to cover the costs of achieving its baseline lunar goal , let alone other alternative options , the committee found .
" This budget is just simply not friendly to exploration , " said committee member Sally Ride , a former astronaut and the first American woman in space .
" It 's very difficult to find an exploration scenario that actually fits within this very restrictive budget guidance that we 've been given . "
NASA has a budget of about $ 80 billion for human spaceflight through 2020 , about $ 28 billion less than projected when it first chose the Orion spacecraft and its
Ares rockets to succeed the space shuttle fleet .
Orion spacecraft are not expected to begin operational flights until 2015 , the committee said .
Augustine said that NASA 's exploration budget has been cut repeatedly since announcing the new space exploration plan in 2005 , hindering its progress .
Technical and other delays have also led to the current shortfall , he added .
Still he and his committee were surprised none of their options fit in NASA 's current budget .
' I did think that one of the current options would fit under the present funding budget , " he said .
" I thought it might be quite a while before you really got into space and do those exciting things that we were talking about — I guess I should have realized that it was n't possible . "
Narrowing options
Last week , the committee culled a list of 3,000 options for human spaceflight down to about seven different scenarios .
On Wednesday , committee members refined that list down to four general scenarios that include more funding .
They include building Orion spacecraft for eventual manned mission to the moon , as well as options for sending astronauts farther out into deep space to visit near - Earth asteroids or the stable Lagrange points around Earth by the mid- to late - 2020s or 2030 .
" We very much like the deep space option , " Augustine said , adding that his committee is not endorsing one option over another .
" It 's a doable , viable option . :
Only one of the four scenarios includes NASA 's planned Ares I rocket , the booster designed to launch Orion capsules into space .
Some included extending the International Space Station 's lifetime beyond 2016 to 2020 .
The committee strongly favored encouraging commercial vehicles for launching astronauts into orbit and suggested setting $ 2.5 billion aside between 2011 and 2014 to spur development in those spacecraft .
It also included options that included spacecraft more heavily derived from current space shuttles , as well as current unmanned heavy - lift rockets like the Delta 4 Heavy and variants of NASA 's giant Ares V rocket envisioned to launch lunar landers into orbit .
The potential for in - orbit refueling was cited as a key technological goal for some committee members .
But adequate funding is key if NASA is to tackle an innovative , inspiring program that can capture the attention of the American public , committee members said .
" Our view is that it will be difficult with the current budget to do anything that 's terribly inspiring in the human spaceflight area , " Augustine said .
Casino gaming is one of the oldest gambling entertainment concept .
It has remained so throughout history as the takers have never shrunk for the variety of gambling offered .
With the use of online casinos , however , the casino games broke the boundaries of the casino house and were repeated at the variety of interfaces and locations .
Online Casino is a fully electronic concept with greater affinities with the video game world that has made it an ever - expanding boom of the present .
In fact , the e-transformation of casino games was first tried by video game developers who continue to lodge the growing madness of certain casino games such as fruit machines among children and young people .
Screen - based poker games were among the first to evolve and were made available via broadband .
The video game features have also been suitably conditioned in the form of casino promo codes .
The definitive feature of this was that the player actually had a permanent account on the servers of the game and that he could log in from any location via his Internet - enabled devices , be it the PC , the tablet or the smartphone .
Earlier , the player visited the poker house or casino to play his machine / game of choice .
The players also waited until the machine was replaced by the previous player .
Now it ’s easy for the players , as the portability is the big advantage that comes from the good transition of the casino game .
The response of such games has been perceived as fun-oriented entertainment rather than serious gambling still offered by “ in- house ” casino games .
The other major intervention was that of the casino promo codes , which are similar to the majority of online video games offered .
The only difference is that while the traditional video game codes are supposed to unlock the beloved resources and wealth in the game scene to support and accompany the player , in online casino games these codes are generally offered as real money in pounds or pounds Dollar or how the currency can be .
This real currency can be used to place the bet in casino games just like the real casinos .
The winnings or losses and the won or lost money are adjusted in the account of the player , which is kept on the servers .
There are offers from various online casinos that offer a value that is paid by credit card or purchased through a scratch card , which gives the player more e-value .
This thrills the buyers , who then buy more and play more .
Such interventions have made online casino gaming the preferred video game genre of old age , where players can actually earn some money through their efforts and fun .
Casino promo codes are now being offered with more features and giveaways , such as free bonuses and the like , to attract newer players and retain existing ones .
At the interfaces , there are always the lively additions .
After a prolonged box - office slump , too many high - cost movies and executive turmoil , Universal Pictures chairmen Marc Shmuger and David Linde have been ousted after their 3 1/2 year run as the studio’s top movie lieutenants .
Rather than recruit an outsider for the top movie job , Universal Studios President Ron Meyer has promoted two insiders to succeed the duo .
The studio's marketing chief , Adam Fogelson , has been named chairman , and production president Donna Langley , co-chairman , reporting to Fogelson .
Meyer is banking on the pair to reverse the studio’s box office slump and end the infighting that 's disrupted the studio ’s executive suites for several months .
Shmuger and Linde ’s removal is the fourth senior - level shake - up to hit one of Hollywood ’s major studios in the last few months , coming on the heels of the abrupt departure of Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook two weeks ago .
Earlier this month , Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer Inc. chief executive Harry Sloan was pushed out , and a few weeks earlier Paramount Pictures removed its two top movie executives , John Lesher and Brad Weston .
Such upheaval comes at a particularly treacherous time for the movie industry when studios can no longer rely on once - robust DVD sales to prop up their business , making it increasingly difficult for them to recoup costs on their flops and make healthy returns on their more expensive hits .
The long - rumored management changes at Universal come as the studio ’s parent company NBC Universal and owner General Electric are engaged in talks with cable giant Comcast Corp. to sell a 51 % controlling stake in the media company .
A broader housecleaning at NBC Universal could come down if and when there is a change of ownership .
This is the second major upheaval in recent months under the watch of NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker following this summer ’s departure of his hand - picked top television executive , Ben Silverman , who left after two tumultuous years
With the dismal box office year that Universal has had — capped by the poor showing of its current release “ Love Happens ” and this summer ’s high - profile disappointments “ Land of the Lost , ” a costly misfire starring Will Ferrell , Judd Apatow ’s “ Funny People ” starring Adam Sandler , “ Public Enemies ” with Johnny Depp , and Sacha Baron Cohen ’s “ Bruno ” -- Meyer , Shmuger and Linde have been on the firing line of Zucker and NBC Universal ’s owner General Electric
Universal currently ranks last among its rivals in market share so far this year , with just 8.6 % , a poor standing also attributable to disappointing returns from such adult dramas as director Ron Howard ’s “ Frost / Nixon , ” “ State of Play ” starring Russell Crowe , and “ Duplicity ” with Julia Roberts .
In light of the glaring downturn , the Universal executives were asked by NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker and GE honcho Jeffrey Immelt to explain why their movies were n't clicking with audiences and costing so much , and what plans they had to get back on course .
Meyer ’s ultimate decision to dismiss Shmuger and Linde was months in the making , and had been met with some initial resistance from Zucker , according to several people close to the situation .
Zucker , these people explained , leaned toward giving the pair a chance to change course , especially since they were the same executives who presided over two of Universal ’s most profitable years in 2008 and 2007 with such hits as “ Mama Mia ! , ” “ The Bourne Ultimatum ” and “ Knocked Up . ” Shmuger and Linde were also each given four - year contract extensions in January , which would mean that GE will be looking at hefty settlements .
But , in recent weeks , the pressure on Meyer to make a change began to mount as some of Universal ’s biggest producers , including Marc Platt , Brian Grazer and Scott Stuber , continued to lodge complaints and frustration about a leadership vacuum , the lack of a clear strategy and decision - making that they found untenable .
Shmuger and Linde have also come under fire for the high costs of some of their big event movies , including “ Land of The Lost , ” which cost some $ 200 million to make and market and will lose about $ 70 million , according to people close to the matter .
A number of the team ’s 2010 releases , among them “ Robin Hood , ” “ The Wolfman ” and the Iraq War drama “ The Green Zone , ” each have production budgets that exceed $ 100 million .
But , in the end , Shmuger and Linde ’s undoing was not limited to their ill - fated movie picks and budget overruns .
Meyer privately told close associates that he would not fire the pair over a bad slate of films , since no studio is immune to the vagaries of the movie business and difficult - to - gauge audience tastes .
People close to the studio said Meyer became unhappy with Shmuger and Linde ’s inability to sustain a spirit of teamwork and put a stop to the turmoil that has roiled the studio's executive suites .

Looks like the Club for Growth / Sarah Palin wing of the Republican Party has prevailed in this race .
DeDe Scozzafava suspends her campaign :
Dede Scozzafava , the Republican and Independence parties candidate , announced Saturday that she is suspending her campaign for the 23rd Congressional District and releasing all her supporters .
The state Assemblywoman has not thrown her support to either Doug Hoffman , the Conservative Party candidate , or Bill Owens , the Democratic candidate .
" Today , I again seek to act for the good of our community , " Ms. Scozzafava wrote in a letter to friends and supporters .
" It is increasingly clear that pressure is mounting on many of my supporters to shift their support .
Consequently , I hereby release those individuals who have endorsed and supported my campaign to transfer their support as they see fit to do so .
I am and have always been a proud Republican .
It is my hope that with my actions today , my party will emerge stronger and our district and our nation can take an important step towards restoring the enduring strength and economic prosperity that has defined us for generations . "
Ms. Scozzafava told the Watertown Daily Times that Siena Research Institute poll numbers show her too far behind to catch up - and she lacks enough money to spend on advertising in the last three days to make a difference .
Mr. Owens has support from 36 percent of likely voters in the poll , with Mr. Hoffman garnering 35 percent support .
Ms. Scozzafava has support from 20 percent of those polled .
The Gouverneur resident said she thinks she will receive more than 20 percent of the vote , based on several factors , including her performance during a Thursday debate .

DUBLIN — Ladbrokes in downtown Dublin was paying one to 33 that Irish voters would approve Europe 's Lisbon Treaty , against eight to one that they would strike it down .
For non-gamblers , that means the betting chain thought the EU charter was a favorite to win — by a lot .
Two doors down , patrons of the Sackville Lounge turned away from televised horse races to reveal why .
After Irish voters spurned the treaty in a referendum last year , the European Commission — the EU 's unelected legislative , regulatory and executive branch whose ...

The old man was a genius but kept it to himself .
He lived in an old house outside of the city .
He did n’t have friends .
He kept himself busy with hobbies .
His latest project had been a frustrating one .
The problem was material .
By his calculations , he would have needed a dish over six miles in diameter .
Tin or lead - lined steel would have been best .
He did n’t have the money to afford that much metal , let alone get a grant from city council to build something so huge that close to the city .
He was stuck .
Until he thought smaller instead of bigger .
He bought an old television picture tube and a faulty electron microscope from the university that they were going to throw out anyway .
He bought thirty magnets from the hardware store , salted them , and aligned them all in a very unique and specific way on a chunk of stolen chain - link fence .
By pulsing the electrons from the busted television through those magnets with the electron microscope turned on to observe them to make them collapse , he created a tachyon spray gun .
With it , he could mark a radius of five miles around his house with an invisible web of time - retarding , mostly - stable tachyon nets with its focus ending in the middle of his basement .
Totally harmless to the normal population .
To time travelers , it might as well have been a brick wall .
The first traveler arrived five minutes after the old man turned the time - net on .
There was a flash and there he was .
Dressed in blue and with goggles .
He had a bright orange plastic fin on the top of his head .
He was wearing black rubber gloves and his chest had a tangle of monitors on it .
His whole setup looked pretty homemade .
He had what looked like a motorcycle throttle in his left hand and some sort of blender in the other .
“ Sweet !
It worked !
Where am I ? ” he asked .
Looking at the old man and then at his surroundings with a wide , goofy smile on his face .
“ 1958 . ” the old man lied .
“ What ?
That does n’t make any sense . ”
He looked down at one of his dials .
The old man raised his gun and shot the traveler through his left eye .
The old man turned off the time - net .
He took off the traveler ’s clothes and looked at the equipment strapped to his body .
There had to be about six patents in the chest equipment alone .
And judging by the traveler ’s inexperience and naiveté , he probably was n’t even that advanced .
The old man would rob more travelers and steal their technology .
He ’d leak the patents out on the market .
He ’d be rich .
Seeing as no temporal police had showed up at his house yet , the old man figured that he had already gotten away with the crime .
The old man smiled in the darkness of his basement .

The exploding MMO market in China is being cut off from Western economic influence as Chinese regulators ban foreign investment in virtual worlds .
This Reuters report states that : “ The new directive also disallows foreign firms from indirectly influencing Chinese gaming firms through agreements or technology support . ”
This is a move which presumably has something do with predictions that the Chinese MMO market will be worth $ 3.5 - 4 billion this year .
I wonder what the ramifications of this will be for China ’s game culture , and whether we ’ll see them having a rather isolated and unusual MMO focus like South Korea has done in the past .

Capitalism : A Love Story is a fantastic slap - upside - the - head film , just what we need right now .
It ’s been playing a week in New York and Los Angeles , and just opened wide .
The reviews are “ mixed . ”
Critics say it ’s just Michael Moore preaching to the choir again : people who love Michael Moore will go see the film , people who hate him wo n’t , therefore he has no persuasive effect whatsoever .
Though Dana Stevens of Slate doubts that anyone can really love Moore :
If you already dislike Michael Moore , Capitalism : A Love Story , his latest documentary / provocation / performance - piece / decoupage project is n’t likely to win you over .
And if you love him without reservations , this movie has nothing to tell you that you have n’t already shouted through a bullhorn at a “ Free Mumia ” rally .
But is there anyone who falls cleanly into that latter category of unabashed Moore love ?
The hulking Michigander ’s 20 - year career as an agitprop prankster , his stalwart refusal either to go away or to hone the blunt instrument of his demagogic style , has made Moore a problem for the left and the right .
Even those who largely agree with Moore ’s politics are often mortified by the delivery system : the juvenile stunts , the easy demonization of his opponents , the deliberate donning of blinders when a cogent counterargument comes along .
As usual , that leaves me out .
I love Michael Moore , and I never shouted anything through a bullhorn .
I should ’ve , though .
Maybe I ’ll start .
( Note to self : buy bullhorn . )
In his 1989 feature film debut , Roger & Me , Moore charted the ruin of his hometown of Flint , corporate headquarters of GM , and went off on a quest for an explanation from then - head of GM , Roger Smith .
In his 2009 film Capitalism : A Love Story , he charts the ruin of America , which is now one big Flint , pillaged by a horde of Roger Smiths .
But now he does n’t just want to ask corporate heads , or their government shills , for an explanation .
Instead , he enacts an attempted Citizen ’s Arrest on a grand scale .
This fails , as it ’s meant to , because obviously one lone Michael Moore ca n’t sledge - hammer this system .
But a relentless mob of a hundred million smart , angry , organized citizens could .
Right ?
RIGHT ?!?
It beats me how people have managed to get themselves so completely balled up about Michael Moore , the excellent filmmaker who gave us such great stuff as Bowling for Columbine , Fahrenheit 9/11 , and now Capitalism : A Love Story .
Conservatives hate him and try to dismiss him for obvious reasons — he ’s a real threat , a working - class lefty with nerve , brains , humor , ass - kicking rhetorical strategies , and a lifetime membership in the NRA .
But liberal types do n’t seem to like him much either .
Even when they praise his films they do it apologetically , grudgingly , condescendingly , hastening to make clear that , of course , Moore ’s a fat naïve self - aggrandizing buffoon with a tired shtick that he ’s been boring us with for twenty years , but still , he does get a lot of attention and pulls off an amusing prank now and then .
Given how few people are willing to praise him out loud in public , it ’s a mystery that Moore ’s films are such consistent hits .
They are , though .
Somebody besides me is paying to watch them .
In fact , Moore ’s films are so popular they make lots of money , which in turn allows him to make more films , and to wind up rich himself .
This leads to a furious charge of hypocrisy — how dare he profit from the capitalist system he criticizes ?
Why ’s a rich man pretending to stand up for the poor and working class ?
Here ’s Liam Lacey working that angle in the Toronto Globe & Mail :
Abetted by the support of a couple of Catholic priests and a bishop , Moore says , unequivocally that “ capitalism is evil ” and should be eradicated .
But does he mean it ?
As a filmmaker creating a product for a marketplace , supported by profit - seeking investors , he obviously has some comfort level with capitalism in the sense of doing business .
Familiar logic , this .
Because anyone trying to make a living is implicated in capitalistic “ profit - seeking , ” none of us have any right to kick about it .
Any lucky soul who scores big money and argues that something should be done to make things less harsh on those who do n’t have money is immediately charged with heresy because he has n’t pulled a Jesus Christ and given away everything he owns .
The nervous heretic quickly understands the necessity of converting to the Gospel of Wealth and becoming an upper - class bastard who can socialize easily with other upper - class bastards in the Hamptons or wherever .
Here are the other most typical dismissals of Moore , besides he ’s - preaching - to - the - choir and he ’s - a - rich - hypocrite :
Moore ’s hopelessly naïve and simple - minded , reducing complex issues to absurd polemical stances .
He apparently does n’t understand the complex issues he takes on .
Owen Gleiberman , Entertainment Weekly :
Here , as in the health - care doc Sicko ( 2007 ) , Moore ’s real subject is the collapse of the social contract .
That ’s a powerful theme , but why did he have to make the film ’s villain nothing less than …capitalism itself ?
Moore depicts the very concept of American free enterprise as inherently unjust .
But even if you believe that deregulation in the ’ 80s went too far , that unchecked capitalism is a voracious beast that can eat a culture alive , you may have a hard time swallowing the film ’s finale , in which Moore trashes our system as ” evil ” and pushes for a citizens ’ ” revolt . ”
At its best , Capitalism : A Love Story is a searing outcry against the excesses of a cutthroat time .
At its worst , it ’s dorm - room Marxism .
Why does he have to make capitalism the villain ?
Because capitalism is killing us right now , and we can all see it and feel it and practically smell it .
Anybody out there following the news lately ?
Moore has been arguing for twenty years that we need a return to serious government regulation , and a recommitment to the idea of the common good as a primary motivating factor in our culture .
So okay , Obama gets elected , but uh , strangely enough , Goldman Sachs is still calling the shots .
Now what ?
What rhetorical strategies can he deploy ?
The hard right is unreachable .
How to motivate the snooty left and an angry yet inactive American center ?
How about shouting “ capitalism is evil ” in a crowded theater ?
Followed by “ socialism does n’t sound so bad ” ?
A little dorm - room Marxism might be just the way to get everybody up on their hind legs ready to fight for what they want .
Michael Sragow , Baltimore Sun :
In the end , [ Moore ] lacks mental toughness and clarity .
In his melodramatic view of politics , capitalism alone brings out the worst in men .
He says that we must replace capitalism with its opposite : democracy .
The symmetry does n’t work .
Capitalism is an economic system ; democracy , a political system .
Sragow ’s always exemplary mental toughness and clarity does n’t allow him to see that an economic system can have an impact on a political system and vice versa .
The two can even be inextricably intertwined .
Communism , anyone ?
Moore is trying to suggest that our commitment to capitalism has subsumed our commitment to democracy .
As Exhibit A , Moore gives us an appalling suit - and - tied Wall Street Journal git bragging how he personally has no commitment to democracy , because there have been poor democratic countries , but capitalism has made America great because it ’s made America rich .
Some of America , anyway .
Moore also shows us excerpts from a horrifying letter circulating among an elite group of bankers and rich investors openly identifying the new “ plutonomy ” which allows 1 % of the population to control 95 % of the wealth , and lays out an action plan for keeping it that way .
The only potential danger , investors are warned , is the ongoing democratic system of one - person , one - vote .
So apparently democracy still has something to do with capitalism in America , though maybe not for long .
Anyway , let ’s see if we can get it straight : Moore makes impassioned arguments in a popular mass media form to people who still have some latent political muscle , and he wants to persuade them to use it before it ’s too late .
Maybe his way is n’t the right way .
Probably it wo n’t work .
But after all , how DO you persuade people like the scared majority of Americans to get smart and stop supporting the buzzards who are picking their bones clean ?
How would you do it ?
And if you know so damn much about it , why DON ’T you do it ?
Moore does n’t make properly objective documentaries .
Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter notes that “ Simplifications are Moore ’s stock - in - trade , and his documentaries are not known for their impeccable research and objectivity . ”
Pop quiz : define “ documentary ” in terms of its history as an objective form of filmed reportage .
That ’ll be a very short essay .
Film History Lesson :
Direct Cinema is that fly - on - the - wall documentary style that most people vaguely assume is the gold standard of documentaries because the filmmaker is not seen or heard and you can kid yourself the film is free of the filmmaker ’s subjective take on the material .
It represented a break with documentary tradition , because prior to the 1950s - ‘60s documentaries were largely staged affairs , featuring authoritative “ Voice - of - God ” narration telling you what to think about the images .
Technological innovations during and after WW II , such as lighter cameras , faster film stocks , and portable sound recording equipment , allowed documentary filmmakers to get out in the streets and shoot on the run , and the Cinema Verite and Direct Cinema movement developed .
Cinema Verite was the more aggressive form of the new documentaries , featuring a filmmaker insisting upon his / her presence in the film , often asking deliberately provoking questions ( “ Are you happy ? ” ) and sometimes bringing the film subjects into the process to analyze their own participation .
Yeah , you guessed it — Michael Moore is in the Cinema Verite line .
In the ‘ 70s Direct Cinema came under fire , as people argued that it represented a bigger lie , the pretense of impossible objectivity .
After all , some subjective schmoe is framing the shot , editing material in or out for some intended effect , etc .
So years of doc experimentation followed , addressing the fraught relationship of film to reality and authentic experience .
These days we watch Synthesis Documentaries , which feature a mushy , familiar set of conventions we tend to embrace as “ objective , ” neutral , representing no particular point of view , weighing all controversies fairly and impersonally .
All the techniques tossed out by Direct Cinema filmmakers in the interests of “ neutral ” observation are back — talking - head interviews , voice - over narration , musical scores , intertitles , archival materials , etc. Just think PBS .
We buy the Synthesis Documentaries as “ impeccably researched ” and “ objective ” because we are stupid and we learn nothing and we remember nothing .
But it ’s true , Michael Moore insists upon the fact that he ’s making an argument in film form , that it is his argument based on his experience , that he is not neutral .
Moore ’s an egomaniac hogging the spotlight in his own films , pretending to be a blue - collar simpleton surprised by his filmic encounters .
Stephanie Zacharek , Salon :
But 20 years after “ Roger & Me , ” “ Capitalism : A Love Story ” proves that Michael Moore ’s greatest subject is himself .
This is a love story , all right , but it has less to do with the flaws of capitalism than it does with Moore ’s unwavering fondness for the sound of his own voice , and for what he perceives as his own vast cleverness .
Deborah Young , Hollywood Reporter :
As in his previous films , Moore is himself the chief character , offscreen narrator and investigator .
Wearing his inseparable baseball cap and T - shirt , he pretends wide - eyed surprise as his interview subjects recount personal dramas related to America ’s economic meltdown .
Moore ’s film persona is exactly that , and has remained consistent from film to film .
He plays himself as a sane working class guy trying to figure out what the hell ’s going on , a proxy for other presumably sane working class people who also would like to know what the hell ’s going on .
He dresses the part .
His insistence on his own presence in his films goes back to the very first shots of Roger & Me — ME , see ? — and is vital to his argument , which is that his own lived experience , in his view , reflects the larger American experience of late capitalism .
Yes , this gives him a lot of screen time .
Moore is the left - wing equivalent of Rush Limbaugh .
Owen Gleiberman , Entertainment Weekly :
Pointing his finger at ” capitalism ” Moore sounds a little too much like Rush Limbaugh getting hot under the collar about ” socialism . ”
In both cases , they ’re not making an argument — they ’re demonizing a word .
Liam Lacey , Toronto Globe & Mail :
Though presumably a fan of more , rather than less , government involvement in the economy , Moore sees the bailout as another example of the rich screwing the poor , and rather unexpectedly ends up sounding like the anti-government zealots from the right .
Oh hell , these are just stupid .
Moore is repeating himself ; he makes stale , formulaic , crowd - pleasing films .
Dana Stevens , Slate :
In the movie ’s most painfully redundant scenes , Moore approaches the Manhattan headquarters of Goldman Sachs and other investment banks and stands outside with a bag , asking the doorman to let him in to reclaim America ’s money .
Now that 20 years have passed since his first film , Roger and Me , can we all just agree to tap into our collective memory of these moments when Moore is refused entry into corporate high - rises by polite and embarrassed doormen ( all of whom belong to the working class he so loves to champion ) ?
We get it , Mike :
The head of GM will not see you .
The chairman of Goldman Sachs will not see you .
The secretary of the U.S. Treasury will not see you .
Waste any more footage on this tired gag , and your loyal fan base may start to feel the same way .
Manohla Dargis , New York Times :
Mr. Moore does n’t just refer to “ Roger & Me , ” which involved his attempts to speak with Roger Smith , the chief executive of the floundering General Motors ; he also includes some nominal highlights from that 1989 movie .
A lot of performers like to replay their early hits , so it is n’t surprising that Mr. Moore , a practiced showman , recycles images of his younger , slimmer self engaging in one of his trademark moves : trying to enter a building to speak truth to power , only to be turned away by security guards .
It was faintly amusing theater then , especially if you did n’t think too hard about the fact that he was hassling working people just trying to do their jobs .
It ’s less amusing when he repeats the same routine in “ Capitalism . ”
The critics have noticed that Michael Moore is returning to certain scenes and situations he ’s filmed before — nice work , critics !
Way to stay awake through the whole film !
But let ’s consider whether there might be a reason for doing this before we scorn him for it .
Perhaps
Moore is trying to emphasize the fact that he ’s been doing this for twenty years now , not just because he ’s too lazy to film new kinds of scenes , but because there is a certain cumulative power to memories of Moore , Working - class Man , making endless trips up steps to formidable buildings trying to get an accounting from CEOs of their ruinous practices .
He STILL ca n’t get one , and he ’s now rich and famous for trying .
No one can get one .
The president ca n’t get one .
When are we going to demand they come out of those fortress - buildings and face us ?
Though it is true that trying to persuade people to think about what ’s going on does include occasionally “ hassling ” them when they ’re merely trying to do their jobs guarding the entrance to Goldman Sachs for , no doubt , pitifully low pay .
Moore ’s exploitative in manipulating audience emotions .
Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post says “ … Moore ’s sentimental appeals too often veer toward the maudlin ( he ’s neck and neck with Oprah in making his interviewees cry ) … ”
Manohla Dargis , NY Times :
Captain
Mike is here to explain it all or at least crack jokes , milk tears , recycle the news and fan the flames of liberal indignation .
Along the way , because his heart is in the right place even if his images are n’t always , he also makes room for other voices , including those of striking workers and members of one family in foreclosure who videotaped the police breaking down the door to evict them .
Dana Stevens , Slate :
One section of the film deals with so - called “ dead peasant ” insurance policies , a malevolent practice in which large companies ( including , for a period in the ’ 90s , Wal - Mart ) take out hefty policies on employees who seem unlikely to die , essentially betting on the odds of their survival .
Moore interviews the families of two Wal - Mart employees who were horrified to learn , after their beloveds ’ deaths , that the company stood to profit by them ( in one case , to the tune of $ 1.5 million ) .
The way Moore gathers one such family around the kitchen table , then leaves the camera on the children ’s faces while their father remembers their mother ’s final days , feels exploitive and crass .
The scene makes you cry , yes — who would n’t when hearing how a little girl asked whether she could cut a hole in the hospital wall to see her mother one last time ?— but it seems like something you should n’t be allowed to see .
Once again , Moore ’s goodhearted aims come into direct conflict with his bludgeoning tactics .
The way we have allowed ourselves to be tied in knots , so that we ca n’t make a move in any direction , is really wonderful .
We ca n’t express any emotion over terrible things because that ’s “ maudlin , ” we ca n’t try to take action because that ’s naïve and simplistic , we ca n’t “ make capitalism the villain , ” we ca n’t indulge in class warfare , we ca n’t try for political change because it seems to make no difference what party ’s in power , we ca n’t identify with labor and the underclass because that ’s dorm - room Marxism and a one - way ticket to Palookaville , we ca n’t identify with the leisured rich because we ’ve got no money and refuse to be as completely stupid as all that .
We ca n’t do nuthin . ’
Well , maybe rob banks and commit workplace massacres .
Those are still options .
Moore does n’t offer solutions to the vast problems he identifies .
Manohla Dargis , NY Times :
In the end , what is to be done ?
After watching “ Capitalism , ” it beats me .
Mr. Moore does n’t have any real answers , either , which tends to be true of most socially minded directors in the commercial mainstream and speaks more to the limits of such filmmaking than to anything else .
Liam Lacey , Toronto G & M :
These things are shameful , but what do they tell us about economics ?
Through inference , we can guess that the capitalism Moore is angry about is capitalism gone berserk , as the free - market theories of Milton Friedman and others became enshrined into the Reaganite , neo-con ideology of deregulation , anti-unionism and tax - cutting .
Like pure socialism , free - market capitalism seems like one of those single , unifying ideas that have no place in the real world .
In the end , the best the weary - sounding Moore can suggest is that capitalism needs to be replaced by “ democracy , ” which amounts to exchanging one slippery term for another .
Admitting that he ’s grown tired of his own theatrics , Moore urges the audience to “ join him ” in his cause .
Well sure , Captain Mike , as soon as we can figure out what exactly that ’s supposed to be .
Yeah , Moore did n’t give us The Answer in his twenty - year filmic harangue , because nobody knows
The Answer , but he ’s certainly identified the main problems and outlined a number of lively suggestions for action .
And now he ’s throwing the ball to us , and we ca n’t think of enough ways to drop it .
But I ’m sure he ’ll check in with us in another twenty years , in 2029 , if he ’s around , to see how that ’s working out for us .
For five years she ’s lived under the threat of death from Islamic radicals , and in those five years , she has become an acclaimed and provocative author on matters about Islam and the West .
Ayaan Hirsi Ali was born into a Somali Muslim family and eventually made her way to the Netherlands as a refugee .
There she wrote a screenplay for a short film about women ’s treatment under Islam .
Just over two months after it aired , the filmmaker Theo van Gogh was assassinated .
A letter threatening Ali ’s life has meant she has lived under guard ever since -- most recently thanks to a fund set up by private donors .
Controversy follows her :
In 2006 , she resigned from the Netherlands parliament under fire for lying on her asylum papers ; the complex charges and countercharges precipitated a Dutch political upheaval .
She now works for the conservative American Enterprise Institute , which is headquartered in Washington .
She established her AHA foundation to defend the rights of women in the West against militant Islam .
Her autobiography , “ Infidel : My Life , ” which detailed her own genital mutilation in Somalia , was a bestseller , and her next book , “ Nomad , ” is to be published in February .

What did you think of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s trip to Africa ?
I am always very happy when the United States shows interest in Africa , even if it ’s symbolic , and hers was largely symbolic .
I think that Hillary Clinton will continue State Department aid to Africa .
But many African countries are faced with the expansion of radical Islam , [ which ] will mean that the United States is going to be faced with a new national security question .
Wahhabi money is in Africa .
They ’re building mosques very fast .
They ’re introducing Sharia .
It ’s a grass - roots movement , and I did n’t see anybody talking about that .
When it comes to women in Africa , is the U.S. using too many of its values or too few ?
There is too much apologizing for what freedom means .
In Africa , you ’re told , “ Oh , this is our custom -- polygamy is our custom , female genital mutilation is our custom , these are our values . ”
Then you have the Americans and the Europeans being very shy and saying , “ Oh , I ’m really sorry , it ’s your custom . ”

Your own grandmother oversaw your genital mutilation when you were 5 , even though your father opposed it .
That ’s why I keep hammering on principle .
My grandmother was convinced she was doing something right .
She was brainwashed .
She was doing it out of love .
She had done it to all her daughters ; it was done to her , to her grandmother .
She did n’t know it was possible not to be , as she called it , “ cleansed . ”
Yes , education helps , but it had everything to do with the conviction that what she was doing was right .
Will any country ever go to war for rights and women ’s safety ?
It looks like it will not happen .
But I am very , very optimistic -- not about going to war but about human beings changing their minds .
You ’ll remember how communism was stigmatized .
The big problem is [ how ] to define the protection of women ’s rights as the problem of the 21st century .
If the world does that , [ women ’s inequality ] will become like the eradication of apartheid -- people will insist that it ’s wrong , it ’s wrong , it ’s wrong , and that ’s when change happens .

What changes people ?
I ’ll give you an example .
The Sudanese woman who decided to wear trousers , and when the world rallied to her support , she does n’t get the lashes .
It is this kind of unbending persistence .
Human trafficking -- girls kidnapped and then forced into prostitution -- that is economic exploitation .
That can be eradicated by going after the traffickers , by providing education and eradicating poverty .
Where women are put in veils , where their genitals are cut , where there ’s “ honor killing , ” where half the population may not go outside without a male guardian -- that cannot be dealt with only by talking about poverty .
You have to tackle those principles .
I ’ve asked other feminists this question :
Why are women ’s rights always the ones up for negotiation ?
Yes , is n’t that interesting ?
Women are mainly oppressed by their own fathers , their own brothers , their own mothers - in - law , their grandmothers , so it ’s the most intimate kind of oppression .
Another thing : Western feminism still defines the white man as the oppressor , but right now it ’s the brown man , the black man , the yellow man .
When you tell them , “ Stop oppressing your women , ” they ’ll tell you , “ Do n’t impose your culture on me . ”
It would have been fantastic if , when [ President ] Obama went to Cairo , he [ had said ] , “ We have taught the white man that bigotry is bad and he has given it up , at least most of it .
Now bigotry is committed in the name of the black man , the brown man , the yellow man , whatever color . ”

Do you make a distinction between mainstream and radical Islam ?
I refuse to do that because one gives birth to the other .
You are born into mainstream Islam .
You are taught :
Do not question the prophet ; everything in the Koran is true .
And then the radicals come and they expand on that , they build on that .
So it is up to so - called mainstream Islam to tackle the radical element .
[ Mainstream Muslims ] have to question the infallibility of the prophet Muhammad .
They have to quit teaching children and young people that everything in the Koran is true and has to be taken seriously .
You can see it in the Christian world .
You have pockets of very radical Christians who refuse to change .
But most Christians have decided to reform , to introduce new ways of looking at [ the Bible ] and to allow freedom of thought and speech .
So if people move away from the radical ideas , they ’re not killed , they ’re not beheaded .
You ’ll be eligible for U.S. citizenship in about three years .
How do people here regard their citizenship compared with citizens of other countries ?
Advertisement
I think the American situation is much healthier than the European situation .
America has the advantage that when you become a citizen , you pledge loyalty to a Constitution that ’s about ideas and not about ethnicity .
Because of that , Americans do not feel shy about teaching new Americans why citizenship is important , why patriotism is important , pride about the Founding Fathers .
That ’s an easier sell than taking pride in the history of France , for instance .
One guiding value here is tolerance .
You ’re concerned about Americans tolerating the wrong things .
To be a community of free people , you have to defend that freedom tooth and nail , and for this country to remain vital , you have to understand that freedom is a very , very vulnerable institution .
It ’s something you have to keep defending , and the only way to achieve that is intolerance of intolerance .
Are American Muslims different from European Muslims ?
Advertisement
I see one big difference , and that is economic .
Most Muslims who come to the United States had a higher level of education than Muslims going to Europe , and a higher level of income .
That is changing now because of resettlement [ of more Muslims in the U.S. ] .
The United States is not a welfare state .
American Muslims have to have a job .
European [ nations ] are welfare states so you have a lot of poor people who depend on the state for their survival .
That makes it very attractive for radicals .
I hope that American Muslims are different .
But that does not make America immune to radical Islam .
At the Sun Valley Writers ’ Conference , I heard Iranian American author Firoozeh Dumas challenge you on your point that , in Islam , the subjugation of women is a religious mandate , not a cultural one .
She stood up to say that none of the things that I was talking about had anything to do with Islam , that I was simply projecting my personal experiences on [ to ] Islam .
That ’s a question that always upsets me .
I simply gave her the facts , the evidence , the arguments .
I said Sharia law is Islamic law ; it ’s derived from the Koran .
We see everywhere that it is applied [ to ] how women are treated .
Firoozeh Dumas represents an enlightened , educated , modern , cosmopolitan woman -- most people with a Christian background who are on that level of development no longer defend Christianity in the same way that those who are born into Islam still defend it .
Do you regard yourself as an atheist ?

Did God create man , or did man create God ?
I belong to the group who say man created God .
I am comfortable to live without an outer force telling me what to do .
I ’d rather believe in human beings .
Where do you put yourself politically ?
My politics are what the Americans call libertarian and the Europeans call classic liberalist .
[ Here ] the word “ liberal ” is hijacked by people who only care about collectivism .
But then libertarian also implies you do n’t care about communities .
I am a radical individual freedom fighter or defender of individual freedom .
I ’m a universalist ; I think these freedoms and rights are universal .

Venus beat her in last year ’s Wimbledon final , but as it turned out , Venus was not Serena ’s toughest opponent this year .
Serena had to save a match point in the third set against Elena Dementieva in the semifinals , and this is the third time in her career that she has won a Grand Slam singles title after being match point down along the way .
“ She almost was out in the semifinals , ” Venus said .
“ She just hung in there long enough and got the win . ”
With her 30th birthday near , Venus had struggles of her own at Wimbledon this year , and one of the differences Saturday just might have been the extra bit of predominantly white attire that Venus was sporting on her left knee .
She began taping that knee during the second round here , and her father and coach , Richard Williams , who left London before his daughters ’ latest final , said before his departure that Venus was in pain earlier in the tournament .
Venus dislikes discussing injuries .
But she had an abbreviated warm - up before the final , and there were moments when she appeared to favor her left leg slightly .
“ I have no complaints from the beginning and no complaints now , ” Venus said of her knee .
“ Everybody has something they ’re dealing with .
I just have no complaints .
You know , I wish I could have done a few things different here and there in this match .
But , you know , it was close . ”
At least the first set was close .
With both sisters dominating on their serves and looking edgy from the baseline , there were few extended rallies .
But the plot line improved in the seventh game when Serena had to save two break points before holding .
A domestic pig on an organic farm in Solothurn , Switzerland .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A study of domesticated pigs has found that with just a little experimentation they can find food based only on a reflection in a mirror .
The study , carried out by Donald M. Broom , Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University in the U.K. , found that given a chance to familiarize themselves with a mirror first , most pigs can find food based only on its reflection .
Pigs that are not familiar with mirrors look behind them for the food .
In the study , soon to be published in the journal Animal Behaviour , four pairs of domesticated pigs were allowed to familiarize themselves with a mirror for five hours .
They generally approached it cautiously at first , ending with their noses pressed against the mirror , but one pig charged at its reflection and broke the mirror .
They looked behind the mirror , and watched their own reflections moving in front of it .
After familiarization , each pig was placed in a pen with an angled mirror and a partition , behind which were treats such as apple slices or M&Ms .
Seven of the eight pigs immediately looked behind the partition and found the food .
A control group of pigs that had never seen a mirror before searched behind it for the food .
Professor Broom said the study shows pigs have a high degree of what he terms assessment awareness , or the ability to use memories and observations to quickly learn to assess a situation and act on it .
According to Marc Hauser of Harvard 's Cognitive Evolution laboratory , an understanding of reflections in mirrors has been demonstrated in other nonhuman animals before , but it is paradoxical that many do n't seem to recognize their own reflections .
Researchers have confirmed this by marking a spot on the animal with dye and seeing if they try to remove the spot when they see it reflected in a mirror .
Only a few , such as bottlenose dolphins , apes , elephants , and magpies , recognize the mark as being on their own bodies .
Professor Broom said he had tried marking the pigs , but they took no notice .
He said this is hardly surprising because pigs often get marks on their bodies .
The study proves pigs have awareness , and Broom said that if an animal is known to be clever it is less likely to be treated as a food - producing machine and more like a sentient being .
Perhaps the conditions in which pigs are raised , including overcrowding , which do not meet the needs of the animal , may be improved as a result of the study .

Today ’s jobless claims report should dispel the notion that the labor market in the United States is getting significantly better .
Initial jobless claims rose again to 551,000 from 534,000 the week prior .
The 4 - week average is still an exceedingly high 548,000 and continuing claims are over 6 million ( All figures are seasonally - adjusted .
Chart is below ) .
The silver lining is unadjusted claims .
They came in at 443,000 last week , marking the seventh consecutive week in which unadjusted initial claims were below 500,000 .
As layoffs have declined in this business cycle , I do not expect this number to tick as high relative to the seasonal low around Labor Day as it usually does throughout the business cycle .
What that means is that the seasonal adjustments may be overstating the jobless claims number , which I expect to fall well into the 400s by year - end .
My overall take on these numbers leading into tomorrow ’s unemployment number is this :
The labor market is extremely weak because of a paucity of jobs not because of a torrent of new layoffs .
There are 5 - 6 job applicants for every job opening .
This means that the unemployment should tick higher , reaching at least 10 % before it starts to recede .
When the unemployment rate does recede , the decline will be slow due to the ability of firms to increase the productivity of existing workers ( record - low hours worked and a glut of available temporary workers precede any new hiring ) .
This necessarily means that the economy will be vulnerable to exogenous shocks ( think protectionism , terrorism , etc ) .
So , for the foreseeable future , the employment market will be the missing link to full economic recovery .
Introduction
In April of 1965 , Electronics magazine published an article by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore .
The article and the predictions that it made have since become the stuff of legend , and like most legends it has gone through a number of changes in the telling and retelling .
The press seized on the article 's argument that semiconductor technology would usher in a new era of electronic integration , and they distilled it into a maxim that has taken on multiple forms over the years .
Regardless of the form that the maxim takes , though , it is always given the same name : Moore 's Law .
Moore 's Law is so perennially protean because its eponymous formulator never quite gave it a precise formulation .
Rather , using prose , graphs , and a cartoon Moore wove together a collection of observations and insights in order to outline a cluster of trends that would change the way we live and work .
In the main , Moore was right , and many of his specific predictions have come true over the years .
The press , on the other hand , has met with mixed results in its attempts to sort out exactly what Moore said and , more importantly , what he meant .
The present article represents my humble attempt to bring some order to the chaos of almost four decades of reporting and misreporting on an unbelievably complex industrial / social / psychological phenomenon .
Because this article is quite lengthy , I 've divided it into three parts .
I 've also provided links and summaries for each part below so that you can skip to the part that interests you most :
Part I : The origins of Moore's Law
What was Moore 's original formulation ?
It was n't about increasing " computing power , " and there was a bit more to it than just shrinking feature sizes .
Exploring what Moore originally said will give us the opportunity to learn about the major factors that shape semiconductor manufacturing , and that ultimately shape what we can do with computers and much of modern life .
Finally , I 'll look at how Moore 's observation morphed into the present media construction of " Moore 's Law " as a statement about performance .
Part II : The effects of Moore's Law
In this section , I 'll look at the kinds of possibilities for computing advancement that Moore 's Law opens up .
Power consumption , flexibility , and a host of other issues come into play when we start looking at the variety of ways to exploit the ever increasing levels of integration that Moore 's Law affords us .
In the end , we 'll see why Moore 's Law is just as responsible for " smaller , cheaper and more efficient " as it is for " bigger , faster and more power hungry . "
Part III : The future of Moore's Law
In the third and final part , we 'll look at some of the challenges currently facing designers who would make use of increasing transistor densities to keep Moore 's cost / integration curves marching downwards .
In some markets , system architects are arguing that more integration is n't always better , and in other markets they 're finding it increasingly difficult to mix all the different types of circuits that they 'd like to include on a single die .
Part I : The origins of Moore's Law
The way that " Moore 's Law " is usually cited by those in the know is something along the lines of : " the number of transistors that can be fit onto a square inch of silicon doubles every 12 months . "
The part of Moore 's original 1965 paper that 's usually cited in support of this formulation is the following graph :
This graph does indeed show transistor densities doubling every 12 months , so the formulation above is accurate .
However , it does n't quite do justice to the full scope of the picture that Moore painted in his brief , uncannily prescient paper .
This is because Moore 's paper dealt with more than just shrinking transistor sizes .
Moore was ultimately interested in shrinking transistor costs , and in the effects that cheap , ubiquitous computing power would have on the way we live and work .
This section of the present article aims to give you a general understanding of the various trends and factors that Moore wove together to predict the rise of the personal computer , the mobile phone , the digital wristwatch , and other innovations that we now take for granted .
Of course , I should note that Moore 's original paper was only four pages in length , while the present article is much longer .
This is because Moore presumed quite a bit more background knowledge about the semiconductor industry than most non-specialists have .
Thus this article aims to give you enough background to understand Moore 's reasoning .
If you read through Moore 's paper , the closest you 'll come to a quote that resembles " Moore 's Law " is the italicized portion of the following section , subtitled " Costs and curves . "
Reduced cost is one of the big attractions of integrated electronics , and the cost advantage continues to increase as the technology evolves toward the production of larger and larger circuit functions on a single semiconductor substrate .
For simple circuits , the cost per component is nearly inversely proportional to the number of components , the result of the equivalent piece of semiconductor in the equivalent package containing more components .
But as components are added , decreased yields more than compensate for the increased complexity , tending to raise the cost per component .
Thus there is a minimum cost at any given time in the evolution of the technology .
At present , it is reached when 50 components are used per circuit .
But the minimum is rising rapidly while the entire cost curve is falling ( see graph below ) .
If we look ahead five years , a plot of costs suggests that the minimum cost per component might be expected in circuits with about 1,000 components per circuit ( providing such circuit functions can be produced in moderate quantities . )
In 1970 , the manufacturing cost per component can be expected to be only a tenth of the present cost .
The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year ( see graph on next page ) [ emphasis mine ] .
Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue , if not to increase .
Over the longer term , the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain , although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years .
What exactly does Moore mean by " the complexity for minimum component costs " ?
And what is the relationship between manufacturing defects , costs and the level of integration ?
The answers to these two questions are a bit complicated , but I 'll do my best to break them down in a reasonably understandable manner .
One good place to begin an explanation of the italicized phrase is by rewriting it in a way that unpacks it a bit :
" The number of transistors per chip that yields the minimum cost per transistor has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year . "
This way of putting it is a little better , but the sentence is still impossible to parse correctly if you do n't understand the multiple factors that influence the relationship between the number of transistors that you can put on a chip and the cost per individual chip .
The following section is aimed at giving you an appreciation of those factors , so that you can better understand Moore 's original insight .
This article was first published on February 20 , 2003 .
If all goes well , this 25 - megawatt solar plant in Florida wo n't be America 's largest for long , but it 's not like we 'd pass up the opportunity to let this $ 150 million facility bask in its own glory ( and the sun , if we 're being thorough ) while it can .
The Desoto facility is just one of three solar projects that Florida Power & Light is spearheading , and judging by the proximity of this one ( in Arcadia ) to the 75 - megawatt facility planned for nearby Charlotte County , we 'd surmise that the two are linked in some form or fashion .
President Obama is expected to show up rocking a set of Kanye glasses underneath a welder 's mask when the plant is fired up this Tuesday , and while it 'll only provide power to " a fraction " of FP&L 's customer base , it 'll still generate around twice as much energy as the second - largest photovoltaic facility in the US of A .

Remember this front page lead story from the Guardian in February this year ? :
Britain faces summer of rage – police
Middle - class anger at economic crisis could erupt into violence on streets
Police are preparing for a “ summer of rage ” as victims of the economic downturn take to the streets to demonstrate against financial institutions , the Guardian has learned .
Britain ’s most senior police officer with responsibility for public order raised the spectre of a return of the riots of the 1980s , with people who have lost their jobs , homes or savings becoming “ footsoldiers ” in a wave of potentially violent mass protests .
Superintendent David Hartshorn , who heads the Metropolitan police ’s public order branch , told the Guardian that middle - class individuals who would never have considered joining demonstrations may now seek to vent their anger through protests this year .
Even at the time , publication of the article caused me to muse about the potential consequences :
Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the best - mannered and most polite protests in British political history .
Even as we speak , some opportunist author is presumably working on the Little Book of Riot Etiquette , a sure - fire number one in the non-fiction bestseller chart if this alarming scenario of petit bourgeois quasi- insurrection does come to fruition .
Molotov Cocktails , we will be told , must be passed to the left and must not be thrown while wearing brown shoes or before 6 pm .
It will also be deemed inexcusably bad form to run away from a pitched battle with a phalanx of tooled up police before one has had a chance to present flowers to the hostess .
Demographics alone dictates that the Dalston branch of Matalan will be immune from looting .
But just picture the scene as the baby buggies get hurled through the plate glass windows of Fresh & Wild on Stoke Newington Church Street , and squads of pierced - nose yummy mummies clad in combat gear dive in to liberate the overpriced organic lettuce .
What if things get really serious ?
At that point , some tax lawyers will get sufficiently angry to order the nanny to forget the school run and to engage in acts of sustained sedition on their behalf .
Could legitimate order possibly survive ?
Well , summer ’s over , and it seems like the massed ranks of Hugos and Sophies somehow managed to contain themselves .
Any theories as to why every progressive ’s Berliner of choice got it so spectacularly wrong ?
Let ’s face it , comrades ( and Lib - Dems ) , we need to get our act together .

Two senior Republican senators say the United States , and not Israel , should attack Iran if military action becomes “ necessary . ”
They also say a simple strike at the country ’s nuclear capability would n’t be enough — the US would have to launch an “ all - or - nothing ” war against Iran with the aim of crippling the country ’s military capabilities .

“ I think an Israeli attack on Iran is a nightmare for the world , because it will rally the Arab world around Iran and they ’re not aligned now .
It ’s too much pressure to put on Israel , ” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) told Fox News ’ Chris Wallace .
He continued : “ If the sanctions fail , and Iran ’s going down the road to get a nuclear weapon , any Sunni Arab state that could , would want a nuclear weapon .
Israel will be more imperiled .
The world will change dramatically for the worst .
Military action should be the last resort anyone looks at , and I would rather our allies and us take military action if it ’s necessary . ”
But Graham does n’t think an attack should be limited to airstrikes on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
“ If we use military action against Iran , we should not only go after their nuclear facilities .
We should destroy their ability to make conventional war .
They should have no planes that can fly and no ships that can float , ” said Graham .
Sen . Saxby Chambliss , Republican of Georgia , agrees .
“ The problem with military action also is that you ’re probably not going to be able to stop the production of uranium by just a simple airstrike , ” Chambliss said on Fox News Sunday .
“ Lindsey ’s right .
It ’s an all or nothing deal .
And is it worth that at this point in time , when we know they have the capability ?
We can slow them down , but a full - out military strike is what it would take , ” said Chambliss .

The females seem to know what " quality category " they are in Low - quality females prefer low - quality males , at least in the avian world .
This is according to research published in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B , testing female zebra finches ' taste in males .
As adults , the low - quality females showed a preference for the songs of males of the same quality , and for the male birds themselves .
Evolutionary biologists previously thought that females would always opt for the best male available .
The study was led by Marie - Jeanne Holveck from the Centre of Functional and Evolutionary Ecology in Montpellier , France .
She explained that low - and high - quality birds differ in almost every important characteristic , including metabolism , longevity and attractiveness .
The two individuals just accept each other faster - they just go for it
Marie - Jeanne Holveck
Her team was able to breed high - quality and low - quality finches simply by changing the size of the brood in which the birds were raised .
In larger broods there is more competition between the chicks , she told BBC News , " so the larger groups produce lower quality chicks " .
Dr Holveck 's team tested the female chicks ' preferences for males .
" We trained in what we call an operant cage .
They were trained to peck two keys , and each time they pecked a key it played a male 's song , " she told BBC News .
One of the keys played the song of a high - quality male and the other played a low - quality male 's song .
" I think this is a powerful test , because it 's the female telling us what she would like to hear , " said Dr Holveck .

The low - quality females repeatedly pecked the key that played a low - quality male 's song .
Only male finches sing , and the song is an important reproductive signal to the females .
In the second part of her experiment , Dr Holveck found that these song preferences " actually translated into preferences for the live males " .
" And quality - matched pairs , " she explained , " bred faster - producing eggs faster than the mismatched pairs .
" The main reason , we think , could be that the two individuals just accept each other faster - they just go for it .
" The really amazing thing is that the females are able to recognise what ' category ' they are in .
We 'd like to investigate further to find out how they do this . "
Joseph Tobias , a zoologist from Oxford University who was not involved in this study , said the findings were interesting .
" While [ this ] does n't overturn evolutionary thinking , it does reveal some interesting trade - offs in breeding decisions , " he said .
" It also raises the intriguing possibility that the environment in which individuals are reared strongly influences their mating preferences as adults . "

Reese Witherspoon has quashed rumours her marriage to Ryan Phillippe is on the rocks .
The Oscar - winning actress , who scooped the Best Actress accolade at this year 's ceremony , insists she and her actor husband are blissfully happy despite reports claiming otherwise .
Reese is furious comments she made earlier this year that she and her spouse had attended marriage counselling were " taken out of context " and used to cast doubts on the pair 's happiness .
The blonde star - who has two children , Ava , 6 , and two - year - old Deacon , with Ryan - said : " It 's sad to see that when you are honest and talk about the normal ups and downs it gets taken out of context .
Ryan and I have a great marriage , I see him not only as my husband but also as my best friend .
"
It is not the first time Reese has hit out at claims her marriage is in trouble .
Last month , the ' Legally Blonde ' star revealed she does n't read her own press because she 's sick of speculation about her private life .
She said : " I know what 's true and I do n't live my life like a famous fancy person .
I do n't read any of it - it just does n't matter to me .
I feel like people read it one day and the dog pees on it the next .
I really just do n't care . "
