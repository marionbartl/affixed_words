Rarely do we dabble in the entertainment field , especially when it involves men , but this one deserves special mention because it involves one of the greatest sports movies ever made .
Remember Shooter McGavin ( Christopher McDonald ) of “ I eat pieces of sh!t like you for breakfast , ” fame from Happy Gilmore ?
Well , Shooter is doing very well , and after a short Busted Coverage investigation ( we can confirm ) , pulls even more tail than Mr. Belding who also cruises the celebrity golf circuit .
It ’s been 13 years since Happy Gilmore made its cinematic debut , but that has n’t stopped the Shooter ( just turned 54 ) phenomenon .
We ’ve discovered dozens of photos where Shooter is using his old magic on women who were in elementary school when he was hitting irons against Adam Sandler .
That , folks , is called longevity .
In case you ’d like to see more of Shooter ’s work , may we suggest American Pie Beta House where he plays Mr. Stifler .
Or if you ’d like to go back a little further into the Shooter library , 2006 ’s classic American Pie The Naked Mile might be more to your liking where he also plays Mr. Stifler .
You get the idea .
Shooter ’s life is better than yours .
TED supplies its speakers with strict guidelines .
“ Start strong ” is the most obvious one , and there is virtually no throat clearing or contrived thanking .
Instead , speakers blaze onto the stage like stand - up comics , hellbent on room domination .
Some consult notes and stay close by their audiovisual equipment — PowerPoint is used for emphasis , but it never directs the talks — while others pace , spread their arms wide and take up space .
No one apologizes for himself .
No one fails to make jokes .
The appreciative room roars at humor , when they ’re not literally oohing and aahing at insight .
It ’s not easy to admit , then , that no single idea put forth in the TED talks seized me with its specifics .
The necessary fiction at TED is that matters of substance — policy , practice , code — will emerge from the talks .
But it ’s unlikely that a plan to disarm Iran or treat autism will surface ; there ’s too much razzle - dazzle for brass tacks .
What ’s really on display is much more right brain , and that ’s what I ’ve come to be addicted to : the exposure to vigorous minds whirring as they work hard .
Right now I ’m holed up on TED.com , sampling the talks .
The TEDsters bellow their ideas at me , and I try to brook more stimulation .
These are the people of the brain , after all , the understanders .
They have only to chant some nostrums and cast rhetorical spells and I ’m suddenly thinking some combination of It ’s all going to be all right and The heck it is — but only I can stop it !
Thanks , TED .
I ’m clearly inspired out of my mind .

神待ちサイト徹底比較 神待ちサイト比較 神待ち総合ランキング 会員数や出会い易さ等の項目を完全数値化 神待ちサイトは、テレビでも特集が組まれたことではじめて知った方もいるでしょうが、携帯サイトなどでは、結構前から話題になっていたものでもあります。家出少女をサポートする神と家出少女の出会いサイトというのが、神待ちサイトの大まかな意味ですが、もっと平たく言えば援助交際サイトです。宿泊先や食事を与えるというのが救済のおもなものですが、最近神待ち掲示板には、「割り切り希望」といったワードも見られるようになってきたからです。
神待ちのなかには、本当に深刻な悩みを抱えている家出少女もいるのですが、大半は家出などしていない少女ばかりです。プロフィールをみると、自宅に住んでいると記載している子もいますし、家出とはほど遠い年代の女性まで、神待ちサイトを使っているので、「神待ちって。一体何か？」と混乱してしまうところもあります。でも神待ちサイトで知り合った中学生にわいせつな行為をしたことで捕まった男性もでていることから、基本的に援助犯罪を招きやすい危険性をはらんでいるサイトであることは間違いありません。
もちろん、神待ちサイトをユニークだとか新しいとかは考えておらず、非出会い系サイトのなかでも危険性の高さではいちばんと言えるものだと思います。ここでは、神待ちサイトのおもな概要や実情などを紹介するとともに、なぜ危険なのかということについても詳しく触れてみました。神待ちサイトなら簡単に出会えてラクかもと安易に考えている方がいたら、今一度、この特殊な非出会い系サイトの危険性や犯罪性に気付いていただければと思います。

Mandatory service equals involuntary servitude , equals slavery .
It seems the Democrats are determined to turn the American people into slaves of the government .
Bill HR - 1388 would have created a commission to study mandatory service for all Americans .
That language was removed from the bill before it passed , perhaps because of public anger over it .
But now a new bill , H.R. - 1444 , has been introduced which contains essentially the same language .
This bill , the Congressional Commission on Civic Service
Act would create a commission to study ;
“ Whether a workable , fair , and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed , and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the Nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic , ethnic , and educational backgrounds . ”
Mandatory service is a recurring theme among the Democrats .
In the 110th congress Charles Rangel introduced the Universal National Service Act H.R.-393 .
That bill would have required all persons in the United States between the ages of 18 and 42 to perform national service , either as a member of the uniformed services or in civilian service for a period of two years .
During the 2004 presidential campaign John Kerry said .
“ For America now , service is not just an option , but an obligation of citizenship . ” [ link edited for length ]
Rahm Emanuel , the President 's Chief of Staff has also called for mandatory national service .[ link edited for length ]
Mandatory service is the same thing as involuntary servitude and slavery , and is prohibited by the 13th amendment .
The fact that government would be the slave master does not make it legal .
One has to wonder why the Democrats seem so determined to bring this about .
We also have to ask ourselves what kind of place we want America to be .
Do we want America to remain the “ Land of the Free ” , or do we want America to be a land where the people are slaves of the government ?

Premium music videos will not be accessible to UK YouTube users Online music service Last.fm has waded into the row between YouTube and the Performing Right Society .
Founder Martin Stiksel said he hoped a resolution could be found to avoid illegal services from taking over .
He urged both parties to find a " workable solution , which he hoped would include cheaper and " less complicated " licences .
YouTube is removing all premium music videos to UK users after failing to reach agreement with the PRS .
Thousands of videos were made unavailable to YouTube users from late on 9 March .
Mr Stiksel told the BBC : " It has been a bold decision for Google but we are all working in a very competitive environment and the fees need to reflect that .
This action has been taken without any consultation with PRS for Music and in the middle of negotiations between the two parties
PRS statement " It is a fundamental problem that we have been facing in that online music licensing is getting more complicated and more expensive , " he said .
He wants to see online payment for music rights reflecting the model used by terrestial radio .
" We pay each time one users listens to a song or watches a clip and , while that is more accurate because it makes sure the more popular songs get paid more , it is also very expensive , " he said .
" Terrestial radio pays a fixed minimum and that works out a lot cheaper , " he added .
" We have to find commercially workable rates otherwise illegal services will win and take over , " he said .
Pricing content Consumers must be scratching their heads in amazement at such obstacles to delivering legal content in a timely and straightforward fashion .

The row between PRS and YouTube has attracted high profile attention .
Lord Carter , the UK's Minister for Communications , Technology and Broadcasting , has also commented on the row .
Giving evidence before the Business Select Committee the minister said he suspected a degree of " commercial posturing on the part of both parties " but said the row was indicative of a wider issue .
" It is an example of the question of how do you price and fund content in the digital world , " he said .
" We have had decades of content being funded in one way - via the licence fee and advertising - and that model is changing at a rapid speed , " he told MPs .
YouTube 's director of video partnerships Patrick Walker told BBC News the PRS was seeking a rise in fees " many , many factors " higher than the previous agreement .
He said : " We feel we are so far apart that we have to remove content while we continue to negotiate with the PRS . "
" We are making the message public because it will be noticeable to users on the site . "
YouTube pays a licence fee to the PRS which covers the streaming of music videos from three of the four major music labels and many independent labels .
Stream online
While deals with individual record labels cover the use of the visual element and sound recording in a music video , firms that want to stream online also have to have a separate deal with music publishers which covers the music and lyrics .
In the UK , the PRS acts as a collecting society on behalf of member publishers for licensing fees relating to use of music .
It said of the decision : " This action has been taken without any consultation with PRS for music and in the middle of negotiations . "
" Google has told us they are taking this step because they wish to pay significantly less than at present to the writers of the music on which their services relies , despite the massive increase in YouTube viewing . "
YouTube is the world 's most popular online video site but has been under increased pressure to generate more revenue since its purchase by Google for $ 1.65 bn in 2006 .
Services such as Pandora.com , MySpace UK and Imeem have also had issues securing licence deals in the UK in the past 12 months .

CHARDON–A woman has pleaded guilty to reckless homicide for exercising her 73 - year - old husband to death in a swimming pool , repeatedly refusing to let him leave the water .
Surveillance video showed Christine Newton - John , 41 , pulling James Mason around the pool by his arms and legs , said Middlefield police Chief Joseph Stehlik
The chief said he counted 43 times in which Newton - John prevented her husband from leaving the water , and Mason rested his head on the side of the pool several times while gasping for breath .
" The video is bone - chilling , " Stehlik said .
" The whole case is very sinister . ''
Mason had a heart attack on June 2 after the extended swim session .
An officer who had investigated previous complaints that Mason was being abused pursued the case because he suspected there was more to the death , Stehlik said .
Newton - John pleaded guilty Thursday and faces up to five years in prison .
No sentencing date was set .
Police did not immediately respond to a call Saturday seeking comment on a motive .
The video would have had a profound effect on a jury , Geauga County Prosecutor David Joyce said .
But that would n't have been enough for a conviction if Newton - John had been charged with murder .
" You can see the man struggling for his life on the tape , but there is no audio , so we could n't hear what he was saying , " he said .
Geauga County Chief Public Defender Robert Umholtz , who represented Newton - John , declined to comment .
Mason was a longtime friend of his wife 's family .
He knew her as John Vallandingham before she had gender reassignment surgery in 1993 and changed her name in honor of the singer and star of the hit movie version of the musical " Grease . ''
The couple were wed in 2006 in Kentucky , where people can change their gender on their birth certificate .
Ilkae are Aaron Munson and Krystian Lubiszewski , representing Canada and Poland respectively .
Their music could be described as a mixture of classic video game soundtracks , hip hop , and experimental electronica .
Munson has been the sole active member of the group since 2003 .
when Lubiszewski decided to take a prolonged hiatus from writing music to focus on his academic career .
Ilkae remains an active musical project , continuing beyond the closure of merck records in 2007 .
Since then , Munson 's work has largely been published on the Eerik Inpuj Sound netlabel .

“ The Counter - Counterinsurgency Manual ” : New Book on Anthropology , Militarization , and the Human Terrain System
I am very happy to report that the second of three new volumes about the human terrain system to be published this year has just been released for pre-order .
It is The Counter - Counterinsurgency Manual , by the Network of Concerned Anthropologists .
It features contributions by Catherine Besteman , Andrew Bickford , Greg Feldman , Roberto J. González , Hugh Gusterson , Kanhong Lin , Catherine Lutz , David Price , and David Vine .
It will be released in April of this year .
This is the publisher ’s description :
At a moment when the U.S. military decided it needed cultural expertise as much as smart bombs to prevail in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Pentagon ’s Counterinsurgency Field Manual offered a blueprint for mobilizing anthropologists for war .
The Counter - Counterinsurgency Manual critiques that strategy and offers a blueprint for resistance .
Written by the founders of the Network of Concerned Anthropologists , the Counter - Counterinsurgency Manual explores the ethical and intellectual conflicts of the Pentagon ’s Human Terrain System ; argues that there are flaws in the Counterinsurgency Field Manual ( ranging from plagiarism to a misunderstanding of anthropology ) ; probes the increasing militarization of academic knowledge since World War II ; identifies the next frontiers for the Pentagon ’s culture warriors ; and suggests strategies for resisting the deformation and exploitation of anthropological knowledge by the military .
This is compulsory reading for anyone concerned that the human sciences are losing their way in an age of empire .

( CNN ) -- Super Bowl fans in Tucson , Arizona , caught a different kind of show during Sunday 's big game .
Just as Cardinals ' superstar Larry Fitzgerald watched himself sprint into the end zone on the stadium 's Jumbotron during Sunday 's Super Bowl , 10 seconds of eye - popping pornographic imagery " flashed " across the screens of those watching at home .
" We are mortified by last evening 's Super Bowl interruption , and deeply apologize to our customers for the inappropriate programming , " Comcast Cable said in a written statement .
" Our initial investigation suggests this was an isolated malicious act , " the statement added .
Comcast , and several local television stations that carried the signal , say they are currently investigating what caused the interruption .
" It appears this material was only viewed by some Comcast customers , " local Tucson television station KVOA - TV said in a written statement .
Television station KVOA added " when the NBC feed of the Super Bowl was transmitted from KVOA to local cable providers and through over - the - air antennas , there was no pornographic material , " KVOA President and General Manager Gary Nielsen said in a separate statement .

Alan Moore ’s Watchmen was largely considered to be the “ holy grail ” of graphic novels , the treasured masterpiece of superhero storytelling that was in a class all by itself .
At full disclosure , while I am an avid reader of graphic novels , I grew out of reading superhero comics when I was about 12 years old .
I grew out of superhero comics because , frankly , superheroes are extraordinarily lame .
While I ’m sure there is the occasional well - written superhero graphic novel ( i.e. Frank Miller ’s The Dark Knight Returns ) , but you just ca n’t make me care about muscle - bound men in rubber - tights with supernatural abilities fighting monsters – that is except for Watchmen .
There is a reason Watchmen was so good , and it is this very reason which I feel director Zack Snyder completely missed when making his film adaptation .
Watchmen is certainly not a bad movie , but it is far from a great movie .
This is the point : Watchmen the graphic novel was revolutionary and amazing because it was satirizing the superhero genre .
Snyder ’s film becomes exactly what Alan Moore set out to satirize .
Snyder does try desperately to stay faithful to the graphic novel ( for which he can be applauded ) , and there are moments in the film that work very well .
However , the film would have greatly benefited from being about a million times more subtle stylistically .
Snyder began his career making flashy car commercials before venturing into feature films – and it shows .
As soon I saw the murder of the Comedian in the opening scene , I knew Snyder had blown it .
The fight - scenes in the film are choreographed within an inch of their lives , and the sound - effects added seem like something straight out of a cartoon .
Yes , they may have been ultra-violent , but nowhere even close to realistic .
You practically expect to see the “ Zap ! ” and “ Pow ! ” graphics from the old Batman television show to appear on screen during these sequences .
And while Snyder does use the layout of the comic panels to set up most of his shots , he fills the scenes with so many slow - motion segments and also zooms and pans and dollies the camera into a dizzying style which screams “ you must know that this movie is fucking cool ! ”
Well , it was n’t supposed to be cool in that way .
Remember , Watchmen the graphic novel came out in the mid 80’s , and at the time , superheroes were still a medium of storytelling largely directed at children .
What Alan Moore set out to accomplish was to write an ultra-realistic , gritty take on superheroes aimed squarely at adults .
He was mocking the genre by saying , “ all of this superhero stuff is so cheesy and lame , I ’m going to write a story that actually attempts to demonstrate what the world would really be like if superheroes existed . ”
The world Alan Moore created was one where superheroes were psychopaths or neurotic - depressives – because to be something as absurd as a superhero , you would have to be fucking nuts .
In Moore ’s world , superheroes did more harm than good .
Even the very concept of Dr. Manhattan is a complete satire of how the superhero comic craze came out of the atomic - age .
I mean come on – a nuclear researcher gets locked in a test chamber and develops superpowers ?
Moore was mocking the absurdity of the concept , but at the same time making it as realistic as possible .
The closest example of art I can think of which employs a similar satirical style as the graphic novel is Clint Eastwood ’s Unforgiven .
Keep in mind , satire does not automatically equal funny .
Satire will take some truth and heighten it to the absurd or the extreme .
When taken to the absurd you get Stephen Colbert satirizing Bill O’Reilly with The Colbert Report ; when taken to the extreme you get Oliver Stone satirizing America ’s violence - and - celebrity - obsessed culture with Natural Born Killers .
Unforgiven is in many ways a satire of the western genre by being an ultra-realistic or extreme version of it .
But extreme does not have to mean flashy and extravagant .
In my opinion Snyder should have employed a cold , calculated , objective and even somewhat distant style to Watchmen .
Stylistically it should have been more similar to Unforgiven or the wonderful film from last year Let the Right One In , which was pretty much a satire on the vampire genre by being an extreme or realistic version of it .
And the violence should have been gritty and ultra realistic , not over - choreographed with cartoony sound - effects .
The movie should have felt more film - noir and less X - Men .
And by missing this point , Snyder misunderstands Watchmen , and will also force others unfamiliar with the graphic novel to forever misunderstand Watchmen .
Also , most of the casting was pretty bad .
Jackie Earle Haley was pretty good as Rorschach , though the voice seemed pretty forced at times .
Patrick Wilson was almost perfect as Nite Owl .
And Jeffrey Dean Morgan was damn - near flawless as the Comedian .
Everyone else pretty much sucked .
I ’ve never been a big fan of Billy Crudup .
I thought he was awful in the awful movie Big Fish .
I appreciated the gentleness he brought to Dr. Manhanttan , but his voice sounded like Dr. Manhattan had just reached puberty which was very off - putting .
Mathew Goode was far too young and small - framed for Ozymandias , and he could n’t keep a consistent American accent .
And both Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter and Carla Gugino as Sally Jupiter were appallingly bad .
Granted , some of the scenes worked very well , and the opening credit sequence was amazing ( by far the highlight of the film ) .
But overall , seeing Watchmen on the big screen just felt so damn cheesy .
Snyder understood that Watchmen was superheroes for adults , but he made it feel like it was for teenage boys .
And as a result , the film became what Moore was satirizing .
Nice try , Snyder … but you missed it .

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is testifying before the House Financial Services Committee today .
UPDATE : Here is the CNBC feed ( opens in new window ) .
From Gregg Robb at MarketWatch : Bernanke tells Congress
Fed knows what it is doing
" We 're not making it up , " Bernanke told the House Financial Services panel .
" We 're working along a program that has been applied in various contexts , " he said .
" We 're not completely in the dark . "
I 'm not making this up .
In retail , divas are fired or soon quit .
In journalism , I ’ve had managers who routinely shrieked abuse .
In retail , I ’m managed by a man who served in the United States Air Force in Mogadishu and who wears his authority comfortably and rarely raises his voice .
Even the most senior regional and national managers in my company who visit a few times a year know my name , say hello and listen to sales associates with respect .
I never expected that .
In journalism , all too often perception helps people get ahead .
One editor ’s star performer is another ’s nightmare .
In retail , numbers win .
I ’ve become one of my store ’s top salespeople , and , for the first time in 30 years of professional life , I know my clear value to my employer .
Our individual sales are posted on a wall for everyone to see .
I like that clarity .
Social capital means nothing here .
Our retail sales floor is the levelest playing field I ’ve yet seen .
It comes at a price .
I enjoy this job , grateful to the company that took a chance on me .
But I ca n’t afford to do it full time .
Only using my other skills the rest of the week allows me to meet my financial commitments and keep saving for retirement .
The hardest part ?
It ’s not scraping gum and food off the floor or standing for five straight hours .
It ’s not refolding clothing so many times the skin on my hands cracks from dehydration .
It ’s some customers ’ stunning sense of entitlement , even contempt , for those  i.e. , us  they feel certain are their inferiors .
Expecting good service is fair .
Treating hourly wage workers like personal servants is not .
When you wear a plastic name badge , few bother to read it .
We , too , are intelligent and proud of our skills ; many of us are college educated .
Some of us travel often and widely , speaking foreign languages fluently .
Our employees include nationally ranked athletes , a former professional ballet dancer and a former officer in the French Foreign Legion .
Adding Parallel Extensions to F# Monday , February 23 , 2009
In many of my presentations lately , I ’ve been using the Parallel Extensions for .NET as part of my heavy computations in F# .
By doing so , I ’m able to speed up some of my heavier computations by several fold and take full advantage of my machine .
Over time , with the help of others , I ’ve translated many of the functions from the ParallelEnumerable class into those that can easily be consumed by F# in a meaningful way .
From Seq to PSeq
Within the F# libraries , there is a thin wrapper over the IEnumerable < T > class called seq < ’a > , and associated functions in the Seq module .
The goal here is to mimic the signatures and well defined behaviors of the Seq module while wrapping the ParallelEnumerable class and its associated IParallelEnumerable < T> interface .
Just as the Seq implementation which hides the IEnumerable < T> with seq < ’a > , we ’ll hide the underlying IParallelEnumerable < ’a > with the pseq < ’ a > type .
We have some issues such as translating the F# functions to .NET delegate functions .
We must wrap each of these into the Func constructor in order to call them properly .
But other than that , it ’s a pretty smooth integration between the language and the library .
So , without further ado , here is the code :
# light
/// Type wrapper over the IParallelEnumerable
type pseq <'a > = System .
Linq . IParallelEnumerable <'a >
module PSeq =

open System .

let adaptn ( n : int ) ( seq : seq <'a > ) : pseq<'a > =

What Does the Future Hold ?
With the ease of integration here , we should wonder , how in the future F# might interact with the Parallel Extensions for .
NET .
With both F# and the Parallel Extensions for .NET becoming first class citizens , the case can be made that it should be an integral part of the F# libraries as well .
These are interesting times when it comes to concurrency oriented programming and with the combination of F# and the Parallel Extensions , we have a powerful tool in our chest for performing algorithms over big data .

Are you a big fan of the plasma flatscreen television ?
It might be harder to get your sticky hands on one in the future , with recent announcements that two of the most popular plasma TV manufacturers have decided to terminate production .
Although the plasma market has been struggling for some time , it 's hard to ignore the role played by a stagnant U.S. economy in driving down interest in tech products .
The most stunning news came earlier in the week when technology giant Pioneer announced it would bow out of the television business altogether .
To the average consumer who has in the past outfitted their home theatre and car stereo with Pioneer TVs , subwoofers , and CD players , it 's stunning to think that there 's no longer any room in the market for such a traditionally successful company .
However , analysts who 've been keeping a close eye on Pioneer 's place within the TV market are anything but surprised .
" The brand was not doing well and was not gaining traction with consumers despite their superior quality , mainly because of their higher prices , " remarked Riddhi Patel , an analyst with iSpuppli TV systems .
Big prices , big problems for Pioneer
Plasma televisions are often more expensive than their LCD brethren , and for a company with a recognizable name like Pioneer , the obligatory brand premium ( Sony and Apple are no exceptions ) became a sort - of handicap .
" They were n't selling an overwhelming amount of plasma -- period , " said market researcher Tamaryn Pratt .
( Source : twice.com )
Pioneer is n't the only company suffering from slackening interest in plasma TVs .
Newer , cheaper , but recognizable Vizio recently revealed that it too will duck out of a market currently being pounded by LCD , or Liquid Crystal Display televisions .
Patel believes the moves are all about cost .
" In the U.S. market , our consumer research findings show that consumers even in the highest income bracket are fairly price conscious . "
That being said , not even LCDs are doing particularly well right now .
Sales dipped two per cent in the last quarter of 2008 , and insiders warn that the situation is n't likely to improve in 2009 .
Surprisingly , plasma sales actually exploded over the last quarter of 2008 , up a staggering 28 per cent .
Still , demand has never really matched LCD and it seems both Pioneer and # 3 plasma manufacturer Vizio finally recognized the consumer trend .
( Source : cnet.com )
With those two out of the market , only Samsung , Panasonic , and LG Electronics continue to sell plasma televisions .
Vizio plans to concentrate on LCD technology while Pioneer will shift more of its resources towards the ( slowly ) burgeoning Blu-ray market .
Senate Judiciary Chairman says Bush officials could be prosecuted David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) said in an interview Tuesday evening that Bush Administration officials could be criminally prosecuted if they lied under oath as part of a proposed investigation into Bush - era abuses .
Leahy chose his words carefully , to be sure .
But his words went slightly farther than that of other Congressional Democrats , who maintain that probing abuses of the Bush era is critical to preserving the integrity of law .
" You 're going to have people , some people will say , let 's go ahead and prosecute everybody , " Leahy told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow Tuesday .
" That can take 10 or 15 years .
Others want to ignore everything .
I do n't agree with that . "
But , he said , the Senate could set up a " truth commission " like that established by Sen.
Frank Church in the 1970s , which was aimed at bringing out abuses of the President Richard Nixon era .
Church 's commission resulted in an array of reforms that tightened civil liberties protections after Nixon 's infamous wiretapping and Watergate scandals .
" What if a truth commission did a thorough investigation of the type you 're describing and they found that in fact horrible crimes were committed ? "
Maddow asked .
" If there would n't be prosecution , how would say -- how would we say now we know and they all legally got away with it , how would that stop these things from happening again ? "
Leahy seemed to signal a slight shift -- previously his focus seemed more on uncovering misdeeds than in prosecuting officials .
While not saying that he was planning for prosecutions , he indicated that they could certainly result .
" I think because of the fact it 's very , very public and the way they find out about it , it makes it very clear to the next person , you try the same thing , you are going to be found out , you are going to be prosecuted , " Leahy said .
" You are also going to have some people that will refuse to -- perhaps refuse to testify , even though offered immunity .
With the evidence from the others , they can be prosecuted .
And , of course , anybody can be prosecuted for perjury . "
David Carle , a spokesman for Sen .
Leahy , noted that Leahy 's commission concept was a proposal and no bill had yet been introduced .
" He wanted to begin a discussion , " Carle said .
Asked about potential prosecutions , he reiterated that immunity would still " of course " require truthful replies .
Leahy subpoenaed Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove to testify on the firing of nine US Attorneys in 2007 .
Rove never appeared .
He was subsequently called to testify twice by the House Judiciary Committee , and said recently that he would refuse to honor congressional subpoenas related to the case .
Leahy 's commission concept received a cool response from President Barack Obama in his Tuesday night press conference , though Obama admitted he had n't read it .
" It 's not a perfect way of doing it , but it may be the only way to get the truth out , " Leahy said .
" And I think that the only way you 're going to stop a future administration from being tempted to do some of the same things is if the truth comes out . "
Immunity seems to be the keystone of Leahy 's plan to extract the truth .
You " either grant enough immunity to get the truth out or you do n't get it at all , because otherwise you are just going to have constant stonewalling . "
Why would those who testified get immunity ?
" The only way they would have immunity would be if they testified and testified thoroughly , " he added .
" Because they would be asked under oath , have you given us all of the information ?
You withhold , that 's perjury and you would be prosecuted for that . "

PRINCETON , NJ -- Conservative talk - show host Rush Limbaugh is viewed favorably by 60 % of Republicans nationwide , while 23 % have an unfavorable opinion of him .
In sharp contrast , only 6 % of Democrats view Limbaugh favorably , while 63 % view him unfavorably .
Limbaugh has been much in the news recently as media outlets have played up his highly vocal opposition to President Obama in general and to Obama 's economic stimulus plan in particular .
The president himself was provoked enough by Limbaugh to bring up his name in his public comments about the stimulus plan , saying , " You ca n't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done . "
Since then , Limbaugh 's role in influencing Republican positions on public policy issues , including in particular the stimulus package , has been a topic of discussion .
Given the deliberately partisan and ideological nature of Limbaugh 's radio program , the sharp divide in views of the talk - show host by partisanship are not surprising .
Still , the data from Gallup 's Jan. 30 - Feb. 1 poll show that Republican support for Limbaugh is not monolithic .
Although a clear majority of 60 % of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Limbaugh , a not - insignificant 23 % have an unfavorable opinion .
Seventeen percent of Republicans say they have no opinion of Limbaugh either way ( either because they have n't heard of him or do n't know enough about him to say ) .
Almost a third of Democrats say they have no opinion of Limbaugh , but negative views of him among Democrats outweigh positive opinions by more than a 10 - to - 1 ratio .
Among independents , negatives outweigh positives by a 45 % to 25 % margin .
Gallup asked a similar question about Limbaugh in a slightly different context six years ago , with generally similar results .
Implications
Limbaugh is a radio personality whose continuing viability depends on maintaining high levels of listenership , which in turn depend at least in part on his ability to generate " buzz " and controversy .
So it is no surprise that Limbaugh has taken on President Obama in a provocative manner .
It 's a little more surprising , perhaps , that Obama acknowledged Limbaugh in his public remarks , thus elevating the opinions of the talk - show host to national news status .
The data from the recent Gallup Poll confirm what has been found previously and what follows from common sense , given the target audience for Limbaugh 's radio show .
He enjoys a positive image among the majority of Republicans ( although about one in four Republicans view him negatively ) , while having a much more negative image among independents and particularly among Democrats .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,027 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 30 - Feb. 1 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 289 Republicans , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±6 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 346 independents , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±6 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 376 Democrats , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±6 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

One of the key issues in the recent Pirate Bay trial was the prosecutor 's contention that the lads behind the site were raking in something like 10 million kronor ( one million dollars ) a year .
This led defendant Gottfried Svartholm
Warg to complain during a court recess : " It 's totally absurd , those numbers are totally disconnected from reality . "
And , for good measure , he took a shot at the prosecutor .
" The old bastard 's crazy , " he said .
Whatever the truth of The Pirate Bay 's profits , BitTorrent search engines can rake in quite a bit of cash .
Mininova , for instance , earned � 600,000 in revenue back in 2006 , upping this to a whopping � 1,000,000 in 2007 .
Is it profiting from piracy ?
A good business to be in
Mininova is one of the largest such sites in the world ( indeed , it claims to be the largest , with over 25 million pageviews a day ) , but that does n't mean it tries to hide its contact info or address .
It operates as a legitimate business from a canal - side office in Utrecht , which entails certain consequences .
One of these is that it is legally required to file a basic financial statement with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce each year , and these statements are available to anyone 1 ) able to navigate a Dutch - language website and 2 ) cough up � 9 .
Ars pulled Mininova 's statement from the Chamber of Commerce to see just how much cash such an operation could earn ; in 2007 , revenue was � 1,037,560 .
Mininova 's Niek van der Maas confirmed to Ars that the numbers were accurate , but noted that they do n't account for either taxes or expenses .
The money comes largely from ads on the Mininova site , but it also includes revenue from the video service Snotr.com , affiliate partnerships , and various toolbar offerings .
Even a casual glance at the site will confirm that a huge percentage of the .torrent files it hosts ( Mininova , like The Pirate Bay , does not host actual content on its own servers ) infringe copyright , but Mininova is n't quite The Pirate Bay .
While the Bay used to delight in posting — and then ridiculing — takedown requests from copyright owners , Mininova claims to comply with all such requests and has a prominent page on its website providing information on the takedown process .
According to van der Maas , this means that " website revenue has nothing to do with copyright infringement . "
This seems like a hugely debatable claim ( ad revenue from the Mininova site is not boosted at all by those using the search engine to find copyrighted content ? ) , but one sees what he means .
Google could also said to " profit from piracy " in this sense , but as the IFPI 's John Kennedy said during The Pirate Bay trial , the real issue for rights holders is whether search engines " cooperate " in some way on taking down infringing content .
Mininova does , which would seem to limit the scope for legal action against it .
And , given the company 's revenue and 2007 working capital of � 665,523 , it certainly has the resources to put up a fight if IFPI comes knocking .
SCENE 1
Animation
Once upon a time — 610 AD — a kindly monk in Aosta in the Italian Alps , decided that the good children of the town — who properly learned their prayers — deserved some kind of treat .
Unable to come up with any great ideas himself , he wandered into the monastery kitchen .
There , he spied a scrap of yeast dough that oddly resembled the folded arms of a praying child .
Back then , folks prayed with their arms crossed .
Go figure .
He sprinkled the tidbit with salt — a symbol of purity — and baked it .
The creation , which he dubbed " pretiola " or " little reward " , was a big hit .
Too bad there was only one .

These days , the pretzel is often served as a punishment for flying commercial .
Just another one of those little things that we 've decided to drop our standards on .
Luckily , there are still places in the world where the pretzel gets some respect .
Bavaria , for instance , and , of course ... FLIGHT ATTENDANT : [ on the overhead speakers ]
Ladies and Gentlemen , we 're starting our descent into Philadelphia .
So sit down , buckle up , and turn off all your electronic equipment .
NOW ! ... ha ha ha ha , the City of Brotherly Love .
You know , in terms of pretzel consumption , Philadelphians eat 12 times the national average .
And when you taste the local twist , you 'll understand why .
Heck , sometimes I go to Philly just for pretzels .
But you know , if you can't make that run , do n't despair .
With a little know - how , some sound science , and a handful of good ingredients , you can make your own perfectly ...

A Philadelphia Street GUEST : Pretzel Vendor
Although most of the great American street foods — oysters , waffles , and ice cream penny licks — are , sadly , gone , street pretzels — the big , salty , soft type — remain an icon of the great northeastern metropoli .
AB : [ to the pretzel vendor ]
One , please .
Extra salty if you have it .
Now I know that in parts of Pennsylvania , they prefer their pretzels hard and crunchy .
But to me , the soft pretzel is still the true pretzel .
The exterior is glossy , brown , and smooth .
The salt stands proud .
And the bread inside soft , yet chewy , warm , inviting .
As for the shape , it no longer reflects modern prayer posture .
But it is the perfect shape for munching on the go .
[ takes a bite ] AB : [ returns to the street vendor and opens his suitcase ]
My good man , do me a favor and , er , fill ‘er up .
Ha ha ha ha .

Set [ the set turns into a glitter - filled scene , reminiscent of a 1960 's era game show ] [ AB runs out as game show hosts of that era often did . ]
Hi , kids .
Let 's test your yeasty knowledge : Question number one : Yeast are :
a ) Bacteria
b ) Molds
c ) Fungi
d ) Just barely technically alive YEAST ARE :
A : BACTERIA
B : MOLDS
C : FUNGI
D : JUST BARELY
TECHNICALLY ALIVE
The answer , of course , is " c " .
Yeast are fun-guy , which is why they get invited to all the best parties .
Ha ha ha ha ha .
YP : [ yeast puppets groan and boo ]
Never mind .
FUNGI Question number two : Yeast 's Latin name , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , means :
a) Very small mushroom
b ) Faceless orb
c ) Sweet beer mold
d ) Stinky sock puppet
Ha ha ha .
SACCHAROMYCES
CEREVISIAE= A : VERY SMALL
MUSHROOM
B : FACELESS ORB
C : SWEET BEER MOLD
D : STINKY SOCK PUPPET
Well , although they are all very very good answers , except " d " , which is , very stupid , the correct answer is " c " .
Now if you were thrown off by that whole mold thing , remember , this critter was christened before the Greeks and the Romans knew anything , but , well , you know , wearing sheets and building roads .
C : SWEET BEER MOLD
Next question :
The process by which yeast consume sugars , and produce CO 2 and ethanol is called :
a) Tying one on
b) Pigging out
c ) Crosspollination , or
d ) Fermentation THE PROCESS BY WHICH YEAST CONSUME SUGARS AND PRODUCE CO 2 AND ETHANOL IS CALLED : A : TYING ONE ON
B : PIGGING OUT
C : CROSSPOLLINATION
D : FERMENTATION
Why , that 's right .
The answer is " d " .
Whether yeast are boosting bread or brewing beer , the process is called " fermentation " .
D : FERMENTATION
Last question :
If yeast were to star in a horror or sci - fi film , they 'd most likely play :
a ) Mummies
b ) Zombies , or
c ) Tribbles IF YEAST WERE TO STAR IN A HORROR OR SCI -FI FILM , THEY'D MOST LIKELY PLAY : A : MUMMIES
B : ZOMBIES
C : TRIBBLES
The answer : all of the above .
They start out dry as mummies , they reanimate like zombies , and then , they reproduce like those gosh darn tribbles .
So , how'd you do ?
Ah , who cares , let 's make them .
A : MUMMIES
B : ZOMBIES
C : TRIBBLES SCENE 6
The Kitchen Based on my examination of the field sample , I have decided to adapt an old bagel recipe that I feel produces a bread that is very close to a soft pretzel .
Only I 'm going to add butter — in fact , two ounces of unsalted melted butter — and more water —o ne and a half cups , in fact — heated to , eh , around , I do n't know , 115 degrees .
To that , I will add one tablespoon of sugar , two teaspoons of kosher salt , and one package worth of active dry yeast .
That 's two and a half teaspoons .
2 Ounces Unsalted Butter ,
Melted
1 ½ Cups Water
1 Tbs. Sugar
2 tsp. Kosher Salt
1 package Active - Dry Yeast Meanwhile , weigh out 22 ounces of all - purpose flour .
That 's about four and a half cups–one pound , six ounces .
There we go .
Now I 've got a tare function on my scale so I can just zero out the weight of the mixing bowl before the flour went in .
22 Ounces All - Purpose Flour Now , clamp this onto your mixer , add your water / yeast slurry , and the two ounces of melted butter .
To bring this together , we will employ " Captain Hook " .
[ refers to the dough hook ]
And we 're going to do this at low speed just until the dough comes together .
[ later ]
When the dough ball comes together thusly , boost the speed to medium for four to five minutes .
This will trigger the great cosmic intermingling of water and wheat proteins , like glutinen and gliadin , which form gluten .
Only this elastic , plastic structure has the strength to contain the gaseous exhaust soon to be emitted by our fungal friends YP : [ appears and belches ]
AB : [ tries to grab it . ]
Come here !
Well , just about the time that the old mixer crawls right off of the counter , we should be done .
The dough should be nice and smooth , and satiny like this .
See , it 's kind of almost like a matte finish .
It comes away in a ball , so we will get rid of the hook .
Give the bowl a quick spray with some no - stick , because as this rises it will get very sticky indeed .
Back in the bowl , we will cover the bowl with a tea towel ... aww , it 's pretty ... and stash this in a warm place — say , 70 degrees — for one hour .
The average American consumes 2 pounds of pretzels each year .
In Philadelphia , it 's more than 20 pounds .
SCENE 7
The Kitchen GUEST : Thing
As you can see , our dough has doubled in size , signifying that it is prepared to move on to the next phase of production .
The question : " Are we ? " A checklist is the only way to know : Oven : set to 450 degrees
Hardware : assembled .
We have : One dough cutter .
Check
We have a scale ; digital is best .
Check .
We 've got a spritz bottle .
Now yours does n't have to look like a dinosaur , but if it does , it would be cool .
I have also taken to doing this procedure with one pair of latex gloves , standard drug store issue .
Next , one ruler .
Metal .
As long as you can get .
Two tea towels , lightly moistened .
And two sheet pans , each lined with parchment , lightly lubed .
[ in an affected German accent ]
Und now ve bake !
First , we must portion our dough .
We have 36 ounces of this stuff , and we would like eight portions , so that 's ... T : [ cuts in with a calculator ] ... um – a hah , excellent – four and a half ounces each .
Now we cut .
Now , you certainly do n't have to do this with a scale .
You could simply divide your dough into eight even pieces .
But trust me , this is easier .
Now we shape .
Make sure that you have plenty of room here .
Put your ball right in front of you and squish it out with the heel of your hand until you get a little rectangle .
There .
Now roll it up , nice and tight , and make a good seam along the bottom .
There .
Now start rolling with just one hand .
The goal is to push it away with some pressure , then just roll it back lightly , and push it again .
And when it gets long enough , add the second hand .
Now if you start to see a twist form right in the very middle of the dough , you know that you do not have your hands coordinated , and that twist could become a break point .
So be watching for that .
Now our target length is 24 inches , give or take an inch or so .
There .
Now , for the basic pretzel shape , fold this end around , and this end around .
And you do n't have to press down , just barely pinch so that they join .
There .
We can move that onto the pan .
And then go ahead and cover it with a tea towel and give that a few spritzes of water [ on top of the tea towel ] , just to keep it damp .
Then repeat with the rest of the pretzels .
Oh , and I should mention that , you know , if you do n't like this particular shape of pretzel , go ahead and make a peace sign , or a pterodactyl , whatever you want .
Me , I 'll , I 'll stick with the classics .
There , now , there is but one more ingredient to consider .
[ AB is looking at various types of salt under the microscope ]
Although there is such a thing as salt - less pretzels , called " baldies " , I would suggest that they 're really not pretzels at all but rather , cruel jokes perpetrated by bitter bakers .
That said , not just any old salt will do on a pretzel .
Now here is an example of old - school pretzel salt .
It 's really nothing more than a coarse salt that 's a little bit bigger than kosher salt , which is way , way too small for the job .
New - school pretzel salt looks to be the same shape and size as the old - school stuff , but notice ; it 's wider , and it 's opaque .
That 's because it 's actually made from a bunch of tiny grains , that have been compressed into a cake , and then broken up into this shape .
I like this type of salt , because it looks nice , it crunches easily , and the saltiness moves evenly around the mouth .
It can be found in some grocery stores and all over the Internet .
I would n't dream of pretzelling without this stuff .
Application could n't be easier .
Just sprinkle it on .
It 'll stick .
Well , some of it'll stick .
Yeah , it 'll be enough .
Park these in a hotbox : 450 , for 14 minutes , and give the pans a spin seven minutes in .
[ takes the pretzels out of the oven ]
Well , they remind me of pretzels , and , uh , well , the interior seems okay .
But all the salt falls off , and I kind of miss that shiny mahogany exterior .
Gosh , what we need here is deep browning .
But we do n't want to overcook the interior to get it .
So , what are our options ?
[ an avocado drops from above ]
Well , yes , avocados brown rapidly .
But I do n't think smearing proto - guac all over them will do the trick .
[ a spray paint can flies in from the side ]
Um , yes , paint .
You chose the high - gloss .
Nice , but I think caramelization is probably where it 's at .
[ a bag of sugar flies in from the front ]
What do you mean ?
T : [ shows a lighted blow - torch ]
Well , yeah .
We could brûlé the little buggers .
But I think the sugar might be off - putting .
Hey , what if we messed with the pH ?
Of all the chemical concepts a cook must grasp in order to move up the ladder of culinary enlightenment , pH — that is , the concentration of either a positively or negatively charged hydrogen atoms in a solution †— is one of the toughest .
This is especially true for cooks like myself who went through High School where , I 'm told , this very concept is taught like this [ stares blankly off into space ] .
Luckily , we have models to fall back on .
= pH = − log 10 H +]
In 1861 , the first American pretzel factory opened in Lititz , Pennsylvania .
SCENE 8
The Kitchen GUESTS : Lawyer # 1 and # 2 [ read the transcriber 's note at the bottom : AB is incorrect about the quantity of negatively charged hydrogen atoms when he 's talking about pH .
pH is the concentration of positive ( or H 3 O + ) in a solution while pOH is the concentration of negative ( or OH — ) in a solution .
pOH is essentially the opposite of pH .
I suggest a good read of Wikipedia 's explanation of pH and pOH ]
Okay , here 's the deal with pH .
If a solution has an equal number of positively and negatively charged hydrogen atoms , it is said to be " neutral " , which means that it has a pH of 7 .
Okay , now distilled water is a very , very good example of that .
pH 7
Now as the number of positively charged atoms increases , the pH number goes down , and the solutions become more acidic .
Now most of your common kitchen ingredients fall along this end of the scale , from milk at 6 , to black coffee at 5 , orange juice 4 , most vinegars around 3 , lemon juice 2 , stomach acid 1 , and below that , well , you 're talking about battery acid , which is never good eats .
pH ↓ Acidity ↑ ph 6 milk
ph 5 coffee
ph 4 orange juice
ph 3 vinegar
ph 2 lemon juice
ph 1 [ stomach acid ]
Now on the other end of the scale , from 8 to 14 , that represents solutions higher in negatively charged hydrogen atoms [ or , as we noted above , a lower concentration of positively charged hydrogen atoms ] .
These are called " alkalis " or " bases " and there are n't really too many of them in the kitchen .
Sea water , just slightly alkaline .
Egg whites hit about 8 .
Baking soda scores a 9 .
Antacid tablets about 10 .
Ammonia , 11 to 11.5 .
Bleach somewhere around 12 .
And then we get all the way down here , to NaOH , a .k.a. lye , at 13 .
[ shows a bottle of lye , with a skull and crossbones icon ]
See the little design from the pirate flag there ?
Okay , that does n't mean Johnny Depp gets a percentage of each bottle sold .
It means that this stuff is very poisonous , okay ?
Now , as any " Fight Club " fan can tell you , it is critical in making soap .
Oops , broke the first rule , did n't I ?
Oh , well .
It 's also critical for making great pretzels .
[ grabs the bottle of lye , as he slides on a moving chair ]
Ahhhhhh !
pH 8 egg whites
pH 9 baking soda
pH 10 antacid tablets
pH 11-11.5 ammonia
pH 12 bleach
pH 13 lye Dipping our uncooked pretzels in a weak lye solution will instantly gelatinize starches on the surface of the dough and break proteins down into small peptide chains .
That will brown rapidly in the oven , creating the characteristic nutty flavor and color we want without the hardening that so often accompany the Maillard reactions .
LAWYERS # 1 & # 2 : [ appear from outside the kitchen window and next to the countertop ]
Why , look , it 's my legal team , " Itchy " and " Twitchy " .
[ sarcastically ]
AB :
You guys pass the bar yet ?
L#1 : [ hands AB a sheet of paper ]
AB : What 's this ?
You gotta be kidding me .
But lye is an integral part of processing foods like olives , hominy , soft drinks , and pretzels .
L#1 & # 2 : [ all this time , they are handing AB sheets of paper ]
AB : Well , you 've got to use , you know , the correct , you know , stuff .
You know , gloves , and goggles , and [ reading the last piece of paper ] ... RECKLESS EN ... aww , that 's too ... but the , the pretzels are going to be so good and ...
Alright , that 's it .
Fine .
No lye .
Lye 's out .
Do n't need it .
I 'll figure out something else .
You guys hurry back to the office so you can ...
BILL ME .
Ooohhhh .
Who would have thunk those guys would have a problem with a little " lye " ?
Well , what else do we have left ?
Uh , we 've got bleach : 12.5 pH . No. Ammonia ?
You know , it used to be used in baked goods and in early forms of baking powder .
But it 's just as dangerous as lye and the smell is even worse .
We could grind up antacids , but I think that might throw off the flavor .
And that leaves us with baking soda .
Well , it 's nowhere near as powerful as the lye , with , you know , a pH of 9 , but most of us do have it in the kitchen , and , well , we may be able to boost its effectiveness with a judicious application of heat .
It 's worth a try .
Now I 'm sure there are other ways to dip a pretzel , but I think this rig is pretty sweet .
Here I have 10 cups of boiling water in a wide sauté pan , to which I 've added two - thirds of a cup of baking soda .
Now I 'm just kind of bathing the pretzels , two at a time .
Lifting them out and dropping them in with a slightly altered splatter screen .
You could use a spatula or a spider , whatever you happen to have .
I 'm just going to scoop those out while they 're still nice and warm and get on the next load .
10 Cups Boiling Water
⅔ Cup Baking Soda
I am figuring that 30 seconds should be the perfect amount of exposure for the alkali to do its job .
And , of course , the hot water is also going to go to work gelatinizing the starches on the outside .
This is , by the way , the exact , precise method for making bagels .
And I figure that 's a good thing .
Of course , these are never going to be as golden brown and delicious on the outside as the lye - dipped versions .
But ... wait ... um , hold that thought .
Many is the pastry item that has received an extra dash of color from eggs .
One egg yolk , thinned with a tablespoon of water should provide enough wash for our entire batch .
1 Egg Yolk +
1 Tbs. Water
The other nice thing about the egg wash is it will definitely help that salt to stay in place .
These now go into the oven ; same pretzel time , same pretzel temperature .
In 2002 , the leader of the free world passed out while choking on a pretzel .
SCENE 9
The Kitchen Um , um , that is a good pretzel , and it's a nutritious part of this traditional Bavarian breakfast , along with sausage and ... plenty of beer L # 1 , # 2 and AB : [ the lawyers are now dressed in lederhosen , all raise their beer steins ]
Heh heh heh heh .
Of course , I do realize that some of you may like your pretzels on the thin , hard side .
That 's cool .
Just make the exact same dough .
But this time , leave out the butter , boost the water to one and three - quarters cups .
Now when the dough comes together , section it into 36 one - ounce hunks , roll it out very thin ; 14 to 15 inches .
Then give them a dunk in just plain , boiling water , put them on prepped pans — it 'll take about four — and into the oven for , eh , somewhere about 55 minutes .
1 ¾ Cups Water
Me , well , I like mine big , soft , and with plenty of mustard .
Heh heh heh [ reaches for a spoon inside a mustard jar , and finds that it is empty ] AB : [ to the lawyers ]
Hey , you sleaze !
Fine , I 'll make my own .
[ now at the cupboard ]
The mustard plant is related to Brussels sprouts , broccoli , and cabbage .
And like most members of that clan , contains some highly volatile phytochemicals , which are concentrated in the seeds .
Crush these in the presence of water and isothiocyanates are released , and that creates a very special kind of heat .
Now , what 's really cool about this reaction is that it can be controlled .
You see , once the seeds are ground , mixed with water , the heat begins to build , hitting a sinus - roasting peak after about 15 minutes , depending on the mustard .
However , this chemical reaction can be shut down at any point along this line by the introduction of an acid , like vinegar .
And that 's a good thing , because the flavor of the mustard peaks during this time as well .
| ! H | ⁄!` E | / !
` A | / !
` T | ⁄ !
\ _|_|_|_|_|_|_ 5 10 15 20 25 30 TIME
So , to make our own mustard , we will require a quarter of a cup of mustard seeds .
Light ones are not nearly as hot as the dark ones .
The rest of the dry team will include , well , a quarter of a cup of dry mustard to help round out the flavor , two teaspoons of light brown sugar , a teaspoon of kosher salt , half a teaspoon of turmeric , a quarter teaspoon of paprika , and one - quarter teaspoon of garlic powder .
¼ Cup Mustard Seed
¼ Cup Dry Mustard Powder
2 tsp. Light Brown Sugar +
½ tsp. Turmeric +
¼ [ tsp. ]
Paprika +
¼ tsp. Garlic Powder Next up , go ahead and grind up those mustard seeds in your favorite spice grinder , and then add that to the rest of the dry ingredients .
Give them a stir and then add a quarter cup of H 2 O , and a half cup each of cider vinegar and sweet pickle juice , straight from the pickle jar .
Stir to combine , and zap on high in your microwave for one minute .
This will heat the mixture just enough to hydrate the solids .
¼ Cup Water +
½ Cup Cider Vinegar +
½ Cup Sweet Pickle Juice
Now since the water and the acid went in at the same time , the heat level will be frozen at its lowest setting .
You could play around with mixing in the water first .
But unless you 've got steel sinuses , you want to be very careful .
The same substances in there were responsible for the first modern chemical weapon , mustard gas .
Once it 's good and hot , put your stick blender to it .
If you do n't have one of these , you could always use a food processor .
There , nice and thick , and it'll thicken even more as it cools down .
Might as well have a taste now .

You know , in the overall scheme of things , being able to make your own delicious soft pretzels may not be a big deal , but , if we raise such expectations back to their rightful place , perhaps , just maybe , we will demand that other facets of modern life follow suit .

PASSENGER # 2 : You call these headphones ?

Heh heh heh heh .
See you next time , on Good Eats .
Everything is being stress - tested in this crisis .
Europe , too .
The weak points in the way the European Union has been put together , politically and economically , over the 20 years since the world changed in 1989 , are all showing up .
As we saw with the investment banks last autumn , if one bulkhead bursts , others are likely to follow .
Start with the eurozone .
To those that have it , the euro has been a source of stability and strength in this storm .
Aspirants to membership of the eurozone , like Poland , pray that they were already members .
Even in Britain , a discussion has revived about whether or not we would be better off with the euro .
Yet at the same time , the stresses between different members of the eurozone are becoming acute .
They go back to its original design .
Asked for the first lesson he draws from Japan 's decade of stagnation , a leading Japanese analyst says : you need the closest possible co-ordination between your monetary and your fiscal authority .
The eurozone has one monetary authority but 16 different national fiscal authorities .
They are , in practice , only loosely bound by a growth and stability pact , while subject to intense domestic political pressures - for democratic politics in Europe are still almost entirely national .
This has consequences .
So , for example , because eurozone governments have behaved differently over the years , their bonds have been valued somewhat differently in the markets .
In times of crisis , these tensions increase .
Safety first , says the investor .
So even if the Greek government offers me a better return for lending it money , I may prefer to lend to the German government .
The more investors think that way , the greater the difference grows .
In the end , something has to give .
One way out of this , recently advocated by George Soros and others , is to create a single eurozone government bond .
Since that would include weaker and riskier governments , Germany would have to pay slightly more to borrow the money it needs through such a bond .
Now imagine how that will play with German voters .
What , as Germany plunges into recession , we , the German taxpayers , must pay to save Greeks or Italians from the consequences of their own fiscal irresponsibility ?
Unerhört !
Unmöglich !
So the politicians who have to make this decision would pay the price in the European elections this summer and the federal election this autumn .
For them , there are no votes in Greek or Italian gratitude .
In short , because we have a monetary union but not a political one , decisions that put the long - term European interest before the short - term national interest are at once more needed and less rewarded .
Even more dramatic is the predicament of the east central European countries that joined the EU over the last decade but are not yet ( with the exception of Slovakia and Slovenia ) in the eurozone .
In recent weeks , the tempest has hit them with a vengeance .
Far from finding safety through being aboard the good ship EU , their close financial relationship with western Europe has become part of their problem .
Twenty years ago , after the velvet end of communism in 1989 , they set out to build capitalism without capital .
Therefore they opened up liberally to western investment .
Most of their bigger banks now have western owners or majority shareholders .
Hit by a financial crisis whose origins did not lie in east central Europe , those western owners pulled in their horns .
Their core business and home markets came first , while east central Europe fell victim to a blanket warning against " risky emerging markets " .
Western loans dried up .
And as east central European currencies fell , these countries were left struggling to pay the interest on existing loans denominated in western currencies .
This is not just a problem for governments and companies .
Quite a few middle - class Polish families , for example , have taken out new home loans denominated in Swiss francs .
When the value of the Polish zloty collapsed , their interest payments almost doubled overnight .
Of course different countries have fared differently .
Hungary and Latvia have already had to go cap in hand to the IMF .
The rating agency Standard & Poor 's has just cut Latvia 's credit rating to junk status , where it joins Romania .
What they all have in common is a sense of desperation and injustice .
At a panel discussion in Vienna last weekend , I heard the leader of Hungary 's main opposition party , Viktor Orban , complain of " financial protectionism " on the part of the west .
That is mild language compared with the populist , anti-western and anti-liberal rhetoric that will flow if this continues .
More dramatic still is the plight of countries not yet in the EU : the third circle , so to speak , of Europe 's current hell .
Even before the financial crisis hit , the EU 's magnetic power was visibly fading in places like Turkey , Ukraine and Bosnia .
Now even more so .
Ukraine is a mess .
There are alarming reports that Bosnia is sliding backwards , with the Bosnian Serb leader stirring the old devils of ethnic separation .
I do not say that the fissiparous tendencies will inevitably triumph in any of the three circles .
I do say that the future of the whole European project , as we have known it since the late 1940s , and particularly since 1989 , is now at issue .
The forces of integration and disintegration , of European solidarity and national egoism , the centripetal and the centrifugal , are finely balanced .
There are a few signs of Europe getting its act together , such as last weekend 's Berlin summit and yesterday 's announcement of proposals for a Europe - wide financial supervisory framework .
Optimists will argue that crises have been the catalysts of European integration throughout its history .
It is clear is that we can not stay where we are .
If we do n't go forwards we will go backwards .
Forwards not , I emphasise , to some idealised United States of Europe , but to a practical construction strong enough to weather the storm .
Whether we achieve that will depend on three things : global forces beyond our control , the quality of European leaders , and the space and trust they are afforded by their national electorates .
Earlier this week I visited Jean Monnet 's touchingly modest home in the countryside south - west of Paris .
It contains reminders of even more dramatic times , including a copy of the 1940 proclamation of a Franco - British Union and an old typewriter on which was drafted one of the original proposals for what became the Schuman declaration - which led to the European Coal and Steel Community , which led to the European Economic Community , which eventually became the European Union .
Europe , Schuman famously declared , " will not be made all at once or according to a single plan .
It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity . "
Monnet himself liked to quote a saying that there are two kinds of people : those who want to be someone and those who want to do something .
Yet even if today 's European leaders prove themselves to be of the latter sort , in democracies they can only do as much as we , their national publics and voters , let them do .
Whether I look at Britain or Poland , France or Germany , Latvia or Austria , I do not , today , think we will let them do enough .

Baron said :
I finished up the rewiring of my first Hori Wii stick .
I modded this stick about 2 months ago - it was my first stick mod and I was happy with it at the time , but after doing a second one , my skills had progressed so much that the first looked positively amateurish , so I decided to re-do it .
Also , I was bored .
It 's not completely finished yet , as you can see , I am going to put green Sanwa button plungers in the white button " rims " , but all shops have stopped taking orders for now and it has to be put on hold until they accept them again .
-_-
I need to place a quartet of rubber feet - stoppers on the bottom plate , the screw heads protrude and will scratch whatever surface it is set upon .
Not a big deal , as I use these smaller Hori sticks as lap sticks , but all the same it will be done .
I also need to place some plastic washers in between the plate and the screw posts .
That will be done this weekend .
I cut and installed a new piece of lami - flex plexiglass to fit on the bottom in place of the original metal plate to both show off the wiring work and also to solve the problem of the PCB shorting out against the plate .
This took forever .
If you do n't have the patience and all you have is a dremel tool like me , do n't bother , it literally took 2 hours of sanding to get it where it fit properly .

The ant is capable of forming supercolonies , pushing out native species A recently discovered ant species may soon be colonising parks and gardens across northern Europe , including the UK , scientists suggest .
The ant , Lasius neglectus , was identified only 20 years ago after establishing a colony in Budapest .
Writing in the journal PLoS One , scientists say the species probably originated in west Asia .
A garden infested with them can contain between 10 and 100 times more ants than if it bears native European varieties .
" When I saw this ant for the first time , I simply could not believe there could be so many garden ants in the same lawn , " said Professor Jacobus Boomsma from the University of Copenhagen , who oversaw the research .
A number of them have become invasive pests with giant supercolonies
Dr Sylvia Cremer
Although superficially similar in appearance to the common black garden ant , the invasive species is very different in its behaviour , and particularly in the social structure within colonies .
This , the researchers believe , is key to understanding why it can invade parks and gardens and exterminate varieties that previously held sway .
The ants have probably been transported across Europe in soil used to grow pot plants .
Colonies now exist in France , Germany , Poland and Belgium .
Although it is thought to have west Asian origins , its " home patch " has never been found .
Into the cold Species of ants and other social insects differ in the way mates are selected and in what happens to new queens .
In Lasius neglectus , queens mate within the existing colony rather than leaving and establishing a new one .
Over time , this probably carries an evolutionary cost as it limits the mixing of different genetic variants .
However , for an invasive species it is a highly advantageous trait .
A queen leaving a colony that had been transported to new pastures would find no mates .
But if she can mate with other males from the same colony , it can just expand , with the ever - growing number of ants burrowing through soil and building new nests connected to the old one , until the entire area is populated with one " supercolony " .
" It is now becoming clear that rather many ant species share this lifestyle , so it is no surprise that a number of them have become invasive pests with giant supercolonies based on the same principles , " said lead scientist Dr Sylvia Cremer , who now works at the University of Regensburg in Germany .
Other invasive ant species include the Argentine ant .
Having come to Europe about 1900 , by 2002 it had established what was effectively a single supercolony along thousands of kilometres of coast , from northwestern Italy round southern France and the Iberian peninsula to the northern coast of Spain .
Northern Europe has escaped its attention so far ; but researchers believe the invasive garden ant is sure to establish itself further in the region , with the UK unlikely to find itself exempt .

Reflections on a complaint from a frustrated git user
Last week , Scott James Remnant posted a series of “ Git Sucks ” on his blog , starting with this one here , with follow up entries here and here .
His problem ?
To quote Scott , “ I want to put a branch I have somewhere so somebody else can get it .
That ’s the whole point of distributed revision - control , collaboration . ”
He thought this was a “ mind - numbingly trivial ” operation , and was frustrated when it was n’t a one - line command in git .
Part of the problem here is that for most git workflows , most people do n’t actually use “ git push ” .
That ’s why it ’s not covered in the git tutorial ( this was a point of frustration for Scott ) .
In fact , in most large projects , the number of people need to use the “ scm push ” command is a very small percentage of the developer population , just as very few developers have commit privileges and are allowed to use the “ svn commit ” command in a project using Subversion .
When you have a centralized repository , only the privileged few will given commit privileges , for obvious security and quality control reasons .
Ah , but in a distributed SCM world , things are more democratic — anyone can have their own repository , and so everyone can type the commands “ git commit ” or “ bzr commit ” .
While this is true , the number of people who need to be able to publish their own branch is small .
After all , the overhead in setting up your own server just so people can “ pull ” changes from you is quite large ; and if you are just getting started , and only need to submit one or two patches , or even a large series of patches , e-mail is a far more convenient route .
This is especially true in the early days of git ’s development , before web sites such as git.or.cz , github , and gitorious made it much easier for people to publish their own git repository .
Even for a large series of changes , tools such as “ git format - patch ” and “ git send - email ” are very convenient for sending a patch series , and on the receiving side , the maintainer can use “ git am ” to apply a patch series sent via e-mail .
It turns out that from a maintainer ’s point of view , reviewing patches via e-mail is often much more convenient .
Especially for developers who are just starting out with submitting patches to a project , it ’s rare that a patch is of sufficiently high quality that it can be applied directly into the repository without needing fixups of one kind or another .
The patch might not have the right coding style compared to the surrounding code , or it might be fundamentally buggy because the patch submitter did n’t understand the code completely .
Indeed , more often than not , when someone submits a patch to me , it is more useful for indicating the location of the bug more than anything else , and I often have to completely rewrite the patch before it enters into the e2fsprogs mainline repository .
Given that , publishing a patch that will require modification in a public repository where it is ready to be pulled just does n’t make sense for many entry - level patch submitters .
E-mail is in fact less work , and more appropriate for review purposes .
It is only when a mid-level to senior developer is trusted to create high quality patches that do not need review that publishing their branch in a pull - ready form really makes sense .
And that is fairly rare , and why it is not covered in most entry - level git documentation and tutorials .
Unfortunately , many people expect to see the command “ scm push ” in a distributed SCM , and since “ git pull ” is a commonly used command for beginning git users , they expect that they should use “ git push ” as well — not realizing that in a distributed SCM , “ push ” and “ pull ” are not symmetric operations .
Therefore , while most git users wo n’t need to use “ git push ” , git tutorials and other web pages which are attempting to introduce git to new users probably do need to do a better job explaining why most beginning participants in a project probably do n’t need their own publically accessible repository that other people can pull from , and which they can push changes for publication .
There is one exception to this , of course , and this is a developer who wants to get started using git for a new project which he or she is starting and is the author / maintainer , or someone who is interested in converting their project to git .
And this is where bzr has an advantage over git , in that bzr is primarily funded by Canonical , which has a strong interest in pushing an on - line web service , Launchpad .
This makes it easier for bzr to have relatively simple recipes for sharing a bzr repository , since the user does n’t need to have access to a server with a public IP address , or need to set up a web or bzr server ; they can simply take advantage of Launchpad .
Of course , there are web sites which make it easy for people to publish their git repositories ; earlier , I had mentioned git.or.cz , github , and gitorious .
Currently , the git documentation and tutorials do n’t mention them since they are n’t formally affiliated with the git project ( although they are used by many git users and developers and the maintainers of these sites have contributed a large amount of code and documentation to git ) .
This should change , I think .
Scott ’s frustrations which kicked off his “ git sucks ” complaints would have been solved if the Git tutorial recommended that the easist ways for someone to publicly publish their repository is via one of these public web sites ( although people who want to set up their own server certainly free to do so ) .
Most of these public repositories probably wo n’t have much reason to exist , but they do n’t do much harm , and who knows ?
While most of the repositories published at github and gitoriuous will be like the hundreds of thousands of abandoned projects on Sourceforge , one or two of the new projects which someone starts experimenting on at github or gitorious could turn out to be the next Ruby on Rails or Python or Linux .
And hopefully , they will allow more developers to be able to experiment with publishing commits on their own repositories , and lessen the frustrations of people like Scott who thought they needed their own repositories ; whether or not a public repository is the best way for them to do what they need to do , at least this way they wo n’t get as frustrated about git . 🙂
Poll : Obama over Jesus ; McCain crushes Palin Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday February 20 , 2009
Print This Email This President Obama 's broad public popularity continues with Americans naming him their number one hero in a new poll .
Obama is brand new to the poll , last conducted in 2001 by Harris Interactive .
He vaulted to the No. 1 slot in front of Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King , who were ranked number two and number three respectively .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , whose popularity at times seemed to eclipse that of Sen.
John McCain during the 2008 campaign , was roundly beaten by him in the new poll .
McCain came in at No. 7 , while Palin just managed to make the American heroes list , coming in at No.21 .
The online survey of 2,634 adults was conducted by Harris from Jan. 12-19 .
Rounding out the top five were two past presidents - Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush .
Despite his ranking as the best president of all time by historians in a new survey for C - Span , Abraham Lincoln was beaten by Bush in the heroes poll , coming in at No.6 .
Bush incidentally was ranked by historians as the seventh worst president .
Coming in at No. 8 in the poll is John F. Kennedy followed by Chelsey Sullenberger ( America 's current favorite pilot ) and Mother Teresa .
Respondents to the poll named their heroes spontaneously when asked whom they admired .
Those surveyed were not shown or read a list of people to choose from , according to a press release from Harris .
The top 5 in the 2001 poll by Harris were Jesus Christ , Martin Luther King , Colin Powell , JFK and Mother Teresa .
Bush was only ranked 19th at the time the poll was conducted in July .
John McCain , did n't even make it into the top 20 in 2001 .
" When asked to name people who used to be their heroes but who they no longer consider as heroes , the people mentioned most often are Colin Powell , George W. Bush , John McCain , Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy .
In 2001 , Bill Clinton topped this list , " said Harris in their release
Interestingly , Hillary Clinton , now Secretary of State , ranks higher on the list ( No.12 ) than her husband , President Bill Clinton ( No.16 ) .
From the release : Heroes who were in the top 10 in 2001 who have fallen sharply this year include :
Colin Powell who was No.3 and is now No. 16 .
John Wayne who was No. 8 and has dropped out of the top 20 .
Michael Jordan who was number 9 and is no longer in the top 20 .
Mother Teresa who was No. 5 and is now No. 10 .

Juniper gave a few tantalizing details of advanced technology in its development pipeline at an analysts day Tuesday .
The company 's founder and chief technology officer , Pradeep Sindhu , announced a new silicon initiative from Juniper that he claimed was a quantum jump over current solutions .
Sindhu called it a network instruction set processor and it is being designed to enable highly optimized networking data flows .
The new processor set includes 4 chips built in 65 nanometer technology encompassing 1.2 billion transistors .
Sindu claimed that the new silicon would provide up to 604 Gbps of input / output ( I/O )
" It is going to revolutionize networking engines built in silicon ; we 're confident of that . "
Sindhu said .
Juniper 's rival Cisco Systems ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) in 2008 rolled out its own new silicon Quantum Flow microprocessor which contains up to 40 cores and can run 48 billion instructions per second .
Juniper ( NASDAQ : JNPR ) also took its analyst day as an opportunity to pre-announce its Status cloud computing fabric .
The new fabric is supposed to be able to provide increased scalability for converged physical and virtual data center environments .
" Stratus will augment Juniper 's portfolio and will offer more flexibility and choices to our customers , " said Juniper executive vice president David Yen .
But Yen was unable to provide much in the way of granular details on what Stratus will actually entail or when it will be available .
" We are not prepared today for competitive reasons to disclose details on the project regarding specific milestones , product configuration , pricing or availability , " Yen said .
Yen noted that the reason why Juniper was disclosing that Stratus is under development is to demonstrate to customers and the market that Juniper is a long term strategic vendor .
Juniper 's Switch Pays Off
Juniper also announced a new addition to its EX switch portfolio with the EX25000 10 Gigabit Ethernet ( GbE ) switch .
Juniper entered the switch market in 2008 after not participating in the market for the previous 12 years of its existence .
The move into switches is something that company CEO Kevin Johnson said is paying off for Juniper .
He noted that the introduction of the EX has enabled Juniper to sell more broadly .
Johnson said that over 50 percent of the customers ordering Juniper switches were also buying other Juniper equipment with it .
Additionally Johnson said that between 30 and 40 percent of customers buying EX switching gear were new customers for Juniper .
" The portfolio and the depth of solutions that we have is coming to life , " Johnson said .
" It 's transitioning from more of a product focus to a solution focus . "

A recession is typically a good time for graduate schools .
Their application pool goes up because people see them as safe shelter from the storm .
The scariest part of a down economy is the idea of having no income .
Of course , graduate school does not solve for that .
But graduate school does solve the second most scary thing about a bad economy : lack of a learning curve .
The more desperate you are for a job , the more likely you are to take a job that does n’t teach you what you want to learn .
And then you get to that job and you think , “ Grad school could solve this problem . ”
But in fact , grad school creates larger , and more insurmountable problems .
And some the problems you ’re trying to solve with grad school might not be problems at all .
1. Grad school pointlessly delays adulthood .
The best thing you can do for yourself is take time to figure out who you are and where you fit in the world .
No one teaches you that in school .
You need to do it yourself .
Grad school is a way to delay this process , rather than move you forward , according to Thomas Benton of the Chronicle of Higher Education .
So instead of dodging tough questions by going back to school , try being lost .
It ’s normal , and honest , and you will end up with more self - knowledge and less debt than your grad - school counterparts , and in many cases , you will be similarly qualified for your next big job .
2. PhD programs are pyramid schemes
It ’s very hard to get a job teaching at a university .
And if you are not going to teach , why are you getting a degree ?
You do n’t need a piece of paper to show that you are learning .
Go read books after work .
Because look :
In the arts , you would have a better chance of surviving the Titanic than getting a tenure - track position ; and once you adjust for IQ , education , and working hours , post - PhD science jobs are among the most low - paying jobs you could get .
3 . Business school is not going to help 90 % of the people who go .
Here ’s the problem with business school .
Most people want to work for themselves , but you ca n’t learn entrepreneurship in school — you have to learn by doing .
And a business degree that is not from a top school is not going to get you very much at all , according to recruiting firm Challenger & Gray .
Finally , Harvard Business
School has acknowleged that if you are planning to downshift for kids around the time you are 30 , your ability to leverage an MBA is drastically compromised .
4 . Law school is a factory for depressives .
It used to be that if you had a law degree it was a ticket to a high salary and a safe career .
Today many people go to law school and cannot find a job .
This is , in a large part , because law school selects for people who are good with details and pass tests and law firms select for people who are good at marketing themselves and can drum up business .
Law firms are in a transition phase , and they have many unfair labor practices leftover from older generations , for example , hourly billing and making young lawyers pay dues for what is , today , a largely uncertain future .
Which might explain why the American Bar Association reports that the majority of lawyers would recommend that people not to go into law .
5 . The medical school model assumes that health care spending is not a mess .
Medical school is extremely expensive , and our health care system does not pay enough to doctors for them to sanely accept the risk of taking $ 200,000 in debt to serve as doctors .
Specialists like opthalmologists have great hours , and plastic surgeons have great salaries , but most doctors will be stuck in a system that is largely broken , and could easily break them financially — like OBGYNs who cannot afford to deliver babies in New York because they can’t afford the malpractice insurance with their salary .
6 . Going to grad school is like going into the military .
Applications to the military increase in a bad economy in a disturbingly similar way that applications to graduate school do .
For the most part , both alternatives are bad .
They limit your future in ways you ca n’t even imagine , and they are not likely to open the kind of doors you really want .
Military is the terrible escape hatch for poor kids , and grad school is the terrible escape hatch for rich kids .
7 . Most jobs are better than they seem :
You can learn from any job .
When I worked on a French chicken farm , I thought I ’d learn French , but I did n’t , because I was so foreign to the French farm family that they could n’t talk to me .
However I did learn a lot of other things , like how to bargain to get the best job in the chicken coop , and how to get out of killing the bunnies .
You do n’t need to be learning the perfect thing in your job .
You just need to be learning .
Do n’t tell yourself you need a job that gives your life meaning .
Jobs do n’t do that ; does n’t that make you feel better ?
Suddenly being in the workplace does n’t seem so bad .
8. Graduate school forces you to overinvest :
It ’s too high risk .
In a world where people did not change careers , grad school made sense .
Today , grad school is antiquated .
You invest three to six extra years in school in order to get your dream career .
But the problem is that not only are the old dream careers deteriorating , but even if you have a dream career , it wo n’t last .
You ’ll want to change because you can .
Because that ’s normal for today ’s workplace .
People who are in their twenties today will change careers about four times in their life .
Which means that grad school is a steep investment for such a short period of time .
The grad school model needs to change to adapt to the new workplace .
Until then .
Stay away .
Not sure if grad school is right for you ?
Penelope now offers 1 on 1 career coaching and can help you work through the toughest question of all :
Is grad school worth it for you ?

When President Obama announces Washington ’s new plan to help troubled mortgage - holders today , the betting is that the program will include a loan - modification effort that reduces the size of a besieged homeowner ’s debt .
One goal would be to cut the size of loans and perhaps also their interest rate so that a mortgage holder ’s monthly payment would equal no more than 31 percent of his pre-tax income .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have already been experimenting with an income - to - payment ratio of 38 percent in their loan modification efforts , but Washington wants to go further , indeed probably needs to go further , if it is to stem the tide of defaults .
There is a great irony that Washington will now lead the way in imposing new , stricter standards , including a tougher income - to - payment ratio , because it was Washington , prodded by affordable housing advocates , which pushed mortgage lenders to dilute their traditional underwriting values in the first place .
Federal regulators attacked those established standards as being “ unintentionally biased ” against low and moderate income borrowers and used a variety of laws and regulatory bodies to push often resistant lenders into programs based on these lower standards .
The government and those who backed its actions assured lenders these lower standards were safer than they thought , even though there was little research to support that contention .
Now that a huge chunk of the market based on these debased standards has melted down , the government is going full circle .
The movement to water down underwriting standards grew out of claims of some housing advocates and elected officials that mortgage lenders were ‘ redlining , ’ or avoiding , certain urban neighborhoods , and that these credit - starved areas were decaying from a lack of capital .
When bankers countered that they received few credit - worthy applications based on their traditional underwriting criteria in many of these neighborhoods , regulators and housing advocates began to argue that there must be something wrong with the lending criteria , which needed to change .
One group that led the way was the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , or ACORN , which began protesting bank mergers and expansion requests in the mid-1980s under the Community Reinvestment Act .
In 1986 , ACORN threatened to oppose an acquisition by a Southern bank , Louisiana Bancshares , until the financial institution agreed to new “ flexible credit and underwriting standards ” for low - income borrowers , including agreeing to take into account on mortgage applications such income as public assistance and food stamps .
ACORN also led a coalition of community groups that demanded industry - wide changes in lending standards for urban residents , including watering down minimum down - payment requirements .
The community groups also attacked Fannie Mae as part of the problem with bank lending in certain areas because the giant , quasi government agency ’s underwriters were “ strictly by - the - book interpreters ” of standards who turned down purchases of unconventional loans , which sent a message to banks that these loans were unsafe .
Under pressure from Washington , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed to begin purchasing mortgages under new , looser guidelines .
Freddie Mac , for instance , made 28 changes to its underwriting standards , including approving low - income buyers without credit histories or with bad credit as long as they were current on rent and utilities payments -- even though research had concluded that such buyers are more likely to default .
Freddie Mac also said it would count income from seasonal jobs and public assistance toward income minimums , although such income ( particularly seasonal work ) was by definition not steady .
The giant agencies began several experimental lending programs based on watered - down standards .
Freddie Mac began a program with Sears Mortgage Corporation to make mortgages to borrowers with an income - to - monthly payment ratio of 50 percent , at a time when most private mortgage companies aimed for a 28 - to - 33 percent ratio .
The program also allowed borrowers with bad credit to win mortgage approval if they took credit counseling classes administered by local nonprofits like ACORN , although research would show that credit counseling classes have little impact on default rates .
These efforts gained the endorsement of some of our most authoritative federal institutions .
Shortly after producing a controversial study in 1992 which asserted there was some evidence that lenders were intentionally avoiding minority neighborhoods , the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston produced a “ guide ” to equal opportunity lending in which it told mortgage makers that conventional underwriting standards were “ unintentionally biased ” because they did n’t take into account “ the economic culture of urban , lower - income and nontraditional customers . ”
Among other things , the Boston Fed told lenders they should consider junking the industry 's traditional “ obligation ratios , ” including the 28 percent income - to - payments ratio .
The Fed noted in its guide that the “ secondary market , ” that is , those that purchased mortgages from banks , was willing to buy loans with higher ratios , thereby implying that others thought these loans a good bet , too .
But at this point the secondary market for such loans consisted of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which had both been cajoled into buying them by Washington .
Under pressure , these institutions accepted these new standards even though there were plenty of early warning signs as well as several decades worth of research which suggested that when banks departed too far from traditional underwriting criteria delinquencies and foreclosures rose sharply .
For instance , a minority loan program put together by banks in Atlanta after a newspaper series accused local financial institutions of redlining quickly ran into predictable trouble .
The program allowed loans with payments that were up to 50 percent of an applicant ’s monthly income , and within a year , 10 percent of the loans were delinquent .
Even worse , those who took out the loans fell deeper into other kinds of debt , defaulted on credit card payments and had goods they ’d purchased on credit repossessed .
Meanwhile , a Freddie Mac program called Affordable Gold , which purchased loans from banks under looser underwriting standards , including loans which allowed a borrower to make a down payment with funds contributed from a third party like a government assistance program or a nonprofit , showed sharply higher default rates , up to four times higher than traditional underwriting standards .
Despite such evidence , over time these programs moved from the experimental stage to a large part of the marketplace because politicians in both parties made expanding the number of home owners in America a high priority , and the only way to keep doing that was to lend to people with increasingly riskier credit .
Fannie Mae announced a $ 1 trillion commitment to purchase affordable housing loans in 1992 , then in 1999 under pressure from the Clinton administration announced a new program to buy loans made to “ borrowers with slightly impaired credit . ”
In 2005 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac committed to another $ 1 trillion in affordable housing lending .
And as their loan pools grew , their credit standards deteriorated .
In a recent Forbes article Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute and Edward Pinto , former chief credit officer of Fannie Mae , point out that by 2001 , 18 percent of Fannie Mae ’s portfolio consisted of loans to people with credit scores below 680 — the traditional definition of a loan to someone with riskier credit , who is also someone more likely to default .
Of course , with two huge federal agencies willing to purchase such loans , mortgage makers could n’t churn them out fast enough , and private investors also began snapping up the loans in competition with Fannie and Freddie .
Prof. Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas uncovered a 1998 sales pitches by Bear Stearns , the leading private packager of mortgage - backed securities , in which a managing director of the firm assures banks in language remarkably similar to that used by government regulators that these loans were safer than traditionally thought and that investors were ready to buy them , if only banks would make more of them .
“ Do we automatically exclude or severely discount … loans with [ poor credit scores ] ?
Absolutely not , ” the eager investment banker tells his audience .
Bear Stearns , of course , was eventually sunk by such loans .
Today , housing advocates and ex-government regulators say federal programs were not the problem because many of the worst loans portfolios were created by non -bank lenders which are not even subject to the Community Reinvestment Act .
But that ’s an argument that ignores the much broader role that government played in watering down standards , including using pressure to force players across the industry to participate .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton , for instance , threatened to introduce legislation to make non-bank lenders , that is , mortgage finance companies , subject to CRA if these firms did n’t sign on to affordable lending goals .
HUD even crafted an agreement with the Mortgage Bankers Association , the industry trade group , which pledged that the group ’s members would aid in affordable housing goals .
One of the first members of the MBA to take up the pledge was Countrywide , which pledged to introduce low - down payment loans with high income - to - payment ratios for low - income borrowers .
Countrywide and its co-founder , Angelo Mozilo , ultimately became infamous as one of the first major mortgage lenders to melt down under the weight of its bad lending , but before it was notorious Countrywide was celebrated for its low - income efforts .
Today , the Obama administration acknowledges through its bailout program that those standards were unsafe .
It ’s a backhanded acknowledgement that comes only because bailout efforts up until now have largely failed except in cases where borrowers are given new mortgages written to reflect former underwriting standards , which in many cases can only be accomplished by simply forgiving a big chunk of the borrower ’s debt .
I suppose that ’s about as far as we can expect government to go in admitting the mess it helped to make .
Over a thousand figures and hundreds of thousands of bricks have been used to create the scene as Lego designers have imagined it .
Obama 's wife , Michelle , and his daughters , Sasha and Malia , are depicted as he takes the presidential oath on the steps of the Capitol

We are pleased to present a shortened and edited excerpt from the second edition of Information Architecture : Blueprints for the Web. – Ed .
Article Continues Below
Published in 1977 , Christopher Alexander ’s A Pattern Language : Towns , Buildings , Construction , contains the collective wisdom of world cultures on centuries of building human housing .
It had a resounding effect not only on architecture and urban planning , but also on software design .
In it , Alexander and his co-authors explored 253 architectural design patterns .
For example :
203 . Child Caves#section2 Conflict : Children love to be in tiny , cave - like places .
Resolution :
Wherever children play , around the house , in the neighborhood , in schools , make small “ caves ” for them .
Tuck these caves away in natural leftover spaces , under stairs , under kitchen counters .
Keep the ceiling heights low — 2 feet 6 inches to 4 feet — and the entrance tiny .
Every pattern explores ways of designing space to meet human needs and promote happiness .
It does n’t take great imagination to apply these architectural principles to information architecture — taking them out of the real world and into the digital world .
Humans can behave in surprising ways when you bring them together .
In an information space , a human ’s needs are simple and his behavior straightforward .
Find.
Read .
Save .
But once you get a bunch of humans together , communicating and collaborating , you can observe both the madness and the wisdom of crowds .
Digg , an online news service in which the top stories are selected by reader votes , is as likely to select an insightful political commentary as it is an illegal crack for a piece of software as their top story .
This unpredictability makes architecting social spaces the most challenging work a designer can take on .
While your designs can never control people , they can encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior .
The psychologist Kurt Lewin developed an equation that explains why people do the crazy things they do .
Lewin asserts that behavior is a function of a person and his environment : B=f ( P , E ) .
You ca n’t change a person ’s nature , but you can design the environment he moves around in .
Let ’s explore some of Alexander ’s patterns I ’ve observed in my work and the design work of my fellow practitioners .
Conflict : Who can you trust online ?
Resolution : Give each user an identity , and then allow him to customize it as he sees fit .
The identity allows the user to express his personality , and is typically accessed and protected via a unique log - in .
Participation is rewarded by enhanced reputation and the ability to collect items in the system ( bookmarks , history , relationships , and so on ) .
Identity is the bedrock of social architecture .
In the brilliant essay “ A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy , ” Clay Shirky writes :
If you were going to build a piece of social software to support large and long - lived groups , what would you design for ?
The first thing you would design for is handles the user can invest in .
Elements of identity #section4
To allow your user to successfully create an identity , you need to provide ways for users to reveal themselves online .
Four elements of online identity are :
A profile is a collection of information about the user , typically including a short biography and contextually appropriate facts .
Orkut , Google ’s foray into social networks , collects and displays gender and marital state prominently .
LinkedIn , a business networking site , does n’t touch any of these bits of information , focusing instead on job history , skill set , and education .
Orkut user profile .
Linked
In user profile .
One thing any inviting and vibrant community needs is a sense of life .
Presence is a way for a user to express themself and populate the online space .
Presence can be a status , history of activity , or location .
On a website , your reputation is equal to the sum of all your past actions on the site , good or bad , where the community defines “ good ” and “ bad . ”
Since human memory is fallible , and of course , new members or visitors do n’t always know the history , reputation systems are built into web software to track behavior and how the community judges it .
Amazon ’s “ Top 500 Reviewer ” or eBay ’s “ Top Seller ” designations are great examples of reputation systems .
Conflict :
On a web site with thousands or millions of people , how do you make sure you can keep track of the people you care about ?
Resolution : Create ways for people to identify , connect , and organize the people they care about , as well as the information those people produce .
The complexity of relationship classification depends on how your customers will use your web site .
Relationships are always present in communities .
Online , site software manifests and categorizes relationships according to the community ’s needs .
It can be simple , such as Twitter ’s flat following mode .
Twitter is based on the concept that people broadcast to others and subscribe to others ’ broadcasts as they would to a magazine .
The Twitter system design does n’t recognize that mutual following might be a proxy for friendship .
The entirety of the relationship is , “ I ’m interested . ”
Following on Twitter .
Offering more choices to define the nature of relationships allows the user greater control , but introduces complexity .
Flickr offers categories for “ friends , ” “ family , ” and “ contacts , ” which the user applies as they see fit — including marking as friends people who are really family and as family those who are really friends .
When your Flickr contacts grow to 100 , “ friends ” becomes a useful tool to watch some people a little more closely , because your friends appear in the center of your homepage .
Additionally , you set viewing permissions based on these distinctions .
For example , a college student might show his most intimate photos only to a list of close friends labeled family .
He may label actual family members as friends or contacts .
Each label has a built - in set of assumptions that may or may not apply to the user ’s needs .
But having clarity on who sees what , no matter their label , is useful .
Flickr friends and family .
Elements of relationships #section9
Relationships on the web are just as important as relationships in real life .
Three key elements of relationships are :
Give your users a way to classify the humans in their life .
It can be as simple as just saying , “ I know him , ” or “ I do n’t know him , ” or as complex as saying , “ We were college roommates , but we have n’t spoken in ten years . ”
Groups are another relationship structure , based on shared interests or experiences rather than personal connection .
They include alumni groups , work groups , and professional organizations .
While walking into a biker bar wearing a Yamaha tee shirt might get you killed , wandering into a Star Wars forum and saying , “ George Lucas ripped off Joseph Campbell , and he did n’t even do it well ! ” will generate 500 flames an hour .
We call those who violate norms “ trolls , ” and it ’s best to prepare for them .
Create rules for behavior and consequences for violating the rules such as a time - out or a ban .
Conflict :
If there ’s nothing to do on a site , then it does n’t matter if all your friends are there or not .
The site has no more interest than an address book , and it wo n’t get affection or traffic .
Resolution : Create activities that are useful to individuals but are much improved by group participation .
The third major pattern in social software is community activity .
This is just like being a party planner : you ’ve brought people together , now what ?
Happily , humans have things they like to do together , and if you get them in the same spot and give them even rudimentary tools , they ’ll start talking , sharing , and collaborating .
Shared goals on 43 things .
Elements of activity # section14
The more things your users can do on your site , the more time and energy they ’ll spend there .
Some elements of activity are :
Gift giving is a primitive human behavior — it binds us .
When one person gives something to another , there ’s gratitude , and a desire to reciprocate .
In online community settings , where the nature of the medium ensures you retain a copy of any files you give to someone else , gift giving becomes sharing .
Sharing gathers people of like interests , and allows for an exchange of ideas .
As the community tightens , sharing permits exchanging dreams , hopes , secrets , and fears .
Conversations and communication — that ’s the heart and soul of a community .
No matter how much software we build , people build the relationships , and they build them out of words first .
If you do n’t have a place for people to put their words , community devolves into viewership .
Social software was envisioned as a tool to allow work groups to collaborate .
While the “ social ” part may have swept the web , there are still plenty of tools that focus on allowing smaller groups to get things done .
Architecture for Humans#section18
Humans are complex , and the web is dynamic .
Many more innovations and patterns of excellence will be defined .
Yet human contact and interaction is not new .
From A Pattern Language :
36 . Degrees of publicness #section19 Conflict : People are different , and the way they want to place their houses in a neighbourhood is one of the most basic kinds of difference .
Resolution :
Make a clear distinction between three kinds of homes : those on quiet backwaters , those on busy streets , and those that are more or less in - between .
Make sure that those on quiet backwaters are on twisting paths , and that these houses are themselves physically secluded ; make sure that the more public houses are on busy streets with many people passing by all day long and that the houses themselves are exposed to the passers - by .
The in - between houses may then be located on the paths halfway between the other two .
Give every neighborhood about an equal number of these three kinds of homes .
This pattern decribes the design of a town , but can be applied to social network design .
Facebook was initially lambasted over what has become its most popular feature : the news feed .
The news feed is the equivalent of the town square where you can see what ’s going on with everybody and chat about it .
Some people want to live on the town square , so they do n’t miss a thing .
Others like to live at the edges of town , away from prying eyes and overwhelming updates .
Social architecture ’s ongoing challenge is to find intelligent and subtle ways of allowing people to choose degrees of publicness ( including shelter from other people ’s publicness ) .
If we remember the social in social architecture , we can continue to make new products that delight people as well as change their lives .
As a hideously middle - class Guardian reader , there 's a very real chance you 've experienced the disappointment of " charity gifting ' .
The horrible moment when you tear open a birthday present from a " friend " only to discover that , in lieu of an actual gift – a decent bottle of wine , a hot air balloon ride , a nice cat – they 've decided to FedEx a goat to an African village " in your name " .
It 's perverse , really .
Your friend spends the same amount of money they would have spent buying something for you , but instead it 's them who gets to enjoy the feeling of warmth , while you 're left to wallow in a cocktail of disappointment and guilt .
Could there be a more selfish approach to charity ?
Well , yes , actually , there could – and I 'm proud to say I came up with it .
It 's called UncharityGifts.com and it's the perfect way to get revenge on your smug friend , while restoring the karmic balance in your friendship .
For just £ 20 , we 'll send a poacher to an African village to steal a cow in your friend 's name !
Or , if you 're feeling generous , for just £ 50 we 'll pay local workers to fill in a much - needed well with concrete or raze an entire school to the ground .
Of course , as with normal charity gifts , you 'll receive no actual proof that we 've done any of the above , rather than , say , pocketing the money to cover admin costs , but who cares ?
The important thing is that your friend will receive a handsome certificate of authenticity to make them think long and hard about what they 've done .
Remember : if you steal a man 's fish , you 'll make him hungry for a day , but steal his nets and you 'll keep him hungry for a lifetime .
Now , I know what you 're thinking .
You 're thinking , " Paul , that 's the most hideous thing I 've ever heard .
The people who buy these charity gifts have nothing but honourable intentions .
Only a truly sick mind would assign selfish motives to such an obviously generous and charitable act . "
And you 're probably justified in your thinking .
Furthermore , I imagine you 're disgusted that I would use an attack on charity as a theme for a column .
And , once again , justification would be your wingman .
You might even go so far as to describe me as the most pathetic , snivelling excuse for a hack that has put finger to keyboard this week .
But that , dear reader , is where you 'd be wrong .
Because that title has been taken – fair and square – by Andrew Orlowski from geek news site , the Register .
More on him in a moment .
But first , some background .
On Thursday of last week a slightly amazing thing happened .
So amazing , that you 've probably already read about it in one of the ( literally ) hundreds of news outlets that covered the event .
In almost 200 cities across the globe , from London to Lagos , tens of thousands of people came together for a global party called Twestival .
The ridiculous name comes from the fact that the entire event was organised using Twitter while the ridiculous attendance numbers stem from the whole shindig being held to raise money for Charity : water , an organisation that aims to bring clean water to some of the world 's poorest people .
The global task of collecting all of the pledged money is only just beginning , but already the total raised is well into six figures , every penny of which will go to building wells in Uganda , Ethiopia and India .
By any metric you choose to use , the event was a gigantic success .
On top of raising a shitload of cash , Twestival brought together strangers from across the world and raised a huge amount of awareness of an inspiring charity .
My mind may be capable of coming up with the concept of uncharity gifts but even I , in my darkest moments , could n't think of a single negative thing to say about Twestival .
But then again , why would I want to ?
I 'd have to be mental .
Which brings me back to Andrew Orlowski .
Orlowski , in the highly likely event that you have n't heard of him , is what I would call a professional troll .
A " journalist " whose oeuvre is to spout views so calculatingly dumb – global warming ?
scientific evidence , schmientific evidence – and to rely on wordplay so pathetic – Wikipedia users ?
" wiki fiddlers " more like !
– that the editors of the Register regularly disable comments on his diatribes , lest a child accidentally crawl across a keyboard and beat him in an argument .
He hates Wikipedia , he hates peer - to - peer filesharing ( " freetards ! " ) , he hates basically anything popular or successful or fashionable .
Which all serves to explain why , above all else , he really , really hates Twitter .
In fact , Orlowski hates Twitter , and its users , so much that he decided to summon up all of his trollish powers to write an article hacking Twestival , and its charitable intentions , to death .
Faced with a forest of positive statistics and coverage of the event , he sniffed around – like a pig nudging aside truffles in search of a turd – until finally he dug up a single negative fact .
Donations to Twestival 's online radio station , Twestival.fm , had failed to reach their $ 20 K target , with pledges coming in at a little over $ 4 K .
Compared to the huge totals pledged through other channels , it was an irrelevant disappointment .
An irrelevant disappointment on which Orlowski based his entire coverage of the event .
I quote ...
" A much - trumpeted charity event called ' Twestival ' ( from the people who brought you blooks , perhaps ) received breathless coverage worth hundreds of thousands of pounds this week .
175 cities around the world took part .
And it 's raised just a measly $ 4,180 from the Twestival .fm pledge … According to one Twitterer at the Guardian , Twestival is ' a global charity event that has become the Live Aid of the tech world ' .
Um , let 's hope not , since $ 4,000 is n't going to save many lives . "
He then went on to liken the event to the famous The Day Today sketch where Chris Morris 's newsreader tears strips off the organiser of a jam festival because she only raised £ 1,500 .
Even putting aside the fact that , actually , $ 4,000 would save quite a lot of lives ( and resisting the urge to add " you little prick " to the end of that fact ) , I find Orlowski 's attitude breathtaking .
So rabid is his hatred of Twitter and the people who use it that he does n't care – possibly does n't even notice – that he 's taking the piss out of a huge charity effort .
It 's actually made me sick to read .
How sick ?
You can read my correspondence with Orlowski on my blog .
But here 's the even more sickening thing – Orlowski 's attitude may be wrong , but it 's far from unique .
Here at the Guardian , Jemima Kiss 's coverage of Twestival received similar bile from a small - ish selection of readers .
One commenter – " Plissken " – complained that " the people involved says it all , really " , referring to the fact that several of the people quoted in Kiss 's piece work in , gasp , marketing .
" Itchybollix " agreed , asking whether " looking at that front - page photo should it be ' twatter ' ? "
Seriously – what the hell is wrong with these people ?
Is it really more important for them to attack the people who use Twitter than to admit that , while they may not be a fan of the medium , the message it sends out with events such as Twestival can be pretty incredible ?
Yes it is , but not for the reasons you might think .
What 's really going on – with Orlowski , with the commenters , with all of the techno - trolls who dismiss any coverage of Twitter , and Facebook and Wikipedia and web 2.0 services in general with a passion that borders on romantic hate – is not an expression of hate .
But of fear .
For as long as these people can remember , they 've been the early adopters .
The kings of the cyber hill .
The people who learned everything there was to know about new technology precisely because the crowd did n't know it .
That 's where they got their sense of worth and power : by knowing something no one else did .
( You see a similar attitude in magicians .
A lot of them are wankers too .
And I should know , I used to be one .
Long story . )
For all of Orlowski and co's snide allusions to the " Nathan Barleys " who use Twitter , what they fail to realise is that it 's actually they who are the Nathans – the pathetic self - parodies who take great pains to hate things , just because the masses like them .
( In fact , there are several ironies in Twitter haters appropriating the character of Nathan Barley to try to make their point , given that Charlie Brooker , Barley 's co-creator , has embraced Twitter with both arms .
Also , it 's worth noting that one of the writers on that " jam festival " episode of The Day Today was Graham Linehan , who now organises a Bad Movie Club on Twitter .
I mean , if you 're going to use other people 's jokes , like some simpering fanboy , to make your anti-Twitter points , do at least try to ensure those joke writers are n't huge Twitter fans . )
Anyway , where was I ?
Oh , yes , these old - school early adopters have suddenly found their special , secret world is being blown apart .
Ordinary people – office workers , journalists , postmen and – yes – PR people – are embracing new technology in their droves , and what matters to them is not how these magical new tools work , but how they can be used to make the world a more interesting place .
Or , in extreme cases such as Twestival , a better place .
Geek has gone mainstream .
But rather than moving with the times and welcoming this new era of mass technological accessibility , people such as Orlowski stand their ground , waving their fists , yelling and cursing like elderly lunatics .
" You young whippersnappers with your wiki - fiddling and your twatter and your stupid haircuts , you look ridiculous … and call this music ?
It 's just noi… " , totally oblivious to the truth that each passing day brings them closer to total irrelevance .
Sans teeth , sans iPhones , sans everything .
Until this reality hits them , all the rest of us can do is watch and point and laugh .
Oh , and perhaps one other thing : if I were Amanda Rose or one of the other organisers of Twestival , I 'd send Orlowski a thankyou card .
Thanks to his preposterous hack job of a column , the vast majority of sane Register readers who automatically believe the opposite of whatever Orlowski spews are surely now flooding to the Charity : water Twestival site to find out more about ways to get involved .
You 're probably planning to do the same yourself .
To save you the hassle of Googling , the address is http://www.charitywater.org/twestival.
Twestival might be over , but it 's never too late to donate whatever you can afford .
If not because it 'll save lives and make you feel warm and fuzzy inside , then because it will annoy the living fuck out of Andrew Orlowski .
And that 's an uncharity gift that will just keep on giving .
[ Technology editor 's note : Twestival.com presently reports that it has raised more than $ 250,000 in total , with about 80 cities still to report . ]
• Paul Carr is author of a book .
But you should n't buy it this week .
Instead , you should donate to Charity : water .
Do it .
Do it now .
“ Suicide by Cop ” ( SBC ) is a suicide method in which a person engages in actual or apparent danger to others in an attempt to get oneself killed or injured by law enforcement .
A new study in the Journal of Forensic Sciences examined the prevalence of this phenomenon among a large sample of officer - involved shootings .
Results show that SBC occurs at extremely high rates , with 36 percent of all shootings being categorized as SBC .
The findings confirm the growing incidence of this method of suicide , with SBC cases more likely to result in the death or injury of the subjects 50 percent of the time .
The study was led by noted police and forensic psychologist Kris Mohandie , Ph.D. , who has over nineteen years of experience in the assessment and management of violent behavior .
Dr. Mohandie responded on - scene to the O.J. Simpson barricade and assisted the L.A. County District Attorney ’s prosecution of the stalker of Steven Spielberg .
He has appeared in numerous news programs , including CNN and MSNBC , as well as on the Discovery Channel , A & E , and the History Channel addressing issues pertaining to violent behavior .
Using the largest empirical sample of police shootings to examine the issue of SBC , Dr. Mohandie , J. Reid Meloy , Ph.D. , A.B.P.P. , and Peter I. Collins , M.C.A. , M.D. , F.R.C.P. , examined 707 cases of North American officer - involved shootings from 1998 to 2006 .
Materials reviewed included police reports , witness statements , criminal histories on subjects , photographs , videotapes , and external review reports .
SBC was found to occur at a momentous rate among officer - involved shooting cases .
The fact that 36 percent of all shootings in the sample could be categorized as SBC underscores the significance of suicidal impulses among those who become involved in shootings and other uses of force with police officers .
The study also verifies that suicidal individuals can in fact threaten , injure , and kill others in their quest to commit suicide .
These individuals are quite lethal to themselves , with a 97 percent likelihood of being injured or killed .
There was a one in three chance of others being harmed during the incident .
“ It is clear from our research that SBC is a common occurrence among officer involved shootings and must be considered as an issue during post - event investigations , ” the authors conclude .
Markets exploded today because of a memo from Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) CEO Vikram Pandit , telling employees that -- surprise ! -- the bank was actually on track to post its best quarter in over a year ... and a profit !
Maybe things are n't as bad as we thought !
We 're saved !
We 're saved !
Whoo - hoo !
Not so fast
You can't blame the market 's reaction .
Since Feb. 6 , the Dow Jones has risen all of five times .
Even relatively healthy banks like JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) and Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) are being treated like basket cases .
Anything that can be slightly spun as good news is bound to be clinged to .
Just give us any good news -- even if it's not , you know , true -- and the market will run with it .
This is no exception .
Citigroup 's announcement that " Hey , hey , we 're actually profitable ! " is twisted , tortured , and largely irrelevant to its ultimate fate .
The gist of Pandit 's memo was that operating profit was going gangbusters -- as if operating profit has been the problem all along .
The problem is not a bank 's ability to generate current income , but its ability to absorb losses on legacy assets that are worth a fraction of their purchase price -- using absurd amounts of leverage to boot .
The memo disclosed numbers that point to an operating profit of about $ 8.3 billion this quarter , but Pandit did n't give any mention of what asset writedowns would be .
" In January and February alone , our revenues excluding externally disclosed marks were $ 19 billion , " he said .
Great !
Now ... uh ... about those " externally disclosed marks ? "
How are those workin ' out for you ?
I 'm not worried that Citigroup can't generate operating profit : I 'm worried it 's not solvent .
There 's a big difference .
Imagine a person drowning in debt but insisting they 're wealthy because their paycheck exceeded their grocery bills .
You get the idea .
Same game , different day
You can't blame bank CEOs for trying to instill confidence these days .
Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) tried a similar approach a few weeks ago , telling investors that Countrywide and Merrill Lynch were the " stars " of 2009 , and that Merrill Lynch will be " a thing of beauty , " pointing to , you guessed it , operating profits .
It does n't take a tremendous amount of thought to see that if a company has an operating profit of X and losses on existing assets of X times 100 , things might not turn out so hot .
Such is the case with Merrill Lynch , whose losses in 2007 and 2008 wiped out all profits earned over the preceding eleven years , and ultimately caused B of A to become the recipient of one of the largest federal bailouts ever .
" A thing of beauty " indeed .
Posting the occasional operating profit will indeed provide a cushion for banks to absorb impending writedowns , but it 's a clown show to think it 'll be enough to plug the black hole of losses , especially in Citigroup 's case .

Some years ago I started studying Islam .
It did n’t take long to recognise the problems of that religion ’s texts the repetitions , contradictions and absurdities .
Unlike Christianity , scholarship on these problems in Islam has barely begun .
But they are manifest for anyone to see .
For a holy book which in its opening lines boasts  that is the book , wherein is no doubt ’ , plenty of doubt emerges .
Not least in recognising demonstrable plagiarisms from the Torah and the Christian Bible .
If God spoke through an archangel to one illiterate tradesman in 7th - century Arabia , then just for starters why was he stealing material ?
Or was he just repeating himself ?
Gradually , scepticism of the claims made by one religion was joined by scepticism of all such claims .
Incredulity that anybody thought an archangel dictated a book to Mohammed produced a strange contradiction .
I found myself still clinging to belief in Christianity .
I was trying to believe though rarely arguing  Well , your guy did n’t hear voices : but I know a man who did . ’
This last , shortest and sharpest , phase pulled down the whole thing .
In the end Mohammed made me an atheist .
The Porn Bailout
by Doug French by Doug French
With the federal government ladling out billions in bailout money to the financial and auto industries , a number of businesses now have their hands out .
Home builders , retailers and commercial real estate developers all want a piece of the bailout pie .
Not like there is an existing warm pie cooling on the window sill waiting to be cut and served .
No , this money pie is created out of nowhere , to be paid for in higher prices as the inflation is forced upon the unwitting public .
Nobody could imagine that pornographers would be brazen enough to line up at the government trough .
But sure enough , Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt and Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild fame have asked their local Congressman Henry Waxman for $ 5 billion because : " People are too depressed to be sexually active , " according to Flynt .
Ever the patriot , Flynt says an unsexed nation is an " unhealthy " nation .
" Americans can do without cars and such but they can not do without sex . "
No doubt being depressed about losing your job or the general correction of the real estate bubble does n’t do much for your get up and go .
And if past escapades on Capitol Hill are any guide , this is a subject lawmakers are very interested in .
However , the head Hustler honcho is stretching it a bit to think that a $ 5 billion injection into the porn industry will provide a lasting stimulus — economic or otherwise .
Upon hearing the news of Flynt and Francis ’s panhandling , most people likely figured that it was all a big publicity stunt .
But there really is a method to their madness .
In an interview with Fox Business , Francis revealed what really has his business in a funk .
When asked what he would do with the $ 5 billion , he said they would " invest in building new means of distribution , and shoring up our distribution right now to prevent further erosion from factors like Youporn and other internet content that has seriously affected our business over the past few years . "
Indeed , Francis was once one of these small - scale producers until his Girls Gone Wild series took off .
Now that his company employs 400 people and sales exceed $ 100 million , it sounds like he wants to use intellectual property laws to protect his content from pesky competitors like Youporn .
So the jobs that Joe Francis assured Fox Business that he and Flynt would create are likely to be jobs for intellectual property law lawyers , in hopes of benefiting Hustler and Francis ’s Mantra Films , Inc. at the expense of their innovative and creative competitors .
No matter what Larry Flynt contends there is no lack of inexpensive porn available to stimulate Americans .
In fact , using $ 5 billion of taxpayer money " to prevent further erosion from factors like Youporn and other internet content that has seriously affected our business over the past few years , " will only make his product more expensive and less accessible .
Throwing money at Flynt and Francis , like bailing out the automakers and the big banks , stifles innovation and new technologies in order to keep outmoded business models in place at the expense of taxpayers .

OTTAWA–The latest wave of job losses shows the economic stimulus package delivered by the Conservatives only last week may be too little , too late to help Canada cope with the global recession , Liberals say .
In the worst employment showing in decades , the Canadian economy shed 129,000 jobs in January as the unemployment rate shot up to 7.2 per cent from 6.6 per cent the previous month , Statistics Canada said .
Nearly all the jobs lost were full - time positions .
The recession hit hardest in Ontario , where 71,000 jobs disappeared , pushing the unemployment rate to 8 per cent – the worst in the province since November 1997 .
Despite Finance Minister Jim Flaherty 's planned injection of $ 40 billion in stimulus into the economy over two years , there is speculation the Conservative government has not done enough to revive slumping business conditions .
" If these negative trends in employment continue , there could be a need for more fiscal action before we break for the summer , " Liberal finance critic John McCallum said this morning .
He suggested the economy has been so flattened by the global slowdown the Canadian government may be forced to make another effort to revive economic activity with more government spending and tax measures by June .
The worsening job statistics reinforced the argument Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government badly underestimated the difficulties facing the Canadian economy , McCallum said .
" It 's only a few short months ago that they were saying the Canadian economy was as strong as the Canadian Shield and we would have nothing but budget surpluses .
" In part , it 's the world changing quickly , but I think they were certainly far less aware than virtually every other government " of the severity of the coming recession , McCallum remarked .
Harper said in Miramichi , N.B. , today that the latest figure of 129,000 lost jobs is bad news but his government wo n’t change its approach to solving the economic crisis , the Canadian Press reports .
Later , in an interview with CTV broadcast in the Maritimes , Harper said economic forecasters have been unable to call the recession accurately , but Canada is still in a better position than most countries to deal with the global downturn .
“ We ’re in a period where , the truth is , people just do n’t know exactly what ’s happening , ” he said .
“ We know two things .
We know it ’s going to be difficult , it ’s going to be more difficult in the months to come , but we also know so far , and this is the one thing I think to take some solace from , is that Canada remains in a relatively good position compared to all these other countries . ”
In Niagara Falls this morning , Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty lamented the " pretty serious job - loss numbers . "
" The American economy continues to falter and Canadians and Ontarians continue to pay a price , " McGuinty told reporters at a Liberal caucus meeting here .
" I think it 's important to keep in mind that the number 's even larger in terms of who 's affected by this , " he said .
" If a family loses a job , not only does it affect the mum or the dad , but it affects the spouse or the kids and then there 's a heightened sense of anxiety among all those who have not lost their job . "
Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said unemployment data was as bad as the provincial government had feared
" We expected this .
They 're obviously deeply troubling , " Duncan said .
" It reminds us just us how deep this global crisis is and calls on us to redouble our efforts as we move forward , " he said .
Duncan , who is readying a budget to be tabled within the next four weeks , said he is expecting " quite a dramatic decline " in corporate tax revenues , which will affect the government 's planning .
Statistics Canada said the manufacturing sector that is centred in Ontario and Quebec dropped 101,000 jobs in January , the worst decline ever recorded .
The employment declines were most pronounced in vehicle manufacturing .
But layoffs were widespread , including in furniture , computer and electronics , non-metallic mineral products , electrical equipment and clothing production .
" I can't see one glimmer of hope in this report when we dig beneath the headlines , " said Derek Holt , economist at Scotia Capital .
" The optimists are just taking body blows all over the place here , " he said .
The monthly drop in employment , far worse than expected , single - handedly wiped out the net job gain in 2008 of less than 100,000 .
Canada has shed 213,000 jobs since October .

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a job loss of 40,000 and an unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent .
The monthly decline was also bigger than any seen in the previous economic troughs of the 1980s and 1990s , Statscan said .
That raised fears this recession will be deeper and more protracted than policy - makers have predicted and that the Bank of Canada will be compelled to cut rates further from their 50 - year low of 1 percent .
" Everybody is prepared for a pretty weak first quarter , but these numbers are probably surprising the more bearish views , " said Craig Wright , chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada .
Many economists disagree with the Bank of Canada 's projection the economy will recover more quickly than in past recessions , with growth returning in the third quarter .
Last month it projected the economy would shrink 4.8 per cent in the first quarter after contracting 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year .
Sal Guatieri , senior economist at BMO Capital Markets , said Canada was in for more carnage in the labor market in coming months .
" This is the start of a wave of job losses that will likely extend through the first half of this year , " he said .
Canadian companies have been announcing massive layoffs on an almost daily basis .
Montreal - based aircraft maker Bombardier was the latest , saying on Thursday it would cut more than 1,300 jobs due to a softening market for business jets .
The last time the unemployment rate hit 7.2 per cent was in November 2004 .
Flaherty had hinted on Thursday the report would be grim , saying the job numbers would be " very regrettable " and there was a risk that Canada 's recession would get much worse .
The news was also bad in the recession - battered United States , where layoffs have been biting for months .
U.S. employers eliminated 598,000 more jobs in January , the most since the end of 1974 , sending the unemployment rate to 7.6 per cent from 7.2 per cent in December .
The numbers in the U.S. Labour Department 's report , released Friday , were far worse than the 524,000 that economists expected .
Job reductions in November and December also were deeper than previously reported .
All told , the U.S. economy has lost 3.6 million jobs since the recession began there in December , 2007 , with half of those losses coming in the past three months .

Disclaimer : Depending on your definition of atheism and agnosticism , I may actually be advocating agnosticism in this text .
These two terms have any number of definitions and what follows simply reflects my perception of them .
The point is not that one term is better than the other .
What I 'm trying to argue is simply that one type of thought process associated with agnosticism is not particularly useful .
The more I think about agnosticism the more I think it 's just the politically correct face of atheism .
It 's a way to say " Hey , listen guys , you say you know god exists , and we 're skeptical .
But that does n't imply we think we 're better than you , we just think it 's impossible to know at all . "
That is the gist of it , but does it really differ from the atheist position in any important way ?
I do n't think it does .
Does an agnostic believe in god ?
If he did he would be a believer .
Which he is n't .
So the answer is no .
Of course , the agnostic slogan is " I do n't know " , but in a question of belief , there is no such thing .
There is no way to not know if you believe in something .
You either believe or you do n't , and if you " do n't know " that means you do n't .
You fail to give a positive answer .
The problem with agnosticism is that it gets you into meaningless statements about probability .
An agnostic who adamantly repeats " I do n't know " is likely to be seen as low hanging fruit for believers and unbelievers alike .
" Okay then , what do you think is more likely ? "
Agnostics in their drive to be even handed get pushed into saying that both are ' equally likely ' .
Well , what on earth does that mean ?
Is that a statement about statistical probability ?
So in a repeatable experiment where the universe is created god appears 50 % of the time ?
That 's absurd reasoning .
We are not talking about something measurable and therefore there is no way to say ' how likely ' it is .
Wrong question , wrong answer
A philosopher once said " as a philosopher it is not that I can produce more answers , but I can make sure we do n't ask the wrong questions " .
Religious people claim to know with absolute certainty that god exists .
And thus they seek the equivalent answer from the unbeliever .
" Can you say with absolute certainty that god does not exist ? "
It is the wrong question .
And to see why we need only ask a different , obvious , question .
" Is there anything at all you believe with absolute certainty ? "
Again , the answer is no .
What does ' absolute certainty ' even mean ?
It would have to mean , I think , that notwithstanding circumstances you know nothing about , your faith would still hold .
If nothing else , that strikes me as just about the most foolish statement imaginable .
Religious people claim to have this certainty , and that 's their business .
In any case , we know that life is unpredictable , and it is possible that anything one has established as knowledge may be overturned .
Is there any knowledge at all you have that holds beyond the constraints of sensory perception and reason ?
No , there is n't .
Everything is theoretically subject to change .
So why on earth should I have to answer the question of god to a greater degree of certainty than I have about any other question in life ?
Agnosticism exists only because we need an answer to this incorrect question .
Atheism is the realization that the question is incorrect .
An unbeliever simply does not have an equivalent answer to the question of absolute certainty .
Atheism is not about absolute certainty , it is about giving an answer to a question that has a reasonable answer .
Does god exist ?
No .
Do you know this with absolute certainty ?
Irrelevant .
I know god does n't exist with the same certainty that I know Superman does n't exist , and that 's perfectly sufficient .
Atheism is the realization that the difference between a hypothetical " no " and a practical " no " is n't worth dwelling on .
Because when it comes down to choosing how to live life , there is no agnostic option .
You either live your life according to religious observance or you do n't .
No agnostic will sit in the ' waiting room ' until the answer comes in .
Thus there is no practical difference between the agnostic and the atheist , only a theoretical one .
This also resolves the misunderstanding that " atheism is faith just like theism " .
Atheists do not have an equivalent belief , that is what the a in atheism means .
Political correctness
How does political correctness factor into it ?
I think the answer is obvious .
Religion is such a big issue in our culture that we have the intuition not to take these questions lightly .
Religion is not just an issue of faith , it 's also a question of world view , of social institution , of tradition , of family ties .
To reject the god hypothesis is to reject religion , because what sensible religious observance could follow if you eliminate the cornerstone of religion itself ?
And to reject religion is to make a big life decision .
That is the paradox of the god question .
The fallout may be complicated , but the question is n't .
So people hesitate to say what they would so easily say if it was n't for the collateral damage .
To say " I do n't know " to a question of belief , I think , is to say " I do n't believe , but I 'm not sure what the consequences are going to be " .
We are not so hesitant to answer other questions of faith .
Do people say " wait a minute , you can't be dead certain that Superman does n't exist " ?
Actually , I can .
He 's a fictional character from a comic book .
Do I need to be more guarded in my reasoning ?
No , I do n't .
I 'm never going to get a more useful answer than " no " .
Are you still on the fence about Santa Claus ?
Of course not .
Because there is no reason not to say just say " no " .
“ People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are .
I do n’t believe in circumstances .
The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want , and if they ca n’t find them , make them . “
George Bernard Shaw
We are all capable of so much more than we accomplish , and often fall short of our potential .
One excuse I often hear ( and sometimes make ) is how we did the best we could , and then blame our failure on “ the situation . ”
For example :
“ It might have looked like I dropped the ball on that one , but I did the best I could – given the situation . ”
Sometimes that is a real reason – but more often than not , it is a temporary obstacle that you need to get through .
And today , I will show you how .
Making Excuses with “ The Situation ”
There are times when this blanket reason of “ the situation ” is legitimate .
Perhaps physical constraints , disabilities , or absurdly difficult obstacles presented a “ situation ” that was impossible to overcome .
Often however , I have found that “ the situation ” is an excuse used to avoid confronting a difficult problem that has a difficult , uncomfortable or uncertain solution .
Rather than tackling the actual issue head on , we instead pretend there is no way to resolve some solvable problem , work around it and then say we “ did our best , given the situation . ”
We are not powerless .
Every day we can decide to accept things that happen to us , or to confront issues and to change them .
Examples of “ The Situation ”
Below are a couple of common “ situations ” that hold us back .
I then will show you some possible real issues that are causing “ the situation ” – and the difficult solution or decision that needs to be made , but is being avoided .
There is not necessarily a right or wrong answer in each tradeoff .
Oftentimes , however , this exercise helps us realize that either a difficult change needs to take place , or perhaps sacrifices made – or else we wo n’t be able to accomplish what we set out to do .
“ The Situation ” The Real Problem (s ) The Difficult Questions ( s ) “ I could n’t stick to my diet – we went out for happy hour . ”
Friends / occasions that are out of line with your fitness goals
A diet that is too strict
How important is eating this way to me ?
How can I plan my social events to reach my nutrition goals ?
“ I have n’t been working on that – I ’m too tired , since I have n’t been sleeping as much as I would like .
Poor time management
Poor planning
Why am I staying up too late or getting up too early ?
How important is that project to me ?
Five Steps For Beating “ The Situation ”
The above table discusses this through example , and here is a five step process for helping you make the difficult decisions you need to resolve “ The Situation ” –
Realize that nothing is non-negotiable .
Everything in your life can be responded to and reacted to Define “ The Situation . ”
Write down the specific conflict that are causing your situation .
Define the real issue causes of this conflict .
Ask yourself the tough questions to resolve your conflict .

How do you wrest control of the banking industry away from the vested elites who got us in this mess ?
Former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson makes the fascinating point that breaking the back of the elites is a critical stage in crisis resolution in developing and post - communist countries — a stage we have yet to go through in confronting our own crisis :
The elites who run the US banking industry have had a great run of economic good fortune .
They used this wealth to further strengthen their political power , both through donations to politicians of almost all stripes and more broadly through taking positions of formal and informal influence throughout the executive and legislative branches .
Our unsustainable debt - fueled boom , in other words , produced both the conditions for a major global financial disaster , and a political strengthening of the people who benefited most from the risk - taking and associated compensation packages that made this disaster possible .
Ending the financial crisis is relatively straightforward – a forced recapitalization and change of ownership / management in the banking system – although this will not immediately lead to an economic recovery …
But seen in deeper political terms , decisive action to restructure large banks is almost impossible .
Such action would require overcoming perhaps the single strongest interest group in the United States today .
How can you do it ?
The answer must be by splitting this powerful interest group into competing factions , and taking them on one by one .
Can this be done ?
Definitely , yes .
In particular , bank recapitalization – if implemented right – can use private equity interests against the powerful large bank insiders .
Then you need to force the new private equity owners of banks to break them up so they are no longer too big to fail .
Did You Watch the Super Bowl With Your Kids ?
Do You Regret Letting Them See the Ads ?
It was a great game .
The Steelers looked strong all through the game , until they made some sad personal fouls that gave the Cardinals some big opportunities .
The Cards were scrappy , and fought tooth and nail to the end .
The last four minutes will go down in sports history .
" But , " to quote Mr. Nielsen , " that 's not important right now . "
Since the iconic Apple ad in 1984 , the Super Bowl has been known as a showcase for what you might call blockbuster ads .
The quality and humor of the ads probably hit their peak during the original dot - com boom in the late '90s .
Every year , people say things have gone downhill , and while there may still have been a few bright spots , those people would be right .
It 's been a long , slow decline , and yet a lot of folks still talk about looking forward to watching the Superbowl ads almost a much as seeing the game itself ; moreso if they 're not really football fans , but know they 'll be stuck somewhere that they can't avoid the game .
But this is the year , I hereby declare , that kills the Super Bowl ad .
This is the year that starts the trend of people willfully , even determinedly , avoiding the Super Bowl ads .
Yes , they were that bad .
And sadly for many of us GeekDads and other parents , our kids sat through them as well .
Damage has been done that we will be hard - pressed to undo .
Now , we 're guys .
We get it .
We like a bit of off - color fun once in a while .
But these ads were so full of violence , cruelty , and sexism that something needs to be said .
With that purpose in mind , here are the worst of the bad ads , by quarter .
1st Quarter : GoDaddy.com shower ad .
So I guess the takeaway here is that , since sex sells , everyone looking to create a website must be a puerile teenager .
Runners up : Bridgestone for the female Potatohead being portrayed as a figurative harpy , and Bud Light for the cartoon physics of throwing a guy out a fourth floor window walking away , and making the scene a joke .
2nd Quarter : TelaFlora for making the funny out of a woman suffering through a sexist , demeaning diatribe from a box of talking flowers .
Runners up include the Bud Light skier ad because the way Sonny Bono died is so humorous , and Cheetos for the pigeon attack .
3rd Quarter : CareerBuilder.com for their Hate Work spot .
Yeah , punching a koala is a laugh riot .
No huge runners up in the quarter , though the stuffed moose was a hard call .
4th Quarter : the most exciting quarter of the game was the worst for ads .
Again , GoDaddy.com is the winner ( loser ) , with their courtroom bit with women unzipping their tops .
Entirely inappropriate for our younger kids , and embarrassing to watch .
Runner up to Taco Bell for the attractive young woman choosing a date outfit going through possibilities in a provocative manner , and then the punchline ?
Her ignorant boyfriend is n't taking her out for a nice steak dinner , he 's getting Taco Bell .
Wow , how many stereotypes can we cram in there ?
I imagine we 'll see a fair number of " get a sense of humor , old man " comments to this , but we 'd love to hear what you all thought .
Here 's my core problem with including relief jobs in the unemployment rate : the unemployment figures start telling you as much about the political situation as the underlying economy .
The government can push the unemployment level down to nearly any arbitrary level it wants by putting anyone without a job on the dole and making them do some not - very - valuable task in order to cash their check .
Just as you can push GDP up by the simple expedient of borrowing money ( which does not show up in the GDP figures ) and having the government spend it , you can lower unemployment by borrowing money and spending it on creating jobs with a value too low to justify creating them in the private sector .
But ultimately , the health of the economy relies on the ability of the private sector to generate growth , and the private sector to generate jobs .
It 's the tax revenue from that growth , those jobs , that allow the government to create government jobs .
In the short term , the government can borrow and spend , but if the private sector and the labor market are not growing , eventually lenders will get worried about the ability to repay and raise the interest rates they charge .
Result : well , there are a lot of deposed Latin American heads of state who could describe the result in some very vivid language .
If we include relief jobs in the unemployment figures , we lose track of the strength of the underlying private labor market that has to ultimately support those jobs .
Regardless of what the government does , our economy will not have recovered from the current mess until the private markets start growing again .
The government spending may ( or may not ) be a good way to alleviate the pain of a weak labor market , but unless either the economy recovers on its own , or the massive stimulus shocks it back into full output , the stimulus will eventually have to be cut back , and we 'll be back into the bad old equilibrium with a lot of extra debt payments making us even poorer .
It behooves us , then , to keep a closer eye on the underlying figure than on what the government is doing in the short term .
And that 's approximately the place the US found itself in at the end of the 1930s , with unemployment back up to 19 % after falling into the low teens .
The underlying economy was not sound .
Perhaps the liberals are right and the problem is that FDR did n't spend enough -- but that is a hypothetical .
What we know is that the US economy was still in shockingly bad repair until World War II turned it around .
BELLAIRE , Ohio , Feb. 2 ( UPI ) --
The Bellaire , Ohio , water department is warning residents to avoid contact with tap water after hydrochloric acid was mistakenly added to the system .
Kirk Baker , superintendent of the water department water department said Monday emergency crews were at the city water treatment plant after a supplier mistakenly gave the plant hydrochloric acid instead of fluoride , WTOV -TV , Steubenville , Ohio , reported Monday .

Baker said about 40 pounds of the acid was added to the water supply by workers Sunday and the error was not noticed until Monday morning , when crews noticed the low fluoride levels .
" It looks like it was caught in time and nothing major has happened at this time , " Baker said .
He said crews were working Monday to flush the entire water system .
" It could have been a serious situation we want everybody to know the guys have been great .
We 've been on it , " Baker said .
" Luckily we caught it but it 's nerve racking . "
The department said between 2,300 and 2,400 people were affected by the incident .
Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej is highly revered
The government in Thailand has set up a special website urging people to inform on anyone criticising the monarchy .
It has also established an internet security centre to co-ordinate the blocking of websites deemed offensive to the monarchy .
On its first day of operation the centre banned nearly 5,000 websites .
The Ministry of Information had already blocked many thousands of sites , but that work is now being accelerated by the new centre .
Loyalty to the king
For all the many other challenges confronting the new government in Thailand , it has made protecting the image of the monarchy one of its highest priorities , according to the BBC correspondent in Bangkok , Jonathan Head .
Internet users are being urged to show their loyalty to the king by contributing to a new website called protecttheking .
net , which has been set up by a parliamentary committee .
On the site 's front page it is described as a means for Thai people to show their loyalty to the king by protecting him from what it calls misunderstandings about him .
It calls on all citizens to inform on anyone suspected of insulting or criticising the monarchy .
The site has managed to block 4,818 websites in its first 24 hours of operation .
Sources in the military have told the BBC that top generals are concerned about growing anti-monarchy sentiment , particularly among supporters of the ousted prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , many of whom believe that members of the royal family have backed anti-Thaksin movements .
The new website appears to be part of a concerted effort by the government and its conservative supporters to stifle any debate on the future of the monarchy , before it can gather momentum , our correspondent says .

So , you 've just moved into your new home .
Beautiful house , fantastic location , and you got it for a good price .
The previous owners seemed very keen for a quick sale .
Wondering why ?
Well , could it be that they thought it was haunted ?
Stranger things have happened .
Beautiful properties have become houses of horror thanks to unexplained happenings .
Some families decide to move out .
Others learn to live with their ghosts , or resort to exorcism .
Or , in the case of the actor Nicolas Cage , they simply do n't sleep in the house .
In 2007 , he shelled out $ 3.5 m for LaLaurie Mansion , reputedly the most haunted house in New Orleans .
" At any given moment , " said Cage , " I have five or six ghosts surrounding the house , all looking up at this haunted temple , and I 'm in there .
We 'll [ his family ] come over and have dinner there but nobody sleeps there . "
The property is now up for sale .
Being saddled with an unwelcome spectral guest is more common than you might think .
According to a 2005 study by the Portman Building Society ( now merged with Nationwide ) , one in three people surveyed claimed to have lived in a house that was haunted , or rumoured to be .
The question is , if you 've got a resident spook , do you come clean about it to prospective buyers ?
And if you do n't , could you be prosecuted under the Property Misdescriptions Act ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 does not refer to haunted houses , " says the London - based lawyer Conor Walsh .
" But it does create a general duty to avoid making false or misleading statements . "
Theoretically , this should stop a seller from claiming that a house is not haunted – or , indeed , that it is haunted – when he or she believes otherwise .
In the US , it 's a different story .
There was a case in 1991 where a seller was ruled liable to the buyer for failing to mention that the property she was selling was haunted , which could have affected the value .
" The court held that a buyer would be highly unlikely to discover the existence of such activity himself prior to purchase , " says Mark Pawlowski , professor of property law at Greenwich University in London .
" And therefore the onus was firmly on the seller to make disclosure . "
In one extreme case of apparent supernatural activity , the residents fled in terror – and left the bank to repossess the £ 3.6 m property when they could n't sell it .
Businessman Anwar Rashid moved into Clifton Hall in Nottinghamshire in early 2007 .
The 52 - room mansion , which dates back to the Norman Conquest , was the dream home for Anwar and his wife , and their four young children – until the resident ghosts came out .
" I fell for its beauty , but behind the façade , it 's haunted , " says Anwar .
" The ghosts did n't want us there , and we could n't fight them because we could n't see them . "
The spooky happenings started the day they moved in .
And over time , they experienced everything from tapping on the wall and unexplained voices , to screaming in the passageways .
Investigators of the paranormal were called in , but failed to solve the problem .
In the end , the Rashids could n't take any more .
And that was that : £ 3.6 m down the drain .
The property went on the market again in October 2008 ( at £ 2.75 m , nearly £ 1 m less than Anwar paid for it ) , and is now a conference centre rather than a private residence .
If you own a country estate , a resident ghost could well prove a boon .
" An interesting and spooky history – particularly involving any famous or infamous characters – can add intrigue and appeal for more eccentric buyers , " says Charles Wasdell , head of research at Propertyfinder.com .
Such a reputation certainly brings in the visitors to Blickling Hall in Norfolk , which is supposed to be the most haunted of all properties owned by the National Trust .
Ghosts are n't always welcome , however , on NT properties .
" The trust does exorcise some properties .
It does n't shout about it , though , " says Siân Evans , author of Ghosts : Mysterious Tales from the National Trust .
According to Wasdell , exorcism is worth exploring if you 're plagued by an unruly ghoul .
" Every Anglican diocese in the UK has a specialist team of exorcists ready to vanquish evil spirits , " he says .
" So , if you 're worried that a ghost is going to damage your sale chances , you can always call them in . "
Anatomy of ads · 2007-01 - 25 18:57 by Wladimir Palant
I would like to take a look at the different costs connected to ads .
Most of the time , the only cost people consider is our attention — ads are designed to be distracting , they do n’t let us concentrate on what we are doing .
Jeff Atwood analyzed the space occupied by ads in comparison to content on a particular page and came to alarming results .
I want to pick another page to look at the other aspects .
Dilbert.com has been mentioned quite a few times as an example of an ad - laden site , the server response time is quite stable ( good for reproducible results ) and it features a large variety of different ads .
If you look at the space distribution on the main page , ads occupy roughly 32 % of the space while the content area is quite small with 22 % .
Most of the remaining space is navigation .
That ’s the visual appearance .
But let ’s look at the networking side .
How much do the ads cost in download size ?
How much do they increase page loading times ?
I measured these parameters for a full reload of the main page both with and without ads ( each experiment was repeated 10 times to get a reasonably reliable average ) .
However , when you browse a site , you usually make use of your browser ’s cache — so I also did measurements for the case that you come back to the main page by clicking a link .
Here is an overview of the results , all numbers are given in the “ from – to ( average ) ” form :
with caching , with ads with caching , without ads without caching , with ads without caching , without ads amount of data transfered , kB 22 – 60 ( 40 ) 0 – 36 ( 11 ) 675 – 707 ( 680 ) 204 – 205 ( 205 ) time required , seconds 2.6 – 5.4 ( 3.5 ) 0.0 – 1.2 ( 0.3 ) 6.2 – 8.4 ( 7.1 ) 6.0 – 8.1 ( 6.7 ) number of servers contacted 6 – 8 ( 6.7 ) 0 – 1 ( 0.5 ) 8 – 9 ( 8.9 ) 1 number of URL s requested 12 – 13 ( 12.5 ) 0 – 1 ( 0.5 ) 72 – 77 ( 73.2 ) 55
Summary of the highlights :
Ads triple the amount of data one has to download ( over 450 kB increase ) .
When downloading the page the first time ( without caching ) the delay due to ads is not notable .
However , these measurements have been made with a very good internet connection , modem users will see something very different .
Also , it does n’t consider the time for server name resolution ( all names were already cached ) — resolving nine server names instead of just one usually makes a huge difference .
Dilbert.com is really good at caching , often you can go back to the main page without contacting any server at all .
Unfortunately , ads pretty much destroy this advantage by requiring almost every ad server to be contacted .
This means that instead of showing up almost immediately the pages take more than 3 seconds to load .
Now lets have a look at memory use .
Restart Firefox , look at memory use , go to dilbert.com , check memory use increase .
Comes out that this page needs less than 2 MB of memory without ads and around 9 MB with ads .
Yes , we have quite an increase here .
Altogether dilbert.com includes 8 remote JavaScript files .
They are allowed to execute on the page and access the same information that the page itself receives .
What do they do , should you be concerned ?
Let ’s look at those scripts in detail .
adsremote.scripps.com
Five of the eight JavaScript files included in the page are loaded from this domain .
Three of them ( ad types EXIT_POP and SUPERSTITIAL according to their addresses ) do something weird : they insert an image wrapped within a regular ad link , but the image is a 1×1 transparent GIF .
Who is supposed to click on that ?
I have no idea .
The other two ( ad types UNSIZED_AD and LEADERBOARD ) are more creative — they load other scripts , this time from a.tribalfusion.com .
What do these scripts do ?
You probably guessed it already — they load more scripts , this time from media.fastclick.net .
And one of those finally inserts an image ad , while the other inserts yet another script ( cdn.fastclick.net ) that finally checks whether you have Flash installed and inserts a Flash ad if you do .
The image ad ( animated GIF , 331 kB ) is mostly responsible for the increase in download size .
All this craziness involving 10 scripts ( have you been counting ? ) amounts to 31 document .
write calls .
Just to keep your browser busy .
And of course each single script sets a cookie ( altogether five cookies on three domains ) so it can recognize you when you stumble upon another of their ads .
js.adsonar.com
This script defines a bunch of functions including its own error handler .
Never noticed JavaScript errors on dilbert.com ?
That ’s because the helpful ad script catches them all .
The webmasters might not be very grateful once this masks a real problem but who cares …
It will add an unused hidden form to the page ( memory is cheap , you know ? ) and then create the ad .
The script lets the webmaster choose whether he wants a regular pop-up , a pop-under or an iframe .
Dilbert.com chooses an iframe .
In addition to the regular information about the account that should receive the payment it also transmits the full URL you have been viewing — just in case your firewall blocks the Referer header to protect your privacy .
The iframe actually contains an unobtrusive text ad , that ’s the one you see above the text “ Dilbert.com Marketplace ” .
It manipulates your status bar to make it appear that you will be sent directly to the advertised site .
In reality it sends you there through redir.adsonar.com – each click is counted .
st.sageanalyst.net
That ’s a tracker .
It tries to get as much information about you as possible — whether you have cookies enabled , the address of the page you are viewing , the address of the page you came from , your screen resolution , JavaScript version supported by your browser .
Then it creates an image that will transmit this data back to st.sageanalyst.net .
And it sets a cookie to track you .
ssl.google-analytics.com
I probably do n’t need to introduce this one .
That ’s Google ’s visitor statistics service for webmasters who for some reason cannot afford proper log analysis .
In terms of privacy there is only one difference to sageanalyst.net : instead of settings a cookie on their own server , Google sets the cookie on dilbert.com .
I guess this has the advantage that one cannot easily block Google ’s cookies without locking himself out of any cookie - dependent services on the domain ( forums above all ) .
On the other hand , this cookie is only useful for tracking the user within one site , on another site with Google Analytics you will receive a different cookie .

Canadian voters are at risk of identity theft because of voters lists that go missing and are circulated widely among political parties , says Canada 's privacy commissioner .
" The personal information of Canadian voters is not adequately protected , " commissioner Jennifer Stoddart said Thursday in a statement after presenting a report to Parliament highlighting the issue .
" We 're concerned that voters ' personal information could fall into the wrong hands and be used for illegal activities . "
Stoddart and Auditor General Sheila Fraser collaborated on two reports that looked into the practices of four federal agencies that collect personal information such as birthdates and addresses :
Canada Revenue Agency .
Elections Canada .
Passport Canada .
Service Canada .
They found that in the case of Elections Canada :
At least one per cent of voters lists have gone missing during elections and byelections .
Elections Canada collects too much personal information on Canadians , including some teenagers too young to vote .
Paper and electronic copies of voter lists are widely circulated to political parties and candidates , who are n't covered by the same privacy laws that federal employees have to abide by .
Stoddart said that is a notable gap in Canada 's privacy legislation .
Such parties do n't have a formal way to report privacy breaches to Elections Canada .
Canadians are n't fully informed about how their personal information will be used .
Stoddart cited one example from 2006 , when RCMP discovered lists of voters ' names and addresses at an office belonging to the Tamil Tigers , classed in Canada as a terrorist organization , which was allegedly using them to find people who might help them financially .
" When you get something as reliable , as organized , as a voters list in the wrong hands , this is arguably worth a lot of money in the underground economy , " Stoddart told reporters at a news conference .
She acknowledged that keeping track of the lists is a challenge , given that 190,000 temporary workers are hired during elections and laws governing elections require the distribution of voter information .
But she suggested that Elections Canada :
Boost its privacy training .
Develop a system for reporting data breaches .
She said it would also be " good practice " for political parties , MPs , and candidates to report losses or inappropriate use of the electoral lists to Elections Canada , even though they are not required to do so .
Elections Canada will purge minors ' data
Fraser presented her own report on whether the departments examined by Stoddart work together to manage the information efficiently in accordance with the law and collect only information that is relevant to delivering their programs .
She found that Elections Canada currently holds identity information on about 104,000 Canadians under the age of 18 , even though it is not authorized to do so because they are too young to vote .
That is because it gets data from provincial and territorial driver 's licence registries .
In response to the findings of the audit , Elections Canada said it will purge its database of information on Canadians under 18 and will ask suppliers to provide only information about adults .
However , the report found that for the most part , Elections Canada and the three other institutions audited collect only the information they are authorized to collect .
Data gathering incomplete or duplicated
Other findings in Fraser 's report included :
Federal departments have no national framework that allows them to work together in managing personal information .
That has resulted in duplication , repeated consideration of the same problems and incomplete solutions to problems .
Even though there have been electronic links between federal departments and provincial governments for 10 years , only some information is being collected electronically .
That means some individual federal organizations have separate agreements with provinces and territories to obtain and pay for information about people who have died , and then sometimes exchange information with each other about the same people .
Fraser said the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat needs to address the issues by providing clearer leadership in this area .
Overall , Stoddart said the government needs to strengthen privacy training for its employees .
With regard to the other departments in the audit , Stoddart found :
Service Canada has good policies to protect privacy , but does n't always follow them .
Canada Revenue Agency did not consider the privacy implications before automatically collecting social insurance numbers for between six and eight million children .
She noted that an earlier audit found Passport Canada also had some questionable personal data management practices .
For example , it kept applications in clear plastic bags and sometimes threw out personal information with regular garbage and recycling .
The privacy commissioner ’s mandate is to oversee compliance with laws governing the handling of personal information by federal government departments and the private sector , while the auditor general ’s mandate is to hold the federal government accountable for its spending of public funds .
Microsoft is investigating problems with gamers being booted off Xbox Live by malicious hackers .
Hackers are using data flooding tools in revenge attacks on fellow Xbox gamers .
Chris Boyd , director of malware research at Facetime Communications told BBC News : " There 's been a definite increase in the amount of people talking about and distributing these things over the last three to four weeks . "
" The smart thing about these Xbox tools is that they do not attack the Xbox Live network itself , " Boyd said , noting that the hackers are able to identify the IP address of the Xbox 360 hosting a game , then hit it with a Denial of Service ( DoS ) attack .
Data flooding woes
Boyd explains that hackers " get your IP address , put it in the booter tool and they attempt to flood the port that uses Xbox traffic .
Flooding that port prevents any traffic getting out . "
Microsoft said in a statement : " We are investigating reports involving the use of malicious software tools that an attacker could use to try and disrupt an Xbox LIVE player 's internet connection . "
" This problem is not related to the Xbox Live service , but to the player 's internet connection .
The attacker could also attempt [ to ] disrupt other internet activities , such as streaming video or web browsing , using the same tools . "
Air Force
One is a symbol of American power .
The 747 ’s presence , grandeur , and mythical stature never ceases to captivate audiences ( even when co-starring with Harrison Ford ) .
But despite Air Force
One ’s almost omnipotent qualities , I really do n’t know the yearly cost of the plane .
In my article on the operating expenses of the White House , I quoted Kenneth Walsh ’s ( low ) 2002 estimate in the Washington Post of $ 200 million a year .
The cost is probably far higher now , as Walsh 's figure fails to account for any measures aimed at beefing up security after September 11 and the rise in fuel prices since 2002 .
More recent estimates suggest that Air Force One costs $ 68,000 an hour ( mostly for fuel ) , but the yearly costs to operate the two 833,000 pound behemoths ( yes , the president has two of them ) are still a mystery .
One of the problems with calculating the cost is that part of the expense depends on the total travel hours , personnel costs , backup aircraft , and sometimes even ground transportation .
All of this can get pretty pricey .
In 2000 , one of Clinton ’s week long trips to Asia cost an estimated $ 63 million .
Sometimes these costs are lumped in with Air Force One ’s budget , and sometimes they ’re not .
Many of the costs are also classified , which makes them difficult to determine .
Since 2002 , Jet fuel prices have gone up about twenty per cent , so if I had to estimate , I would guess that Air Force One 's yearly operating expenses are somewhere between $ 240 - 280 million ( though even this estimate might be far too low ) .

Since Canada 's miniature constitutional crisis began a few weeks ago , I have come to realize that I am talking at cross-purposes with my fellow Canadians .
I have been misperceiving the statements by supporters of Stephen Harper 's government as a problem of political literacy .
Statements that it is " undemocratic " for a group of MPs representing 54 per cent of voters and 52 per cent of parliamentarians to attempt to govern have so distracted me with their inaccuracy and inconsistency with parliamentary tradition that I have fallen into explaining that Canadian democracy does not work the way they claim .
A leader of a party supported by 37 per cent of voters , holding 47 per cent of the seats in Parliament does not , based on any rules I know , have a " clear mandate " to rule unilaterally .
But that is not the point .
Political debates are not and never should be about how things are .
Politics is about how people think things should be .
To look at recent polls , it is clear that a clear majority of Canadians believe it should be illegal for a set of parties supported by the majority to rule our country if the party that received the largest number of votes in the last election does not lead that group .
They show a clear majority of Canadians do not believe that a government should require the confidence of a majority either of parliamentarians or of Canadians in order to govern .
Canadians want their government to be led the Prime Minister , not Parliament .
We do n't want the majority to rule but rather the largest plurality to do so .
My disagreement with the majority of Canadians is not , as many of us have been pretending , a civic literacy issue .
It is a civic values issue .
We leftists tend , erroneously , to believe ourselves more educated and intelligent than our opponents , that if we just " educate " people , they will come around to our point of view .
This does a disservice both to our opponents , by insulting their intelligence , and to ourselves by recommending stupid political strategies .
What if instead of believing Canadians do n't understand democracy , we consider the possibility that Canadians do n't like democracy ?
Democratic decision - making has three features : ( a ) public participation , ( b ) deliberation and ( c ) majority rule .
While 59 per cent of Canadians remain willing to participate , it is increasingly evident that the second and third aspects have lost buy - in .
Canadians prefer executive dictatorship to deliberation and negotiation ; and they prefer rule by substantial minorities to rule by the majority .
How have we come to this point ?
First , we need to look to our plurality voting system .
A system that awards representation to the winner of the most votes in a single riding , irrespective of their proportion of the vote ( recent elections have been won with as little as 29 per cent ) means that " false majorities " are routinely produced when the party garnering less than a majority of the vote wins a " majority government " by coming first in the majority of seats .
But in the past , Canadians did believe in deliberative democracy and majority rule , despite our flawed voting system .
Canadians expected Pierre Trudeau to co-govern during his minority government in 1972 and mocked Joe Clark for his failure to assemble a working parliamentary majority in 1979 .
He became an object of derision for his inability to assemble a voting majority in the Commons .
Contrast the mockery of Clark to the contemporary indignation towards the parties that could not bring themselves to vote for the mini-budget .
In the minds of most Canadians , it was not Harper who was at fault for failing to assemble a majority ; it was the opposition for defying his one - man rule .
And what appears to have transformed that anger into outrage and a massive windfall of support for the Conservatives was opposition parties ' plans to co-operate .
Again and again , open line show callers and bloggers stated , " nobody voted for the coalition . "
True .
But nobody voted for dismantling the nation 's political funding system or a fire sale of crown assets , or any of the other proposals in the mini- budget .
In the past , we have shown boundless tolerance for radical changes of direction after elections and the implementation of hitherto - unannounced policies ( e.g. the Chretien government 's radical reworking of social program funding ) or cancellation of prominent portions of parties ' platforms .
Obviously , there was something especially offensive about this particular deviation from campaign trail statements .
And I would suggest that it was the idea of a coalition itself that Canadians found offensive , the idea that decision - making should be collaborative , deliberative and based in the Commons rather than the Prime Minister 's Office .
Canadians had come to expect Prime Ministerial dictatorship .
And when it was n't delivered they were disappointed to see the potential end of the plurality - based executive autocracy they have enjoyed during both minority and " majority " administrations for more than a generation .
Current polls show that support for personal , autocratic governance transcends Canada 's right - left divide .
Even as an increasing majority of Canadians come to perceive Harper 's views as out of sync with theirs , a growing majority believe his government has the right to govern with or without parliament 's consent .
This belief comes from a shifting perception of what makes a government and its leader legitimate .
In most countries , the increasing diversity of political opinion has resulted in more proportional voting systems and coalition - building ; it has reinforced deliberation and negotiation in politics .
These changes have been made not simply out of respect for diversity but out of a growing demand for social and political order in the face of an increasingly diverse and atomized society .
Yet Canadians , motivated by the same anxieties , have chosen a different response .
We seek to vest power in the person who is most capable of fusing a subset of these atomized groups and individuals back into some kind of unified formation .
In our voting system , the most successful party is one best at reducing the number of choices its potential voters feel that they have .
A look at Liberal messaging shows that Jean Chretien became increasingly reliant on his ability to convince potential NDP and Green Party supporters to vote for his party .
And despite his antipathy for Chretien , Paul Martin intensified this approach .
What we missed during that time was how this change in Liberal tactics helped to change Canadian ideas of what made a legitimate government .
As the Liberals lost their capacity to intimidate left - of - centre voters , they lost power .
And Canadians learned a lesson : a government 's legitimacy comes not from its ability to appeal to the majority but instead from its ability to control and discipline its own supporters and potential supporters .
Of course , the Liberal Party 's fortunes were not the main way this lesson was imparted to Canadians .
They learned this best through the " unite the right " movements that began in 1997 .
The failure of the Canadian Alliance to limit competition and restrict choices available to conservatives was correctly portrayed as the reason that conservative Canadians failed to retake power in 2000 .
The democratic , voluntary processes set up by Preston Manning to concentrate the conservative vote were rejected as insufficient and conservative activists embarked on the project of the total eradication of one of their two parliamentary parties .
Stephen Harper 's instrumental involvement in the process of destroying the Progressive Conservative Party and restricting the choices of right - of - centre voters has come to be perceived by Canadians as the source of his and his party 's political legitimacy .
Canadians today perceive the basis of a leader 's legitimacy to rule stemming not from his ability to gain the support of the majority but his ability to control and discipline his electoral base by restricting their choices on their ballot and intimidating them into concentrating their votes more effectively than their competitors .
For Canadians , entitlement to rule comes not from the capacity to build a coalition representing the majority but instead from the capacity to discipline one 's core constituency .
This is why , much as they find these attributes of Harper personally distasteful at a human level , Canadians appear politically undaunted by the image of a Prime Minister who rules his party by fear and centralizes power in his own hands .
What offended Canadians about the likes of Randy White and other undisciplined , bigoted members of the Class of ' 93 Reformers was not their bigotry , per se .
It was the way their public statements demonstrated Manning 's inability to offer the discipline and control Chretien could .
While some see this is as evidence of the Americanization of Canadian politics , it is far more Russian than American .
Americans can barely comprehend the idea of an " official opposition , " because they assume that every single member of the legislative branch , just like the executive , part of the government and responsible for co-governing the nation .
Executive leadership is an American value .
Total executive hegemony , at least on this continent , is a thoroughly Canadian one .
Lest leftists misread this as an indictment of the right , let me be clear : this is a national problem .
One need only look at the City of Toronto , bastion of coalition support in recent weeks .
Municipally , NDP and labour leaders have vociferously supported creating a " strong mayor " system of municipal governance .
In Toronto , our NDP mayor and his supporters argue that our legislative body , the city council , is " dysfunctional . "
But instead of supporting reforms to the body , their solution is " to drain the power of council " into the mayor 's office .
New Democrats join Liberals and Conservatives in demanding the radical disempowerment of the legislature and concentration of power in a mayoral autocracy able to set civic policy without the consent of a legislative majority .
This should not surprise us .
For all the obfuscation of their public campaign , the most vociferous defenders of plurality voting and minority rule in the 2005 B.C. referendum on proportional representation were New Democrats , eager for the next time a right - wing vote split results a 39 per cent " majority " government for them .
Western NDPers internalized decades ago a belief the majority of Canadian voters are now coming to accept : what entitles you to rule is not the confidence of the majority but rather the relative discipline of your gang .
And in this model , coalition - building , deliberative governance and majority rule are the very opposite of political legitimacy in today 's Canada .

In my first contribution to Ouroboros , I reviewed a paper in which the authors found an allele of FOXO3A associated with long lived Japanese men .
So it seemed highly appropriate that I wrote the review for a follow - up paper : Flachsbart et al. analyzed 16 polymorphisms in the FOXO3A allele in 1,031 long - lived individuals ( 95 - 110 years old , 388 centenarians included ) and 731 younger controls .
They found that polymorphisms in the FOXO3A gene were significantly associated with German centenarians and human longevity .
Association of FOXO3A variation with human longevity confirmed in German centenarians
Here , we have investigated 16 known FOXO3A SNPs in an extensive collection of 1,762 German centenarians / nonagenarians and younger controls and provide evidence that polymorphisms in this gene were indeed associated with the ability to attain exceptional old age .
The FOXO3A association was considerably stronger in centenarians than in nonagenarians , highlighting the importance of centenarians for genetic longevity research .
Our study extended the initial finding observed in Japanese men to women and indicates that both genders were likely to be equally affected by variation in FOXO3A .
Replication in a French centenarian sample generated a trend that supported the previous results .
Our findings confirmed the initial discovery in the Japanese sample and indicate FOXO3A as a susceptibility gene for prolonged survival in humans .
The next exciting advances in our knowledge of the molecular function of the FOXO3A protein will address how these polymorphisms affect protein function to impart this long - lived phenotype .
FOXO3A ( a human homo of the worm gene daf - 16 , whose function is necessary for lifespan extension conferred by daf - 2 / IGF - I pathway mutations ) has been shown to play a role in insulin sensitivity , coronary heart disease , and diabetes which implicates FOXO3A as a “ master regulator ” that can regulate a wide variety of downstream targets which can have large effects on extending lifespan .

( CNN ) --
The owner of a Nebraska car dealership and two executives were in police custody facing theft charges Thursday after 81 cars were taken from the dealership 's lot , authorities said .
Alan Patch , 52 , who owns Legacy Auto Sales in Nebraska is being held in Tooele County , Utah .
Alan Patch , 52 , the owner of Legacy Auto Sales in Scottsbluff , Nebraska , was being held in Tooele County , Utah , Scottsbluff police Capt .
Kevin Spencer told CNN .
Rachel Fait , 37 , Legacy 's comptroller , was arrested in Tooele County on Wednesday , and Legacy general manager Rick Covello , 53 , turned himself in to Scottsbluff officials Thursday , Spencer said .
Police became aware of the case Tuesday , when they received a call from Toyota company officials , Spencer said .
Toyota told police they had received a call that all of Legacy 's new Toyotas were gone from its lot .
Employees arriving at the dealership for work on Tuesday also found the three executives gone , police said .
They had packed up their personal possessions .
Some computers were gone , as well .
Fait and Patch 's homes in Nebraska were on the market and empty , Spencer said .
In all , authorities found , 81 vehicles -- mostly Toyotas but some Fords as well , valued at more than $ 2.5 million -- had been moved off Legacy 's lot over the weekend and on Monday .
At least some of them were moved by a Utah transport company that was paid with a fraudulent cashier 's check , Spencer said .
Authorities have been trying to track down the cars , he said .
Seven of them were found at a Utah auto business ; 16 others were sold at a Utah auction .
Others were found in Las Vegas , Nevada , Spencer said , but police do not have an accurate tally of how many remain missing .
The FBI has been assisting local authorities in the case from the beginning , Spencer said .
The cars were n't the dealership 's to sell free and clear .
While they technically belonged to the dealership , they were financed by Toyota , he said .
New cars come to dealerships with documentation called a Manufacturer 's Statement of Origin .
Police investigating the case found that those statements had been converted to titles , Spencer said .
While such conversion is not a crime , and is not unheard of among dealerships , the step usually is seen when a dealership goes under and is trying to expedite the sale of vehicles , he said .
What a dealer can do with cars depends on a dealership 's agreement with the manufacturer , Spencer said .
Police are attempting to find out details of Legacy 's agreement with Toyota , he said , but " normally as part of that agreement , [ the cars ] are not to leave the dealership . "
" We 're of the opinion they 've committed a crime , " Spencer said .
Arrest warrants for the three list each as facing one count of felony theft , he said .
The dealership had been facing financial difficulties , Spencer said .
The Scottsbluff Star - Herald reported a bank had been overseeing Legacy 's day - to - day operations for about three months .
According to the newspaper , the owner of a Utah auto auction said that some of the vehicles had been sold at his business , but he declined further comment , saying he was seeking legal advice because he was trying to work things out with Toyota .
Doug Bergener , a manager at Bargain Buggys in Tooele , Utah , a suburb of Salt Lake City , told the newspaper he offered to buy 10 used vehicles from Legacy after hearing they were shutting down .
But the vehicles that arrived were brand new , he said .
He had sales pending on four before he got a call telling him not to sell them .
He told the Star - Herald that he 's known Patch and Fait for years , and that Patch told him he had paid for the vehicles and had titles .
" I do n't think anyone can prove anything 's illegal at this point , " Bergener said , according to the Star - Herald .
" We 've known Allen for 15 years and never knew him to do anything underhanded .
There 's been no reason not to trust him .
He 's always been honest .
It 'll all come out in the wash . "

In the BDSM lifestyle many people like to either give or receive a sign of ownership , for many subs / slaves it is the acknowledgement of belonging to a certain person , it tells others that they are spoken for and any interaction is to be at the agreement of their owner .
In many M/s or D/s relationships a collar is given in much the same way as a ring is given in a vanilla relationship .
Some Doms or Masters only use a collar during a scene whilst others require their property to wear a collar 24/7 while having a different one for play time .
The term collar is sometimes misleading , it is usually a collar that is worn around the neck , however it can also be a bracelet or a anklet , or a simple chain that is worn , what is important to many is that it is a sign for them that they are owned , but as so many work outside of the home , wearing a dog collar with slave or slut printed on it if you are a lawyer or a checkout assistant can cause some strange looks and conversations .
The collar is another way that many engage in humiliation with their sub or slave , leading them around the street on a lead is bound to lower their self esteem .
No matter what your opinion is on collars it is just another way that each can adapt the BDSM life to their needs , some subs or slaves feel they need to be collared and some know who they serve without the need for a collar , the same is true for Doms or Masters , some like to give them and some do not , its up to the individual as so much of this life is
Interactive Disassembler Pro v3.7 Demo ( II )
( How to load the previous databases )
by Quine
( 30 October 1997 )
Advanced cracking series Courtesy of Fravia 's page of reverse engineering
Well , this is SERIOUS ADVANCED CRACKING once more .
Once more a fundamental tool of the trade ( IDA ) .
Once more a function reenabling work ( the loading of the previous databases , i.e. one of the most important crippled functions of the crippled version : you do not want to start everything anew every time you use IDA , do you ? ) .
Once more something we all need : new knowledge that you can at once apply to other targets and reverse engineering endeavours .
Quine is getting us used to this kind of well - crafted essays .
I 'm afraid newbyes will not understand much here , please read the ' basic ' essays first , and peruse the other +HCU page ( where you 'll find a lot of help for newbyes ) before delving in this .
For all other Fravia : some considerations .
1 ) Read it twice ( at least ) what you 'll find daunting at the first quick glance will be understandable at the second and easy to follow at the third pass .
In my opinion if you read this at least a couple of times you will not even need to have a crippled IDA target on your HD to follow the path ;
2 ) Note how all this is built and buids on the contributes of others .
Quine is an extraordinary Fravia and a very good didact , witty and deep , whose mighty essays never forget ( as unfortunately some other do :-( to quote all contributions to the crumb trail he has followed and left behind ;
3 ) I believe it is time to tackle a VITAL sector : compiler specifities .
Actually that what we are doing is not very professional .
This has some advantages ( only non programmers can see the non-obvious ) and some disadvantages ( we find relocation tables and we do n't even know that they are called vtables :-)
Time to correct the disadvantages keeping the advantages .
Let 's begin to work on ' compiler specific differences ' or whatever you want to call that what we should understand perfectly if we really want to migrate from ' good dilettante ' to ' elite ' reverse engineers .
This said , here you have a real reverse engineering essay in all its glory ... enjoy !
Target : Interactive Disassembler Pro v3.7 Demo
We 're going to enable the loading of saved databases .
Source : http://www.datarescue.com/ida.htm ( homepage ) http://www.datarescue.com/ida/demo37.zip ( 9,884,100 bytes ) or , rather , ftp://195.0.122.253/pub/ida/375evl.zip ( thank Ed ! ) read on for more web resources :-)
Tools used : IDA Pro 3.7 itself ( nothing comes close to comparing to it ) SoftICE for NT v3.2 ( that new video driver is amazing ) ( if you ca n't get Pinnacle 's version to install , change the byte at 2B6C in setup.ins from 2B to B8 ) HexWorkshop32 ( for patching - any hex editor will do )
In this essay , I will assume that you are familiar with my previous essay here on Fravia +'s site about cracking the file size limit on the IDA Pro demo .
I am also assuming that you have ida.wll loaded into IDA Pro .
Ok , the first thing to do is to find the place where it puts up the message that it can't load old databases .
Our previous work on the file size limit suggests that this message will be in ida.hlp , which it is .
Using the method I outlined in that article , compute the index number for the help message and use IDA 's search for immediate function to find the place where 36Eh is moved into a register or pushed on the stack .
Sure enough , we find it early on at 403520 .
This routine is directly called anywhere in the program , but IDA very helpfully tells us that the value 403520 is referenced at 403D3 F ( actually it will give you the starting address of the function it occurs in and an offset , but I will usually translate that into an address in this article ) .
Follow the hyperlink and we find ourselves in a familiar place : just past the explicit file size check and before the rather vulgar expiration date check ( now would be a good time to patch it before you forget -- Jan 1st is n't that far away ) .
403520 is moved into ebx , then we get the expiration check , then call ebx .
But look , depending on the value of esi at 403CDE , either 403520 or 40352C is moved into ebx .
Let 's jump back to 40352C and see what 's going on there .
40352C calls two functions , one indirectly , and returns .
A little thought will tell you that this routine must be called when a new file ( i.e. , a file to be disassembled rather than a saved database ) is loaded into IDA .
Why ?
Well , we ought to assume that the expiration date is always checked and therefore , since execution follows immediately to the call ebx and we do n't get the message about loading old databases when we load new files ( obviously ) , it must call 40352C ( this can be verified in SoftICE if you feel like it ) .
Therefore , the value of esi at 403CDE must indicate whether or not we 've got a new file or a saved database .
This , unfortunately , is the point at which pedagogy must depart from actual practice , because explaining everything I tried at this point would take far too long and furthermore I can't even remember everything I did that might be significant .
Instead , I will attempt a rational reconstruction of the process and try to cover the major points of interest .
Remember , though , that this crack required a lot of tedious pouring through code and slowing but surely putting together a rather detailed picture of everything that IDA does between starting up and displaying the message saying that it can't load old databases .
I could not have hoped to put such a picture of IDA together without IDA itself .
The commenting and renaming features and all the other features that make it a truly interactive disassembler ( unlike w32 dasm which is basically a text viewer ) are what saved me hours of scratching done notes and trying to remember where I had been and what functions did what .
Enough of that and on with the crack .
There are two reasonable things to do here .
One is to trace back the value of esi and see how it gets set .
The other is to simply force the code to jump to 40352C no matter what .
Let 's try the second , but it sounds like more fun .
Fire up the text editor and change the byte at file offset 3340h from 20h to 2Ch .
Start up IDA , load a saved database and see what happens .
Well , it happens is that it crashes at location 44D2 BB trying to access memory at 00000064 .
That 's no good .
No memory access there for humble console applications .
Load up SoftICE and try it again .
Now when it crashes , we 'll be able to look at what 's going on .
Turns out that the function in which it crashes got a null pointer from sonewhere , because the offending instruction is mov edi , [ eax + 64h ] and eax is 0 .
This is bad news for us because there are any number of ways that that pointer could be set .
Also , patching the code to jump to 40352C could have introduced further problems .
This is a tough position to be in when cracking a target .
So , let 's sit back and evaluate the situation and try to gather everything we know about IDA 's start up code so far .
First , how perceptive where you when you loaded your old database ?
I 'll tell you that I ( stupidly ) was n't very perceptive at all for quite some time .
Part of the problem is that I was using as a test database one that I had created from the tiny hello.exe sample program included in IDA .
The fact that this program is small means that it disassembles quickly and produces a small database ( which is why I chose it ) .
With a bigger database what I 'm about to point out is much more obvious .
Look at the screen when you load the old database .
IDA allocates memory for the database , it unpacks the file , it compiles the default macro ( ida.idc ) and at least begins to execute it .
Furthermore , it does this whether you 've patched the program or not .
Only after having done all this does it display the mesg box / crash .
What does this tell us ?
Well , it tells that Mr. Guilfanov did not remove large sections of the code that have to do with loading saved files and furthermore that that code actually executes .
However , there 's still something that needs to be done to get the database loaded .
Here 's the crucial point : INSTEAD OF DOING THAT EXTRA THING , IDA CALLS THE ROUTINE THAT DISPLAYS THE MSG BOX .
In other words , the call to 403520 needs to be replaced with a call to a function that works the missing magic .
I would n't expect anyone to figure out this last point exactly without more work , because it certainly took me forever to figure it out , but it does seem rather obvious in hindsight .
Of course , we still do n;t know what the missing magic is or what function does it .
We do know that 40352C does n't do it .
Also , having 403520 simply return instantly does n't work either .
Now , let 's get back into SoftICE and learn a little more about our crashing patched program .
When the crash puts you into SoftICE , we 're going to walk the stack back as far we can go and find out where that null pointer comes from ( see my previous article on IDA for a description of my particular stack walking technique ) .
44D2 BB is sub_44D2 AC which was called at 417CC4 in sub_417CA4 .
eax came into sub_44D2 AC live and it was assigned a value just before the call in sub_417CA4 with the following command : mov eax , [ ebx+0 Eh ] .
Great .
Another pointer .
What are these pointers that have immediate values added to them ?
Brief digression about the importance of understanding the compiler
When I ask this question , I am asking " What is the program 's author doing here that causes the compiler to generate such commands ? " .
This is THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION a reverse engineer can ask him / herself when dealing with compiled code ( which is almost always unless you 're in a library routine where you should n't be in the first place ) .
No person wrote the code you are looking at .
Who would write the following ?
0041809A mov edi , edx 0041809C mov ebx , eax 0041809E mov edx , edi 004180A0 mov eax , ebx Only an idiot or a compiler .
This is taken straight out of ida.wll which was compiled by Borland C++ 5.01 with the optimization level set to maximize speed of execution ( I know because I have the makefile --- read on :-) .
Compilers just have their ways of doing things and it is very helpful to figure out just what those ways are .
End digression .
They are pointers into structures when the immediate value is not an address offset .
Here 's the situation .
You pass a pointer or a reference as an argument to a function and that function is then able to get at the members of the structure by adding values to the pointer that was passed .
Keep in mind , also , that the same goes for C++ classes ( but they have added complexities that I 'll get into in a moment ) .
So , in the struct / class based at [ ebx ] in sub_417CA4 there is a member at offset 0 Eh which is itself a pointer to a struct / class which in turn has another pointer at offset 64h and that pointer is 00000000h and we do n't want it to be .
On with the tracing !
sub_417CA4 is called at 417B89 , which is in sub_417B50 .
We see that again in this function ebx is used to hold the pointer to the struct .
( Since writing my last article , i have read that most Win32 compilers use ebx , edi , and esi as holders for enregistered local variables ) .
Anyway , it came in through eax from a call at 41E941 in sub_41E934 .
Here 's where we get our first break .
eax is assigned the address of export _637 .
Now , let 's dump the memory at _637 and see what we get .
What we get are mostly zeros and FFFFh at one point .
And of course at _637+0 Eh we get zeros .
However , significant progress has been made .
We can safely assume that the struct / class at _637 , which was declared at global scope in the program or else it would n't be able to be executed , is n't filled porperly .
Furthermore , this must be a fairly significant struct or else it would n't be exported .
Before we get too excited , though , let 's continue tracing backwards as far as we can .
There are quite a few functions that you will go through before you get back to the function that has the file size check , the expiration check , etc .
I wo n't go through all the details here , but it is worth looking at one function call in particular .
sub_422AF8 calls sub_403300 at 422B23 , but it does it with the following instruction : call dword ptr [ esi+2Ch ] .
This is interesting .
I trust that everyone has read Fravia +'s fine article on call relocation tables .
But now we must ask what these call relocation tables are .
Are they a structure or array of pointers to functions declared explicitly by the programmer ?
Almost always not .
In fact , the average programmer probably only has the vaguest idea that they exist at all .
They are an invention of the compiler used to deal with virtual function calls in C++ and are commonly referred to as vtables .
I am still working on the details of how they are implemented ( it differs from compiler to compiler and the optimization settings also affect it ) , but notice that the pointer to the beginning of the vtable is gotten in a fairly roundabout way .
You will see these offsets ( 7D9 , 7DD ) in other places in the program and if you get an indirect call right after that , you 'll be able to know which vtable you are dealing with .
This particular vtable starts at 489191 .
Another thing you know is that all the functions in a particular vtable are member functions of the same class and are therefore related .
Ok , so you end up in sub_403934 , which is the big routine that has the date check , etc. at loc_ 403E2E , which calls sub_408100 .
This tells us quite a lot .
First , the call to 40352C does not crash when we 're loading a saved file .
Second , an obvious test with SoftICE will tell us that sub_408100 is only called when a saved file is loaded .
That means that at 403E23 esi==0 if and only if we 're loading a database .
Furthermore , sub_408044 is n't called at 403E27 when we are loading a database .
Finally , at 403E33 , the load new file and the load database paths meet up .
Something has happened in the routines that handle loading a new file , that has n't happened in the routines that load a saved database and that something has to do with the struct / class at export _637 .
So , let 's start up IDA , load a new file , let it run for a minute and then break in with SoftICE and see what 's going on at _637 .
With ida.wll loaded into IDA , this is what I get ( remember , ida.wll is relocated to BB0000 on my machine ) : 00C47A74 09 00 00 FF 29 00 90 AE - C6 00 00 00 00 00 28 E6 00C47A84 C7 00 90 AE C6 00 E0 B8 - C6 00 B0 B8 C6 00 00 00 Good , we 've got some pointers in here .
In particular we 've got one at _637+0 Eh .
Dumping the memory at [ _637+0 Eh ] does n't tell us much ( try it ) , so let 's look at some of these other pointers : 00C6AE90 : 00401000 00489000 FF001CF5 FF001CF5 00C6AEA0 : 00000000 01000203 00010000 FFFFFFFF 00C6B8E0 : 00489000 004A1000 FF001CF6 FF001CF6 00C6B8F0 : 00000000 01000203 00020000 FFFFFFFF 00C6B8B0 : 004A118C 004A12 DC FF001CF7 FF001CF6 00C6B8C0 : 00000000 01000203 00030000 FFFFFFFF
Now we 're getting somewhere .
These ought to look familiar because the first two dwords at each pointer are the begin and end addresses of the various segments in ida.wll !
So , it looks like the struct at _637 holds information about all the segments in the open file .
No wonder the program could n't get anywhere without this information .
What we need to do now is figure out how to get this information out of the saved database and into the struct at _637 before getting to the call to sub_408100 .
Is this our missing magic that 403520 was supposed to do ?
Well , this is where I got stuck for a long time .
I pretty sure I knew what had to be done , but had no idea how to do it .
Furthermore , I was n't sure that this was the only thing that had to be done .
Where there other structures that needed to be filled in ?
I would n't know until I figured out how to get the segment structure filled in .
What saved me is what some might consider cheating , because it involves having access to way more information than you usually do when reversing .
Here 's the story .
On IDA 's US web site ( www.datarescue.com) there is a mention of an SDK ( Software Developer 's Kit ) for IDA that enables you to write processor modules for IDA ( see my first essay on IDA ) .
This sounded very helpful , but it was n't available for download .
They said to e-mail them for information on it .
So I did .
This was the response :
It is free to registered users of IDA Pro .
Have you registered your copy ?
Well , no , I was planning to crack my copy instead .
I went out in search of more information on IDA .
Maybe there was some out of the way web site containing more info .
There was and still is .
IDA is written by a brilliant Russian man named Ilfak Guilfanov and Mr. Guilfanov has his own IDA web site on a server in Russia ( http://www.unibest.ru/~ig/index.html ) .
Go there now and download everything you can , because it has , among other things , the IDA SDK .
The IDA SDK has very well commented C++ header files for most of the program .
This was an unimaginable boon .
Even better , it has a Borland lib file for accessing the exported functions in ida.wll .
This lib file conatins the real names of all those 500 + functions / global variables .
To get at this information , you need a program that dumps out the contents of Borland lib files ( which are a proprietary format ) .
tdump.exe , which is included in most Borland development products , does it , and you can easily find that or a freeware equivalent on the web .
Now you can go into IDA and start renaming the exports to their real names instead of those meaningless numbers .
Between the headers and the lib file I had more than enough to finish the job .
Sure enough , export _637 is called _segs ( this made me feel pretty good ) .
In the header files you can find a complete desription of the class object that resides there ( it 's an area control block ( areacb_t ) ) .
Furthermore , looking through the segment.hpp and area.hpp headers you 'll see some very interesting functions , including the following : // Link area control block to Btree .
Allocate cache , etc. //
Btree should contain information about the specified areas .
//
After calling this function you may work with areas .
.. some comments deleted ... int link ( const char * file , // Access to existing areas const char * name , int useva , int infosize ) ; // Initializa work with segments // Called by the kernel itself .
// file - name of input file void initSegment ( const char * file ) ; Btree is the database .
Calling one of these two functions seemed like the thing to do .
However , neither of them are exported by ida.wll , so we 've got to find them .
Finding them took a while , but I realized an interested fact about executable files in the course of doing it .
What determines where a particular function is put inside of an exe / dll / etc . ?
When a programmer compiles a project , each source file is compiled into .obj files , which contain the machine code to be processed by the linker .
The linker then combines all the obj files into the finished product , changing the addresses appropriately so that everything works out .
What does this mean ?
It means that all functions in the same source file will be adjacent to one another .
Now , of course , different programmers arrange their source files in different ways , but we still know that adjacent functions tend to be conceptually linked in some way .
Of course , when we have the header files , we have a very good idea where to look for functions .
To make a long story short , here 's how I found the link and initsegment functions .
First , we know in general where to look .
Second , we know what parameters each function takes and that they , like just about every function in ida.wll , were compiled with the __fastcall option ( see the appendix to my last essay ) .
Borland implements __fastcall in the following way : arg1 : eax arg2 : edx arg3 : ecx arg4 : last thing pushed on stack arg5 : second to last pushed etc .
I looked for link first because it has more arguments and ought to be easier to find .
Well , I found what I 'm pretty sure is it at sub_4399AC , but more importantly , in the course of looking , I found the right function which is initSegment ( with a name like that and given our problem , you may be wondering how I could have thought that any other function could possibly be the right one --- well , it was late and I 'd been looking at this program for days and managed to get myself to believe all sorts of crazy things about it ) .
initSegment is at sub_456D70 .
The first thing it does is call areacb_t : : create to create the _segs area control block .
It then calls another function which in turn calls link .
Ok , what we need to try now is to rewrite the function at sub_403520 to call initSegment .
However , we need to pass it the name of the EXE file that was saved in the database .
However , eax comes in sub_403520 with a pointer to the name of DATABASE file .
So , how do we get a pointer to the right filename ?
Well , in the course of studying IDA , I discovered that there is a very easy way to do this .
Look at this code snippet which is straight out of my ida.wll database : 00403DB0 mov eax , offset _RootNode ; idb specific 00403DB5 call @netnode@value$xqqrv ; netnode::value ( void ) 00403DBA push eax ; pointer to exe filename from dbase 00403DBB push 244h ; Database for file ' %s ' is loaded .
00403DC0 call @ Message$qie ; Message ( int , ... ) 00403DC5 add esp , 8 ; end idb specific
To get the filename pointer into eax , all we have to do is call netnode : : value and pass it the address of _ RootNode ( 4998B0 ) .
So , sub_403520 needs to be this : mov eax , 4998B0h call 425F5C ; netnode : : value call 456D70 ; initSegment ret Unfortunately , we 've got two problems .
( 1 ) This code takes 10h bytes and we 've only got 0Fh in the area of sub_403520 .
( 2 ) We 're referencing a global variable in a program that is inevitably going to be relocated .
That means that _RootNode is never actually going to be at 4998B0 .
Windows deals with this little issue in the .reloc section of PE files .
This section contains all the addresses of places in the program that make absolute reference to an address ( note the most jmp and call instructions use relative offsets and are therefore not affected by reloctaion ) .
The first problem is easy to get around .
Take a look at PNA 's essay on adding a save function to the demo of w32dasm .
We 'll just stick the code at the end of the CODE segment where there are about 190h free bytes .
The second problem involves patching the relocation table .
I wo n't describe the details of this table , because they are somewhat hairy and you can find many good descriptions other places .
The best I have seen is in the ESSENTIAL and INVALUABLE book " Windows 95 System Programming Secrets " by Matt Pietrek ( a NuMega employee no less ) , but descriptions of the PE file format are a dime a dozen on the web ( I think there is even one on the site ) .
Let 's start patching .
First thing is change the value assigned to ebx at 403D3 F to point to our new routine .
We 're going to put the routine at 488875 , right after the dll import jump stubs .
So , patch 403D3 F mov ebx , offset loc_403520 to 403D3 F BB 75 88 48 00 mov ebx , offset loc_488875
Notice that we do n't have to worry about relocations here because there already was an absolute address reference at the location where we 've stuck the new one , so the loader already knows to fix it up .
Now , let 's insert our new routine : 488875 B8 B0 98 49 00 mov eax , 4998B0h 48887A E8 DD D6 F9 FF call 425F5C ; netnode :: value 48887F E8 EC E4 FC FF call 456D70 ; initSegment 488884 C3 ret
The last thing left to do is patch the relocation table .
We need the dword at 488876 to be adjusted .
The necessary patch is to change the two bytes at offset 96DA4 in ida.wll from 00 00 to 76 38 .
I 'll leave it as an exercise to figure out exactly how this works if you do n't already know .
Here a small correction : the relocation table patch must be applied to locations 9EDA4 and 9EDA5 , not 96DA4 and 96DA5 , as Quine says .
It may be a Tipo. greets as usual zeezee Now , the moment of truth .
Run it .
Load a database .
It works .
That 's it .
I really did n't think it would work , to be honest .
I assumed that all the other global areacb_t's ( _funcs , etc. ) would have to be initialized also .
That , however , gets done eventually in the call to sub_408100 .
Could I have done it without the header files and the export names ?
Who knows .
If I could have , it 's not entirely clear that I would n't have given up in frustration after weeks of trying before I ever got it .
I was glad to know that I was at least on the right track .
Demo function enabling is what I suppose that I find most enjoyable in cracking and I have a word of advice to demo writers : TAKE AS MANY FUNCTIONS AS YOU CAN OUT OF THE DEMO .
Mr. Guilfanov took one very small function out and left in a ton of code that he never intended the demo to execute .
With those functions gone , it is simply impossible barring an act of God to re-enable the function .
I do n't care how good a cracker you are .
There would be no concievable way to reconstruct what happens in the call to 408100 .
Future Plans for IDA Pro First , enable the saving of ASM files .
This code really is gone from the demo , but with the information I have about the program , I 'm half way there .
It 's going to involve inserting rather a lot of code in the target , so hopefully I 'll come up with tricks for that .
Second , and more interesting , adding features .
This can be done in part through the IDC macro language , but also through code patching .
To get an idea of the features I have in mind , check out http://www.cs.uq.edu.au/groups/csm/dcc.html and anything you can find written by Cristina Cifuentes ( she is truly BRILLIANT ) .
DCC is a full fledged DOS deCOMPILER !
That 's right , it kicks out real C code .
Admittedly this can be done only to a limited extent with large and complex programs , the concepts she discusses are very deep and important for understanding how to reverse engineer .
Ilfak Guilfanov has certainly read her work ( see his web site ) .
Well , I 'm tired and I am very behind in my work .
Good Night .
And you better do n't joke with this request of Quine either , because I 'll find out if you do .
Fravia+ , I was wondering if you could add to my essay (s ) the note that I would very much like for no one to release the cracks to IDA as crack programs ( those vulgar little .com files ) on the web or for anyone to publish the cracks without the full essay .
I have too much respect for the author of the program to have the demo crack tossed about the web for people who are not serious about reverse engineering .
He has written such a beautiful program that those of us who really cannot afford to buy it ought to - at least - earn the right to use it .
Thanks ,
Quine

With so many details left unsolved , much more work will have to be done , again creating uncertainty for investors .
" It 's going to be fine - tuned many times over , " predicts Quincy Krosby , chief market strategist at The Hartford .
" Given the enormity of the problem it 's clear that certain parts will work and certain parts wo n't work , but it 's a start . "
The market is clamoring to know how the government will be able to help banks with their toxic assets while also protecting investors and taxpayers from getting blindsided if the fixes do n't work .

" We 're still back to the old problem of how you price that , how you structure that . "
3. Treasury Bubble Still Popping
While Treasurys rallied Tuesday on a further flight to safety , government debt prices are likely to fall as more and more supply comes on line while the government finances the bank rescue .
For Investors
The predicted trend reflects the difficulty the government will face getting a premium on bills it will be in a hurry to unload .
" The idea that you can just borrow and spend , borrow and spend , run ever - larger deficits and essentially print money with no consequences is economically naive , " says Mike Larson , analyst for Weiss Research 's Money & Markets newsletter .
" Yet no one seems to be talking about the unintended consequences until now . " '
Larson called the popping of the bond bubble months ago and sees the trend continuing as the government accumulates more and more debt .
Moreover , he said the pressure on Treasurys will cause interest rates to rise and thwart hopes of mortgage rates falling to 4.5 percent or even lower , a prediction made Mondayby Bill Gross , co-CEO of Pimco , the world 's largest bond fund .
" The longer - term trend is clearly for lower prices and higher rates as a result of this supply issue , " Larson says .
Formal semantics for side effects
Blog » Formal semantics for side effects
Posted on
Got an idea for formal semantics for operations with side - effects like IO operations , random , etc .
It 's inspired by Haskell 's use of Category Theory as a semantic device and by the Z specification language ( the ISO Standard is downloadable ; see the small print below the price list .
An outdated but still useful manual is here . )
The idea in brief is that we model the world as a category W , whose objects are events and whose sole arrow is a precedence operator ( >- , \ succ in LaTeX ) .
What the events represent specifically is irrelevant ; we only care about an event " input 'c ' " as an abstract event .
Think of this as the infinite list of events that contains all possible permutations of real world events .
To provide the semantics of the execution of a program P , we establish an isomorphism between it and W .
The isomorphism maps " opaque " terms ( e.g. IO terms , random values , etc. ) to events .
Ordering is preserved by some kind of rule mapping textual precedence in P to event precedence in W .
In other words , to model a particular execution of P we incorporate a subset of W into the semantic domain .
The static semantics of P are expressed only in the semantic domain , excluding W .
Now the meaning of the program is the text of P , its mapping to a semantic domain ( the usual denotational mapping for e.g. ' 3 ' ) , plus the set of all possible isomorphisms between opaque terms and W .
The actual exposition is a little more complicated than that , but this conveys the general idea .
This allows us to express program semantics , including dynamic semantics , in a rigorous , formal model that completely excludes any hint of dynamics , contingency , side - effects , etc .
The notion of evaluation is also eliminated .

The Unusual Suspects
Researchers are uncovering some pretty strange culprits behind the obesity epidemic — everything from air - conditioning to infectious love handles
US drones loomed large in the skies over North Waziristan today , flying over villages and sewing panic in a region which has seen scores of residents killed in attacks by those drones over the past few months .
On Friday similar drones killed 22 people , including several children .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told the Senate today that it is the Obama Administration ’s intention to continue the attacks , in spite of the repeatedly objection of the Pakistani government .
When asked , Gates also confirmed that the Pakistani government had been informed of the plan to continue the attacks .
The government has refused to comment directly on its individual attacks , but officials seem almost universal in their agreement that the Bush era practice of unilateral strikes on the territory of an ally should continue , no matter how much relations with that ally are harmed by them .
The Kindle works through your Amazon account ; the same account you use to buy physical products from Amazon .
Each Kindle must be linked to a particular Amazon account , which is then used for payment if and when you buy books on the Kindle itself .
You can link your account to multiple Kindles .
After buying a book through Amazon , download the book to your Kindle at any time and delete it from that Kindle at any time .
Deleting a book from one Kindle does not prevent you from downloading it to , or keeping it on , another Kindle using the same account .
Multiple people can use the same account by sharing the ID of the account and the password .
This means two people can each read the same book on their own Kindles , even though only one of them has bought it .
The Pine Bluff Arsenal , a United States Army installation in Arkansas , specializes in chemical and biological weapons .
The military touts them as the only facility in the Northern Hemisphere which fills white phosphorus munitions .
That ’s the important point here , as it once again ties the US military directly into the Israeli war in the Gaza Strip , and one of its most unseemly practices .
State Department officials told the Associated Press that the United States provided Israel with white phosphorus rounds , and photos taken during the Israeli conflict show the military readying rounds with Pine Bluff Arsenal serial numbers .
The use of white phosphorus is not in and of itself a war crime , and is generally considered acceptable as a means of obscuring troop movements or illuminating areas .
Its use in civilian areas however , even if not directed at the civilian population , is banned under the Geneva Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons .
Preliminary investigations show indisputable evidence that Israel used white phosphorus in some of the most densely populated portions of Gaza , and still burning fragments were found after the war ended wedged into civilian buildings .
The Israeli military officially denied using such munitions during the war , though they eventually conceded to it .
Their official story now is that the use was not illegal and that Hamas was the one committing war crimes by provoking such attacks .
The treaty prohibits the use of such weapons against military targets in civilian regions however , and makes no exception allowing the nation violating it to transfer blame to others in case they really wanted to hit those targets .
What does this have to do with sound systems or entertainment technology ?
Many people do n't realize that sound , which travels only about 1,130 feet per second ( depending on the temperature ) , actually travels way , way slower than light , which travels at roughly 186,000 miles per second .
This accounts for why when you see a lightning flash , you generally hear the thunderclap seconds later .
And so , when we have a sound system where we want people to hear some distance away from the stage , sound system engineers have to take this into account .
Speakers at a distance from the stage ( like at the concert pictured in the video ) must be intentionally delayed to get them to line up in time with the sound emanating from the stage .
This happens because the electrons in the cables transfer the audio signal out to the delay speaker positions effectively , for our purposes , " instantly " , while the sound waves , vibrating air molecules , can take many seconds to travel .
And if the " delay " speakers , remote from the stage , are not aligned in time ( even milliseconds matter ) , the audience will hear either destructive interference called " comb filtering " , or perceive an echo .
( Interestingly , from what I saw on screen , it appears that the large video displays on the mall were actually delayed to match the slowness of the sound . )
Keep all this in mind the next time you are at a large concert !

Space Keynesianism :
All hail the grand architects of our renewed prosperity , Ben Bernanke ( nearest to the nosecone ) and Tim Geithner ( straddling a fin ) , who for some reason decided to bring along Harry Paulson ( clinging to the underside of the rocket ) .
“ At this very moment , the President of the United States is announcing a New Age of Space to relieve unemployment .
Billions of dollars are going to be spent on unmanned space ships , just to make work .
The opening episode in this New Age of Space will be the firing of The Whale next Tuesday .
The Whale … will be loaded with organ - grinder monkeys , and will be fired in the general direction of Mars . ”
~ From The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut
Well , why not ?
If the secret to prosperity is simply to permit the government to spend money it does n’t have in any quantity our rulers can imagine , why should n’t they commission the construction of a huge fleet of spacecraft to be filled with organ - grinder monkeys and dispatched into the void ?
Or why not emulate the ancient Egyptians under the tyrant Cheops by commissioning an immense mausoleum to stand in eternal testimony of our bold and visionary ruler , Pharaoh Obama the First ?
According to Herodotus , Cheops achieved full employment by enlisting nearly the entire population to build his legendary pyramid — but this was done by depleting the treasury so thoroughly that the ruler had to sell his own daughter into slavery to raise the funds for some forgettable and long - effaced bit of decorative filigree .
The same ancient historian observes that for centuries after Cheops died , the Egyptians refused so much as to utter his name ( or that of his equally despicable brother , Chefren ) , so reviled had he become on account of his tyrannical profligacy .
Pointless expenditures on space exploration or construction of monuments to the vanity of the ruling class would actually make more sense than the Regime ’s present course , which is to ruin the currency in a doomed effort to save a terminally insolvent banking system .
The $ 3.8 trillion budget disgorged by the regime of Obama the Magnanimous includes a budget deficit of nearly $ 1.8 trillion — a figure , as the observant Anthony Gregory points out , roughly equivalent to the entire federal budget in the year 2000 .
When budgets and annual deficits go hyperbolic , hyperinflation is sure to follow .
But the cruelly amusing fact is that neither Obama nor the gallery of trained seals called Congress is in charge of the public purse .
Sure , Obama can propose a budget and Congress can ratify it on a party - line vote , but the real economic power now resides with the Commissar for Official Counterfeiting , Ben Bernanke , and the Commissar for Fiscal Fraud , Tim Geithner .
Obama is seeking to salve the electorate ’s economic wounds with oleaginous words about hope , change , and determination .
Meanwhile , Geithner — as pure a product of the bankster elite as ever drew an undeserved breath — is “ finishing touches on a plan that will dump $ 1 trillion of toxic assets on the US taxpayer , ” warns Mike Whitney of CounterPunch .
“ The plan , which goes by the opaque moniker [ of ] the ` Public - Private Investment Fund ’ ( PPIF ) , is designed to provide lavish incentives to hedge funds and private equity funds to purchase bad assets from failing banks .
It is a sweetheart deal that provides government financing and guarantees for illiquid mortgage - backed junk for which there is no active market . ”
There is other mischief afoot behind the obscuring barricade of official acronyms .
First came TARP ( Troubled Assets Relief Program ) , which was supposedly intended to buy up bad mortgage - backed securities , but in practice was an open - ended conduit of funding to prop up any corrupt financial institution of the Treasury Secretary ’s choice .
Now we confront the Fed ’s Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) , which will open for business in a few days .
TALF will provide another $ 1 trillion to finance the purchase of securities backed by new classes of failing loans — credit cards , auto loans , small - business loans .
We can expect TALF , like TARP , to gain considerable girth as the depression deepens .
The same is true of the PPIF , which was created by the Fed and the Treasury Department on their own supposed authority without specific congressional authorization .
( Remember , TARP removed Congress from this equation . )
That new “ public - private partnership ” — a euphemism for a corporatist , which is to say fascist , entity — amounts to what financial analyst Kevin G .
Hall calls “ a blank check to ensure that the top banks — those with assets over $ 100 billion — remain solvent . ”
Beginning in late April , as Hall explains , squads of federal regulators will start administering “ stress tests ” to the 19 largest banks .
Those found to be “ under - capitalized ” will be given six months either to raise capital in private markets , or to “ ask for a capital buffer from the government . ”
The PPIF begins with a ridiculously low credit pool of $ 500 billion , with a provision to expand immediately to $ 1 trillion .
But as Hall says , the program is , in principle , “ a virtually unlimited solvency guarantee ” to the nation ’s 19 largest banks .
This means that it could keep pouring “ liquidity ” — that is , inflation - debauched dollars — into the banking system until the Fed runs out of zeroes .
This is where the really bloody business of butchering the middle class is taking place .
Apart from occasional fits of televised grousing , Congress has no role in the process , having abdicated its constitutional control over public expenditures to the Treasury Department last September .
So when Obama the Munificent , framed — appropriately enough — by the fasces that decorate the wall in the well of the House of Representatives , invited Congress to gorge itself on a new menu of spending programs , this gesture was a bit like conferring a consolation prize on the second - place finisher in a two - man competition .
As he sketched , in vague outline , a campaign to enlarge what is already the largest and most expensive government in human history , His Holiness Obama the Blessed declared : “ I do not believe in bigger government . ”
That odd and discordant sentence begs the question , bigger than what ?
A reasonable surmise would be that Obama meant something along the lines of the following : “ I believe in a government somewhat bigger than Betelgeuse , but no bigger than Antares . ”
The best summary of Comrade Obama ’s Address to the Central Committee may be the one offered by an enraptured Ross Douthat of The Atlantic :
“ [ Obama ] laid out the most ambitious and expensive domestic agenda of any Democratic President since LBJ , and did it so smoothly that you ’d think he was just selling an incremental center - left pragmatism .
I think that he has an acute sense — more acute than most people in Washington , probably — of just how much running room is open in front of him at the moment , and he intends to make the absolute most of it …
It was the speech of a man seeking to turn a moment of crisis into a domestic - policy revolution … .
Now all he has to do is find a way to pay for it . ”
Hey , no problem : Obama can always whip out his Presidential Express Card ( neither Gold nor Platinum being sufficiently rare and precious to provide the required cachet , Obama ’s is a Moonrock Card , with an astronomical spending limit ) .
As long as Geithner and his minions can sell Treasury Debt , the government can keep the party going .
When foreigners decide to dump their T - bills , and Bernanke sends his printing presses into hyperdrive , we ’ll thus have the opportunity to experience all the romance and enchantment of distant , exotic Zimbabwe — without leaving the comfort of our own homes .
Assuming any of us still has a home by then .
Obama ’s speech to Congress , while heavy on facile uplift and melodrama , was almost entirely devoid of humor .
I must admit that the speech managed to wrench one bitter chuckle from me when Obama announced that a “ Day of Reckoning ” had arrived .
That phrase would make sense if the government over which Obama presides were to permit the market to function .
This would mean mass liquidation of bad assets and , yes , continued and deepening deflation .
It would mean the immediate end to two foreign wars and rolling up the infrastructure of Washington ’s global empire .
It would hurt like hell for a few years , and then recovery would begin .
What Obama apparently meant by “ Day of Reckoning , ” however , was something along these lines : “ My spendthrift predecessor somehow neglected to destroy every pocket of prosperity and productivity left in this economy — so I reckon it ’s up to me to finish that job . ”
As the indispensable Peter Schiff points out , a genuine Day of Reckoning is inevitable , and it will come “ when our money is worthless , and the rest of the world will no longer take our [ government ] paper . ”
When the actual Day of Reckoning arrives , one of three scenarios will play out :
Sanity will seize our population and our chastened political class will restore the foundations of the pre-1913 ( or , better yet , pre-1861 ) political system .
Yeah , I do n’t think so either , but it is a possibility .
The productive elements of the population will divorce themselves from the parasitical ruling class and its client constituencies , eventually creating some kind of loose confederation .
While the parasites wo n’t surrender their host without a violent struggle , this is probably the best we can hope for .
We ’ll see the Regime continue to inflate , spend , and regiment the population until we achieve the ne plus ultra of Keynesian economics :
The government will achieve full employment by forcing all of us to build immense pyramids out of its useless , unwanted fiat currency .
( My sincere apologies for traducing the Three Stooges by comparing them to federal political appointees . )
The Best of William Norman Grigg
Sanjay Gupta ( loc.gov )
Drug reformers busily poring over the tea leaves in an effort to discern the drug policy intentions of the incoming Obama administration have found little solace in the announcement that it will nominate Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the position of surgeon general .
One of America 's most famous doctors , Gupta is a neurosurgeon who also doubles as a correspondent for CNN and CBS News .
The Obama administration offer came after a two - hour meeting between Gupta and Obama in Chicago in November .
At that meeting , Obama told Gupta he would have an expanded role in providing health policy advice and would be the highest - profile surgeon general in history .
Gupta has a history in health policy .
He served as a White House fellow in the 1990s , writing speeches and advising Hillary Clinton on health policy issues .
He is also an accomplished , telegenic communicator .
While he has received criticism from some quarters for being too friendly with big pharmaceutical companies and from others for wrongly accusing filmmaker Michael Moore of falsehoods in his documentary " Sicko , " it is his old - school views on marijuana that are raising hackles in drug reform circles .
Most famously , in a November 2006 editorial in Time magazine , Gupta , while acknowledging marijuana 's medical benefits for some patients , went on to repeat a raft of long - debunked anti-marijuana myths as reasons for opposing marijuana reform initiatives on the ballot in Nevada and Colorado that week .
In Gupta 's words :
" Maybe it 's because I was born a couple of months after Woodstock and was n't around when marijuana was as common as iPods are today , but I 'm constantly amazed that after all these years -- and all the wars on drugs and all the public - service announcements -- nearly 15 million Americans still use marijuana at least once a month .
California and 10 other states have already decriminalized marijuana for medical use .
Two states -- Colorado and Nevada -- are considering ballot initiatives that would legalize up to an ounce of pot for personal use by people 21 and older , whether or not there is a medical need .
" What do voters need to know before going to the polls ?
" The first is that marijuana is n't really very good for you .
True , there are health benefits for some patients .
Several recent studies , including a new one from the Scripps Research Institute , show that THC , the chemical in marijuana responsible for the high , can help slow the progress of Alzheimer 's disease .
( In fact , it seems to block the formation of disease - causing plaques better than several mainstream drugs . )
Other studies have shown THC to be a very effective antinausea treatment for people -- cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy , for example -- for whom conventional medications are n't working .
And medical cannabis has shown promise relieving pain in patients with multiple sclerosis and reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients .
" But I suspect that most of the people eager to vote yes on the new ballot measures are n't suffering from glaucoma , Alzheimer 's or chemo - induced nausea .
Many of them just want to get stoned legally .
That 's why I , like many other doctors , am unimpressed with the proposed legislation , which would legalize marijuana irrespective of any medical condition .
" Why do I care ?
As Dr. Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , puts it , " Numerous deleterious health consequences are associated with [ marijuana 's ] short - and long - term use , including the possibility of becoming addicted . "
" What are other health consequences ?
Frequent marijuana use can seriously affect your short - term memory .
It can impair your cognitive ability ( why do you think people call it dope ? ) and lead to long - lasting depression or anxiety .
While many people smoke marijuana to relax , it can have the opposite effect on frequent users .
And smoking anything , whether it 's tobacco or marijuana , can seriously damage your lung tissue .
" The Nevada and Colorado marijuana initiatives have gained support from unlikely places .
More than 33 religious leaders in Nevada have endorsed the measure , arguing that permissive legalization , accompanied by stringent regulations and penalties , can cut down on illegal drug trafficking and make communities safer .
" Perhaps .
But I 'm here to tell you , as a doctor , that despite all the talk about the medical benefits of marijuana , smoking the stuff is not going to do your health any good .
And if you get high before climbing behind the wheel of a car , you will be putting yourself and those around you in danger . "
Whether Gupta if confirmed will support medical marijuana -- as opposed to mere THC - based pharmaceuticals such as Marinol -- or do good for drug policy reform in other ways , remains to be seen .
And he did demonstrate a willingness to acknowledge some of the arguments made by the other side .
But his apparent blindness to the harm caused to marijuana users by arrest and incarceration is not a great first sign .
Change we can believe in for drug policy ?
Only time will tell .
I met Chris Kim in September , 2005 in Boston .
A tiny Korean guy with thin eyes hidden behind thick glasses under a well - worn and faded ball cap , he looked kind of mousy under awkwardly baggy clothes and behind a soft voice .
And even though neither of us drank much , we met at a bar — me speed - sucking a gin and tonic through a needle - thin straw , him warming a well - nursed beer and occasionally taking baby sips .
When he mentioned he was from Boston , I asked about the Red Sox and he played along well enough .
“ Big win last night , ” he offered cautiously .
“ Maybe still have a chance at the playoffs ? ”
Of course , that launched me on a rant about the bullpen and whether Curt Shilling had enough steam for another big run .
He nodded on , listening intently , asking genuine and serious questions , and letting our friendship take root over sports , of all things .
Of course , he never watched the stuff , but was nice enough to let me talk mindlessly about it all night .
Full of wry smiles , awkward pauses , and mock - serious faces , Chris was a complex , fascinating , creative person who grew into a remarkably close friend during the two years I lived in the US .
He got excited about little things , like caramelizing onions perfectly for an hour on low heat , getting randomly selected to fill out a survey of his radio habits , or learning a new keyboard shortcut in Microsoft Excel .
But it was n’t the bar scene that helped our friendship bloom .
It was the car scene .
Yeah , when I showed up to school on our first winter morning shivering to the bone in a flimsy nylon coat , my hair wet , my face dripping , Chris asked where I lived and if I needed a ride the next day .
As I was at that moment toweling my face off with a fistful of balled up Kleenex , I took him up on it right away .
( Lucky for me Chris had signed up to be a senior student in an undergrad residence way off campus , spending his free time for two years chaperoning social events , holding heads above toilets , and editing two or three resumes a night on a steady clip . )
Anyway , he began picking me up every morning for the next two years , probably at least a couple hundred rides , never once accepting money for gas because , as he said , “ I ’m going that way anyway . ”
When other students heard about my taxi service , they got in on it , too .
It started with a “ Hey Chris , if there ’s a blizzard tomorrow , can I catch a lift ? ” , and turned into Chris emailing three or four of us each night , giving us the Bus Schedule , as he called it , timed precisely to the minute for the next morning .
And so it went — us piling into his car after he ’d spent the first few minutes warming it up for us , tightly blanketed in fat mittens and his trademark big blue hat .
Two years later , in Spring , 2007 , Chris and I went on a three week roadtrip with our friend Ty , which I ’ve mentioned before here and here .
Not too long after the trip began , we started joking about how much Chris was text - messaging his friends .
It was non -stop , how in touch he was constantly with people .
“ Jake says hi , ” he ’d deadpan , his back facing the Grand Canyon , surrounded by people all looking the other way .
Eventually , he made a joke of it , letting us take photos of him obliviously focused on his cell phone in front of every big site we stopped at .
He absolutely loved the gag and laughed wildly before and after each photo .
Last year I nervously started up this page , tentatively dipping my toe into cyberspace where anyone could see .
Chris of course adopted his Mexican half - brother pseudonym San Carlos and peppered us with comments of support from the get - go .
On # 1000 Broccoflower , he wrote “ My policy is to avoid all foods that look to be from outer space .
Eggplant .
Mushrooms .
And , apparently , broccoflower . ”
On # 885 Paying for something with exact change he wrote “ I save all my pennies in my car .
And then , the next time I do McDonald ’s drive - through , I fling all the pennies into the server ’s face . …
No , actually , I put the pennies into the Ronald McDonald ’s House box right underneath the window . ”
On # 859 Playing with a baby and not having to change its diaper he wrote “ I do n’t mind changing my nephews diapers .
It only got weird when they began to talk .
Awkward ! ”
I loved his sense of humor and his way about himself .
I loved how he laughed , frequently , at little things , and got so excited about tiny details most people overlooked .
Chris and I spoke three or four times a week over the past year , in ten or fifteen minute snippets usually , but sometimes for an hour or two .
He ’d tell me about the sourdough bread he was going to bake that day , the elaborate meal he had planned for friends coming for dinner , or the New York Times article he read that I should check out .
I would ask him for ideas for this page — he had plenty — and occasionally go on long rants about sports .
Chris died suddenly this past week .
He was 32 .
No amount of the usual closing rhyming couplets or fist - to - the - sky proclamations are going to bring him back .
But I know he ’s in a peaceful place and would want us all to just be happy , keep plugging , and enjoy our lives as full as we can .
So thank you , Chris .
You ’ll always inspire me .
And you ’ll always be so incredibly awesome .

Ask Jeremiah : Comprehensive FAQ Guide to Twitter
What are common terms and phrases I need to know ?
Do I Tweet or Twitter ?
Twitter , which evolved from simple status messages to now a global conversation , is referred to in a number of times .
Asking folks : “ Are you on Twitter ” is appropriate .
When you want to use Twitter , and want to refer to it as a verb , it ’s appropriate to say “ I ’m Twittering that ” .
However , it ’s more appropriate to say to say , “ Did you Tweet that ? ” .
( verb conjugation )
It is never appropriate to suggest “ I ’m twatting now ” .
I just joined , now what ?
I do n’t get it .
Twitter on it ’s own makes little sense , why ?
It ’s a social tool and this means you have to follow others .
First , use the address import tool to add folks that are in your Yahoo mail and Google mail .
Secondly , do searches for people you may know to find them .
If Twitter search does n’t ’ work or the “ Find people ” search , use Google and seasrch “ First Last Twitter ” to find folks .
Once you find people you do know ( or want to know ) see who they are following , and add them .
You can always add me , but you should first see how I use Twitter .
Who gives a donk what I ate for lunch , can I talk about something else ?
Yes , talk about anything you want .
The twitter question “ what are you doing now ” is n’t the most effective way of using the tool .
Instead , answer this question “ What ’s important to me ” or better yet “ What ’s important to my followers ” .
Also , engage in dialog , ask questions and answer others questions using the reply feature .
Why 140 Characters ?
140 characters is the size limit of text messages using SMS , since Twitter integrates well with mobile devices , you can text to “ 40404 ” and enter in 140 characters to tweet from your phone .
Also , 140 characters is a true bite sized chunk of information making it easy to consume and create –ideal for rapid sharing of ideas .
Loughlin reminds us that the true maximum payload of SMS can actually be 160 characters .
How do I use the reply feature ?
Easy .
When you see someone ’s tweet , there ’s a small ‘ arrow ’ next to their tweet .
If you feel like responding to them , click that arrow and it will automatically load their name into the text box .
Type your answer in 140 characters and submit .
This will make conversations easier to track and find .
How come people do n’t write in normal English in Twitter ?
Good question , due to it ’s limited 140 characters style of publishing , Twitter has formed it ’s own unique nomenclature , similar to how users of pagers in the 90s developed shortened codes and how text message have developed their own digital shorthand .
Often you ’ll hear people use Twinglish , a combination of “ Tw ” plus other English words like “ Twello Texas ” .
It ’s cute once in a while , but can grate on ones nerves after a while .
Twanks Tweeple .
What is a “ DM ” ?
DM stands for “ Direct Messages ” which suggests that an individual can message another individually using the private messaging system ( like email ) to other members .
You can only DM users that are following you .
You may hear individuals say “ DM me for details about conference discounts ” suggesting the user wants to take the discussion private .
Do note that Twitter ’s DM system still resolves in 140 characters and is fairly primitive , many conversations may naturally shift to email , or even the archaic phone !
Question :
What does “ RT ” or “ Retweet ” mean ?
One of the greatest aspects of Twitter is how quickly word of mouth spreads globally .
If a user thinks another users tweet is interesting , they may choose to retweet what they say .
In this instance , the member will repeat what the twitter user said .
Example : “ Did Jeremiah got a doctorate in Twitter ? ” if a second user sees this and agrees , they will echo it back in the following way : “ Retweet : @ Jowyang Did Jeremiah got a doctorate in Twitter ? ” .
In a shortened version , they may also use RT , an abbreviated version of Retweet , it would go like this : “ RT : Did Jeremiah got a doctorate in Twitter ? ” .
And in case you ’re wondering , no I did n’t get a doctorate in Twitter , but I did get my undergrad in Twitter .
BT a Bachelors of Twittering .
What the heck are Hashtags or # ?
You may often notice that twitter users add hashtags to the end of their tweets .
Such as this example : “ 49ers just scored 7 points against the Cowboys # football ” .
Users are using hashtags for events , ideas , conferences , TV shows , and any other interesting subject to make tweets easily found .
By using this hashtag , anyone can use the search tool to find anyone talking about a particular topic .
As you know tweets , on their own , can be taken out of context , so hash tags are a simple way of making content findable and retrieable .
How is Twitter going to make money ?
Good question , a few weeks ago ( early 2009 ) they raised yet another round of capital , a strong round of $ 35 MM .
VCs require a business plan for that amount of money , and they ’ve indicated that they ’re seeking to provide services to brands .
I predict that they will offer services to brands to secure their corporate names , provide analytics , and crude customer and prospect management tools .
It ’s unlikely they ’ll generate revenue from ads as we know that ads do n’t perform well in social networks , it could disrupt the user experience , and also tweets can be exported to other clients –purging ads out of it .
It ’s possible for them to monetize with contextual ads as people search , or develop a currency system for third parties to use during transactions , I think those are far fetched .
Should companies register aka “ squat ” user names ?
Great question from Tom in comment 5 . Companies should register their main company and or product name , but they should not register all the variations of their name .
Registering the most common name like “ ‘ Hitachi ” makes sense as this is one of the first places users will look and it will also score high in search engine results .
Brands should not register all the variations as they wo n’t be able to register all the different varieties .
I know that Twitter themselves have ‘ locked ’ variations for brands that have requested , but I do n’t know if this is a common service .
Expect Twitter to offer name registration services for brands , similar to GoDaddy for urls .
What do I need to know about Twitter Search ?
Thanks Daniel , good question .
Search is a your best friend !
Twitter actually has two search tools , the first one is the search .
twitter.com tool .
It was originally created by a developer who named it summize , then Twitter acquired them and the developer , it ’s slowly being integrated with each users profile page .
The search tool is easy to use , and you can use it just like you would Google .
First , search for your name , variations of your name and your actual twitter handle .
Examples : “ Jeremiah ” or Jerymiah ” or “ @jowyang ” .
The search tool offers an RSS feed so you could subscribe to search results and watch them come into a feedreader , like MyYahoo .
Also , see the trending topics on the right hand column of the search tool , that ’s a great way to see what the community is talking about , which is referred to as a ‘ zeitgeist ’ .
Another useful tip is to search other people ’s names to see the conversation around them , or search terms that have hashtags to see all the discussions around an event or topic .
What ’s the difference between private and public tweets ?
Thanks Daniel , good question .
Did you know that your tweets , when public , are publishing to the whole world ?
Your boss , wife , kids , competitors and enemies can read what you ’re writing , for better and for worse .
It ’s important to remember that you ’re publishing ( like a blog ) and these tweets will stay public forever –even if you delete them they could be archived .
The internet tends to trend towards open communications and many ( if not most ) make their tweets public , however you should be aware of the impacts .
If you ’re still concerned about privacy , make your tweets private , which means they will only be visible by those you follow .
Check out the toggles here on the account page , you can select the ‘ make my tweets private ’ checkbox at the bottom of the page .
How much time should I spend constructing my Tweets ?
I like this question from Caesar .
The answer ?
It depends on what your objective is with the tool .
The same thing applies when you ’re communicating in real life , are you have an impromptu conversation with friends ?
Or are you having a business discussion with colleagues .
Regardless of your objective , you should take the time to construct meaningful tweets that are grammatically correct , and are void of spelling errors .
The more thoughtful you are with your tweets , the more people will notice and may react –just tweeting a stream of consciousness or spelling out every detail of your mundane activities is n’t going to win folks over .
I ’m a bit more careful on my tweets , I try to get them to be about 120 - 130 characters so folks will have an easier time retweeting them , and I try to write in an engaging way that folks will find interesting – that is of course unless I ’m tweeting from a party –then all the rules are off !
Summary : you ’ll get back as much as you put into tweeting .
Can small businesses succeed with Twitter , or just the big ones ?
We ’ve seen press picking up the successes that Dell , Comcast , and Jetblue have had with Twitter , but what about small businesses ?
Good question from James Hong .
The answer ?
There are more opportunities for small companies –as these small tools have big reach to a global community .
In fact , Zappos , an online etailer has done very well for itself by using twitter for customer support , marketing , and thought leadership .
Koji a “ Korean Taco truck ” ( I ’m serious ) has gotten lots of media buzz from tweeting it ’s location to it ’s community .
In summary , there ’s plenty of opportunities for companies both big and small .
What should I put on my profile ?
Thanks to Jennifer Bongar for the question .
In all social networks , not just Twitter , the more you fill out your profile ( here ’s how ) and make an effort to connect with others , the more you ’ll get back .
So , it really depends on your goal , if you ’re using Twitter to do heavy social networking with others you do n’t know , make an effort to fill out the profile with your name , occupation , location , and an appropriate picture , bonus points for linking to your blog , facebook , or linkedin site .
Yet if you ’re using it just among your friends , they already know who you are , and can put less information .
Some users suggest they wo n’t follow those who do n’t make it clear who their name is , also , putting an image ( preferably your own picture ) is a good idea ( here ’s how ) .
How do you measure click through rates ?
Thanks WBB Jeff , a good question .
I ’ve yet to see an easy - to - use accurate method .
There ’s a few considerations you ’ll have to take in to really be accurate .
First of all , use a tracking tool like bitly or snipurl to track click throughs .
That ’s the easy part , the numerator for your ratio .
The hard part is trying to determine the denonomater .
Twitter is time - sensitive , and we know that tweets around late morning to lunch time eastern time may get more attention , and certainly during weekdays .
Secondly , not all users are on twitter , and this HP research on twitter found that the actual number of active users is around X percent .
So depending on how accurate you really want to calculate , you ’ll have to factor in those impacts .
How should I brand my company Twitter handle ?
Kate Lukach says she sees large consumer brands with branded handles , yet wants to know what SMB and B2B companies should do .
This really depends on your objective .
I recommend that you certainly reserve your formal company handle on Twitter .
It comes down to expectations .
Make it clear in the profile what the objective is , whether it be for support , news , questions , or conversational .
Some brands like Dell and Oracle have employees that share the name of the brand @richardatdell which creates a unique hybrid brand –yet with it ’s own challenges .
Some brands use the corporate handle and an ‘ official spokesperson ’ like @marketingprofs will indicate their persona and face .
Of course , you can expect many employees to create personal twitter accounts , and they may indicate their affiliation with their employer .
In any case , set expectations in the Twitter profile .
Best Buy is set to start selling the Brammo Enertia motorcycle , which is powered by large format lithium - phosphate batteries .

Best Buy Capital invested a few million dollars in Brammo last September , and features like integrated GPS and Wi-Fi chips make this an especially gadgety ride , which helps explain how it got to the big box retailer 's floor .
There will be more fancy - pants options as well , like on - board cameras that can connect to the internet and automatically sort ride pictures by location .
All in all , it looks like a pretty slick ride , even if you do need to go to Best Buy to get it .

It 's an economic crisis he largely predicted -- so what 's former presidential candidate / Rep. Ron Paul up to these days ?
He 's thinking about the long - term .
His campaign for Liberty will start training activists at eight regional summits this year while it continues to urge followers to work against the stimulus and bailout measures in Congress .
More than 500 activists are expected to attend the first summit in St. Louis from March 25 to 27 .
The second summit is scheduled for April in Jacksonville and a third tentatively set for Seattle .
Campaign for Liberty 's Senior Vice President Jesse Benton said five more summits will be held if the first three are successful .
Paul will attend the St. Louis summit , as well as Andrew Napolitano , a Fox News legal analyst and former New Jersey Supreme Court justice , and Tom Woods , best - selling author of the " Politically Incorrect Guide to American History . "
Benton said the summits will educate activists on the principles of the Constitution and train them in how to influence politics , from organizing , educating , lobbying and running for office .
Already activists are getting involved in running for Republican Party leadership races in different states , Benton said .
AN Enfield house being used as a cannabis factory went up in smoke on New Year ’s Day .
Firefighters from Enfield and Edmonton were called to Bideford Road at 5 am on Thursday morning following an emergency phone call from terrified neighbours .
The fire ripped through the entire first floor of the empty property where " hundreds " of cannabis plants were being grown , according to one firefighter at the scene .
It also spread to a neighbouring home and caused a small amount damage , he added .
No injuries have been reported .
Specialist heating devices were found at the property and the electricity supply had been rigged for the cultivation of the Class B drug , Enfield Police confirmed .
The owners of the property have not yet been identified and enquiries are ongoing .
No arrests have been made .
Kate Kevins , 14 , of Bideford Road , said : “ My mum shouted there was a fire so I woke up and looked out the window .
People were outside and there was four fire engines .
The house was really burning .
“ It was exciting but scary at the same time .
Our fears were that someone might have been in there .
We had no idea about the cannabis . ”
Another neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : “ In November , someone from Enfield Council visited to ask if I knew anything about the people that were living there .
I did n’t have a clue .
I work shifts and never really saw who it was that was coming and going .
“ I did see a young man a few times .
He drove an Audi TT .
I was shocked when the firemen told me the house was being used for drugs .
It just shows what can happen practically on your doorstep . ”
Retire the Penny
Brought to you by Citizens to Retire the U.S. Penny
Retire the Penny is a commonsense , non-partisan coalition of individuals , businesses , and political leaders who understand that eliminating the penny from circulation could save the US government close to $ 85 million annually .
The penny costs twice as much as to produce than it is worth .
Like the 1/2 cent coin , the penny should retire with grace !
March 2009
About twenty years ago people noticed computers and TV were on a collision course and started to speculate about what they 'd produce when they converged .
We now know the answer : computers .
It 's clear now that even by using the word " convergence " we were giving TV too much credit .
This wo n't be convergence so much as replacement .
People may still watch things they call " TV shows , " but they 'll watch them mostly on computers .
What decided the contest for computers ?
Four forces , three of which one could have predicted , and one that would have been harder to .
One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open platform .
Anyone can build whatever they want on it , and the market picks the winners .
So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead of big company speeds .
The second is Moore 's Law , which has worked its usual magic on Internet bandwidth . [ 1 ]
The third reason computers won is piracy .
Users prefer it not just because it 's free , but because it 's more convenient .
Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer screen . [ 2 ]
The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation : social applications .
The average teenage kid has a pretty much infinite capacity for talking to their friends .
But they can't physically be with them all the time .
When I was in high school the solution was the telephone .
Now it 's social networks , multiplayer games , and various messaging applications .
The way you reach them all is through a computer . [ 3 ]
Which means every teenage kid ( a ) wants a computer with an Internet connection , ( b ) has an incentive to figure out how to use it , and ( c ) spends countless hours in front of it .
This was the most powerful force of all .
This was what made everyone want computers .
Nerds got computers because they liked them .
Then gamers got them to play games on .
But it was connecting to other people that got everyone else : that 's what made even grandmas and 14 year old girls want computers .
After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience , people in the entertainment business had understandably come to think of them as rather passive .
They thought they'd be able to dictate the way shows reached audiences .
But they underestimated the force of their desire to connect with one another .
Facebook killed TV .
That is wildly oversimplified , of course , but probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words .

The TV networks already seem , grudgingly , to see where things are going , and have responded by putting their stuff , grudgingly , online .
But they 're still dragging their heels .
They still seem to wish people would watch shows on TV instead , just as newspapers that put their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the next morning and read them printed on paper .
They should both just face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium .
They'd be in a better position if they 'd done that earlier .
When a new medium arises that 's powerful enough to make incumbents nervous , then it 's probably powerful enough to win , and the best thing they can do is jump in immediately .
Whether they like it or not , big changes are coming , because the Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media : synchronicity and locality .
On the Internet , you do n't have to send everyone the same signal , and you do n't have to send it to them from a local source .
People will watch what they want when they want it , and group themselves according to whatever shared interest they feel most strongly .
Maybe their strongest shared interest will be their physical location , but I 'm guessing not .
Which means local TV is probably dead .
It was an artifact of limitations imposed by old technology .
If someone were creating an Internet - based TV company from scratch now , they might have some plan for shows aimed at specific regions , but it would n't be a top priority .
Synchronicity and locality are tied together .
TV network affiliates care what 's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news at 11 .
This connection adds more brittleness than strength , however : people do n't watch what 's on at 10 because they want to watch the news afterward .
TV networks will fight these trends , because they do n't have sufficient flexibility to adapt to them .
They 're hemmed in by local affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by dealers and unions .
Inevitably , the people running the networks will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for a couple more years , just as the record labels have done .
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal described how TV networks were trying to add more live shows , partly as a way to make viewers watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it suited them .
Instead of delivering what viewers want , they 're trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks ' obsolete business model .
That never works unless you have a monopoly or cartel to enforce it , and even then it only works temporarily .
The other reason networks like live shows is that they 're cheaper to produce .
There they have the right idea , but they have n't followed it to its conclusion .
Live content can be way cheaper than networks realize , and the way to take advantage of dramatic decreases in cost is to increase volume .
The networks are prevented from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think of themselves as being in the broadcast business — as sending one signal to everyone . [ 4 ]

Now would be a good time to start any company that competes with TV networks .
That 's what a lot of Internet startups are , though they may not have had this as an explicit goal .
People only have so many leisure hours a day , and TV is premised on such long sessions ( unlike Google , which prides itself on sending users on their way quickly ) that anything that takes up their time is competing with it .
But in addition to such indirect competitors , I think TV companies will increasingly face direct ones .
Even in cable TV , the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the threshold you had to get over to start a new channel .
It will be longer on the Internet , and there will be more mobility within it .
In this new world , the existing players will only have the advantages any big company has in its market .
That will change the balance of power between the networks and the people who produce shows .
The networks used to be gatekeepers .
They distributed your work , and sold advertising on it .
Now the people who produce a show can distribute it themselves .
The main value networks supply now is ad sales .
Which will tend to put them in the position of service providers rather than publishers .
Shows will change even more .
On the Internet there 's no reason to keep their current format , or even the fact that they have a single format .
Indeed , the more interesting sort of convergence that 's coming is between shows and games .
But on the question of what sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years , I would n't dare to make any predictions , except that things will change a lot .
We 'll get whatever the most imaginative people can cook up .
That 's why the Internet won .
Notes
[ 1 ] Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point .
He adds : " I remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when they talked about convergence .
They thought most programming would be on demand , and they would implement it and make a lot of money .
It did n't work out .
They assumed that their local network infrastructure would be critical to do video on - demand , because you could n't possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet .
At the time ( 1992 ) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth was n't enough for one video stream .
But wide - area bandwidth increased more than they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu . "
[ 2 ] Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of piracy , which is the lost revenue .
They therefore think what drives users to do it is the desire to get something for free .
But iTunes shows that people will pay for stuff online , if you make it easy .
A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better user experience .

Or a phone that is actually a computer .
I 'm not making any predictions about the size of the device that will replace TV , just that it will have a browser and get data via the Internet .

Anyone can broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting to 10,000 people or so , even if the quality of production is not so good . "

HALIFAX , N.S. - Seal hunters returned to the ice in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence for a few hours Wednesday to kill the last remaining seals allowed under their quota off Iles de la Madeleine .
Phil Jenkins , a spokesman for the federal Fisheries Department , said about 17,200 seals were killed on Monday and Tuesday , leaving only a few hundred remaining before the hunt ended at 10 a.m. local time .
ANDREW VAUGHAN / THE CANADIAN PRESS
A hunter heads towards a harp seal during the annual East Coast seal hunt in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence around Quebec 's Iles de la Madeleine Wednesday .
Helicopters carrying observers from two animal welfare groups headed out to witness the final stage of the hunt , which involved sealers from the Quebec islands .
In addition to sealers in boats , the hunt involved sealers who were able to reach the animals by snowmobile and all - terrain vehicles because of ice that reached the shore .
Jenkins said a hunt in the gulf for sealers from Nova Scotia , New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island is scheduled to begin at 6 a.m. Friday .
" That 's the earliest , weather dependent , " he said .
About 50 licensed sealers plus their crew will take part in that hunt between Iles de la Madeleine and Cape Breton .
It has a small quota of 1,435 animals .
The federal government has set a combined allowable catch for this year 's East Coast seal hunt of 338,200 harp , hooded and grey seals .

The Tories have admitted a member of staff altered a Wikipedia entry on the artist Titian after a row between Gordon Brown and David Cameron .
During exchanges at prime minister 's questions , the Tory leader mocked Mr Brown for talking of Titian at 90 , when he said in fact he had died age 86 .
Shortly afterwards a Wikipedia user registered at Conservative HQ moved his date of death forward .
The party admitted an " over - eager " member of staff had been responsible .
Wikipedia is an online encyclopaedia founded in 2001 and based on wikis , which let anyone have access to a web page .
The issue of Titian was raised during prime minister 's questions when David Cameron referred to comments made by Mr Brown last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Mr Brown had said : " I 'm reminded of the story of Titian , who 's the great painter who reached the age of 90 , finished the last of his nearly 100 brilliant paintings , and he said at the end of it , ' I 'm finally beginning to learn how to paint , ' and that is where we are . "
' Brilliant '
He was speaking in the context of people learning how to deal with the current economic crisis .
In the House of Commons Mr Cameron said , to laughter from Conservative MPs : " You told us the other day you were like Titian aged 90 .
The fact is Titian died at 86 . "
Shortly afterwards several people e-mailed the BBC taking issue with this claim , saying there was no certainty about the age at which Titian died .
BBC Two 's Daily Politics also reported that his Wikipedia entry suggested he had lived to 91 .
At 1234 GMT , shortly after PMQs ended , the page was changed by someone registered as being at the Conservative Party 's HQ in London .
Is it enough in this modern age for the leader of the opposition 's staff simply to alter Wikipedia ?
Peter Kilfoyle , Labour MP
The artist 's date of death was altered from 27 August 1576 to 27 August 1572 .
A Conservative spokesman said : " This was an over - eager member of staff putting right an incorrect entry on Wikipedia . "
At 1229 GMT , another user - registered as being in Sutton , Surrey - altered Titian 's date of birth from c.1485 to c.1490 .
This , when combined with the intervention by the Conservative HQ user 's intervention , would have made his lifespan 81 or 82 years .
The page has since been changed a number of times and there has been a heated debate taking place citing different authorities ' views on Titian 's most likely birth and death dates .
Later , Labour MP Peter Kilfoyle asked the deputy Speaker of the House of Commons : " I wonder whether you could tell the House whether you have had representations from the leader of the opposition so that he might correct the comments that he made about Titian .
" Or is it enough in this modern age for the leader of the opposition 's staff simply to alter Wikipedia ? "
Following several seconds of uproar , the deputy Speaker replied : " The honourable gentleman , as an experienced member of this House , knows that is not a point of order for the chair but his comments are on record . "
Titian - Tiziano Vecellio - was born in Italy and his works include Bacchus and Ariadne and Diana and Actaeon .

Kit Bond , the Republican U.S. Senator from Missouri once thought to be a specialty brand of adhesive for model airplane enthusiasts , is apparently still sniffing the good shit .
When it comes to the stimulus plan , this good ol ’ boy is having his cake , eating it , and sending a flaming pile of resultant crap out through his flaks .
Last week , he towed the party line in a press release on his NO vote on the stimulus :
“ Hold on to your wallets folks because with the passage of this trillion - dollar baby the Democrats will be poised to spend as much as $ 3 trillion in your tax dollars … ”
“ Unfortunately , this bill stimulates the debt , it stimulates the growth of government , but it does n’t stimulate jobs ”
An exaggeration and at least partly wrong , but fair enough – the Kit Car is sticking to his guns .
Respect .
Until this week ’s press release :
Last week , Bond led a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing an amendment ( to the Stimulus Package ) to help provide needy families affordable housing .
Bond ’s amendment provides $ 2 billion to fund low - income housing tax credit ( LIHTC ) projects that have been stalled by the financial credit crisis .
As part of the Democrats ’ spending bill now signed into law , the Senate unanimously accepted Bond ’s provision …
“ This is the type of emergency stimulus spending we should be supporting – programs that will create jobs now and help families , ” said Bond .
So , congratulations on getting your generous amendment into the stimulus bill , and even bigger congrats on finding enough “ Yes ” votes to discount your own “ No ” vote , dingus .
• Bank of England governor Mervyn King blamed for confusion as government fails to sell gilts for first time in seven years • William Hague accuses Labour of losing control of public finances
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Efforts to rescue the UK economy were plunged into fresh uncertainty this morning after the government failed to find a buyer for some of its debt , the first such failure in seven years .
City dealers blamed Mervyn King , the Bank of England 's governor , for sowing confusion after he warned earlier this week that the UK could not afford another stimulus package .
The UK debt management office said it attracted just £ 1.62 bn of bids for a sale of £ 1.75 bn of 40 - year gilts .
Normally , such auctions of government debt are oversubscribed .
This was the first failure of an auction since 2002 .
Analysts warned that it cast doubts on the government 's ability to borrow billions of pounds to stimulate British economic activity .
William Hague , standing in for David Cameron at prime minister 's questions today , said investors were no longer interested in holding UK debt , and claimed the government had lost control of the public finances .
Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman denied that there was a general problem in the gilt market .
The Bank of England had begun buying up gilts and corporate debt through its quantitative easing ( QE ) programme , which is designed to boost the money supply and get the economy going again .
But on Monday King suggested that the Bank might not need to create the full £ 75 bn assigned to QE .
" This is a direct result of yesterday : the fact that this gilt auction has failed means that we 're just not getting the benefits of QE .
Mervyn King was never a big convert , " said Graham Turner , analyst at GFC Economics .
" The bond market is just failing – investors can see there 's a row between King and the government , and he 's not committed .
This is the problem with trying to run a separate monetary and fiscal policy , " Turner added , referring to King 's other remark on Monday that there was little room for the government to engage in further fiscal easing .
The gilts market has been alarmed by King 's comments , as demand for gilts will be hit if the Bank buys fewer than planned .
Bond prices plunged this morning and look to be on course to record their biggest weekly loss in at least six years .
As a result of falling prices , yields ( income relative to price ) shot higher .
" I just think there 's a state of confusion in the market at the moment .
It requires greater clarity from the Bank on what its aims are in this process , " said Sean Maloney , strategist at Nomura International .
More than half the big fall in gilt yields since the Bank announced its QE programme has now been reversed .
A key aim of QE was to push down yields , thus reducing further borrowing costs in the economy .
The Treasury insisted that there was still strong demand for UK gilts , and predicted that today 's shortfall would be made back in future auctions .
" As the head of the debt management office said to the Treasury select committee last year , it would be wrong to read anything into the results of one auction event , which depends on the gilt on offer , demand and market conditions on the day , " a Treasury spokesman said .
Generally , there 's nothing that makes me laugh harder than an " I did n't see you there " joke to a guy dressed in camouflage at the mall .
But here 's one better .

At the moment Seven is running repeats of repeats of Kath & Kim on a Saturday night .
Years and multiple viewings later , the series still draws almost as many viewers as The Footy Show ( and more than NAB Cup grand final ) .
And even when the foxy ladies from Fountain Gate finally retire from our screens you can bet that their legacy will live on with the one - liners and catchphrases they 've bequeathed us .
How many of us now sit down with a nice glass of " kardonnay " at the end of the day ?
Or relish any pleasurable object or experience as " noice , different , unusual " ?
Or demand that our friends , partners , colleagues , offspring " look at moi " ?
Like any cliche or aphorism that has stood the test of time , TV catchphrases serve a purpose .
Sometimes it 's quite a profound purpose .
A neat line from a satire or spoof can capture the human condition in a few memorable words .
Seinfeld 's " Yada yada yada " perfectly expressed our bone - deep fatigue with a world chock full of BS .
Or consider the pithy insight of : " Computer says no " .
Confucius himself could n't have done better in expressing our maddening helplessness in a technology - driven world .
Sometimes that purpose is less profound , but just as important .
The mantras of reality and game shows , for instance , provide everyone with a way to be mean and dismissive , while pretending to be funny and light - hearted .
" You are the weakest link .
Goodbye . "
" The tribe has spoken . "
Crucially , TV catchphrases give geeks and social misfits borrowed wit .
When we do something dumb , we have the opportunity to instantly lean on the TV geeks and social misfits who have gone before and provided charming verbal defusers .
Obviously , Maxwell Smart is our king .
" Would you believe ...? " or " Missed it by that much " smooth over all kinds of physical and verbal trips and pratfalls .
Meanwhile , Sergeant Schultz provides that handy catchall - " I know nuh - think " - beloved of politicians , corporate moguls and mere mortals alike .
TV catchphrases are , of course , cultural touchstones too , a way of identifying whether you are one of us .
In his book Cad : Confessions of a Toxic Bachelor , Rick Marin describes tumbling into bed with a woman and spying an enormous jar of lubricant on the nightstand .
" That 's the second biggest jar of ... I 've ever seen , " he says .
When his paramour inquires gravely about the largest jar he 's ever seen , he knows he 's with the wrong girl .
Some have an even clubbier feel .
If you described yourself as being " Auf'd " , who would know what you mean ?
Other fans of the original Project Runway , of course .
When Heidi Klum gives eliminated contestants the double air kiss , she always accompanies it with a fond but stern " Auf Wiedersehen " .
When someone gravely intones " Make it so " , only dedicated Trekkies recognise it as a pet phrase of Captain Picard .
And if you inform someone they 're " entering another dimension " , you 're both showing your age , and identifying yourself as a hard - core Rod Serling fan .
Of course , nothing 's more annoying than people whose entire conversation comprises lines from Little Britain .
But catchphrases are a great way of livening up ordinary conversation .
Why say " Dinner 's on the table , " when you could say " Come on down ! "
Or , " Did you call me ? " when you could say " You rang ? "
They 're a wonderful , enduring shorthand that encapsulate a moment or a state of mind , trail a bit of the fun , frivolous spirit of telly in their wake , and link us to our peers .
They do what television does best - and even great art rarely achieves .
They unite us .
QUOTE ME
Few television series have so many memorable and oft - quoted lines as The Simpsons .
Of course , being on air for 20 years does n't hurt .
But there 's something about the yellow family from Springfield that has utterly captured the zeitgeist .
Bart 's " Bite me ! " has become the bane of mothers of primary school boys throughout the Western world .
But the real evidence of the ubiquity of its catchphrases - and its cultural influence - must be in the fact that two of its tropes have entered not just the popular lexicon but actual dictionaries .
You can now find " Meh ... " in the standard Collins English Dictionary , and " Doh ! " in the Oxford .
Why the heck is this happening to us ?
What happened to mortgages , to banks , to large retailers , to retirement savings , to stock prices , to the availability of credit ?
How could so many errors have coincided ?
To the media pundits and government officials , this is a market failing that requires the government to take trillions of dollars from you and run the money presses full time .
Otherwise we are doomed .
But there is another way to look at the great market collapse of 2008 : the whole thing , including the bubble that preceded it , is the fault of the government and the Fed .
All attempts to " fix " the problem are like forcing the patient to swallow more of the poison from which he currently suffers .
Mises.org has been making this argument , and warned of the coming crash years ago .
But where can you find the argument explained for the average person in a convenient package , without technical jargon and with logic and facts ?
Enter Tom Woods with his blockbuster book Meltdown .
It 's all here , all the information you need to understand what is happening and what to do about it .
It is billed as a free - market response to the crisis but it is more precisely an Austrian School response .
He covers the problem of housing subsidies , of low interest loans , of the absurdities of the boom times , and how it was inevitable that they would come to an end .
He puts the fault right where it belongs : with the government and the central bank .
He further blasts the political establishment for taking exactly the wrong path in response .
Interest rates should be raised , not lowered .
Government spending should be cut , not increased .
Tax should be reduced .
Regulations should be cut , not expanded .
On the current path , the bozos in Washington are going to wreck whatever hope for recovery there is .
The great thing about this volume is that it is rooted in serious ideas .
We are n't talking about some quicky investment book by a media talking head .
Professor Woods is steeped in the ideas of Mises , Hayek , and Rothbard , and never misses a chance to explain the relationship between theory and reality .
It contains what might be the clearest explanation of Austrian business cycle theory ever written .
This book is a fantastic weapon in the intellectual battle that is taking place right now .
It needs to become a bestseller , and it could .
You can do your part by distributing it as widely as possible .
History really does hang in the balance .
From the Inside Flap
Is Capitalism the Culprit ?
The media tells us that " deregulation " and " unfettered free markets " have wrecked our economy and will continue to make things worse without a heavy dose of federal regulation .
But the real blame lies elsewhere .
In Meltdown , bestselling author Thomas E. Woods Jr. unearths the real causes behind the collapse of housing values and the stock market -- and it turns out the culprits reside more in Washington than on Wall Street .
And the trillions of dollars in federal bailouts ?
Our politicians ' ham - handed attempts to fix the problems they themselves created will only make things much worse .
Woods , a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute and winner of the 2006 Templeton Enterprise Award , busts the media myths and government spin .
He explains how government intervention in the economy -- from the Democratic hobby horse called Fannie Mae to affirmative action programs like the Community Redevelopment Act -- actually caused the housing bubble .
Most important , Woods , author of the New York Times bestseller The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History , traces this most recent boom - and - bust -- and all such booms and busts of the past century -- back to one of the most revered government institutions of all : the Federal Reserve System , which allows busy - body bureaucrats and ambitious politicians to pull the strings of our financial sector and manipulate the value of the very money we use .
Meltdown also provides a timely history lesson to counter the current clamor for a new New Deal .
The Great Depression , Woods demonstrates , was only as deep and as long as it was because of the government interventions by Herbert Hoover ( no free - market capitalist , despite what your high school history teacher may have taught you ) and Franklin D. Roosevelt ( no savior of the American economy , in spite of what the mainstream media says ) .
If you want to understand what caused the financial meltdown -- and why none of the big - government solutions being tried today will work -- Meltdown explains it all .
" There were various Iranians who would come to London and suggest we had tea in some hotel or other , " Sir John tells the final part of a BBC documentary on the Islamic Republic 's relations with the West , to be broadcast on Saturday .
" They 'd do the same in Paris , they'd do the same in Berlin , and then we 'd compare notes among the three of us .
NASA is allowing the public to vote on the name for " Node 3 " of the International Space Station .
So what did we do ?
We named it after a cult science fiction show , of course !

As of right now , " Serenity " is dominating an open vote for Node 3's new name .
This ship from Joss Whedon 's short - lived show Firefly has 82 % of the total vote , with second place going to Earthrise ( with 7 % of the vote ) .
What can we say to such adolescent nomenclature ?
This .
Is . Awesome .
Voting will be open until March 20th , so let 's vote early and often to seal the deal for Serentiy .

A hot topic in security research communities as of late is the Conficker B worm .
This worm has infected nearly 10 million computers around the globe , and doesnt seem to be slowing down .
The worm uses several different technologies to secure its payload , obscuring its contents and its intentions from researchers who wish to disable it .
One of these technologies is RSA 4094 , which is a very strong flavor of public key encryption .
This encryption is used to obscure the contents of software delivered to infected machines , which seem to include updates to the worms code , and command and control information relayed from whoever is responsible for the worm .
The encryption , however , has a unique weakness .
RSA ’s security lies in the difficulty of factoring extremely large composite numbers Semi-Prime numbers quickly .
A semi-prime compsite number is the product of 2 primes .
Semi-prime Composite numbers have a unique property in that they only have 4 factors , 1 and itself , and each of the prime numbers used to create it .
The semi-prime modulus of Conficker is known , and so far its only known weakness is the inability of researchers to crack the encryption on the payload of the worm .
If we could crack the encryption , we may be able to provide a payload for conficker that disables the worm all together .
Some may note that cracking RSA 4094 is currently thought to be unfeasible , but I say it is only unfeasible if you do n’t try .
Without further adue , the Modulus of conficker :
Modulus : size = 256 words = 4094 bits

Mike Allen , today :
Like athletes limbering up for the big game , White House reporters have been going through elaborate preparatory rituals as they bone up for tonight ’s prime - time news conference with President Obama , the second formal “ presser ” of his presidency .
The unspoken contest playing out under the East Room lights :
The president wants to deliver a message – in this case , reassurance on the economy and a plug for his budget – and not get tripped up by issues he considers extraneous , or that might overshadow what he wants to say .
Reporters have the opposite incentive :
They want to “ make news ” by getting the president to say something he has n’t said before , or was n’t prepared to say – which , by definition , is not his message .
A study of 40 people -- some religious , some nonreligious -- found that phrases such as " I believe God is with me throughout the day and watches over me " lit up the same areas of the brain we use to decipher the emotions and intentions of other people .
Grafman says the finding , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , shows that there is no special circuitry in the brain that deals with religious belief .
It also suggests that religion developed as the human brain evolved its capacity for complex social interactions .
Of course not .
Per NPR : etc .
The study did make some interesting findings , but of course not the one heralded in the title or in the article .
The only true statement in the NPR article is this one : NPR , and the study 's author , unfortunately concluded more than this : Nope .
It 's no stretch of the imagination to say that the majority of the NPR devotees -- and likely members of PNAS -- may not be outright atheists , but they 're hardcore agnostics .
They occupy that space preferred by the self - absorbed who are n't sure what they do believe , but fervently confident about what they do n't believe : anything their parents were into .
They 're skeptical , but lazy ; they " know " which things are not true , but can't be bothered to learn what is true , or at least make something up that is logically consistent .
The exception to this is evolution : they are passionate about evolution , though woefully ignorant of any of its principles or mechanisms .
Their zeal is partly in reaction to established religion , and evolution becomes a substitute for religion .
Articles like this one fortify them .
They do n't need the details ; it 's enough to know that science is discovering , bit by bit , that much of the intellectual or religious history of mankind over the past , say , 6000 years , is all crap .
It only took the sophisticated , post - Nixon mind to figure out what Kant could n't .
" Whatever , man -- evolution has a billion years on you . "
Indeed .
The study itself is n't too hard to explain .
Subjects were asked to agree or disagree with certain god related statements ( " People go to hell , " " God protects all people " ) while their brain was scanned .
The study found that the same regions were ones associated with understanding the intentions and emotions of human beings .
Ergo :
God is just another guy .
The obvious criticism is that this did n't study the religions experience at all ; what it studied was what regions of the brain interpretthat relate to intention .
If they asked , " Jabba The Hutt thinks Leia is hot " it would have lit up the same regions , allowing the title of this article to be , " To The Brain , God Is Just Another Hutt . " Furthermore , it is very likely that many of these regions are only involved in linguisitic interpretations ; if they had shown videos of people intending to do something , different regions of the brain would have been used .
But a more subtle criticism , and likely the most relevant one , is that this study was done onborn after 1970 -- the Dumbest Generation of Narcissists In The History Of The World .
Even if this was a valid test of how the brain deals with the religious experience , it 's probably not applicable to how human beings in general , or over time , deal with the religious experience .
If they tested , say , Carmelite nuns " thinking about God , " you 'd probably get different regions .
( They did . )
In other words , the study emphatically does not show that " to the brain , God is just another guy . "
At best , it shows that American 30 - somethings areable to see God as anything other than just another guy ; but who knows how 3rd century Romans saw God ?
Given that the study was done at NIH , by cognitive neuroscientists , published in PNAS and then reported on NPR , you would think that someone would have thought of this .
Or perhaps they did , which is why they wrote it this way .
The weekend 's elections in Iraq were a huge success for the Iraqi people .
The remarkably peaceful day of voting on Saturday - and the interim results - give good reason to hope Iraq really is on the way to building a decent society .
These provincial elections were held in 14 of the country 's 18 provinces ( Kurdistan will hold separate elections , and the disputed oil - rich city of Kirkuk was deemed " too hard " at present ) .
This was the first post - Saddam election that the Iraqis handled themselves .
Iraqi soldiers protected the polling stations .
It was also the first election to have international observers in all 712 constituencies .
In 2005 terrorist attacks made that too dangerous .
Then , more than 200 candidates were killed - this time , eight died .
There were 14,412 candidates standing for office , an impressive number .
This was also the first election in which there was no boycott on ethnic or sectarian grounds .
There was an enormous spread of views represented on the ballot papers - Iraq is the only Arab country which offers almost everyone , including Trotskyites and monarchists , the freedom to stand for election .
The turnout , 51 % , was less than some predicted but importantly it included many Sunnis who had boycotted the last elections in 2005 .
Turnout in some of the Sunni areas was as high as 60 % .
The hope is that these Sunnis have turned from the methods of al - Qaida , which dominated the early post - Saddam years , to the political process .
The peaceful polling was remarkable and so were the results .
All the Islamic parties lost ground , especially that associated with the so - called " Shia firebrand " , Moqtada al - Sadr , whose share of the vote went down from 11 % to 3 % .
The principal Sunni Islamic party , the Islamic Party of Iraq , was wiped out .
The only Islamic party to gain ground was the Dawa party of the Shia prime minister Nouri al - Maliki - and even that party dropped the word Islamic from its name .
The power of Maliki , who has emerged a stronger leader than expected , is further enhanced by these elections .
Now no Islamic parties will be able to control any provinces on their own .
The election is thus a big defeat for Iran which had hoped that Shia religious parties would control the south and enable Iran to turn them into a mini Shia republic .
Instead , a new generation of Iraqi politicians is coming forward .
Many of them are young and secular .
They have lived always in Iraq , not in exile ; they are Iraqis with local roots first and foremost - they are not pan-Arabs or pan-Islamists .
Nor do they have connections to the US .
Iraq 's polity is still fragile .
Parliamentary elections later this year will be another test of whether the horrific inter-Islamic violence of recent years is over .
The country is still far from united and its infrastructure still needs massive investment .
But there are now real grounds to hope that Iraqis are finally on track to creating a far more decent society than they have ever had .
This would never have been possible without the US - led overthrow of the psychotic Saddam family .
There were lamentable failures in the subsequent US occupation , which allowed the rise of the hideous sectarian violence that threatened to tear the country to pieces .
But in the last two years the " surge " of US troops under General David Petraeus appears to have destroyed much of the terrorists ' infrastructure and support .
Now , as US troops begin their phased withdrawal , the new American - trained Iraqi army is defending the country against Islamist violence .
There will be further setbacks .
But who knows , Iraq may yet even become a model for democratic change in other Arab countries .
If so , who deserves some credit ?
The much maligned President Bush .
And Tony Blair .

Seventeen years ago , I left a great job teaching at a prestigious northeast culinary school to move back to Iowa and be an executive chef at a Holiday Inn .
It was difficult to find people , in Vermont or Iowa , who did not think I was certifiably insane .
Those who thought they knew Iowa claimed , “ There ’s no there , there ! ”
And those who did not asked , “ Iowa ?
Is n’t that where they grow potatoes ? ”
Because I had spent my undergraduate years in Iowa , I was accustomed to the rest of the country , especially folks from the coasts , referring to it as one of the “ flyover states . ”
Iowans , a group among whom I now proudly count myself , are fine with that — as long as such critics do just fly over .
We ’ll wave .
We ’re Iowans .
East Coast has Broadway , West Coast has Hollywood , and Iowa has people — damn fine people .
The other thing Iowa has is Agriculture — and I use that capital “ A ” deliberately .
We produce more pork , more corn , and more eggs than any other state in the union , and come in second or third in virtually every other commodity crop save oranges .
And who knows ?
Global climate change may change that too .
What the people who wanted to put me in a rubber room a decade and a half ago did n’t see , which I did , was the massive potential for local , sustainable , community - based food systems in Iowa .
After all , it is home to 3 million people who still have spiritual and familial ties to the finest soil on the planet .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
One of the lessons I ’ve learned from almost 30 years in food service is that fresh tastes best .
Sounds obvious until you look beneath the surface a bit and realize that what passes for fresh in many places is really not so fresh , and many “ foods ” currently available on store shelves can be measured in half - life rather than shelf life .
Ninety - five percent of Iowa ’s food is imported , and it travels an average of 1,500 miles to get to our plates .
This in a state that can grow anything that can grow outside the tropics .
Does n’t matter how fast your planes , trains , and trucks are ; if it traveled 1,500 miles , it ’s not fresh .
My thought was , the closer it is to my kitchen door , the fresher it ’s going to be .
Seemed simple enough .
At the time , the farmers ’ market was right outside the hotel ’s back door , but disagreements with management kept me from buying much from the market then .
So 12 years ago I opened Devotay , a tiny , quirky little restaurant serving Spanish - style food made from local ingredients ( wherever feasible ) smack in the belly of the agribusiness beast .
There were ADM and IBP ( now Tyson ) and Quaker plants less than 30 minutes away .
There was one other business I could find that endeavored to buy locally ( the renowned New Pioneer food co-op ) , and when I walked through the farmers ’ market in my white chef ’s coat , people looked at me funny .
“ What ’s a chef doing in the farmers ’ market ? ” I could almost hear them thinking .
I only knew two farmers personally , but I knew people who knew people , and gradually Devotay built a network of local growers we now lovingly refer to as the Devotay Local Farm Partners , who are recognized in name and image at the restaurant ’s entrance ( “ The Hall of Farm ” ) .
What success and accolades Devotay has received I owe primarily to them ( and to the best dang staff in town ) .
In addition , we built a one - acre garden of our own under the loving care of my wife and business partner , Kim McWane Friese .
Guests never cease to be pleased and impressed with the greens , tomatoes , peppers , ground cherries , and more that come from the Devotay Gardens .
But getting from there to here was not a straight line .
Opening a small restaurant serving Spanish food — which most guests thought would be like Mexican — with no TVs , no fry - o - lators , no smoking , and no light beer in a college town , seemed to many to be further evidence of my deteriorating mental and emotional condition .
But it is said that nothing persists like persistence , and we were convinced that if we focused on the food , everything else would fall into place .
The food I bought locally was simply better .
It looked , smelled , and tasted better , and there is mounting evidence ( more here ) that much of it is more healthful as well .
And it has economic and marketing benefits too .
There is a strong multiplier effect to keeping my dollar in my community , and my clientele appreciate our dedication to the health and well - being of the area .
Connections to those first two farmers , Simone Delaty of Wellman and James Nisly of Kalona , led to friendships with many others , such as Susan Jutz , who runs the organic CSA Local Harvest with Simone , and Nick Wallace , who raises grass - finished beef .
Onward the connections went .
Along the way I learned that buying all my ingredients off the back of a truck from U.S. Foodservice is definitely easier , and often cheaper .
But that food is never of a higher quality , and it takes its toll .
Any business can take great strides when it stops looking at price and starts looking at cost .
Same holds true for individuals and families .
For just a moment set aside the price on the tag , and take a good hard look at the hidden costs of cheap food .
Chefs , you may think it cheaper to buy that commodity beef from Sysco .
Moms and dads , it may seem more convenient to get the cheap grocery - store apples from New Zealand than to visit the nearby orchard , or to get the frozen entrée rather than making a simple pasta dish at home .
But imagine the impact on our environment and health - care system of all that processed food .
Think of the fuel used to ship an apple halfway around the planet .
Then consider the benefits of taking a walk through an orchard with your children , of having them learn at your apron strings , of shaking the hand that raised that steer .
We are all co-producers , Wendell Berry tells us , all a part of the interconnected web of food production , and are therefore just as culpable for its ills as the agribusiness corporate executives are .
I am a gastronome .
It ’s a fancy word for someone who makes a study of food , has a passion , even a reverence for it .
Slow Food founder Carlo Petrini pointed out recently that , “ A gastronome who is not also an environmentalist is an idiot .
An environmentalist who is not also a gastronome is , well , sad . ”
In the past seventeen years I have seen an awakening here in Iowa , and I have undergone one myself .
Where once no restaurants were buying locally , now there are at least 15 in Iowa City alone ( a town of just 60,000 ) .
Plenty more are cropping up in even smaller surrounding towns : Lincoln Café in Mt. Vernon , Redhead in Solon , Phoenix Café in Grinnell , Augusta in Oxford and Café Dodici in Washington , to name just a few .
The University of Iowa Food Service is sourcing some foods locally , and the Iowa City Farmers ’ Market , where people used to look confused when they saw my chef ’s coat , has more than doubled in size and hosts plenty of chefs every day .
There ’s plenty more to be gleaned from my magazine , Edible Iowa River Valley , and you can sign up for our email newsletter here .
The restaurant has a newsletter too – sign up here .
If such progress can be made here , one plant , one plate , one palate at a time , it can be made everywhere , and I hope it will .
Because the best times of our lives often happen gathered around a table with great food in front of us and the people we love all around .
Who would n’t want more of that ?
Two Devotay Recipes
By Chef Kurt Michael Friese
This bisque is the perfect winter belly - warmer , always well received at Devotay and now even more so with the addition of Iowa ’s own whiskey , Templeton Rye .
The pork shoulder is the recipe I used when preparing the Mulefoot hog for consideration by the Slow Food USA Ark and Presidia Committee .
The Mulefoot was boarded onto the ark at Seed Savers Exchange in September 2005 .
Squash Bisque with Maple and Templeton Rye
I grow most of the ingredients ( except the bay and the syrup ) for this soup myself , but they should be readily available this time of year in most farmers ’ markets .
The rye , though , will be a challenge , as it is only available here in Iowa .
A good bourbon can substitute .
2 1/2 pounds butternut ( or other ) squash , peeled , seeded , and diced
2 carrots , diced
1 onion , peeled and diced
1/2 pound red potatoes , washed
5 cloves garlic , peeled
1 stalk celery , sliced
1 bay leaf
1 cup Templeton Rye Whiskey
1/2 cup real maple syrup
water , to cover
salt and cracked black pepper , to taste
Simmer all ingredients except the whiskey and maple syrup until very tender .
Remove bay leaf .
Puree and pass through a fine strainer .
Return to heat , bring to simmer , and add the rye and maple syrup .
Season to taste with salt and fresh cracked black pepper .
Serve immediately , or cool and store up to 3 days .
Freezes well .
Serves about 8 .
Smoked and Braised Mulefoot Hog Shoulder
With Sweet Peppers , la Quercia Prosciutto Americano , and Lacinato Kale
This is a time - consuming recipe , but worth every minute .
It ’s a great way to really wow your guests at the next barbecue .
Remember to use the Mulefoot , or one of the other breeds listed on the Slow Food Ark of Taste & Tradition — we have to eat them to save them !
2 pound pork shoulder roast , boned and netted ( your butcher will do this for you )
1/4 cup each salt and brown sugar , mixed with
2 tablespoons cracked black pepper
8 paper - thin slices of prosciutto
8 large leaves of lacinato kale
3 cups julienned sweet bell peppers , preferably of many colors
1/4 cup very thin sliced garlic cloves
1 large yellow onion , julienned
2 carrots , diced
2 stalks celery , diced
2 bay leaves
2 quarts fresh chicken or veal stock ( or to cover ) , well seasoned
2 days in advance :
Rub the shoulder with the seasonings and refrigerate in a sealed plastic bag overnight .
Slow smoke the shoulder over hickory or cherry wood , at a temperature of 225 degrees F for 5 to 7 hours , or until the crust is very dark and the internal temperature is about 160 F .
Remove , cool to room temperature , then refrigerate overnight .
Day of service :
Mix the peppers , garlic , onions , carrots , celery , and bay leaves , and place them in the bottom of a large , deep casserole or other ovenproof pan that is at least 5 inches deep .
Preheat the oven to 350 F .
Cut the pork into preferred portion size ( roughly 6 to 9 ounces , depending on how hungry your family is ) .
Wrap each piece with a slice of prosciutto and a leaf of kale .
Place each piece seam - side down on the bed of vegetables in the casserole .
Add the chicken or veal stock , enough to just cover the pork .
Add a little water or white wine if you ’re a little short of liquid .
Cover tightly with a lid or with parchment and foil .
Braise for 3 hours , then remove and allow to rest for 30 minutes .
Serve over risotto or polenta .
Makes 4 to 6 servings .

Thanks for the heads - up Brad ,
Here 's what I just sent them .
Dear EAC ,
As a citizen extremely interested in the integrity of your election systems these are the changes I would dearly love to see .
1 . Repeal HAVA and start over .
2 . Do away with easily hackable electronic voting machines , which is to say all , of them .
3 . My understanding is that Germany , Canada , and Great Britain hand count paper ballots in their elections .
If they can do this and have confidence in their election outcomes , why can't we ?
4 . Create a public domain national exit poll to help ensure the integrity of the vote as they do in many other countries .
5 . Make election day a holiday .
6 . Create simple , efficient , uniform standards for voter registration and voting .
7 . Create a new position in the Obama Administration whose specific task is to create and oversee an efficient , equitable voting system .
8 . Make election fraud and voter suppression felonies and prosecute .
9 . Make it illegal for a Secretary of State to chair any party 's presidential campaign .
10 .
Bring full transparency and citizen oversight back to our election process .
Private companies should not be allowed to claim proprietary rights to any aspect of our public voting system .
It 's is OUR system .
It is NOT Diebold 's , or ES&S's , or Sequoia 's , or any private company's .
Voting , our sacred right , is the foundation upon which all our other rights depend .
Please fix our incredibly dysfunctional system .
No one should have to wait hours to vote .
And no one should go to vote and find themselves incorrectly purged from voter rolls .
Voting should not be an ordeal .
It should be a pleasure .
Thank you for your time .
sincerely ,
David Lasagna

Wow !
What an incredibly generous lead time to be given to get the word out about this !
Before I put together my letter , I 'd like to send a special note of thanks to the EAC for providing us with such a generous 5 - day thinking - and getting - out - the - word period .
Thank - you !

Wow , David Lasagna covered most of the bases !
The only thing I would add is during the hand counting of the ballots , there must be oversight by all parties of the counters .

Please note that the invitation for written testimony is for testimony on items that are on the meeting agenda .
One of the items on the agenda is the EACs Strategic Plan for the next few years .
My comment , amongst others , will be a suggestion that the EAC wait to issue that plan until after it can be commented on by the new administration and congress .
An effort to push this plan through now , before Jan. 20 , seems to be a wish to rush a plan through now so it does not negatively commented on by the new administration and congress .
I also find it amazing that it has now been 5 years since the EAC was stood - up and 7 years since HAVA was signed into law .
The EAC has just now decided that they need a plan on how to provide guidance to the states on HAVA Title III ; AND , they are giving themselves another two years to figure it out .

There 's every reason to rush ... when even someone as pro-corporate as Obama will be forced to ask " WTF ? ! " upon any independent review of the EAC 's actual performance ... much less the very real questions as to its purported purposes , methodology and actual relevance to election reform .
The EAC is trying to show themselves as self - regulating " we can handle it , do n't mind us " types while simultaneously attempting to entrench the HAVA travesty permanently into the American electoral process .
Yeah , they 've got to hurry ...

zap ,
i didnt communicate my thoughts well , the part i dont want rushed is the perm entrenchment of these neocons ideas of " oversight " ... the system they have allowed to be created is an alice in the looking glass sceniorio that makes no sense to any logical thinking person .
i am especially concerned about the soe software becoming a perm fixture for reporting results , as i think it will allow " them " to move numbers with much more ease and less chance of detection remember the larger an area is that reports together , the easier it is to " flip " numbers sadly my hometown has used this software for 3 elections .... in the primary i voted about 2:30 in the afternoon .. it was kind of a big deal as it was my daughters first time to vote , so hubby joined us and we went together we have paper ballots and we feed them into a counter .... the number on the machines counter goes up every time a ballot is fed in at 2:30 the number was over 600 ( 2 precincts vote together ) .. we were talking about the low turnout and commented that we should have at least 800 votes by closing , i remember this because of thinking about bevs 500 / voters per precinct idea when soe software reports for the primary it shows precinct 6 with 263 ballots cast and precinct 9 with 285 ballots cast , less than the 600 plus i remember from hours before the polls closed [ed note : karen , I did a little editing , putting in some spaces and fixing really mangled typos , because some people need to have their computers read this stuff to them and this comment would have been hopeless .
Please try to slow down just a jot , be more careful .
Thank you . -- 99 ]

Dear Agent 99 ,
David forgot to include in his list , " 11 .
And then go away . "
Thanks for the addendum .
I thought I 'd left some stuff out .
I also miswrote " our election systems " as " your election systems " in the beginning making me sound like someone from another country or planet .
Do you think that will give my words less import with the EAC if they suspect I 'm off planet ?
When I saw my representative Barney Frank and recommended abolishing the EAC he was opposed to the idea .
He thought once the Democrats regained power it'd be a good thing to have .
Ah well .
Being really smart , which I believe he is , does n't mean you see everything clearly .
I realize this again and again and again in many contexts .
love ,
Dave

That response from Barney Frank is " ... but they 're our planes now ... " all over again .
And the sadly funny thing is that those who are screaming " FEDERAL CONTROL OF ELECTIONS NOW NOW NOW ! " do n't seem to realize that it was n't the Feds who led and still lead the way in election reforms ... it was citizens and then some academics and institutions , and then certain local officials and then certain state officials ...
I think the Founders would have said " Told ya so ! "
All the Feds have done was first to support and then to mandate and enforce a corrupt and corporate - controlled regime .
No , not Bushco ... e-voting .
And I think the Founders would have said " Told ya about that too ! "

I think you should get a friend to fill out the FOIA request for you then .
I do n't know anyone in particular to recommend for it , but maybe John or Brad do ....
Spaces between words .
Do n't type like you are texting or chatting .
Type as though it were a letter to someone in the analog world and then the computers can make out what you are saying well enough to read it to the hard - of - seeing who frequent this blog .
If you want to say peops instead of people , spell it peeps , so the machine can at least pronounce it right .
Right now I can just hear the computer voices out there going " pee-ops " ....

THANK YOU , BRAD !
I distilled it down to my favorite nobody - else - cares - about - this point .
Dear Madam Chairwoman :
Thank you for your time and for offering me the opportunity to comment on voting system performance for the EAC's December 8th public meeting .
All computers , paper and people will inevitably fail at some point .
Until we understand this and consider that our election laws can and should be the failsafe step of every election , independent of voting methods , we cannot guarantee the integrity of any election .
Election laws must be upgraded to be on par with technology , to recognize voting anomalies and statistically improbable results , and to define and enforce immediate corrective action .
As an example , Florida ping - pongs from one faulty solution to the next without addressing that most basic problem .
What should we do when the election fails for whatever reason ?
Bad ballot design , programming error , defective touchscreens , fraud …
In the end , the type of failure does n’t matter as long as we have a procedure to catch the failure , regroup , correct and if necessary rescind and do over .
Florida ’s election laws already contain some , “ if this happens , do that . ”
But we ’ve proven it ’s not enough .
In the event of an election fault , the country waits for the courts to decide the people ’s choice , while the political party in power ultimately controls the win .
Our 2000 debacle resulted from Florida ’s failure to maintain the voting equipment properly and inferior card stock .
However it was the failure of Florida 's election laws that permitted the chaos that followed .
In 2006 , it was the failure of Florida 's election laws that permitted Sarasota ’s election with statistically improbable results to stand .
While no one even questioned 2006 ’s 89 K missing votes statewide in the Attorney General ’s race .
Same high undervote , same machines .
Had Florida 's election laws been more comprehensive , the 2000 and 2006 elections would have been automatically rescinded in the questionable counties .
As Americans we can individually and independently choose to vote for our future … or not .
Our vote is our power to be heard , to take an active part in our own destiny .
When that right is taken from us by negligence , error , incompetence or an accident of technology , it is an insult to this country and those who sacrificed their lives for our freedoms .
None of us , not red , not blue , not independent , not indifferent should accept this chipping away at democracy .
Sincerely , Lani Massey Brown
Former election systems manager

Oh the irony .
Hello U.S. Election Assistance Commission ,
Well , it 's only been since 23 August 2008 , since the last time I commented on how you failed and wasted everybody 's time .
In that light nothing has changed since that time .
Your still using electronic vote tabulation devices , and now you 've allowed vote caging .
You ask for public input but you provide no feedback , and you ignore advice .
In that light , this request to me to provide comments , will save my own time , as you obviously care less about citizens and your just going through your Standard Operating Procedure motions , be honest , you do n't give a crap what the people say .
So this comment will be a simple cut and paste of the SAME THING I TOLD YOU LAST TIME .
This way it takes me 5 minutes instead of 7 hours .

Allow all counts and processes to be open to any member of the public .
If its too crowded , put them on live and recorded video , or behind a glass window .
And post and publish when they will all take place .
Once enough people are able to observe the maze of shams , and start asking questions , the problem will take care of itself .
Or at least the easily changed problems will , and then focus can be concentrated on the harder , hidden problems .

Bruce Willis Walks Off Set and Gets Sued
Actorwent from acting to directing and it sounds like things did n't go as planned for the production company that recently hired him .
Foresight Unlimited is suing Willis for walking off the set
The movie Three Stories About Joan was to be directed by Willis , who signed a deal to be paid $ 196,404 and work within a $ 20 million budget .
Owen Wilson and Camilla Belle were signed to co-star in the film .
Here is what we know : a suit was filed in LA County Superior Court which alleges that Willis left the set without any notice and has never returned .
Bruce would only say that it was for personal reasons .
The production company is seeking $ 4 million in damages .
Marty Stinger , who is known to be a " pit bull " of a lawyer , represents Bruce and calls the lawsuit absurd .
Stinger says the producers are at fault for not having the money to pay anyone or open escrow accounts .

Then a police officer rolled by in his squad car .
He called Mr. VanRy over , and handed him the summons .
Few people would be happy in that situation .
But most would figure that the path of least resistance was to pay the 25 bucks .
Not Mr. VanRy , who is 40 and works for a supplier of stock film footage , video and music .
He challenged the summons .
He got a lawyer .
He filed motions .
He showed up in court four times .
No , he corrected himself , make that five times .
For one reason or another , delays kept coming .
It just did n’t seem right to him to be ticketed for sitting on his own stoop bothering no one .
As he saw it , this was an example of “ the government poking its nose into what heretofore would have been considered private parts of our lives or private parts of our space . ”
“ I also think , ” he said , “ that it goes against some long - held traditions , particularly in the outer boroughs , of sitting outdoors and meeting people that walk by randomly .
You get to know each other ’s names and their dogs ’ names .
That ’s one of the charming parts of living in one of the boroughs . ”

As the case wore on , “ the reaction of judges and even some court officers was sort of amazement that somebody would follow through on this , ” he said .
Also intrigued were many readers of a community newspaper , The Brooklyn Paper .
They responded to , and debated , a series of articles about the Battle of the Stoop .
The phenomenon is known as " ovum in ovo "
A woman from Somerset discovered another egg inside the boiled egg she was preparing to eat for her breakfast .
Ann Lewis , 47 , from Taunton , said she had eaten plenty of " double - yolkers " before but that she was very surprised at the unusual find .
Douglas Russell , from the Natural History Museum , said : " A complete egg found within a complete egg is relatively rare . "
Ms Lewis , who works as a waitress , bought the egg from a local farm .
Experts puzzled
Douglas Russell , speaking about the phenomenon in the New Scientist , said : " As the curator of the British Natural History Museum egg collection , I 've come across quite a few examples of egg oddities .
" Double eggs ( as opposed to multiple - yolked eggs ) are less common than some other zoological anomalies and consequently the ovum in ovo has attracted specific scholarly attention for hundreds of years .
" Several theories have been proposed for the origin of double eggs .
" The most likely suggests that the normal rhythmic muscular action , or peristalsis , that moves a developing egg down the oviduct malfunctions in some way . "

____________________________________________________________________________
Ever since first hearing of it last spring , I ’ve had a deepening sense of foreboding – an unnamed dread of the upcoming shift to an all - digital television broadcast signal , scheduled to occur in February 2009 .
Now , I believe , that nameless dread may have a name , after all .
The Department of Defense calls it Silent Sound Spread Spectrum ( SSSS ) , and it also goes by the name of S - quad or Squad .
In the private sector , the technology goes by the name of Silent Subliminal Presentation System and the technology has also been released to certain corporate vendors who have attached catchy brand names like BrainSpeak Silent Subliminals to their own SSSS - based products .
Whatever you call it , SSSS is a technology that uses subliminal programming that is carried over Ultra - High Frequency ( UHF ) broadcast waves , planting inaudible messages directly into the subconscious human mind .
Perfected more than twenty years ago by the Department of Defense and battlefield - tested upon unwitting Iraqi soldiers serving in the army of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War during 1991 , SSSS is a sinister weapon that may have been been developed for a specific mission : the total subjugation of the American people .
Whether SSSS is coupled with the new all - digital TV signal as its means of delivery into the minds of an unsuspecting U.S. populace or not , it can be deployed by many different devices , including HAARP and GWEN towers , which would effectively blanket the entire nation at once .
In fact , Judy Wall says that “ there is evidence that the US Government has plans to extend the range of this technology to envelop all peoples , all countries .
This can be accomplished , is being accomplished , by utilising the nearly completed HAARP project for overseas areas and the GWEN network now in place in the US .
The US Government denies all this . ”
But the most insidious aspect of SSSS is that it is completely undetectable by those being targeted .
Because it delivers its subliminal programming directly to the human brain via the auditory sense at frequencies that humans are incapable of perceiving as sound , there is no defense against it .
Everyone on the planet is equally susceptible to mind control via SSSS and there is n’t any escape from it , as the UHF waves can be transmitted over very long distances from remotely located sources and will pass through walls and other objects as if they are not there .
UHF is the frequency ( 100 mhz ) that has been used for television and radio broadcasting for as long as these media have existed .
SSSS is designed to utilize UHF as a carrier wave .
Even more insidious , though , is the fact that , coupled with the use of supercomputers , an individual ’s unique electroencephalographic ( EEG ) patterns can be digitally altered and then stored for rebroadcast via digital UHF .
According to Judy Wall , editor and publisher of Resonance , the newsletter of the Bioelectromagnetics Special Interest Group , these computer - enhanced EEGs “ can identify and isolate the brain ’s low - amplitude ’ emotion signature clusters , ’ synthesise them and store them on another computer .
In other words , by studying the subtle characteristic brainwave patterns that occur when a subject experiences a particular emotion , scientists have been able to identify the concomitant brainwave pattern and can now duplicate it . ”
These modified emotion signature clusters can then be broadcast over UHF carrier frequencies ( i.e. , regular TV and radio signals ) directly into the brain where they can then “ silently trigger the same basic emotion in another human being . ”
In other words , if the emotional signature cluster for , say , a feeling of hopelessness and despair is being fed directly into your brain via unseen radio waves , you will feel those emotions .
The implications of this are , quite literally , mind boggling .
Polls have always shown that the vast majority of Americans believe religion is " an important part of their daily lives " -- 65 % in a recent Gallup poll versus just 34 % who said it was n't .
But that national average obscures a stunning variety by region .
For starters , the Gallup poll shows that there still is a Bible Belt .

The 2009 F1 season gets off to a start with the season - opener in Australia this weekend .
The sport ’s governing body the FIA has made a number of significant changes to the overall rules overseeing the entire season .
According to the official website : “ The new technical changes have 3 main objectives – reducing the role of aerodynamics in the cars ’ performance ; making overtaking easier ; and keeping lap times in check . ”
Here are a few ( not all ) , of the regulations and changes in rules that come into effect for the 2009 season .
The rules can be broadly separated into two distinct categories – Technical Regulations – affecting the design of the cars and Sporting Regulations – inmpacting how the races will be run .
Changes in the Technical Regulations
Tyres :
After ten years of seeing grooved tyres , F1 enthusiasts wil lsee thereturn of slicks .
A change in nomenclature too for the tyres known as ‘ standard wets ’ last year are now called ‘ intermediates ’ and ‘ extreme wets ’ are called just ‘ wets ’ .
At each race the softer of the two dry compounds available and the wet weather tyres will be marked with green rings to distinguish themselves .
KERS : In a radically new approach endorsed by the FIA , teams may use Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems ( KERS ) .
Using a KERS system is not compulsory and teams are allowed to run KERS and non-KERS equipped cars at different races .
KERS may give them a power boost of up to 400 kilojoules per lap which roughly equals 82 bhp for 6.6 seconds , though the power could be used in different ways , although the most common way would be in the form of giving a boost to the engine for a short period of time to aid in overtaking .
Aerodynamics :
The cars ’ front wings may be adjusted while the car is moving a maximum of twice per lap by a maximum of six degrees .
There are new restrictions on the aerodynamic shape of the cars : front wings may now be wider , rear wings are narrower and taller leaving many people disappointed with the apparent lack of aesthetic appeal of the 2009 season cars .
Most of the winglets and other aero aids like barge boards , winglets , turning vanes and chimneys that used to be on the cars have been banned .
Rear diffusers are more tightly limited in size and shape .
The cars must now have four onboard camera housings instead of two , so hopefully viewers should see TV pictures from a variety of different camera angles this year .
Engines : Engines may not exceed 18,000rpm ( reduced from 19,000 rpm of last year ) .
Drivers must now use the same engine for three , rather than two , consecutive events .
Teams will be limited to eight engines per season – eight for each race driver and an additional four for testing .
Just one team – Renault – has been allowed to make performance modifications to their engine for 2009 in order to help equalise power outputs .
Testing :
In an attempt to reduce costs , the FIA and manufacturers have agreed that there will be NO testing during the entire F1 season .
Any and all testing will have taken place in the pre-season .
There is also a limit on 15,000 Kms of allowable testing within a calendar year .
Changes in the Sporting Regulations :
Pitlane Access during Safety Car periods :
The rule stating that the pit lane is closed during a Safety Car period will be scrapped in 2009 .
The rule was introduced in 2007 to avoid people rushing back to the pits to refuel , possibly speeding through a danger zone , but software has been successfully developed to solve this problem .
The pit lane will now remain open throughout any safety - car period , allowing drivers to refuel without penalty .
However , to ensure that drivers are not tempted to speed back to the pit lane , a new software system which employs GPS and the cars ’ standard ECU has been introduced .
When the safety car is deployed , each driver is given a minimum ‘ back to pit ’ time based on his position on track .
If he arrives in the pit lane before that time he will be penalised .
Points System : After a lot of hemming and hawing and a controversial decision to award the Drivers ’
Championship to the driver with most wins was vetoed by the Formula 1 Teams Association ( FOTA ) , there will be no change in the 2009 season from the previous year with the 10 - 8 - 6-5-4-3 - 2 - 1 points system remaining in place .
The driver with the most points wins .
Pre-race weights :
After qualifying , the FIA will publish the weight at which all cars are expected to start the race , giving spectators an accurate gauge of what fuel load each driver is carrying .
Calendar changes :
The debuting Abu Dhabi Grand Prix has been added to the race calendar , as part of Formula One ’s expansion in the Middle East .
The race will take place at the Hermann Tilke - designed Yas Marina Circuit , which is will be the final round of the 2009 World Championship on 1 November , 2009 .
After being dropped in 2007 and replaced by the Fuji Speedway , the Suzuka Circuit will return to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009 .
The race will then alternate between the two circuits .
2009 will be the first Formula One season since 1958 with no Grand Prix in North America
The organisers of the French Grand Prix announced via their official website that the race would no longer be part of the 2009 season , citing “ economic problems ” .
This will be the second time that there has not been a French Grand Prix on the schedule since the start of the World Drivers ’ Championship in 1950 .
The only previous time was 1955 .

A motorised tripod with a robotic finger can capture images with amazing resolution using a consumer digital camera .
This image stitched from 1750 photos and capturing a panoramic view in Hawaii ( top ) contains impressive detail ( bottom ) ( Image : Richard Palmer )
The best professional digital cameras can capture photos containing tens of megapixels .
But , thanks to an affordable robotic tripod , it is now possible to use a consumer camera to take images in the gigapixel range &ndash like this one of President Obama ’s inauguration .
The tripod robot , called Gigapan , was developed at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and uses motors to capture a scene with a grid of hundreds or thousands of images with the camera set to full zoom .
Photo stitching software then combines them into a single super - detailed image containing billions of pixels , called a gigapan .
The largest , most spectacular gigapans can be too large to handle on all but the most powerful desktop computers .
The result is too detailed to be viewed on any printout , but gigapans can be uploaded to a dedicated site where users are able zoom right into the imagesl .

With an affordable version of the device launched last month , the three - legged robot has the potential to be a boon to science , as well as holiday snaps .
Environmental record
A select group of around 25 scientists were among Gigapan ’s early testers , in a project supported by a Pittsburgh non-profit organisation .
After being introduced to Gigapan at a workshop last summer , the researchers were told to go out and experiment .
Botanist Richard Palmer at the Hawaii State Department of Health got his hands on one of the very first models at the end of 2007 and is in the process of working out how to use Gigapan to help monitor vulnerable environments .
Working with colleague Kim Bridges at the University of Hawaii and the US Geological Service , Palmer has recorded large gigapans in a valley , Kawela Gulch , denuded by feral goats and cattle grazing ( see one here ) .
‘ Biopiracy ’ weapon
Successive panoramas will be taken every few months to provide a new way to document the recovery of vegetation over time .
Palmer has also pioneered a way to take gigapan images using a macro lens , providing a way to document herbarium specimens in sub-millimetre detail ( see a gigapan of a herbarium specimen ) .
That could help smaller institutions , especially in developing countries document species , he says .
By distributing gigapans instead of actual specimens , “ this technique would allay fears that loaned specimens may never be returned and would also better regulate bioprospecting , ” he says .
Small herbariums can be victims of “ biopiracy “ , when DNA is extracted from loaned specimens to look for potentially valuable genes and molecules .
3D landscapes
Geologist Ron Schott , at Fort Hays State University , has also pushed the limits of gigapan photography .
He made the first 3D gigapans , viewed using red - green glasses to give a striking perspective on geological features even as you zoom in and out ( see an example of a 3D gigapan ) .
They are made by combining two gigapans taken from slightly different positions .
Schott is currently working to see if it is possible to build a detailed 3D virtual model of a landscape from a stereo gigapan .
Like Palmer , he has an eye on monitoring changing landscapes .
“ I ’m eager to see if this can be used to monitor and measure erosion rates in places such as the Castle Rock Badlands ( see gigapan ) in western Kansas , ” he says .
Schott has also led the way in exploring what can be done with gigapans online , using the programming tools provided by the Gigapan site .
One example shows how two gigapans can be presented side by side ( see gigapans ) to allow easy comparison , or matching of geological faults or other scenes .
Another , the “ guided gigapan ” , takes the viewer on the tour of an image with a syncronised soundtrack explaining what they can see ( click for an example ) .
SLR model ?
While Palmer , Schott and other researchers using Gigapan – such as archaeologist Sarah Sharpe excavating the Great Temple ( see gigapan ) in Petra , Jordan , and
Bill Walleur who tracks chimps ( see gigapan ) with the Jane Goodall Institute in Tanzania – will continue to experiment , they are also keenly awaiting new models of the robotic helper .
One often requested feature is for it to be made sturdy enough to handle large SLR cameras , not just large “ compact ” cameras .
Such versions are being developed , as well as a model that takes time - lapse panoramas .
Meanwhile , more scientists are being recruited to try out Gigapan , with workshops for them planned for May and October .

At least 22 people have died in a crush at a football stadium during a World Cup qualifier in Ivory Coast .
More than 130 people were injured in the stampede at the Houphouet - Boigny arena in the West African country 's city of Abidjan .
About 36,000 spectators were in the stadium , where hosts Ivory Coast beat Malawi 5 - 0 .
The BBC's John James says it was packed for the return of Chelsea striker Didier Drogba , who scored twice .
Our correspondent says the authorities tried in vain to control the panicking crowd .
One report said the police had fired tear gas to control the stampeding fans .
Wall collapses
The ministry of sport and the Ivorian Football Federation have confirmed the number of deaths and say the incident occurred when thousands of fans tried to squeeze into the city 's main stadium .
The stadium was packed for the return of Chelsea striker Didier Drogba A wall collapsed , reportedly under the weight of the supporters , causing those already trying to squeeze into the stadium to panic .
Interior Minister Desire Tagro told state television : " Lots of fans showed up , " reported AP news agency .
" They started pushing to get in because the match was about to start and each and every one of them wanted to get in . "
The incident occurred before the game began but the fixture was allowed to go ahead .
The stadium was reportedly sold out in advance of the game after cut - price tickets went on sale .
AFRICA FOOTBALL DISORDER

The arena has just been refurbished but our correspondent says at this stage it seems the sheer number of people who wanted to get into the match proved too much .
Other European - based stars playing in Sunday 's game were Drogba 's Chelsea team - mate Salomon Kalou , as well as Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Eboue of Arsenal .
The home side also featured Tottenham 's Didier Zokora , Sevilla 's Ndri Romaric and Marseille forward Bakari Kone .
Hundreds of fans have died during riots and stampedes at football games across Africa over the last decade .
Correspondents say poorly - equipped security forces are often unable to control the crowds .

There ’s an upside to the economy being down in the dumps : Less trash .
Consumers are eating fewer meals away from home , reducing food waste -- the No. 1 space hog at landfills .
Contractors are building fewer homes and tossing aside less drywall , lumber and other heavy debris .
Pack rats who ca n’t afford to move are postponing cleaning out their closets , landfill operators say .
For a commentary on California ’s economic health , visit its landfills , where disposal rates are hitting record lows .
Over the last six months , operators at Puente Hills Landfill , among the nation ’s largest , have noted a 30 % decrease in tonnage from neighboring municipalities .
The dump used to close at noon because it would reach its daily tonnage limit ; now it stays open all day without hitting that mark .
Advertisement
San Francisco is disposing of less in landfills than it has in 30 years .
In San Diego , disposal rates at the Miramar Landfill are on track to bring in the lowest total in 15 years .
“ There always have been three givens in life : death , taxes and garbage , ” said Evan Edgar , a civil engineer and a regulatory advocate for the California Refuse Recycling Council .
“ Since the 1970s , that ’s been a mantra in our industry .
But what this recession has shown is that we will have death and taxes , but garbage is no longer recession - proof . ”
Southern Californians confirm that concerns about layoffs and unstable gasoline prices are prompting them to buy little except necessities .
And it shows in the makeup of their trash .
“ I spend less , ” said Sara Serrano , 46 , an employee at Costco in Los Feliz .
She said that the warehouse store now rarely sees the long lines that until last spring had been common during her 13 years there .
“ My trash can -- the recycle one -- I do n’t bring it out anymore .
My other one only has one or two bags in it a week , where before it was three or more . ”
Advertisement
Glendale retiree Helga Santiago , 63 , said she ’s taken to finding second uses for oversized packaging such as cereal boxes and for disposable glasses and plates before tossing them in the recycling bin .
The former home - care aide to the elderly said she never strays from her list at the grocery store , sticking to staples such as oranges and rice .
The reduction in trash has been a blessing for many municipalities statewide , because they had begun seeing steep declines in revenue from their recycling programs when commodity prices tanked last fall .
Now , they are able to offset some of those losses by paying less in landfill fees called tipping fees .
However , the trend has had the opposite effect in San Diego , where the Miramar Landfill is owned by the city .
Officials there are grappling with whether to cut services or raise fees to make up in part for tipping fee losses .
Haulers ferried 66,000 tons of trash to the landfill in December , a 12 % decline from the same period a year ago .
Construction and demolition waste plunged 80 % , from 36,000 tons in December 2007 to 7,000 tons last month .
Advertisement
Frugal consumer buying habits like those practiced by Serrano and Santiago are reflected in the city of Los Angeles ’ waste stream .
The city collected 6 % less trash in the last three months , saving the Bureau of Sanitation $ 405,728 in tipping fees compared to what it paid for a similar period in 2007 .
This savings more than made up for a $ 254,000 drop in recycling revenue , said Enrique Zaldivar , the bureau ’s director .
And that raises another consequence of the downturn : its effect on recycling .
The slumping economy has driven down commodity prices for plastic , glass and especially paper in ways that have discouraged conservation advocates and dented city programs that depend on revenue from recycling .
Los Angeles is less vulnerable to unpredictable swings in commodity prices -- which for some materials , such as cardboard , fell by as much as 90 % in recent weeks -- because its contractor has agreed to pay , in most cases , a minimum of $ 25 per ton of recyclables , Zaldivar said .
Advertisement
Still , he worries that volatility in the market could cause some recycling companies to go under .
In San Diego , the city expects that recycling revenues for the fiscal year starting July 1 will be half what they were two years ago , when it collected $ 6.2 million from selling used glass , plastic and cardboard .
Declines in recycling revenues and tipping fees will require some tough choices for the city during this spring ’s budget negotiations , especially given that a 1919 law prohibits the city from assessing a trash fee on single - family homes , said Stephen Grealy , waste reduction program manager .
“ We ’re pretty close to the bone , ” he said .
“ We have been in a situation of not having a lot of funds for many years . ”
The recession and falling commodity prices have also caused officials at Puente Hills Landfill to trim costs .
The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts , operator of the dump , recently reduced the days that contract workers sort recyclables at one of its material recovery centers from five days a week to one , said Habib Kharrat , supervising engineer in solid waste operations .
Advertisement
“ Recoverables do n’t have value anymore for selling , so they wo n’t cover the labor , ” he said .
“ What ’s happening now is that more of that material ends up at the landfill . ”
With fewer contract workers sorting materials at Puente Hills , the districts decided to send some recyclable material to the dump -- about 16 tons of the 400 tons disposed of at the center each day .
The landfill itself accepts about 9,000 tons of trash on a daily basis .
Even though the trashed recyclables account for a fraction of overall garbage collection activity , conservation experts fear that the recession may set the state back in its efforts to reuse most of its waste .
In 2008 , California posted the nation ’s highest recycling rate , diverting 58 % of its trash from landfills , according to the California Integrated Waste Management Board .
Advertisement
This rate is “ definitely going to drop .
We do n’t know how much , ” said Gary Petersen , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s environmental appointee to the board .
He added that officials hope to take advantage of the unstable commodities market by building more facilities to reuse trash in the state .
Less trash at landfills can be attributed in part to a state law calling for 50 % of trash to be diverted from dumps .
But officials say that even taking the state ’s unusual recycling rates into account , the recent falloff in disposal rates is largely the result of less consumption .
“ There is definitely a drop in trash and that is probably due to a bit more to the recession than it is to recycling , ” said Edgar , the regulatory advocate .
“ People are n’t producing as much garbage because they ’re not buying as much . ”

I was n’t as big of a 300 fan as my friends , and the purist in me was always a little frustrated with the “ fast zombie ” take on Dawn of the Dead .
So when Zack Snyder became attached to direct Watchmen , I was less enthused than my buddies .
But that was before I read the novel , and before I saw the trailer .
Seeing a taste of what Snyder is bringing to the film and understanding the tone of the source material , I finally see that his appointment as director was a no - brainer .
God knows it could have gone in another direction .
Names like Terry Gilliam , Paul Greengrass , and Joel Silver have been attached to this material over the twenty - year development process .
As a recently converted Watchmen fan , the story of the movie ’s development was total news to me , but it ’s interesting enough to make a movie all its own .
It all started in 1986 when Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired the rights to the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons .
This is the same year that the serialized version of the graphic novel hit store shelves .
Silver began to work on his version of the novel .
Now remember , this is 1986 , the year of Big Trouble in Little China , The Delta Force , and Cobra .
Action movies were in …big , dumb action movies with stunts and machine gun fire and jumping off buildings .
So it is no surprise that Silver ’s take was to include Arnold Schwarzenegger in a main role and up - the - ante of action .
Sam Hamm , screenwriter of Tim Burton ’s Batman , rewrote the novel into a more traditional action screenplay .
The ending of the novel was changed to include an assassination and a time paradox .
As Keanu would say , “ Woah . ”
Needless to say , this would have been a very interesting take on Watchmen .
Thank God it did n’t get made .
In 1991 , Fox put the project into turnaround , and the rights were acquired by Warner Brothers .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is how far back the rights dispute that threatened Watchmen ’s release goes .
More on that later .
Warner turned to director Terry Gilliam and his standby writer , Charles McKeown , to make the film with Silver and Gordon still attached to produce .
This is when Watchmen became a little more Watchmen-ish .
Money was hard to find as Gilliam had gone over budget on a few other films .
Eventually , the director dropped out of the project , declaring the graphic novel “ unfilmable . ”
Warner Bros. dropped the project , and Gilliam and Watchmen fans alike began to weep openly in public .
This is where Silver takes his leave of absence from our story , leaving Gordon alone with the project .
In 2001 , Gordon partnered with Lloyd Levin , producer of movies like Event Horizon , The Rocketeer , and United 93 .
The two worked with Universal Studios to shoot the movie with Scorpion King and X - Men writer David Hayter both writing and directing the film .
Hayter soon left the project because of “ creative differences , ” and the movie was briefly put in the hands of Revolution Studios .
When it fell apart there , Paramount picked up the ball and ran with it , attaching Darren Aronofsky of Requiem for a Dream and Pi fame to direct Hayter ’s script .
This was in 2004 , and all the geeks of the world had one collective orgasm .
But like all orgasms , it would n’t last .
Aronofsky left to direct The Fountain ( an amazing film with its own production woes ) , and Paul Greengrass was brought in to direct Watchmen .
Greengrass updated the story , extending Watchmen ’s alternate reality into 2004 .
It did n’t work out , and Paramount became yet another studio to place Watchmen in turnaround .
Gordon and Levin went back to Warner Brothers .
Impressed with 300 , they approached Zack Snyder to direct the film .
Snyder enlisted the help of Alex Tse to create a new screenplay which pulled from other versions but brought the story back to its original 1980′s setting .
Originally set as a two - hour PG - 13 movie , Watchmen developed into a two and a half hour R - rated movie with a three hour director ’s cut .
There would be one more piece of well - publicized drama as Fox filed a lawsuit claiming that when Warner Brothers bought the rights from Fox ( way back when ) , they did n’t acquire all the rights to distribute the film .
For a brief moment which seemed like an eternity , it looked like Fox might actually get the film shelved ( at least for a time ) .
But all Fox really wanted was free money , and the dispute was settled , no doubt with large chunks of cash changing hands .
The movie coming out March 6 is said to be the most faithful adaptation that was ever bandied about .
Illustrator Dave Gibbons was brought on as a consultant on the film , and Snyder went to great pains to recreate certain key frames of the graphic novel .
Alan Moore refuses to ever see any adaptation of his work .
Which is kinda awesome .
We ’re less than two weeks away from Watchmen ’s release .
Reviews are popping up everywhere , and the general word - of - mouth has been very positive ( minus some bitching about the lack of the squid ) .
So while it took me a while to come around to Zack Snyder ’s side of things , I can now see the logic .
These are comic book heroes in a comic book world that looks a lot like our own .
His visual style , showcased in 300 , can compliment this material perfectly ( assuming he avoids using too much slo - mo ) .
And as long as he stays faithful to the characters and story , I think the movie will invariably contain all the subtext and thematic brilliance that is in the novel .
Well , that ’s about all I have in me for today .
It ’s March , folks , and the movie news and reviews pickens are slim .
Couple that with the fact that our site is filled with Watchmen fanatics , and you ’ll understand why you ’ll be seeing a lot more analysis about the novel and film as we move toward release date .
Stay tuned .
With fat - cat bankers on both sides of the Atlantic about as popular as a sneeze in an elevator you might imagine they would be especially careful with their reputation in any aspect of what they do that does not involve losing billions .
Maybe that is why HSBC last week ran , in this paper and others , an advert for " Half - price Green HSBC Plus " .
It 's an online account basically .
So the deal is you " save paper by receiving no paper statements , cheque book or paying - in book … and no paper marketing . "
Reader
Tom contacted me about this .
He was curious to see the other incentives .
" I suspect that the small saving of paper would be more than compensated by long - haul travel and greater car use , with preferential rates offered for ' worldwide travel insurance ' and ' roadside breakdown assistance ' in the same ' green ' ad . "
I suspect you may be right , Tom.
HSBC 's marketing people really can't have got the zeitgeist right when they sweet talk us greenies with the prospect of better flying and driving .
They used to offer things like cheap green electricity and reduced subscriptions to the Ecologist magazine .
Not now .
But there 's quite a lot that bankers do n't seem to get right now .
Exploring the bank 's website for more details , it feels like green blackmail .
Sign up to the green account option and HSBC promises to " radically reduce the amount of paper we send you " – which , of course , is mostly unwanted mailshots anyway .
So we are being invited to sign up to green banking in order to persuade them not to send us marketing stuff that we never asked for in the first place .
Dear green - minded bankers , if you think it will make a difference , why do n't you just stop sending the junk mail ?
Period .
Now .
The greenwash persists .
Reading the online bumf , I discovered the promise that " for each account you switch , we will plant one virtual tree in our virtual forest . "
Sounds green , but what 's a virtual forest ?
Is that anything like a real forest , or something in Second Life ?
Well , only a bit .
Keep clicking and it transpires that " for every 20 virtual trees we promise to plant a real one . "
One day .
Because it turns out they have 400,000 " virtual trees " in stock already and the best they can say two years on is that " we are now working with Trees for Cities to prepare the planting . "
It would be good to hear news about that .
Because 400,000 accounts is a lot to get on the back of promises to plant trees .
I can hear the complaints from HSBC over this blog now .
Maybe I am being unfair .
They have employed some proper environmentalists .
They put some solar panels up at their London HQ .
The HSBC Climate Partnership involves them investing the not inconsiderable sum of $ 100 m in green groups such as WWF over five years .
Though I wonder how such green deals will fare in the current financial climate .
In 2005 HSBC declared itself " carbon neutral " , by which it meant it has reduced and offset its emissions from its direct business activities — not that its investment portfolio is carbon neutral .
So when you put your money into that green account , you will still be investing in logging in Borneo , palm oil projects in Indonesia and digging up tar sands in Canada .
But hey , at least you wo n't have a paper chequebook .
• How many more green scams , cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there ?

BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - Argentine builders stumbled across the wreck of an 18th century Spanish galleon while digging the foundations for a riverside high - rise building in Buenos Aires , archeologists said on Tuesday .
Experts combing the remains of the ship said they did not expect it to contain treasure , but so far they have discovered several canons and well - preserved earthenware jars that were probably used to store olive oil .
The remains of the galleon were found on a building site close to the shores of the River Plate and archeologists from Buenos Aires city government think the boat was probably shipwrecked some 300 years ago .
“ You can see it ’s very old and we think it dates from the 1700s , although it ’s also possible that it ’s from the 1600s , ” said archeologist Marcelo Waissel .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any treasure , but what there will be is a nice collection of artifacts , ” he told local television , adding it was the first time such a discovery had been made in the city .
Workmen were helping the investigators retrieve artifacts from the site and Waissel said the city government would ensure that the discovery was preserved even though the construction of the building will continue .
“ The building ’s going to go ahead and the area will be protected so the archeologists can carry on recovering bits of what ’s been found , ” Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri told reporters at the site in the Puerto Madero district , an area of former docks and reclaimed land that has been redeveloped with offices , apartments and upmarket restaurants in recent years .
In a world where zombies exist , Tofu the Vegan Zombie is the friendly alternative to his meat - eating brethren .
He was created accidentally , when his brain was lost during an experiment and replaced with a block of tofu by the prankster , Lab Monkey # 5 .
When the little zombie boy woke up , he no longer raved meat but veggies and grains .
As long as the block stays in his head he remains that way .
The man responsible for Tofu is Professor Vost .
He has dedicated his life to finding a cure for the zombie epidemic , plaguing mankind .
What he has discovered so far about the illness is truly shocking .
The source of the sickness is animals , which are being genetically altered to make them meatier and tastier .
The culprit behind this wicked crime is the evil billionaire and meat - processing magnate Mallesteros .
Mallesteros knows his product causes zombie - ism and he is n’t bothered by it .
To him it just ensures repeat customers , because his meat is the only thing that keeps zombies docile .
He and Vost have a past and though at one time they were friends , the two are now bitter enemies .
Tofu lives with the Professor , his daughter Addie and Lab Monkey # 5 .
Though he is able to walk among both humans and zombies , Tofu is never fully trusted or accepted by either group .
Addie cares about Tofu and tries to make him feel part of the family by bringing him along with her and Lab Monkey # 5 for fun and adventures .
However , Monkey ’s mischievous , playful nature , often gets Tofu and Addie into trouble .
As for the Professor , he treats Tofu like a son and wants to keep him safe from the dangers in the world .
He knows that because Tofu is different , there is always a chance someone might try and harm him .
Vost is convinced the boy is the key to solving the zombie epidemic .
The question remains , can he unlock the mystery of the tofu block before the world ’s population is turned into the undead ?

Old Google Earth satellite photos , dug up by the * News * of Pakistan , show U.S. drones , parked on a Pakistani runway , back in 2006 .
The paper ID 's the robotic planes as massive Global Hawk drones – unlikely , the shape 's all wrong .
More likely , the aircraft found at coordinates 27 degrees 51 minutes North , 65 degrees and 10 minutes East are Predator drones .
Google Earth no longer shows the planes at the airfield , " built by Arab sheiks for falconry trips , " according to the * Times * of London .
But the 2009 - edition images do show several new buildings – including what appears to be a hangar , big enough for several Predators .
Pakistani blogger Teeth Maestro , for one , is not at all pleased by what he sees .

Dear Dr. Shulgin :
Dear _ Anon_ ,
Psilocybe
psilocybe
I have been puzzled , why this compound ( 4 - HO - 5 - methoxy - N , N - dimethyltryptamine ) was n't included in TIHKAL -- for me it looks very appealing .
Have you by the way , ever looked into cathinone ( beta - keto - amphetamine ) analogues of some of the psychedelic amphetamines ( DOB , TMA - 2 , etc . )
The MDMA - analogue ( Methylone ) is active indeed , do you think the 2,4 - 5 - substitution pattern could be applied onto the CATs ?
_Anon_I totally agree with you .
4 - Hydroxy - 5 - methoxy - N,N-dimethyltryptamine would be a fascinating compound to explore .
The reason it's not in TIKHAL is that it is virtually unknown .
The only report of it in the chemical literature was a paper published by Marc Julia 's group at the Pasteur Institute in 1965 .
They reported the synthesis and physical properties of the compound but to my knowledge it has never been explored in any way .
The synthesis is quite a frightening thing .
It starts with ortho - vanillin and takes approximately 10 steps to get to the 4,5 - HO - MeO - DMT .
I 'm not surprised that no one has pursued the compound .
However there is a very interesting study that took place in Leipzig about 15 years ago .
Jochen Gartz , a mushroom explorer whom I know quite well , has done some fascinating studies withspecies by raising them on solid media containing strange tryptamines that are alien to the mushroom .
Apparently the enzymes that are responsible for the 4 - hydroxy group of psilocin are indifferent to what it is they choose to 4 - hydroxylate .
He has taken things like DPT or DIPT and put them in the growth media and the fruiting bodies that came out contain 4 - hydroxy - DPT or 4 - hydroxy - DIPT instead of psilocin .
In fact , he has a patent on the process .
These active compounds are made by the mushroom so they really are natural and yet they never have been observed in nature .
I 'll give you even odds that if you put spores of aspecies on cow droppings loaded with 5 - MeO - DMT you would come out with mushrooms containing 4,5 - HO - MeO - DMT .
This way you avoid a 10 step synthesis by growing a psychoactive mushroom that contains no illegal drug .
Your idea of making analogues of the psychoactive amphetamines with the carbonyl that is characteristic of CAT would probably be a disappointment .
Cathinone itself is rather unstable because there is a primary amine and a ketone in the same molecule .
It will tend to dimerize and become inactive .
In the example of METHYLONE ( as with methcathinone ) the amine is a secondary amine and the compound is quite stable .
But all of the psychoactive amphetamines ( except for MDMA ) are primary amines . - Dr. Shulgin

Explanation : NGC 2818 is a beautiful planetary nebula , the gaseous shroud of a dying sun-like star .
It could well offer a glimpse of the future that awaits our own Sun after spending another 5 billion years or so steadily using up hydrogen at its core , and then finally helium , as fuel for nuclear fusion .
Curiously , NGC 2818 seems to lie within an open star cluster , NGC 2818A , that is some 10,000 light - years distant toward the southern constellation Pyxis ( the Compass ) .
At the distance of the star cluster , the nebula would be about 4 light - years across .
But accurate velocity measurements show that the nebula's own velocity is very different from the cluster 's member stars .
The result is strong evidence that NGC 2818 is only by chance found along the line of sight to the star cluster and so may not share the cluster 's distance or age .
The Hubble image is a composite of exposures through narrow - band filters , presenting emission from nitrogen , hydrogen , and oxygen atoms in the nebula as red , green , and blue hues .

I read in a post by one of the inbound gurus from Hubspot ( cant recall which post ) that hubspot has over time " trained Google " to visit Hubspot very frequently looking for fresh content .
I am assuming everybody here would love to know how this can be done ?
Is creating fresh content almost on a daily basis is the only way ?
Is there anything else you need to do in conjunction with creating new and meaningful content ?

LOS ANGELES  Jay Leno is putting a big dent in the “ checkerboard . ”
With one sweeping shift this week , the ailing NBC network reordered the playing field of prime - time television .
The introduction of a five - night - a- week program starring Mr. Leno , beginning next fall , was a concession that TV norms cannot continue , at least not at fourth - place NBC .
The programming and viewing habits of the last 50 years  exemplified by the checkerboard of competing programs on the broadcast networks  are being replaced by an Internet - influenced time - shifting model of scheduling .
As a result , the very definition of prime time may be changing .
“ We do have to continue to rethink what a broadcast network is , ” Jeffrey Zucker , the chief executive of NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric , said at an industry conference Monday , hours before the news of Mr. Leno ’s new assignment emerged .
He warned that if changes were not undertaken , “ the broadcast networks will end up like the newspaper business or , worse , like the car companies . ”
Maybe Mr. Zucker has seen the future ; after all , his network has lost 50 percent of its 10 p.m. audience in the last three years .
The announcement of Mr. Leno ’s show continues to reverberate on studio lots and executive corridors here , as the Monday - through - Friday “ strip ” is unprecedented in the modern network television era .
NBC framed the decision in terms of competitiveness and cost - effectiveness , because it defuses the risk of Mr. Leno ’s move to another network and saves untold millions of dollars a year .
But it also reflects the increasing irrelevance of the network schedule .
The court heard Frizell and his victim took part in a press-ups contest
A man has been jailed for eight - and - a - half years for the " pointless " knife killing of a father - of - three after a press-ups contest in Aberdeen .
John Frizell , 29 , was involved in " macho banter " and press-ups which turned into a fight with Ian Wilson , 48 , at a flat in Western Road .
Frizell was originally charged with murder but admitted culpable homicide .
Lord Brodie , at the High Court in Edinburgh , said there had been " quite unnecessary aggression " .
The court heard both men took part in a press-ups contest last November , but a confrontation broke out and punches were thrown .
Frizell picked up a knife and stabbed Mr Wilson in the chest .
The victim grabbed a duvet which he held against the wound and an ambulance was called .
However , despite undergoing an emergency operation , he died from the injury which pierced his heart .
' Good - humoured banter '
Frizell had been released from a previous prison sentence about four months earlier .
Defence counsel Mark Stewart QC said Frizell 's history of offending was largely to do with drug use .
He said the former apprentice car mechanic 's life " went off the rails " following a double bereavement in his family .
Mr Stewart said the incident had begun with " good - humoured banter " .
Lord Brodie told Frizell : " I regard this as a pointless killing which involved quite unnecessary aggression using a knife . "
The judge said the killer had " a lengthy and significant criminal record " which included convictions for possessing an offensive weapon and drugs .
Lord Brodie told Frizell he would have jailed him for 11 years for his latest offence , but the sentence would be reduced due to his guilty plea .
Police assault
The senior investigating officer , Det Chf Insp Malcolm Stewart , of Grampian Police , said : " We welcome today 's guilty plea and I am pleased that the diligent , thorough investigation undertaken by our officers and our partner agencies has brought us to this point .
" Thankfully this type of crime is extremely rare in the north east of Scotland .
This investigation sends a very clear signal that Grampian Police are committed to tackling this type of crime and should serve as a stark warning to those who persist in engaging in it .
" The thoughts of my staff and I are with Ian 's family at this difficult time . "
In 2006 , Frizell was jailed for three months for assaulting the then deputy chief constable of Grampian Police , Pat Shearer .
Frizell admitted assaulting Mr Shearer , by slamming a car door on his leg in 2005 .
Al - Shabab is now fighting against an Islamist president US officials say several cases of US citizens of Somali origin returning to their homeland to join the Islamist al - Shabab militia are being investigated .
A Senate committee heard most of the young recruits came from Minneapolis city in the US state of Minnesota .
Al - Shabab leaders have admitted having links to al - Qaeda but the officials said there was no evidence of Somali - Americans planning to attacks the US .
The US state department considers al - Shabab as a terrorist organisation .
The radical Islamist guerrilla group now controls much of southern and central Somalia .
They came for a better life and this really counters their participation in what is the American Dream and what people think of it
Gregory Pirio , author
The group continues to fight even though moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad has been elected president by parliament .
He has said he will introduce Islamic law , or Sharia .
Andrew Liepman , deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center , said : " They are going to Somalia to fight for their homeland , not to join al - Qaeda 's jihad against the United States , so far .
" He told the Senate Homeland Security committee al - Qaeda did not have strong organisational links to al - Shabab , despite the group 's leaders admitting to links .
Somali -American recruits to al - Shabab have included a 27 - year - old college student from Minneapolis who blew himself up in Somalia last October .
FBI national security official Philip Mudd said : " Some get there and become cannon - fodder .
" A lot of them are being put on the front line and some of them , I think , have been killed on the front line , from the United States . "
Up to 200,000 Somali-Americans live in the US and other population centres for the ethnic group include Seattle , San Diego , Atlanta and Columbus .
Analyst Gregory Pirio , who has written a book on Somalia called The African Jihad , told the BBC's Network Africa programme there was " a lot of distress " in Somali - American communities about these recruits .
" People came here [ to America ] in large numbers from Somalia in 1991 when Siad Barre 's government fell and there was no central government in Somalia and they came for opportunity , " he said .
" They came for a better life and this really counters their participation in what is the American Dream and what people think of it . "

I first heard about the mysterious and fanciful Miracle Fruit about ten years ago when I was researching the possibility of becoming an ethnobotanist and exploring the field .
That ethnobotany , the study of the relations between plants and people , could encompass plants from the mundane potato to the obscure and strange , such as the miracle fruit , was a very exciting prospect , and I decided to end my 7 - year stint as a computer - graphics programmer in Silicon Valley to start a Ph.D. in ethnobotany at City University of New York , researching medicinal plants of Peru and Mali .
I had to wait several years before I finally tasted the miracle fruit I had been seeking and feel its strange effects , but when I did , it lived up to its miraculous reputation .
In South Florida taking a botany course to learn about all the wonderful tropical plants I had never known growing up in New York 's urban jungle , I spotted a miracle fruit bush at the must - visit Fruit and Spice Park in Homestead , and plucked a few of the bright - red , grape - sized berries to play with .
Back at home , I spread out all the strange foods I was told to try with miracle fruit : lemons , limes , grapefruit , balsamic vinegar , wine , and tamarind .
I carefully popped a miracle fruit into my mouth and swished the delicate translucent flesh around my mouth , making sure to cover every last part of my tongue .
The fruit had a very mild sour taste a bit like a grape at first , but this taste was subtly changing as it lingered in my mouth in a very interesting way .
But the taste of the miracle fruit itself was not what I was seeking ; it was what happened after I swallowed the fruit and slowly took a taste of the lemon wedge I had prepared .
This lemon I knew was very sour and puckering when I tasted it before , but now it was amazing !
It tasted like the sweetest honey mandarin orange I had ever tasted .
My initial tentative tastes of the lemon turned to excited devouring of the now intoxicatingly sweet transformed fruit .
Once I had polished off the lemon , I turned to the lime , which I normally prefer over lemons , adding intense flavor on top of the lemon 's sourness .
The lime was even more delectable and could be eaten straight in one gulp .
The grapefruit , which is normally one of the few fruits I dislike , now tasted sweet and juicy , as if bathed in honey .
The most acidic of all the fruits I had assembled , the tamarind used for puckering Mexican tamarindo drinks and Southeast Asian curries and chutneys , now tasted like the sweetest tangy raisin .
Moving on from the sour fruits , I then tried the other acidic foods .
The balsamic vinegar had transformed to something akin to port wine or a rich balsamic reduction and the red wine tasted like a sweet , rich dessert wine , without the syrupy texture .
The miracle fruit had truly lived up to its reputation of turning everything sour into something sweet , and many of the other flavors were subsequently enhanced , making me want to taste any other sour food or drink I could find .
The miracle fruit is not some recent genetically engineered creation , but rather a food with a long tradition in tropical West African countries of Ghana , Congo and Cameroon where it is called agbayun in Yoruba and used to sweeten the sour porridge , bread , and palm wine that is the staple there .
Without a taste of the miracle fruit beforehand these fermented foods would be wholly unpalatable .
The fruit ( Synsepalum dulcificum syn Richardella dulcifica in the Chicle or Shea butter family , Sapotaceae ) was found in the 1960s to contain a large glycoprotein as its active component , dubbed miraculin .
How this protein turns sour sweet on the tongue is not completely understood , but it is thought to distort the lock - and - key shape of the sweet receptor in such a way that it then responds to acids instead of saccharides , so any sour acid now sends sweet signals to the brain .
Since the active compound is a protein , it unfortunately cannot be preserved by heat since this would denature the protein , as all cooking does , and destroy its receptor - deforming properties .
Therefore , the fruit can only be used fresh or in a freeze - dried form .
After a few failed attempts , miracle fruit was eventually brought to the states from Africa in 1952 by way of Panama by the famous tropical fruit breeder William Whitman .
A fruit grower in Panama had played a trick on Whitman by telling him the miracle fruit was merely a nondescript African fruit with unremarkable properties , but then gave Whitman a taste of a lime he said he had bred to be incredibly sweet that amazed Whitman .
When the grower revealed that it was the miracle fruit creating the , well , miraculous taste of the lime , Whitman was hooked and brought it back to Florida immediately and luckily planted it in acidic soil where it thrived .
Others had failed by planting it in more common alkali limestone soil .
All humans and birds who came in contact with these introduced miracle fruit bushes loved it and spread it quickly around the tropical parts of Florida , till eventually in the early 1970s it fell into the lap of three men , Lloyd Biedler ( a biophysicist of taste ) , Robert J. Harvey ( a biomedical engineering PhD student ) , and Howard Dennis ( an expert gardener and plant breeder ) , who thought that it would make a great , natural , calorie - free sweetener to replace the then dominant saccharin and emerging aspartame artificial sweeteners .
They started a company called Miralin that almost succeeded in getting FDA approval for using miraculin as a food additive and sweetener , bred a high - miraculin variety of the miracle fruit , and planted large orchards of the fruit in Homestead , Florida .
One problem is that the miraculin cannot be merely mixed with a sour , unsweetened food since the first taste of these will be very sour .
Rather , the miraculin has to be spread around the tongue for thirty to sixty seconds , and then the sour food tastes sweet .
However , Miralin had also succeeded in developing several ingenious food products that worked with the delayed effects of miracle fruit , such as a popsicle with an unsweetened center coated with a layer of the frozen miracle fruit that takes long enough to lick through for it to take effect .
They also created a soda can with a little straw containing the miraculin that would pop out when one opened the soda to be drunk first , turning the sour unsweetened soda inside pleasantly sweet .
The amazing thing is that in the world of sickly sweet and lingering artificial sweeteners , when market tested , people generally preferred the miracle fruit versions of these foods over the true sugar versions , which is unheard of with sugar replacements .
This , along with a popular sugar - replacement product for diabetics , made it seem that Miralin was on track to have a hugely successful product , until the corporate espionage started .
As word started to get out about Miralin 's successes and as they started to push the FDA to get approval for miraculin as a food additive via the Generally Regarded As Safe ( GRAS ) standard where foods that have a history of safe human use can get FDA approval without much testing , sugar companies and artificial sweetener companies , like those of the burgeoning aspartame industry , started to take notice of the threat of Miralin .
Miralin employees started noticing strange cars following them home , people photographing their offices , nasty " anonymous " articles on the safety of their product and company in a newspaper in Jamaica where they had many farms , and a professional break - in to their office where many of their files were stolen .
They could not prove that this corporate espionage was done by the sugar or artificial sweetener industry or that this led to the FDA denying their approval .
However , the FDA denial letter did arrive within a few weeks of these suspicious events and the denial was not based on any scientific evidence of danger but rather on a perplexing concern that , after eating miraculin , children would take a liking to inorganic acids like battery acid .
This completely non-standard procedure from the FDA made it seem like competing sweetener groups had leaned on the FDA to squelch the promising miracle fruit .
This crippling setback sent Miralin spiraling rapidly towards bankruptcy and most of their innovative products and technology were sadly sold off .
The founders all eventually recovered their losses and were successful in other fields , but the US missed out on a simple traditional food that might have significantly helped stave off today 's diabetes and obesity epidemics .
Miracle fruit went underground in the states for about 30 years while it was developed extensively in Japan where one can easily buy freeze - dried miracle fruit tablets and they do not have an apparent scourge of battery - acid - addicted children .
A recent resurgence of interest in the US has enabled one to buy fresh fruit from Curtis Mozie farms in Ft. Lauderdale , FL and freeze - dried powder from Bioresources International in New Jersey , a company that imports many African medicinal plants .
Due to this renewed interest and a recent press , many people have asked me to throw miracle - fruit tasting parties , something I gladly do since seeing people 's eyes light up with delight the first time they taste a candy - sweet lemon is so gratifying .
Little did I know when I started my new career in ethnobotany that this traditional African food would lead me through an international business , corporate espionage , biochemistry , and modern food fads , but it has been a constantly edifying journey .
I suggest everyone get their hands on some miracle fruit , have their taste buds turned inside out , and taste a little of what ethnobotany has to offer .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s central bank on Saturday said U.S. accusations that it was manipulating the yuan currency were misleading , a day after Beijing cautioned incoming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to handle their ties with care .

The remarks from Su Ning , a vice governor of the People ’s Bank of China , were the bank ’s first public reaction to comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary - designate Timothy Geithner , who said this week that Beijing was manipulating its currency exchange policies to gain an unfair trade advantage .
“ These comments are not only out of keeping with the facts , even more so they are misleading in analyzing the causes of the financial crisis , ” Su said of Geithner ’s comments to the Senate Finance Committee , according to the official Xinhua news agency .
The exchange marks a testy start to ties between Beijing and the Obama administration , which may tarnish vows of cooperation in combating the global economic slowdown and security threats .
“ China wants a good start with Obama , but trade conflicts are the one issue most likely to hurt this , ” said Shi Yinhong , an expert on ties between the two nations at Renmin University in Beijing .
“ Now our diplomacy is conditioned by the financial crisis . ”
China worries that its already slowing exports will be even harder hit by U.S. policies to narrow their trade imbalance .
Many U.S. lawmakers believe the yuan is much undervalued , giving Chinese exporters a big advantage that they blame for U.S. job losses and the U.S. trade deficit , which hit a record $ 256.3 billion in 2007 .
Su did not directly accuse Geithner of trade protectionism .
But the Chinese official ’s warning was clear enough .
“ We believe that faced with the financial crisis there should be a spirit of self - criticism , ” Su said while visiting a business newspaper ’s office in Beijing , according to Xinhua .
“ The international community is currently working together in actively responding to the financial crisis , and it must avoid exploiting different excuses for renewing or encouraging trade protectionism , because these are of no help in withstanding the financial crisis . ”
Su ’s swipe came after China ’s Foreign Minister urged Clinton to be careful with sensitive issues that could strain ties , calling the relationship between their two nations one of the world ’s most important .
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi made the remarks to Clinton , settling into her new job as Washington ’s top diplomat , in a telephone call on Friday , the Chinese Foreign Ministry website ( www.fmprc.gov.cn) reported on Saturday .
“ The China - U.S. relationship is one of the world ’s most important bilateral relations , ” Yang told Clinton , according to the report .
Each side should “ respect and show consideration for the other ’s core interests and appropriately handle differences and sensitive issues , ” he said .
The report did not specify those issues , but Beijing considers Taiwan its most sensitive topic in dealings with Washington .
Beijing says self - ruled Taiwan must accept eventual reunification with the mainland and objects to Washington ’s military aid to and political support for the island .
China has also been angered by U.S. pressure over human rights and Tibet .
Yang , a former ambassador to Washington , said the two powers should “ handle bilateral relations by adhering to a strategic high - point and a long - term perspective . ”
TRADE DISPUTES
But trade and the yuan are already emerging as a points of tension .
Under former President George W. Bush , the Treasury Department urged Beijing to move to a market - determined exchange rate and saw some progress since July 2005 .
Yet it refused to formally call China a currency manipulator , which under U.S. law would require the Treasury Department to begin “ expedited ” negotiations with Beijing to reduce China ’s trade surplus and eliminate any “ unfair ” currency advantage .
The China Daily , an English - language paper that often reflects official policy , said Geithner ’s position was “ a clear move away from the stance of the Bush administration . ”
The dollar has weakened by about 16 percent against the yuan since China revalued it in mid-2005 , according to Reuters data .
But many U.S. industry groups want much more drastic action .
The yuan closed lower against the dollar on Friday and traded mostly below the Chinese central bank ’s mid-point , with speculation that Geithner ’s comments could spark a brief period of modest yuan depreciation .
HM Fowzie , the country 's oil minister described how the explosion left him covered in blood and flesh and surrounded by the bodies of the dead .
" A suicide bomber tried to kill us , but we escaped , " he said

Using Prolog in Windows NT Network Configuration
David Hovel
Microsoft Research
Microsoft Corporation
Abstract Microsoft's Windows NT operating system uses an embedded Prolog interpreter to configure its local and wide - area network systems .
Interdependent software and hardware components are abstracted into a simplified object - oriented framework using declarative information provided by each component 's installation script .
This information , along with the Prolog algorithm , is consulted into the embedded interpreter , which is then queried to construct the most usable configuration .
The algorithm which solves the plumbing problem is described , including its positive and negative constraints , Prolog database and efficiency considerations .
The results of the query , stored into NT 's configuration database , inform each component of its load order and binding targets .
A description of theC++ wrapper class is given and portation considerations are discussed .
The Small Prolog interpreter is briefly described .
1. Overview
1.1 Windows NT
Windows NT was built from the start as a highly extensible platform for both client and server networking .
Fully two years before its initial release , developers at Microsoft were developing NT on NT systems which supported multiple network cards and protocol stacks .
1.2 Problems in Network Configuration
Historically , networking systems have commonly suffered from three wide - spread problems .
First , there was no system - pervasive configuration managementsoftware which could be used as a foundation .
In MS - DOS , for example , every installer was required to have its own parsers for CONFIG .
SYS and AUTOEXEC .
BAT .
This often meant that trivial formatting changes or unusual data could cause product installations to fail in catastrophic ways .
Even simple changes in the order of component installation could result in situations which the vendors software was not designed to handle .
Second , there was no standard repository for network configuration information .
Even experienced systems administrators were often uncertain as to which text files were required by the network and which components utilized them .
Third , the network components themselves were interconnected through proprietary software interfaces .
Hence , components built by separate vendors could not generally be connected or bound even if their roles in the network software ensemble were inherently compatible .
1.3 Configuring Networks on Windows NT
1.3.1 Network Enhancements in Windows NT
NT mandates use of the Network Driver Interface Specification ( NDIS ) , and the Transport Driver Interface ( TDI ) which together provide standardized network component behavior .
Most drivers are reentrant .
All configuration information is stored in a common configuration database with data types .
All drivers are dynamically demand - loaded .
All driver interconnections and configuration parameters are based upon explicit textual information in the configuration database .
Driver load ordering and grouping is governed by explicit information in the configuration database .
The NT operating system in its entirety is functioning during installation , configuration and networking initiation , as opposed to a reduced boot - time load system of limited capability .
By comparison with other networking platforms , NT presents a highly normalized and well - behaved interface centered around its configuration database called the Registry .
Given a correct Registry , the system runs correctly .
1.3.2 The Centralized Approach
In this architecture , the user would have the opportunity to rescind decisions made by the network configuration software , but neither the user nor vendor software could coerce the system into invalid configurations .
1.3.3 The Goals of Network Configuration
Support a diverse and rapidly evolving ensemble of software and hardware components .
Strive for a no-questions - asked network installation process .
Offload configuration intelligence from individual components to the generalized configuration software .
To achieve a high degree of user acceptance , the planned implementation approach was all - encompassing .
In one pass , the network configuration software would be required to :
Detect a network card .
Install all the necessary software components .
Allow the user to install additional hardware and software components .
Create all the network configuration information .
Load and start the network .
Use the new systems network capabilities to allow the user to join an NT security domain .
Equally importantly , the system was supposed to do as little interaction with the user as possible .
To the best of my knowledge , no previous networking system has ever been installed in this fashion before .
2. Plumbing the Network Lattice
2.1 The Network Lattice
Figure 1 : An Example Network Lattice
The lattice is considered to be oriented from the user downwards ; the uppermost nodes are the originators of network traffic and the lowest nodes are those connecting directly to the hardware .
2.2 Plumbing and the NT Namespace
In Windows NT , as in the members of the Unixi family , the concept of a file has been extended to include any data source or sink .
As in Unix , NT maintains names for all such files in a global namespace organized as a tree , and they are accessed using the system openfunction in the same manner as disk files .
Therefore , each ordered pair previously mentioned is really a triple : the final element is the name of the file or port to be created and opened .
This triple constitutes an instruction to the higher component to open a connection to the lower component using the given name , as well as an instruction to the lower component to provide an access port of the name required .
2.3 Load Ordering and Grouping
The solution to the plumbing problem is used to determine the loading sequence of the network modules .
If component A must open a file or port created by component B , then B must complete its loading and initialization operations before A is loaded .
2.4 Decorating the Paths Through the Lattice
In this context , a path is defined as a complete routing from an initiating component downward through the lattice to a network adapter card or other end - point .
Product loading requirements and ordering are determined by the topological relationships inherent in the complete set of all constructed paths .
2.5 Object - Oriented Configuration Design
In systems employing several protocol stacks , network cards and serial ports , components of a similar type are treated virtually identically .
While the exact details of their addressing might vary , their participation in the network lattice is determined solely by the component type .
Elements of object - oriented design were adopted to exploit this type - versus - instance analogy .
In this scheme , there is a global space of named interface classes .
A class may be basic ( that is , have no parent class ) , or it may inherit from one or more parent classes .
A component type is defined by the class names describing its upper and lower boundaries .
In addition , a class may be marked as a logical end - point , which means it acts as a terminal point for interconnections in the lattice .
A network adapter card is always considered a logical end - point .
Instances of classes can be bound to one another in the sense that an interconnection can legitimately be made between them .
There is a close analogy between this approach and class compatibility in common object - oriented programming languages .
For example , if two classes aClass and bClass are declared in Prolog as bindable ( aClass , bClass ) , then instances of aClass can be bound to instances of bClass , but not the reverse .
In addition , instances of their subclasses can also be bound together , but not instances of their superclasses .
In the case of multiple inheritance , instances of such classes inherit the bindablity of every superclass .
2.6 Object Model
In the configuration model , each network component is abstracted as a black box with an upper and a lower boundary or interface .
Most types of objects have the same class interface at both boundaries .
However , there are occasions on which it is necessary to consider the upper and lower layers of an object as having distinct properties .
Figure 2 : Basic Component Object Model
The definition of a network component type , then , requires the declaration of the interface classes to which its upper and lower layers belong .
It is important to remember that these semantic or behavioral interface classes are defined on top of the NDIS and TDI syntactic or general interface standards .
2.7 Overview of the Algorithm
The set of all interface class declarations .
The set of all component type declarations .
The set of all components which are actively present .
Rules governing interface binding .
Rules governing symbolic device name construction .
Given these rules , all dataflow paths can be determined , and the lattice can be constructed and decorated .
3.Choosing Prolog
3.1 Viewing the Problem as Declarative
3.2 Experience with Small Prolog
Another issue clearly in its favor is that the interpreteruses a simplified syntax similar to that of LISP ; this format made SProlog clauses very easy to generate and process using recursive descent .
3.3 Prototyping
During the course of the project there were several occasions when the Prolog algorithm had to be enhanced .
On each of these occasions , changes were developed and tested in console mode ; when completed , the network configuration dynamic - link library was simply relinked with an updated Prolog text program .
This ability to perform continual prototyping within a stable application was greatly beneficial .
3.4 Search Space Management
3.5 Introduction to SProlog
3.5.1 Origin
3.5.2 Syntax
/* membership in a list */
( ( member X ( X|Y ) )
)
( ( member X ( A|B ) )
( member X B )
)
3.5.3 Advantages
3.5.3.1 Size and Portability
Since M. de Feraudy had already considered some of the issues involved in embedding the interpreter , the outer query loop was structured so that it could be readily replaced .
3.5.3.2 Memory Usage
3.5.3.3 List and String Handling
3.5.4 Limitations
The absence of garbage collection was not a primary concern since the lattice generation algorithm ran only once during network reconfiguration .
Being a virtual memory operating system , NT had no problems supporting the full contingent of memory required for the worst - case scenarios .
Similarly , the absence of tail recursion elimination , while a minor performance consideration , did not affect run-time memory use or performance significantly .
4. The Lattice Generation Algorithm
4.1 Background
4.1.1 The Configuration Registry
4.1.2 Network Configuration Information
device - specific information ; that is , information which is particular to the driver or software component in question ;
declarative information used to support network lattice construction .
The latter type of information governs the behavior of the lattice construction algorithm .
As will be explained later , much of it is converted to SProlog declarative facts or base clauses .
4.1.3 Steps in the Installation Process
Detect or choose a network card and run its installation script .
Run the installation scripts for the default software components
Allow the user to pick additional products to install ( scripts to run )
Gather the network - related Registry information and convert it to SProlog format .
Run the binding algorithm to generate a correct lattice .
Convert the query results to Registry format .
Update the Registry to reflect the new lattice .
Allow the user to rescind any bindings which are inappropriate or unnecessary .
Perform a topological sort based upon the revised ( active ) lattice and update the Registry with the load order information .
Start the network by loading the network redirector .
The steps 4 , 5 and 6 above are those which involve the embedded Prolog engine and its interfaces .
Given a correct lattice and software loading order , the last step suffices to cause the entire network ensemble to be loaded and initiated correctly .
4.2 Basic Algorithm
The algorithm then backtracks across every possible pair of device interfaces and determines if they are bindable .
Those which succeed are asserted as facts into the interpreters database .
The discovered set of possible bindings is then examined , and any bindings which violate constraints are retracted .
( See the appendix Basic Binding Backtrack Algorithmfor more information . )
Finally , the set is converted into usable binding information ; that is , the actual device names to be used in the NT namespace are constructed and topological information about the exact path through the network lattice is generated .
( Note :
The full details of the generation of binding names is beyond the scope of this document . )
4.3 Constraints
Any potential path in the lattice which does not reach a network adapter card or a logical end - point is discarded as moot .
Bindings can be declared as exclusive , or restricted to a single instance .
This can be applied to either the source or sink end of a binding or both .
or restricted to a single instance .
This can be applied to either the source or sink end of a binding or both .
If multiple conflicting binding rules apply , a simple priority scheme is used to resolve contention .
Another more general negative binding constraint can be specified that prevents any two device classes from appearing anywhere along a binding path in the lattice , regardless of the degree of separation .
Binding information which is found to violate a constraint or which loses a contention resolution arbitration is retracted .
4.4 Binding Names and Paths
Along with these names , the exact path of each binding down through the network lattice is preserved in a list of component tokens stored with each individual binding fact .
This information is used by the calling program to perform a topological sort as part of the process of generating the correct network component loading sequence .
4.5 Converted Fact Predicates
4.5.1 devClass/3
This fact declares that a class exists , and declares its parent class or uses the token basic to indicate that it has no parent .
A final token of yes or no indicates whether the class is a logical end - point or terminus for the binding search .
Multiple devClass facts are used to indicate multiple inheritance ..
4.5.2 devType/4
This fact declares that a product type exists , but may not necessarily be present or active .
Each boundary ( upper and lower ) of the product can be declared to be of a different class .
The Registry fact conversion software defaults both boundaries to be the same if only one is specified .
4.5.3 present /
4
This fact declares that an instance of a product type exists and tells where it is located in the Registry .
4.5.4 bindable /
5
This fact declares that instances of fromClass can bind to instances of toClass .
The Boolean exclusive tokens are used to indicate whether the upper or lower layer can only be bound multiply or only once .
The bindValue token is a number from 0 to 100 .
Multiple applicable binding rules are resolved as follows .
The rule with the highest binding value is used in preference to all others .
Then , the rule closest to the binder 's true class is used in preference to rules based on parent classes .
Finally , multiple specific rules are order - dependent ; the first found is the one used .
4.5.5 devBind/
5
This fact is used to control the generation of names in the NT namespace .
The arguments indicate the following :
objectName :
This is a string value used as the basis for names generated for this product ( contrasted to the tokenized name used inside the interpreter ) .
getsBindings :
This Boolean value determines whether or not a product 's Registry area is actually updated with binding information .
appearsInBindings :
This Boolean value determines whether or not a product 's name is inserted into the generated name .
Some layers of a protocol ensemble can be " invisible " .
namingMethod :
The NT driver architecture allows drivers to create containers ( or directories ) in the NT name space ; if a driver supports this , backslashes are used to separate product level names ; otherwise , they are simply concatenated using underscores to create unique names .
4.5.6 block /
2
This fact indicates a constraint which prevents any path from being created which connects , however distantly , an instance of fromClass to an instance of toClass .
Normal rules of inheritance apply .
Note that this is an ordered pair and therefore would not in and of itself prevent a binding in the opposite direction .
4.6 Using the Facts : A Simple Binding Example
Figure 3 : Binding Two Components
The arc connecting redir to proto1 would be instantiated by the binding algorithm because backtracking across all possible component pairs would present the list [ redir proto1 ] , and backtracking across all bindable facts would yield the rule which directly permitted binding between the lower interface of redir and the upper interface of proto1 .

The Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , has consistently ignored advice from a host of technical experts saying the filters would slow the internet , block legitimate sites , be easily bypassed and fall short of capturing all of the nasty content available online .
Despite this , he is pushing ahead with trials of the scheme using six ISPs - Primus , Tech 2U , Webshield , OMNIconnect , Netforce and Highway 1 .
But even the trials have been heavily discredited , with experts saying the lack of involvement from the three largest ISPs , Telstra , Optus and iiNet , means the trials will not provide much useful data on the effects of internet filtering in the real - world .
Senator Conroy originally pitched the filters as a way to block child porn but - as ISPs , technical experts and many web users feared - the targets have been broadened significantly since then .
ACMA 's secret blacklist , which will form the basis of the mandatory censorship regime , contains 1370 sites , only 674 of which relate to depictions of children under 18 .
A significant portion - 506 sites - would be classified R18 + and X18 + , which is legal to view but would be blocked for everyone under the proposal .
This week Senator Conroy said there was " a very strong case for blocking " other legal content that has been " refused classification " .
According to the classification code , this includes sites depicting drug use , crime , sex , cruelty , violence or " revolting and abhorrent phenomena " that " offend against the standards of morality " .
And last month , ACMA added an anti-abortion website to its blacklist because it showed photographs of what appears to be aborted foetuses .
The Government has said it was considering expanding the blacklist to 10,000 sites and beyond .
Xenophon said instead of implementing a blanket mandatory censorship regime the Government should instead put the money towards educating parents on how to supervise their kids online and tackling " pedophiles through cracking open those peer - to - peer groups " .
Technical experts have said the filters proposed by the Government would do nothing to block child porn being transferred on encrypted peer - to - peer networks .
" I 'm very skeptical that the Government is going down the best path on this , " said Xenophon .
" I commend their intentions but I think the implementation of this could almost be counter - productive and I think the money could be better spent . "
The policy has attracted opposition from online consumers , lobby groups , ISPs , network administrators , some children 's welfare groups , the Opposition , the Greens , NSW Young Labor and even the conservative Liberal senator Cory Bernardi , who famously tried to censor the chef Gordon Ramsay 's swearing on television .
This week , a national telephone poll of 1100 people , conducted by Galaxy and commissioned by online activist group GetUp , found that only 5 per cent of Australians want ISPs to be responsible for protecting children online and only 4 per cent want Government to have this responsibility .
A recent survey by Netspace of 10,000 of the ISP 's customers found 61 per cent strongly opposed mandatory internet filtering with only 6.3 per cent strongly agreeing with the policy .
An expert report , handed to the Government last February but kept secret until December after it was uncovered by the Herald , concluded the proposed scheme was fundamentally flawed .
Even Labor has previously opposed ISP - level internet filtering when the Howard Government raised it as a method for protecting kids online .
" Unfortunately , such a short memory regarding the debate in 1999 about internet content has led the coalition to already offer support for greater censorship by actively considering proposals for unworkable , quick fixes that involve filtering the internet at the ISP level , " Labor Senator Kate Lundy said in 2003 .
An international team of scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research ( IZW ) in Berlin , Germany , and the University of Sheffield , UK , now answered the question how social status is inherited in one of the most social of all mammals , the spotted hyena .
In a study published online recently in the scientific journal Behavioral Ecology , the scientists used observations during the last 20 years of rare cases of adoption among hyenas in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania in combination with the latest molecular techniques to identify genetic mothers to demonstrate that hyena mothers pass on their social status by supporting their young during social interactions with other group members .
In human society and many animal societies , social status is crucial – it determines access to resources , survival and reproductive success .
“ In highly developed mammalian societies such as spotted hyenas , social status is even more important to survival and reproductive success than environmental factors , predators or pathogens ” says Prof Heribert Hofer from the IZW .
As a result , parents may attempt to pass on their status to their offspring .
Such ‘ rank inheritance ’ has been observed in a number of mammalian species , including many primates and the spotted hyena .
“ In spotted hyenas , surrogate mothers adopt young cubs soon after their birth .
The adopted cubs obtained a rank at adulthood that was similar to and just below the rank of their surrogate mother .
In contrast , the rank of adopted offspring was unrelated to the rank of their genetic mother ” says Dr Marion East from the IZW .
“ This is consistent with the idea that maternal behavioural support determines rank inheritance . ”
The results of the study are inconsistent with the two alternative hypotheses to explain rank inheritance in social mammals : ( i ) mothers might transfer genes that cause their offspring to be as competitive as themselves ; or ( ii ) maternal status might determine the concentration of maternal androgens ( testosterone ) that a fetus is exposed to , and this exposure in turn might make offspring become as competitive as their mother .
“ These hypotheses would predict a relationship between the rank of adopted offspring and that of their genetic mother , but we found no evidence of such a relationship ” explains Dr Oliver Höner from the IZW .
The study demonstrates that in spotted hyenas , the young ‘ learn ’ during adolescence which group members they can dominate when their mother helps them win contests against group members that are subordinate to the mother .
When they become adult , they defend this position and benefit from the ‘ silver - spoon effect ’ – because social dominance provides fitness benefits in spotted hyenas , they obtain the benefits associated with this position .
Civil libertarians , including prominent conservatives like Rep. Ron Paul and former Rep. Bob Barr , have made loud objections to the U.S. government ’s efforts to counteract terrorism in the wake of 9 - 11 .
In particular , they have protested the detainment and interrogation methods used on suspected terrorists at Gitmo , wiretapping , and other methods of surveillance .
They do n’t represent the majority of Americans , many who privately say anyone involved with terrorism should be executed .
They do n’t dare say this publicly since the law has evolved over time to provide those accused of crimes certain privileges , labeling them “ rights . ”
While some of these “ rights ” make sense in order to prevent the government from falsely imprisoning innocent people , at some point there is a line where these specified additional “ rights ” for suspected terrorists begin to infringe upon the rights of innocent Americans .
How these terrorists ’ “ rights ” have been created and defined has mostly been decided in the U.S. courts by judges , not by Congress , by overturning legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President .
Considering the judiciary is controlled by the left , and considering our Founding Fathers as a representative body wrote the Constitution establishing our rights , it is disturbing that a few lone judges are now deciding what our rights – and the “ rights ” of terrorists - are .
Since the 1960 ’s , liberal activist judges have created so many new “ rights ” for criminals that it has become very difficult to get information out of accused terrorists or detain them for very long .
It ’s a vicious cycle – law enforcement is no longer permitted to get information from suspected terrorists unless they coddle them , read them their right to remain silent , and supply them with a U.S. taxpayer - funded attorney to represent them , etc .
Without the ability to obtain any information from them , it becomes difficult to justify detaining them without violating their ( new ) “ rights . ”
So even though we all know the Guantanamo detainees have been aiding and abetting terrorists whose sole goal in life is to kill U.S. citizens , we pretend that the U.S. Constitution includes all these additional “ rights ” for terrorists and their aiders and abettors , ultimately enabling them to continue their attacks upon U.S. citizens .
Many of the anti-terrorism methods being attacked by civil libertarians involve new methods and areas of communication never addressed nor contemplated by the Constitution or Congress .
Claims that our freedoms are gradually being eroded by the government ’s attempts to deal with terrorism are inaccurate since these new areas had never been established as constitutional rights for those accused of terrorist activity .
Cell phones have only come into existence in recent years .
Torture has only become broadly defined in recent years , so attempting to claim that certain interrogation measures are “ unconstitutional ” is nothing more than another attempt to broaden what defines “ torture . ”
Congress has passed laws attempting to reconcile changing technologies with the Fourth Amendment ’s vague general protection against “ unreasonable ” searches and seizures – emphasis on unreasonable .
Left - leaning civil liberties activists seem to forget the word “ unreasonable ” in their efforts to apply the Fourth Amendment to new Congressional law in these areas .
In the legal arena generally , there are myriads of exceptions to judicially - carved out Fourth Amendment rights .
For example , there is no absolute right to be free of wiretapping regardless of who you are , there is always some way to get an emergency order authorizing one .
Civil liberties activists contend that the government will abuse its power through surveillance programs , and so they demand that any surveillance authorized have a proven link between the suspect being monitored and terrorist activity or organizations .
While this sounds good in theory , it does not take into account the fact that terrorists deliberately try to avoid scrutiny by disguising overt connections through the use of third parties and misleading names .
Another criticism of left wing civil liberties activists is that the surveillance is authorized to search communications within the U.S. , not just overseas .
Again , this does n’t take into account reality , which is that many terrorists are now operating within the U.S. as sleeper cells , and others have friendly enablers in the U.S. helping them coordinate their attacks .
All of the 9 - 11 hijackers were in the U.S .
A better approach would be give the laws on terrorism as drafted by Congress a chance , and then if an abuse does occur , where the government spies on someone with no connections to terrorism , revisit the law and determine what changes should be made to prevent those abuses .
There will always be areas where the government can overreach , we can never get rid of the possibility of human error in any area ever .
It ’s simply not possible to eliminate this variable .
So to proactively restrict the government ’s power in this arena beyond current limitations would seriously cripple the ability of the government to protect us from terrorists .
As long as the U.S. is the freest democracy in the world , there is little chance that our government is going to turn against its citizens and spy on them .
As long as we have free elections and are electing free market , pro-democracy leaders , these kinds of abuses are unlikely and would be an exception should they occur .
When critics say that terrorist prevention “ weakens our civil liberties , ” what do they mean ?
It means in that person ’s opinion , any laws being drafted to address the new technologies and methods involved in terrorism should allow the government very little latitude to stop terrorism , and an activist court needs to declare in an official sounding manner using plenty of legalese that there is a correlation between greatly restricting government ’s ability to stop terrorism and the vague phrases “ protecting your constitutional rights ” and “ civil liberties . ”
It is good that we have watchdog groups looking out for our rights and liberties .
But their interest in determining what constitutes “ rights ” needs to be balanced against the interests of Americans who are entitled to life , liberty and happiness as provided by the Declaration of Independence .
Failing to take precautions to prevent another 9 - 11 due to politically correct notions about terrorists ’ “ rights ” tramples on the rights of innocent Americans .
Here we go again .
Rush Limbaugh is public enemy No. 1 .
Liberal bloggers and media chin-strokers are aghast at Limbaugh ’s statement that he hopes Barack Obama fails .
Well , given what Obama wants to do , I hope he fails too .
Of course I want the financial crisis to end -- who does n’t ?
But Obama ’s agenda is much more audacious .
Pretty much every major news outlet in the country has said as a matter of objective analysis that Obama wants to repeal the legacy of Ronald Reagan and remake the country as a European welfare state .
And yet people are shocked that conservatives , Limbaugh included , want Obama to fail in this effort ?
What movie have they been watching ?
Because I could swear that conservatives opposing the expansion of big government is what conservatives do .
It ’s Aesopian .
The scorpion must sting the frog .
The conservative must object to socialized medicine .

Besides , since when did hoping for the failure of ideological agendas you disagree with become unpatriotic ?
Liberals were hardly treasonous when they hoped for the failure of George W. Bush ’s Social Security privatization scheme .
Regardless , the war on Limbaugh from the left is a tired rehash .
In 1995 , Bill Clinton tried to blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Rush .
In 2002 , then - Sen .
Tom Daschle , the leader of the Democratic opposition , claimed that Limbaugh ’s listeners were n’t “ satisfied just to listen . ”
They were a violent threat to decent public servants like him .
In just the last month , Obama suggested that Republicans were in thrall to Rush .
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has anointed him the GOP ’s leader .
Rep. Barney Frank complained that Republicans did n’t give Obama enough standing ovations during his address to Congress because they are afraid of Limbaugh and Sean Hannity .
Does anyone think that Republicans , absent fear of Limbaugh ’s lash , would be throwing flower petals at Obama ’s feet as he sells the Great Society II ?
If that ’s true , I say thank goodness for Limbaugh ’s lash .

Just because the Democrats ’ shtick is old and often dishonest does n’t mean it ’s tactically dumb .
Limbaugh and other right - wing talkers are popular with a third of the country .
Fairly or not , they turn off moderates and self - described independents ( and , for the left , conservative talk radio is the font of all evil ) .
Most politicians would prefer to have 70 % of the public on their side at the cost of losing 30 % , even if that requires being less than fair to the 30 % .
The more interesting war on Limbaugh comes from the right .
My National Review colleague John Derbyshire has written a thoughtful article for the American Conservative disparaging the “ lowbrow conservatism ” of talk radio .
His brush is a bit too broad at times .
Some right - wing talkers , such as Bill Bennett and Dennis Prager , can be almost professorial .
Michael Savage , meanwhile , sounds like the orderlies are about to break through the barricades with straitjacket in hand .
Derbyshire is nonetheless right that conservatism is top - heavy with talk - radio talent , giving the impression the right is deficient in other areas and adding to the shrillness of public discourse .
Another point of attack comes from “ reformist ” conservative writers , such as blogger Ross Douthat of the Atlantic and former Bush speechwriter David Frum .
They argue that conservatism is too attached to talk - show platitudes and Reagan kitsch .
They want conservatives and Republicans to become more entrepreneurial , less reflexively opposed to government action .
Hence , the New Reformers object to Limbaugh ’s role as an enforcer of ideological conformity .
What ’s good for Limbaugh , many of them argue , guarantees that the GOP will become a powerless rump party only for conservative true believers .
I ’m dubious about that , but I do have a suggestion that would help on both fronts .
Bring back “ Firing Line . ” William F. Buckley Jr. , who died almost exactly a year ago , hosted the program for PBS for 33 years .
He performed an incalculable service at a time when conservatives were more associated with yahoos than they are today .
He demonstrated that intellectual fluency and good manners were n’t uniquely liberal qualities .
More important , the “ Firing Line ” debates ( models of decorum ) demonstrated that conservatives were unafraid to examine their own assumptions or to battle liberal ones .

As Democrats try to ram through the “ remaking of America ” ( Obama ’s words ) by exploiting a financial crisis , we need those debates .
PBS could actually live up to its mandate to educate and inform the public .
It would be the kind of entrepreneurial government innovation even right - wingers could get behind .

U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service
President Obama today asked federal agencies to consult with wildlife biologists over decisions that may affect threatened or endangered species .
The memorandum effectively suspends a December 2008 rule issued by the Bush administration , which waived requirements that agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers consult with experts at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service when undertaking projects like building dams .
Today ’s decision did not throw out the Bush administration rule , which had prompted lawsuits from California and a number of environmental groups .
Instead , Mr. Obama asked that the secretaries of commerce and the interior “ review ” the Bush regulation and determine whether new rules are needed .
“ Until such a review is completed , ” Mr. Obama wrote , “ I request the heads of all agencies to exercise their discretion , under the new regulation , to follow the prior longstanding consultation and concurrence practices ” involving the Fish and Wildlife Services and the National Marine Fisheries Service .
The Sierra Club reacted with unmitigated joy .
“ These midnight regulations represented all the disdain for science and political trumping of expertise that characterized the Bush administration ’s efforts to dismantle fundamental environmental laws , ” said Carl Pope , the Club ’s executive director , in a statement .
“ Our wildlife are clearly in much better hands now , ” he continued .
“ President Obama is bringing science back into decision - making . ”
Have you ever woke up in the morning and said to yourself , “ today is the day that I 'm finally going to backup my workstation ! ” only to find out that you 're a day late and about 320 Gb short ?
Well , that 's about what happened to me recently , but do n't worry , the story has a happy ending .
I 'm getting ahead of myself though .
Most people 's excuse for not performing routine maintenance or regular backups is that they just do n't have time .
So when I discovered that I had some down time , I decided to take to take care of a few issues on my workstation .
I performed a system update .
Since I leave my system on all the time , I decided to upgrade the kernel and try to get software suspend working so I could cut down on energy consumption and heat production in my office .
Finally , I resolved to finish backing up my home directory .
The system update went without incident and the kernel compiled and installed without error .
The next step was to reboot into the new kernel .
When the kernel panic 'ed , I figured that I had missed something in the kernel configuration , so I rebooted back to my older kernel , which also panic'ed .
Since this system had been running not 15 minutes ago , I knew things were about to get ugly .
At this point , I remembered that I had been doing some testing with an Ubuntu live CD , so I booted the live CD .
At least now , I could get some work done , even though my workstation was “ toes up . ”
This would also give me a platform from which to work on my regular hard drive , or so I thought .
When I attempted to mount / dev/sda3 , I was told that it did n't exist .
Fdisk told me that my partition table was mostly gone !
All that was left was / dev/sda1 , where I keep my kernel , and / dev/sda2 , which is where I swap .
I posted a message describing my situation to the Gentoo user 's group and was told that I should look into a program called testdisk .
I figured that I should at least assess / dev/sda1 , so I tried to mount it .
No such luck .
The filesystem was n't recognized .
A quick look at / proc / filesystems told me that Ubuntu had n't loaded ext2 support into the kernel .
Further investigation revealed that Ubuntu loaded all of it's drivers from an initial ram disk and they were n't immediately available in / lib / modules .
I could n't bring myself to dissect an initial ram disk image on a system that was RUNNING on a ram disk , so out came the Gentoo installation CD .
It was while watching the Gentoo CD boot , that I saw the IDE disk seek error messages for the first time .
I do n't reboot my system very often and the Ubuntu live CD hides those messages from you , so who knows how long I 'd been working with a drive that needed to be replaced ?
Once the Gentoo CD had booted , it was time to try to recover my system .
I discovered that testdisk was n't installed on the CD , so I had to wget and untar it first .
Oddly enough , I had to run testdisk and reboot a couple times before I had a partition table that looked sane .
When I tried to mount the filesystem , I was told that mount could n't find a valid filesystem .
As a list ditch effort , I decided to try to fsck the filesystem anyway .
The fsck program reported that it could n't find a superblock , but this was the first good news I had received so far ; I knew I could use the - b parameter and ask fsck to use a backup superblock .
At least fsck had n't choked completely .
So , I issued a command like fsck -y -t ext2 - b 8192 / dev/sda3 to see what would happen .
When fsck started to spew error messages indicating fix - ups it was performing , I decided that the process would take a while and went to be for the night .
When I woke up , I found that fsck had finished so I mounted the resulting filesystem .
I was really hoping to see all of my files intact , but no , all I saw was / lost + found .
When I cd'ed into the lost + found directory , I got my first glimpse of just how bad things had been .
The fsck program had done it's job and recovered my filesystem , but it was unable to recover any of the file names at the root of the partition , so it moved the files to the lost + found directory and renamed each file after it 's I - node number .
All I had was a list of files and directories with names resembling # 19539303 .
And the directory list was several screens in length ; I usually keep a pretty clean / directory , so obviously , fsck had encountered a lot of trouble .
One of these oddly - named directories was my / home directory .
I made an educated guess as to which one that was and sure enough , I had user directories .
( My /home directory was the one reported with the largest file size . )
Deeper inspection revealed that most of my files seemed to be there , and they were properly named !
I was in business !
When my new disk arrived , I installed it and started copying my old files onto the new drive .
I was immediately struck by how slow this process was going .
It was as if I were transferring the files over a dial - up modem !
It did n't help that the IDE subsystem had reset a few times in the process .
At this rate the new drive would be out of warranty by the time my file recovery was complete , so I had to do something .
It turns out that I had accumulated a lot of files in my home directory that I really did n't need .
I had downloaded games and other software and simply built them in my home directory rather than installed them on the system .
After I had pruned out all of the files and directories that I did n't care about , I was able to recover the rest of my / home directory .
So there you have it .
When I started , I had a dead machine , a failing hard drive , a corrupt partition table , and a corrupt filesystem .
When I had finished , I had at least recovered the important files from the system and had been able to carry on my day - to - day work without too much interruption , thanks to the Live CD .
But there are some lessons to be learned here , which is why I chose to write about my experience .
I should have backed up yesterday .
But for the record , my business files were on my server and I have redundant , off - site backups of them .
I was mostly interested in recovering my password wallet , a few pictures and videos that I 'd saved , and a few miscellaneous documents .
OK , lesson learned .
But there 's more .
I was grateful to be able to keep running using a Live CD .
However , I 'm a KDE user and the Ubuntu CD that I had was Gnome - based .
I got my work done , but it would have been nice to be in an environment that I was accustomed to using .
In the future , I 'll be keeping a Knoppix or Kubuntu CD handy .
I also found that my Gentoo CD just was n't up to the task of system recovery .
I 'll be burning a genuine recovery disk , as soon as I have a system on which to burn CD's .
I really needed to have a set of emergency CD 's handy for this situation .
I could see having a CD wallet that had a Live CD , a Recovery CD , and an Installation CD .
Having these CD 's handy would have saved me a lot of time .
That said , I have to say that I 'm glad to have been able to recover my data and that I was n't down too terribly long in the process .
I also wanted to mention how helpful the Linux Community is in times like this .
I 'm a fairly experienced Linux user , but it was sure nice to be able to ask questions before I actually committed changes to disk .
I hope my tale of woe serves as both warning and encouragement to you ; stuff happens , and you can recover from it .
Mormon church officials have now disclosed $ 190,000 in contributions to the Yes on Prop 8 campaign … this is up from $ 30 K reported earlier in the week .
The church had previously denied any financial support for the campaign beyond a $ 2000 expense for a visiting Elder of the church .
The report , filed with the secretary of state ’s office , listed a variety of California travel expenses for high - ranking members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and included $ 20,575 for use of facilities and equipment at the church ’s Salt Lake City headquarters and a $ 96,849 charge for “ compensated staff time ” for church employees who worked on matters pertaining to Prop .
8 . “ This is exactly what we were talking about when we filed the suit , ” said Fred Karger of Californians Against Hate , which opposed the same - sex marriage ban .
“ They spent money on the campaign and were supposed to report it . ”
Church officials have yet to comment .
More on the recent disclosure .

A General Motors vehicle is seen at a car dealership in Toronto December 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Cassese
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp , nearing a Tuesday deadline to present a viability plan to the U.S. government , is considering as one option a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing that would create a new company , the Wall Street Journal said in its Saturday edition .
“ One plan includes a Chapter 11 filing that would assemble all of GM ’s viable assets , including some U.S. brands and international operations , into a new company , ” the newspaper said .
“ The undesirable assets would be liquidated or sold under protection of a bankruptcy court .
Contracts with bondholders , unions , dealers and suppliers would also be reworked . ”
Citing “ people familiar with the matter , ” the story said that GM could also ask for additional government funds to stave off a bankruptcy filing .
GM declined to comment , the story said .
General Motors and Chrysler LLC face a Tuesday deadline to file restructuring plans to the government in exchange for receiving $ 17.4 billion in federal loans .
Automakers have struggled as U.S. auto sales have tumbled amid a recessionary economy .
U.S. auto sales in January tumbled to a 27 - year low .
GM has been in talks with bondholders and the United Auto Workers union to get an agreement on a restructuring that would wipe out about $ 28 billion in debt for the auto maker , sources have told Reuters .
However , it appears unlikely a deal could be reached by the Tuesday deadline , they said .
GM has already announced plans to cut 10,000 salaried workers worldwide , or 14 percent of its staff , impose pay cuts for most remaining white - collar U.S. workers and has offered buyouts to its 62,000 U.S. workers represented by the UAW .
In addition , it is trying to sell its Hummer SUV and Swedish Saab brands and is reviewing the status of its Saturn brand .
It ’s been a rough day for Gmail .
After a lengthy service outage this morning , Gmail is now being attacked by a phishing scam that is spreading like wildfire .
I became alerted to it when I received IMs from three people I had n’t talked to in some time within a matter of minutes – one a marketing exec at a prominent startup – with typical phishing jargon “ check this out ! ” with a link to a tinyurl that when clicked , points you to a site called ViddyHo .
Apparently , the site sends out the message to all of your Google Talk contacts .
I ’m a bit surprised this scam is taking off ( and feel sorry for my friends that fell for it , who I expected better judgment from ! ) , because the site itself is so crude and does n’t even tell you what you ’re going to get for entering your credentials .
Nonetheless , people are falling for it , and will likely continue to do so until word spreads far and wide ( which , it ’s starting to do through Twitter ) .
In any event , if you ’ve fallen for the scam , be sure to change your password , as who knows what else ViddyHo has in store for you .

TB is caused by infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis
Two drugs already used for fighting other infections may help in the battle against drug - resistant tuberculosis , researchers say .
The combination of clavulanate and meropenem was effective against 13 strains of the most drug resistant TB in the laboratory .
Clinical trials are now being planned by the US researchers , who reported their results in the Science journal .
UK experts urged caution but said new TB treatments were desperately needed .
It is thought one - third of the world 's population is infected with TB - 10 % of whom develop active disease .
The more drugs that can be used in the treatment of multidrug resistant and XDR - TB , the better
Professor Denis Mitchison
There is growing concern about extensively drug resistant disease - known as XDR - TB - against which first choice and at least one second choice treatments do not work .
The latest study revisits the effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics , the family which includes penicillin and is very widely used in the treatment of infection but has never been successful against TB .
This lack of effectiveness is largely because the mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium contains a highly active enzyme which inactivates the antibiotics .
Combination
In the latest study , researchers looked at several combinations of one drug to stop the enzyme working and one beta-lactam antibiotic .
They found that clavulanate was the best enzyme inhibitor and meropenem , a fairly modern antibiotic , the best partner in potently killing different strains of TB .
Clinical trials are being planned later this year .
Professor John Blanchard , a biochemist from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , said the idea of using these drugs in tandem was not new but what they had done was carry out a detailed investigation into what combination may work against TB .
He explained that the drugs also seemed to work against TB in the non-active phase which is notoriously difficult to treat .
" The number of untreatable cases is increasing worldwide every year .
" We are excited about this because , with the caveat that this needs to be shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials , this would be the first new drug to be introduced in the treatment of TB in 40 years . "
Professor Denis Mitchison , an expert in medical microbiology at St George 's , University of London , said the theory of using a penicillin and clavulanate was not a new one but such combinations had not been sufficiently effective in the past .
" The use of merepenems is new and the combination now sounds effective , though there are already reports of rare resistant strains of other bacteria . "
He urged caution about using the drug combination alone .
But he added : " The more drugs that can be used in the treatment of multidrug resistant and XDR - TB , the better . "
Dr Ruth McNerney , a TB expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said the drug combination needed to be tested in patients before any conclusions could be drawn .
" But we desperately need drugs for XDR - TB , " she added .

REUTERS / Fadi Al - Assaad Journalist Seymour Hersh speaking in Doha at an Al Jazeera forum on the media in 2007 .
At a “ Great Conversations ” event ( MP3 ) at the University of Minnesota last night , legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hersh may have made a little more news than he intended by talking about new alleged instances of domestic spying by the CIA , and about an ongoing covert military operation that he called an “ executive assassination ring . ”
Hersh spoke with great confidence about these findings from his current reporting , which he has n’t written about yet .
In an email exchange afterward , Hersh said that his statements were “ an honest response to a question ” from the event ’s moderator , U of M Political Scientist Larry Jacobs and “ not something I wanted to dwell about in public . ”
Hersh did n’t take back the statements , which he said arise from reporting he is doing for a book , but that it might be a year or two before he has what he needs on the topic to be “ effective … that is , empirical , for even the most skeptical . ”

The evening of great conversation , featuring Walter Mondale and Hersh , moderated by Jacobs and titled “ America ’s Constitutional Crisis , ” looked to be a mostly historical review of events that have tested our Constitution , by a journalist and a high government official who had experience with many of the crises .
And it was mostly historical , and a great conversation , in which Hersh and Mondale talked about the patterns by which presidents seem to get intoxicated by executive power , frustrated by the limitations on that power from Congress and the public , drawn into improper covert actions that exceed their constitutional powers , in the belief that they can get results and will never be found out .
Despite a few references to the Founding Fathers , the history was mostly recent , starting with the Vietnam War with much of it arising from the George W. Bush administration , which both men roundly denounced .
At the end of one answer by Hersh about how these things tend to happen , Jacobs asked : “ And do they continue to happen to this day ? ”
Replied Hersh :
“ Yuh .
After 9/11 , I have n’t written about this yet , but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state .
Without any legal authority for it .
They have n’t been called on it yet .
That does happen .
“ Right now , today , there was a story in the New York Times that if you read it carefully mentioned something known as the Joint Special Operations Command — JSOC it ’s called .
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
They did not report to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff or to Mr. [ Robert ]
Gates , the secretary of defense .
They reported directly to him . …
“ Congress has no oversight of it .
It ’s an executive assassination ring essentially , and it ’s been going on and on and on .
Just today in the Times there was a story that its leaders , a three star admiral named [ William H. ]
McRaven , ordered a stop to it because there were so many collateral deaths .
“ Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That ’s been going on , in the name of all of us .
“ It ’s complicated because the guys doing it are not murderers , and yet they are committing what we would normally call murder .
It ’s a very complicated issue .
Because they are young men that went into the Special Forces .
The Delta Forces you ’ve heard about .
Navy Seal teams .
Highly specialized .

“ In many cases , they were the best and the brightest .
Really , no exaggerations .
Really fine guys that went in to do the kind of necessary jobs that they think you need to do to protect America .
And then they find themselves torturing people .
“ I ’ve had people say to me — five years ago , I had one say : ‘ What do you call it when you interrogate somebody and you leave them bleeding and they do n’t get any medical committee and two days later he dies .
Is that murder ?
What happens if I get before a committee ? ’
“ But they ’re not gonna get before a committee . ”
Hersh , the best - known investigative reporter of his generation , writes about these kinds of issues for The New Yorker .
He has written often about JSOC , including , last July that :
“ Under the Bush Administration ’s interpretation of the law , clandestine military activities , unlike covert C.I.A. operations , do not need to be depicted in a Finding , because the President has a constitutional right to command combat forces in the field without congressional interference . ”
( “ Finding ” refers to a special document that a president must issue , although not make public , to authorize covert CIA actions . )
Here is a tape of the full Mondale - Hersh - Jacobs colloquy , a little over an hour , without the audience Q and A .
If you want to look for the Hersh statement quoted above , it ’s about at the 7:30 mark .
The rest of the evening was , as expected , full of worry and wisdom and quite a bit of Bush - bashing .
Jacobs walked the two elder statesmen through their experiences of :
The My Lai massacre , which Hersh first revealed publicly and which he last night called “ the end of innocence about us and war . ”
which Hersh first revealed publicly and which he last night called “ the end of innocence about us and war . ”
The Pentagon Papers case , which Mondale called the best example of the “ government ’s potential for vast public deception . ”
which Mondale called the best example of the “ government ’s potential for vast public deception . ”
Henry Kissinger ’s secret dealings , mostly relating to the Vietnam War .
( Hersh , who has written volumes about Kissinger , said that he will always believe that whereas ordinary people count sheep to fall asleep , Kissinger “ has to count burned and maimed Cambodian babies . ” )

The Iran Contra scandal .
( Hersh said the Reagan administration came to office with a clear goal of finding a way to finance covert actions , such as the funding of the Nicaraguan Contras , without appropriations so that Congress would n’t know about them .
Mondale noted that Reagan had signed a law barring further aid to the Contras , then participated in a scheme to keep the aid flowing .
Hersh said that two key veterans of Iran - Contra , Dick Cheney and national security official Elliot Abrams , were reunited in the George W. Bush White House and decided that the key lesson from Iran - Contra was that too many people in the administration knew about it . )

And the Bush - Cheney years .
( Said Hersh : “ The contempt for Congress in the Bush - Cheney White House was extaordinary . ”
Said Mondale of his successor , Cheney , and his inner circle : “ they ran a government within the government . ”
Hersh added : “ Eight or nine neoconservatives took over our country . ”
Mondale said that the precedents of abuse of vice presidential power by Cheney would remain “ like a loaded pistol that you leave on the dining room table . ” )
Jacobs pressed both men on the question of whether the frequent abuses of power show that the Constitution fails , because these things keep happening , or whether it works , because these things keep coming to light .

Mondale stuck with the happy answer .
“ The system has come through again and again , ” he said .
Presidents always think they will get away with it , but eventually reporters like Hersh bring things to light , the public “ starts smelling this stuff , ” the courts and the Congress get involved .
Presidents “ always , in the long run , find out that the system is stronger than they are . ”
Hersh seemed more troubled by the repetitions of the pattern .
The “ beautiful thing about our system ” is that eventually we get new leaders , he said .
“ The evil twosome , Cheney and Bush , left , ” Hersh said .
But he also said “ it ’s really amazing to me that we manage to get such bad leadership , so consistently . ”
And he added that both the press and the public let down their guard in the aftermath of 9/11 .
“ The major newspapers joined the [ Bush ] team , ” Hersh said .
Top editors passed the message to investigative reporters not to “ pick holes ” in what Bush was doing .
Violations of the Bill of Rights happened in the plain sight of the public .
It was not only tolerated , but Bush was re-elected .
And even Mondale admitted that one of his greatest successes , laws reforming the FBI and CIA in the aftermath of the Church Committee , were supposed to fix the problem so that “ we would never have these problems again in the lifetime of anyone alive at the time , but of course we did . ”

So , an Iridium satellite just happened to collide with a defunct Russian military satellite …
You ’re about to learn how the sausage gets made , and , before we begin , you should know that it ’s not pretty .
I do n’t know the whole story about Iridium , but it has got to be one of the spookiest tales of them all .
In November 1998 , Motorola activated the Iridium communications network , a constellation of low - earth orbit satellites that provides wireless telecom and data services to any location on the planet .
The cost to build the system ?
About $ 5 billion .
By August 1999 , unable to sign up enough customers — because of extremely high handset costs and per minute usage fees — Iridium was facing bankruptcy .
( If you know of a more complete account of what happened next , please let me know about it . )
Iridium executive Dan Colussy put together a group of “ private investors ” to buy the Iridium system .
According to Iridium :
In December 2000 , a group of private investors led by Dan Colussy organized Iridium Satellite LLC .
Iridium Satellite LLC acquired the operating assets of the bankrupt Iridium LLC including the satellite constellation , the terrestrial network , Iridium real property and intellectual capital .
How much did this group of private investors pay for the system that cost about $ 5 billion to build ?
$ 25 million .
That ’s a discount of about 99.5 % off the build cost .
Who were those private investors who just happened to be at the right place at the right time ?
I ’ll be buggered if I know , but someone , somewhere probably knows .
But guess what happened next .
This is U.S. Department of Defense Press Release Number , 729-00 , 26 December 2000 :
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ANNOUNCES CONTRACT FOR IRIDIUM COMMUNICATIONS
SERVICES
The Department of Defense , through its Defense Information Systems Agency , last night awarded Iridium Satellite LLC of Arnold , Md. , a $ 72 million contract for 24 months of satellite communications services .
This contract would provide unlimited airtime for 20,000 government users over the Iridium satellite network .
The contract includes options which , if exercised , would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $ 252 million and extend the period of performance to December 2007 .
The Department has taken this action because the Iridium system offers state - of - the - art technology .
It features on - satellite signal processing and inter-satellite crosslinks allowing satellite - mode service to any open area on earth .
It provides mobile , cryptographically secure telephone services to small handsets anywhere on the globe , pole - to - pole , 24 hours a day .
The system and its DoD enhancements will provide handheld service currently not available .
Since the Navy has a requirement more than twice as large as the current capability , the Department of Defense needs the capacity Iridium uniquely offers small unit operations in areas without satellite constellation coverage or during periods when various assets are being used in other contingencies .
Special Forces operations , combat search and rescue activities and polar communications will also be enhanced .
Iridium will provide a unique resource to enhance DoD mobile satellite communications requirements .
“ Iridium will not only add to our existing capability , it will provide a commercial alternative to our purely military systems .
This may enable real civil / military dual use , keep us closer to the leading edge technologically , and provide a real alternative for the future , ” said Dave Oliver , principal deputy undersecretary of Defense ( Acquisition , Technology and Logistics ) .
Iridium Satellite LLC is now purchasing the operating assets of Iridium LLC and its existing subsidiaries , pursuant to a Nov. 22 , 2000 order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York .
Under the agreement , Iridium Satellite LLC will purchase all of the existing assets of Iridium LLC , including its constellation of low - orbiting satellites and its satellite control network , and will have Boeing operate the system .
The new “ bulk rate ” service agreement offered and accepted by the Department stands to provide the same critical augmentation capability at substantially cheaper rates .
Early next year , Iridium will offer a classified capability .
Classified service will not only be provided for users already registered to the DoD gateway , but will also be extended to new users from DoD , other federal agencies , and selected allied governments .
Woh !
Wait a minute .
The General Accounting Office tried to investigate , but while those spooky birds continued to fly , a big black National Security blanket fell from above and shut down the GAO with regard to the DoD and Iridium :
The U.S. General Accounting Office ( GAO ) is investigating the Department of Defense ’s recently signed contract for satellite telephone services from Iridium Satellite LLC .
Globalstar LP filed a protest with GAO shortly after the Pentagon announced the agreement with Iridium , because no competition was held for the telecommunications contract .
GAO placed a hold on the Iridium contract pending its investigation , but the Pentagon was able to have the hold lifted by citing national security reasons .
The GAO investigation has a 100 - day limit .
Had enough ?
We ’re just getting started .
This is from USA Today :
When the bankruptcy judge offered one last chance for a buyer to step in , nobody could put together a deal that made all parties happy — except for Dan Colussy , who for the previous 10 years had run United Nuclear , a company that refurbished aircraft and made nuclear reactors for submarines .
“ Basically , he was retired but viewed it as a shameful waste to see an extremely valuable asset done away with , ” says Picasso , who Colussy hired to run Iridium .
So Colussy and a group of investors offered $ 25 million for a system that cost Motorola and its partners $ 5 billion to build .
That ’s one - half cent on the dollar .
It ’s like picking up a $ 150,000 Porsche 911 for $ 750 .
Or getting a $ 425 - a- night room at the Ritz - Carlton in Laguna Nigel , Calif . , for $ 2 .
The last time anybody consummated a deal like that , the French wound up with just $ 15 million for the Louisiana Purchase , which is probably the underlying reason they ’re ticked off at us .
In an odd twist , the new Iridium is 24 % owned by an investment firm controlled by Prince Khalid bin Abdullah bin Abdulrahman of Saudi Arabia .
The prince used to own a minority chunk of the old Iridium in partnership with the Saudi Binladen Group , the company run by Osama bin Laden ’s family .
So in a way , some of the money that gave a start to the world ’s most notorious terrorist partly funded a communications system helping the U.S. military blast Saddam ’s army .
Now that ’s globalization .
Can you hear me now ?
No ?
Ok , let ’s try again .
Alvin B. ( “ Buzzy ” ) Krongard , Former Investment Banking and CIA Veteran , Joins Iridium Satellite Board Of Directors :
BETHESDA , Md. , Aug. 9 / PRNewswire / — Iridium Satellite is pleased to announce that Alvin B. ( “ Buzzy ” ) Krongard has joined its Board of Directors .
Buzzy Krongard is the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Alex .
Brown Incorporated , the nation ’s oldest investment banking firm .
In addition , Krongard served as Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust , in addition to holding other financial industry posts .
He also served as Counselor to the Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , then as Executive Director of the CIA from 2001 to 2004 .
Iridium , as the only provider of truly global satellite voice and data communications , helps government organizations and businesses around the world communicate where there are no other forms of communication available .
Iridium is the only mobile satellite communications service that provides complete pole - to - pole coverage of the earth , making it ideal for remote and backup communications .
As such , Iridium has experienced substantial business growth in providing services for mission critical communications , as well as for response to natural and manmade disasters .
Iridium is tapping top - level counsel as it expands its Board .
The company announced its appointment of Tom Ridge , Former Director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , to its Board in June .
“ Iridium is at a pivotal point in growing its business and expanding its services , ” said Dan A. Colussy , CEO and Chairman , Iridium Satellite .
“ With Buzzy ’s deep knowledge base in investment banking and his unmatched experience with the intelligence community , we look forward to his direction as we expand our financial resources and further serve our important customer base . ” …
“ I look forward to sharing my investment banking background , as well as my insight into the communications needs of the intelligence community , as an Iridium Board member , ” said Mr. Krongard .
“ I am impressed with the unique aspects of the Iridium network and the power it brings to bear on the Global War On Terrorism ( GWOT ) , homeland defense and other related operations .
Iridium has an important customer base to serve and I am pleased to assist . ”
Other related operations ?
Like , growing tomatoes ?
Oh sure .
British intelligence had worked out a covert operation that was tasked with teaching the Taliban “ farming and irrigation ” techniques .
Part of this back - to - the - land plan , for the producers of 95 % of the global opium supplies , included training the Taliban , “ To use secure satellite phones , so they could communicate directly with UK officials . ”
Never mind all of that , because all ’s well that ends well for “ the biggest project failure in history ” : Nine - Year Iridium Bankruptcy Saga Over for Motorola :
A judge has finally ruled that Motorola has nothing to pay over the bankruptcy of its Iridium satellite venture in 1999 , described as the biggest project failure in history .
The satellites are still in use , with current owner , Iridium Satellite , claiming to have around 250,000 subscribers .
A creditors ’ committee had been seeking more than $ 4bn in damages against Motorola , which backed the original Iridium plan to cover the globe with 66 satellites providing phone coverage .
Founded in 1992 , Iridium launched its service in 1998 , but went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1999 , unable to sell enough subscriptions to the expensive service , in the face of competition from GSM mobile - phone services .
Yep , so that ’s all I know about Iridium .
And now back to our regularly scheduled broadcast .
I ’m going to bold just one paragraph below about the , “ accident . ” I ’ll let you do the math on the rest .
Via : Wall Street Journal :
A commercial satellite owned by a U.S. company was destroyed in a collision with a defunct Russian military satellite in what NASA said was the first such accident in orbit , raising new concerns about the dangers of space debris .
The crash , which happened Tuesday in low - earth orbit , involved one of the satellites owned by closely held Iridium Satellite LLC and a crippled Russian military satellite that apparently stopped functioning years ago , according to U.S. government and satellite - industry officials .
The collision created two large clouds of debris floating roughly 480 miles above Siberia , and prompted space scientists and engineers to assess the likelihood of further collisions .
The accident could have implications for U.S. space budgets and policy , partly because it comes amid a Pentagon campaign to increase spending on systems to protect U.S. high - tech space hardware by keeping better track of the thousands of pieces of debris and other satellites circling the earth .
As more and more satellites are blasted into orbit , the challenges of keeping them from hitting debris or each other are growing .
Military planners also worry about enemies jamming , disabling or potentially even ramming U.S. satellites .
Industry officials say Iridium has identified the Russian craft as a Cosmos series satellite launched in 1993 , weighing more than a ton and including an onboard nuclear reactor .
A collision could release nuclear residue , though experts have argued for years that the chance of radioactive debris surviving a fall through the atmosphere and reaching inhabited areas is very small .
More than 220 active commercial satellites now orbit the globe , in addition to hundreds of military , spy and scientific satellites .
Commercial satellites provide businesses with everything from data and video transmissions to support for automated bank teller systems and consumer navigation devices .
The Russian craft was being monitored by Pentagon organizations that keep track of space debris in order to prevent in - orbit collisions from damaging or destroying both commercial and government satellites .
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon track more than 10,000 pieces of high - speed debris , some no larger than a football .
Cosmos satellites have been designed for various uses , from spy missions to missile - warning systems to secure military communications .
They have caused a number of scary incidents over the years , including a 1991 collision between one defunct model and debris from another ; a near - collision with the space shuttle the same year ; and another that crashed into Canadian wilderness in 1978 .
Pentagon officials will face a barrage of questions about how they missed such an impending collision with an intact satellite , according to Tim Farrar , a satellite consultant familiar with Iridium .
Commercial satellites are “ routinely repositioned to avoid potential collision with smaller pieces of debris , ” said Mr. Farrar .
Pentagon brass , satellite industry executives and NASA leaders for years have publicly expressed concern about the dangers of orbital debris .
But the odds of a direct hit between satellites were considered so small as to be basically unthinkable .
The ground - based and space - based reconnaissance tools available to the Pentagon generally were considered adequate to keep close track of larger objects .
Recently , large U.S. and European operators began reviewing contingency plans to move some telecommunications satellites away from a pair of malfunctioning satellites .
Space collision worries gained momentum in January 2007 , when the Chinese government used a relatively simple antisatellite weapon to knock down one of its aged weather satellites .
NASA said there have been four earlier instances of accidental collisions in orbit , generally involving rocket parts and other debris .
None involved a full - size satellite .
When satellites reach the end of their useful lives they often are parked in remote orbits where they are unlikely to endanger working satellites .
But if a satellite ’s onboard computers or other systems fail , or it runs out of battery power , it can be difficult for ground operators to maintain control .
Without such orders from the ground , satellites can act unpredictably over months .
Iridium , of Bethesda , Md. , uses more than 60 satellites to provide voice and data services for about 300,000 subscribers globally .
It said the collision has “ minimal impact ” on service due to its backup capacity .
To lose one awards season to industrial action was bizarre ; but to lose a second would represent Bracknell - ish carelessness .
It could be just about to happen , though , thanks to the real - life contradiction - in - terms that is Hollywood 's trade union movement .
The Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) , which has for some time been involved in a contract dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ( AMPTP ) , is about to ballot its 120,000 members on a strike that would once more bring the industry to a juddering halt .
Voting papers should be mailed out in time to overshadow the coming month 's Grammy , Golden Globe and Oscar nominations , and the fallout from the brouhaha could even affect the mutual backslapping of the Guild 's own awards ceremony .
Everyone needs a strike right now like a hole in the head , of course .
But the sabre - rattling between the SAG and the AMPTP long ago parted company with common sense and instead became an exercise in old - fashioned political power - broking .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Both sides are pursuing a dirty and expensive propaganda war .
On Monday , the AMPTP took out a $ 100,000 full - page advert in the LA Times .
Meanwhile , the SAG president Alan Rosenberg , pictured , ( the Arthur Scargill of this dispute ) saw lurid details of his divorce from the CSI star Marg Helgenberger leaked to the tabloids .
There 's an illuminating back - story to the row , too .
According to the New York Times columnist Sharon Waxman , the SAG recently wined and dined 20 of its most famous members – including Warren Beatty , Jack Nicholson , Meryl Streep , Nick Nolte – at an Italian restaurant , " like a scene from the Godfather movies " , to check they would support any forthcoming strike .
So if Oscar season is ruined for the second year running , do n't blame Hollywood 's many struggling actors .
Instead , take your anger out on their star - worshipping trade union , which – like the industry it serves – seems to reckon that some people – the famous – are more equal than others .

President - elect Barack Obama said Tuesday that he would ban earmarks – pork - barrel projects of lawmakers – from the economic recovery and reinvestment package he is asking Congress to pass this month .
“ We are going to stop talking about government reform and we ’re actually going to start executing , ” Mr. Obama said , speaking to reporters briefly after meeting with his top economic advisers .
“ We are ready for the challenge . ”
( Transcript )
On his second full day in the capital as the president - elect , Mr. Obama also warned that the country faced the prospect of “ trillion - dollar deficits for years to come , even with the economic recovery that we are working on . ”
He said he was troubled by the staggering $ 1 trillion figure , adding : “ I ’m going to be willing to make some very difficult choices on how we get a handle on this deficit . ”
But Mr. Obama said the $ 775 billion recovery plan was urgently needed to jumpstart the economy .
He pledged to be a watchful steward over the money , offering the restriction on earmarks as an example of how he intended to be mindful of Republican criticism that the package could be too costly .
“ We ’re not going to be able to expect the American people to support this effort , ” Mr. Obama said , unless “ investments are made wisely and managed well . ”
In addition to the ban on earmarks , Mr. Obama also said he would create a new Economic Recovery Oversight Board and put all government spending on the Internet in an easy - to - search format .
“ We will set a new , higher standard of accountability , transparency and oversight , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ We are going to ban all earmarks , the process by which individual members insert projects without review . ”

A quote attributed to Ward Cunningham suggests that Smalltalk failed because its tools were too good — they let people manage small messes in Smalltalk until they grew into big messes .
I can believe it .
Think of the C programming language .
C programs can be incredibly simple and straightforward ; the language itself is reasonably easy to understand , with only a few crazy ratholes related to function pointer declarations .
Yet the language provides only the building blocks for programs , and it's easy to believe that the C language is simple while acknowledging that C programs can be exceedingly complex .
Raw pointers and pointer offset math may be simple concepts if you understand how CPUs and memory work , but that simplicity does not make C programs simple .
( It also does n't work portably across platforms unless you understand how all of the relevant CPUs work .
Hooray for struct padding and alignment concerns . )
Perl occupies a sweet spot in language design and use .
Larry describes it as a combination of manipulexity and whipuptitude .
Perl has the power and flexibility to let experts twist and turn it until it does exactly what they want .
It 's also simple and expressive enough that novices can get their work done without worrying about theoretical underpinnings , big O notation , or even how memory allocation and hashing and vectors work .
Of course , it 's only a rhetorical device to anthropomorphize a language .
Perl does n't allow all of these things .
Perl is merely a tool in the hands of people who make these decisions .
Like Smalltalk ,
Perl will let you go a long way even if what you 're doing is n't maintainable .
( Try ignoring memory allocation and proper pointer usage in a C program .
It wo n't run well for long . )
Like Smalltalk , you can end up with a big mess very quickly .
My colleague Allison once said " The last four hundred lines of this loop are kind of messy . "
I have trouble understanding what kind of mindset it requires to write a loop with four hundred lines — and I recall that she had already refactored several hundred lines out of that loop .
Put another way , you 'd have real trouble reading this essay — as short as it is — without paragraph breaks .
Take out the punctuation and it gets more impenetrable .
Remove the spaces .
You wo n't even bother .
I wo n't pretend that people are great writers .
I 've read too much fanfic on the Internet and I wrote too much bad poetry as a teenager to suffer that delusion , but people generally understand how to arrange their thoughts into sentences and paragraphs .
They know how to hit the Enter key every now and then to separate unrelated thoughts .
Find and replace and automated refactoring tools and cross-referencing and compilers which treat all vertical whitespace as more or less the same and a function of five lines as equivalent to a function with five thousand lines are tools which allow us to manage messes in the same sense that Smalltalk 's lovely browser lets Smalltalk programmers manage ravioli code .
Our tools let us work around nascent problems until they grow too large for our tools .
Then we 're in real trouble .
I do n't want to manage little messes .
I want to eliminate them .
Only the relentless desire to eliminate non-essential complexity will work .
Will teaching people to think of code — not in terms of lists of statements to execute or methods to send or mathematical formulas to solve — as words , sentences , and paragraphs help ?

Entries on the government 's terrorist watch list : May 2005 : 288,000 May 2007 : 755,000 March 2009 : 1 million Source : Justice Department ; Government Accountablity Office WASHINGTON 
The government 's terrorist watch list has hit 1 million entries , up 32 % since 2007 .
Federal data show the rise comes despite the removal of 33,000 entries last year by the FBI 's Terrorist Screening Center in an effort to purge the list of outdated information and remove people cleared in investigations .
It 's unclear how many individuals those 33,000 records represent — the center often uses multiple entries , or " identities , " for a person to reflect variances in name spellings or other identifying information .
The remaining million entries represent about 400,000 individuals , according to the center .
The new figures were provided by the screening center and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to requests from USA TODAY .
" We 're continually trying to improve the quality of the information , " says Timothy Edgar , a civil liberties officer at the intelligence director 's office .
" It 's always going to be a work in progress . "
People put on the watch list by intelligence and law enforcement agencies can be blocked from flying , stopped at borders or subjected to other scrutiny .
About 95 % of the people on the list are foreigners , the FBI says , but it 's a source of frequent complaints from U.S. travelers .
In the past two years , 51,000 people have filed " redress " requests claiming they were wrongly included on the watch list , according to the Department of Homeland Security .
In the vast majority of cases reviewed so far , it has turned out that the petitioners were not actually on the list , with most having been misidentified at airports because their names resembled others on it .
There have been 830 redress requests since 2005 where the person was , in fact , confirmed to be on the watch list , and further review by the screening center led to the removal of 150 , or 18 % of them .
Without specific rules for who goes on the list , it 's too bloated to be effective , says Tim Sparapani , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union .
A 2007 audit by the Government Accountability Office said more needed to be done to ensure the list 's accuracy , but still found that it has " enhanced the U.S. government 's counterterrorism efforts . "

Without the tearful public ceremony that accompanied his retirement announcement from the Green Bay Packers just 11 months ago , quarterback Brett Favre has told the New York Jets he is retiring .
Favre had instructed his agent , James " Bus " Cook , to inform the Jets on Wednesday that he is retiring .
Favre and the Jets both confirmed the retirement in separate conference calls .
" There are several things that went into decision but most importantly , the most important thing , was that physically , you know with my shoulder the last half of the year it hampered the way I played , " Favre said .
" I 'm 39 , I had several options [ to have surgery ] and to let it heal .
How that would affect me in terms of playing I had no idea and it was n't something I was going to risk . "
Jets owner Woody Johnson said it was Favre 's decision to step aside .
" We had an all - encompassing conversation , " Johnson said .
" He told me at that point that he had made his decision to retire and thanked everybody and talked about what a great experience he had with the New York Jets . "
" I have great admiration for him as a player and a person .
I wish him only the best in his life after football , " Jets coach Rex Ryan said .
In an e-mail to ESPN 's Ed Werder , Favre indicated he had no regrets about finishing his career with the Jets rather than with the Packers franchise he represented for his previous 16 NFL seasons .
He specifically praised Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum , team owner Woody Johnson and fired coach Eric Mangini -- and even mentioned Thomas Jones and Kerry Rhodes , both of whom were publicly critical of Favre after the team 's collapse in the final month of the season prevented the Jets from making the playoffs .
" Mike and Woody , as well as the entire organization , have been nothing short of outstanding , " Favre said in the e-mail .
" My teammates -- Thomas and Kerry included -- were a pleasure to play with .
Eric [ Mangini ] could not have been any better .
I enjoyed playing for him .
My time with the Jets was short , but I 'm honored to be given that chance . "
" Brett Favre is a Hall of Fame player , but he is also a Hall of Fame person .
Brett , [ his wife ]
Deanna and his family will always be a part of the Jets family , " Johnson said .
" When we acquired Brett , we knew we would get everything he had .
He took the time to mentor younger players and his competitiveness and enthusiasm at practice and during games was contagious , " Tannenbaum said .
" I spoke with him this morning and told him that he will be a friend of the Jets for years to come and it was an honor to work with him . "
Jets teammate Leon Washington also felt honored to have played with Favre .
" The longevity of his career and his love for the game is truly inspiring , " Washington said .
" I 'm privileged to have played with not only a Hall of Fame QB , but also a great role model . "
The Jets already had begun discussing their options at quarterback prior to Favre 's announcement , and spent a good portion of Tuesday studying the 2009 class of draft - eligible college quarterbacks .
The team is unconvinced that Kellen Clemens , a former second - rounder , is capable of being Favre 's replacement .
There also appears to be a conviction to seek a quarterback with significant arm strength to play through the challenges of the windy , cold - weather climate that often is a factor in Jets games .
" We 've got three quarterbacks on the roster , and I think we feel pretty good that in a competition among those guys , we 'll end up with a pretty good quarterback , " Johnson said .
Favre told ESPN that he never requested that the Jets provide his unconditional release and said the decision to retire was strictly related to his ability to perform on the field .
" It 's about me not being able to play at the level I 'm accustomed to , " he said in an e-mail .
The New York Jets have placed Favre on the reserve / retired list , Tannenbaum said .
" He did not ask to be released , " Tannenbaum said .
" Everything he said was , he is done playing football .
We have our plan according to that , and we 're going to move forward . "
Earlier , sources told ESPN that Cook informally discussed the option of releasing Favre with the Jets .
The Jets respectfully declined that option , a source said .
Favre 's retirement will save the Jets his $ 13 million salary in salary - cap space .
The Jets are in one of the worst salary - cap situations in the NFL .
The retirement decision should not have surprised the Jets even though the team had publicly encouraged Favre to play another season .
Favre informed Tannenbaum before the Super Bowl that he was leaning toward retirement .
At some point within the past week , Favre told Cook to inform the Jets that he wanted to retire without fanfare and that the team could make the decision public at its convenience .
" With Brett , there was always the possibility that he would n't play the second year , " Johnson said .
" We were hoping to get one good year out of Brett Favre .
We picked him based on , in our opinion , his giving us the best chance to win last season .
We were disappointed not to have made the Super Bowl , but we did some very good things with Brett . "
The Packers , in a prepared statement , wished Favre the best .
" Congratulations to Brett on a remarkable career .
The Packers organization wishes him and his
family well , " the team said .
" Brett always will hold a special place in Green Bay Packers history , and we remain committed to retiring his number at an appropriate time in the future . "
In what appears to be his final NFL season , Favre threw 22 touchdown passes and an NFL - high 22 interceptions while leading the Jets to a 9 - 7 record -- a five - game improvement over their previous season without him .
A week after the Jets ' season ended without a playoff berth , Favre hinted to ESPN during a telephone interview that he would probably retire because he lacked the motivation necessary to continue playing and felt prepared for life after football .
" I have the ability to turn it off just like that , " he said .
" I do n't feel I have anything else to prove .
Do I have to redeem myself for the last five games ?
No .
I could be trying to do that until I 'm 60 years old .
There is nothing left out there for me from that standpoint .
I 'm disappointed with the last five games , sure , but I know I did everything I could have .
" I did n't play as well down the stretch .
It was probably a little bit of everything .
It 's hard for me , but I have to say I gave out down the stretch . "
In that same conversation , Favre conceded that he had an abundance of motivation to play for the Jets at the beginning of last season , most of it inspired by the spite he maintained for Packers GM Ted Thompson for trading him from Green Bay to New York .
Favre felt Thompson had taken Favre 's team from him , believed it had become personal , described the Packers as dishonest and concluded that the most accomplished quarterback in history had been exiled to the Jets precisely because it was something of a football purgatory , where no championships had been won in the four decades since Joe Namath .
Brett Favre walked off the field Dec. 28 in what appears to be his last NFL game -- a 24 - 17 loss to the Dolphins .

" They sent me to New York because they did n't play the Jets , they were 4 - 12 , so they did n't have to play me , they knew we had very little chance of making the playoffs and they knew it was not likely that we'd have a better year than they did , " Favre told ESPN .
" I was aware of all of that and more than up to the challenge because they felt they were shipping me off to Siberia and they 'd never hear from me again .
So was I coming back to play because I loved the game or to prove them wrong ?
Probably a little bit of both .
" Maybe initially I came back for the wrong reasons , " Favre says now .
" It was like , ' OK , they do n't want me to play , then I 'll play somewhere else and show them I can still play . ' "
He knew there would be comparisons between his statistics and those of the quarterback who replaced him in Green Bay , Aaron Rodgers , the very first player Thompson drafted when he took over the Packers ' front office .
Favre admits that his family and friends were consumed with keeping him informed about how his numbers measured against those of Rodgers and constantly urged him to throw more touchdown passes than his replacement .
Favre admits to virtually no interest in that kind of intramural competition .
But he was devout in doing whatever he could to ensure that the Jets accomplished more than the Packers .
" The only thing I worried about was winning , " he said .
" There was a time in my career where I paid more attention to individual stats , but in the last couple of years the most important thing was winning and losing .
In the end , that 's what matters most .
Was I pissed at Green Bay ?
Sure .
But I was n't pissed at their players .
I did keep up with the wins and losses .
Sure , it was hard not to do that .
I did n't wish them bad , but I wished us better . "
Accomplishing that goal seemed unlikely .
Removed from a Packers team that finished 13 - 3 , Favre inherited a 4 - 12 Jets team .
Favre admitted the transition was difficult .
There were moments of extreme doubt that threatened to become actual regret , when Favre admits he wondered if he had made a terrible mistake .
" Numerous times , " he said .
" Traveling was much more difficult .
Nothing was easy in the whole transition , except for dealing with the guys on the team ; that was the easy part , and I thought that would be the hard part .
But let me tell you :
When we rolled into the house the Tuesday morning after that San Diego game , I thought to myself , ' What in the hell ? ' "
In the third week of the season , Favre threw three touchdown passes , was intercepted twice and suffered a sprained left ankle in a 48 - 29 loss on " Monday Night Football " to the Chargers .
But Favre persevered .
He became more comfortable , played more confidently , accomplished feats not even he had experienced .
He threw six touchdown passes in a single game against the Arizona Cardinals .
The next week , the Jets took over sole possession of first place from the defending AFC champion New England Patriots as Favre orchestrated an unimaginable 34 - 31 triumph .
He led consecutive scoring drives on the last possession of regulation and the first of overtime .
He admitted afterward that nobody in the building was more nervous and says these were the moments that brought him out of retirement .
The next week would prove just as monumental .
There was Favre throwing touchdown passes and celebrating joyously as he and the Jets completed a 34 - 13 road upset of the Tennessee Titans , the final undefeated team in the league .
" There 's not many games left for old Brett Favre , so I 'm glad this one turned out the way it did , '' he said moments later .
When asked how winning a handful of big games for the Jets compared with doing the same for 16 years with the Packers , his answer hinted at the animosity that may never leave him .
" It feels great -- as good , if not better .
My career in Green Bay was great .
It was awesome , maybe better than awesome .
Will I have a 16 - year career in New York ?
I doubt it .
But I 'm going to try and lump 16 into one and see what happens . "
It does n't get better than this , Favre thought .
And , sadly , he was right .
It would not get better than that moment .
" At that point , it was , ' Go get your Super Bowl tickets , ' " Favre says .
" That 's what was so disappointing -- how quickly we rose , and then fell . "
After the victories in New England and Tennessee , the Jets were considered potentially the best team in the AFC and a legitimate Super Bowl contender .
But the Jets failed badly in December , losing four of their final five games , and Favre 's performance with an ailing right shoulder was a primary reason .
In the final five games , Favre threw nine interceptions and only two touchdown passes .
When the season was finished , Favre revealed he had a torn biceps tendon and that doctors had urged him to have surgery if he intended to play in 2009 .
He decided against both .
" It sucks getting old , " he said .
" At 40 years old , your mind tells you that you can do all the things you could in your younger years but the body does n't cooperate .
As I look back on it , I had my moments where people said , ' It was the same Brett Favre , just a different uniform . ' "
Immediately after his first Jets season , Favre had decided that if it was also his final NFL season .
There would be no news conference as there had been 11 months ago in Green Bay .
" I 'm an emotional guy , and I 'm sure people are tired of seeing me get emotional , " he explained .
" People would probably say , ' Oh , here he goes again . '
I think it would just be better for me to just thank the Jets , and I sincerely mean that .
It was well worth what I invested .
But I 'm going to just quietly step away if that 's what happens . "
That is exactly what has just happened .

Anyone here like doing taxes ?
Did n’t think so .
We all have to do them ; we all have to pay money to Uncle Sam ( although some get away with paying much less than others ) .
But as a freelancer and / or a blogger , are you overlooking dozens of legitimate deductions that could save you a whole lot of money ?
I own a small business ( very small , it ’s just me ) and it basically involves doing some writing for advertising , marketing , the web and of course , blogging .
None of this will ever replace my full - time career , but it does eat up various costs that my accountant has told me I can deduct from my taxes .
And when I looked into it further , I found not just a handful of possible deductions , but a veritable smorgasbord .
Here are the expenses you should look into deducting if you ’re a blogger and / or freelancer , assuming they apply to your chosen blogging or freelancing field ( you ca n’t deduct movie tickets if you have no reason to be at the movies … but if you have a blog all about movies and reviews , go for it ) .
As always , you need proof of this stuff .
No good saying you bought 50 magazines last year if you ca n’t find the receipts .
With the government hemorrhaging money , they ’re looking for any opportunity to keep as much of your cash as they can .
In the event of an audit ( aaarggghhh ) you want your finances to be watertight .
It ’s also worth noting that your expenses should n’t really outweigh your income ( although sometimes it 's inevitable in your first year of business , taking into account start - up costs and so forth ) .
But , if you made $ 1500 from your blogging adventures , writing off a $ 3500 computer system may trigger a big bad red flag .
The IRS does n't like it when you spend more than you make .
And if in doubt , double check with an accountant .
Industry books & periodicals , including audio books
Other books and periodicals used for research Library book charges DVDs and CDs related to your blogging Movie or theater tickets , if related to your blogging or freelancing Music and TV show downloads Magazine subscriptions Research sites that require a subscription Further education classes Webinars Business podcasts Business - related websites ( for me , that would be Adweek ) Memberships to professional clubs and affiliations Internet access fees ( at about $ 40 a month , that ’s a biggie ) Public internet access fees ( Internet café ’s , airports etc )

If you do some work for someone , be it a simple blog article or a much bigger job , and you get stiffed on the bill , you can write off your loss .
Fees for other bloggers and freelancers .
If you get overwhelmed and pay a friend or relative to help out , any money you pay that person for their assistance is a tax deduction .
Tax and accounting software Tax preparation fees Business incorporation costs Costs for Trademarks or Copyrights .

Office supplies ( everything from paper to paper clips )
Home office expenses .
You can deduct the part of your home you use exclusively for blogging or freelancing as an expense , including a portion of the rent , water , heating bills and so on .
Percentage of your home insurance ( for your home office )
Online self - promotion fees ( that includes banners and Adwords costs )
Trade show fees Advertising costs ( newspapers , stickers , posters , postcards etc ) Photography fees ( e.g. headshots , pack shots etc ) Photocopying / faxing fees Transportation costs : car mileage ; airline tickets ; taxis ; buses ; trains .
Highway tolls Parking fees Hotel costs for business trips .
Cleaning & laundering services when traveling for business .
Costs of conferences , plus all related expenses ( e.g. BlogHer ) Health insurance costs ( if you ’re self - employed ) Computer equipment insurance Food and drink purchased on business trips Client entertainment ( be reasonable … not sure you ’ll get away with Strip Club deductions )
Postage costs ( Stamps.com is ideal for keeping track of postage , and the service itself is tax - deductible ) PayPal and Western Union fees Post Office Box fees .
Safe Deposit Box fees .
Self - storage fees , especially useful if your files and records are spilling over into your garage and you need extra space .
Advice .
Any professional advice you pay for that pertains to your business is a tax deduction , and that includes counseling or coaching .
Membership dues to labor unions ( do bloggers have a union ? )
Charity work or donations ( this one ’s tricky .
It ’s limited to your out - of - pocket costs , not the final cost of the product .
In my case , I ’ve done some writing for charity , which is not applicable because you ca n’t deduct time spent .
But any materials used during your charity work can be deducted ) .
Prizes and giveaways .
Here at Wise Bread , we give away some very nice things .
Often , they are generously given to us as gifts to pass on to you , or readers .
But when we go out and spend money on a prize to give away , that can be deducted , as well as the cost to mail it out to you .
Business furniture .
If you use it exclusively for your blogging or freelancing , then anything from a chair or filing cabinet to the whole desk can be written off .
Business functions .
If you hold a little get - together for clients , even just one or two , then everything from the rental of the room ( or golf course … know what I mean ? ) to food and drink can be deducted .
Business lunches .
You can't include your own meal , but if you pick up the tab at a power - lunch ( or just a meeting with a potential client ) you can write off their part of the check .
Props .
I sometimes use props for photoshoots , and the cost of those props can be deducted .
Job search expenses .
Any money you spend trying to get work , from postage to travel , is a deductible expense .
Alcohol and drug abuse treatment .
If the pressure turns you into a Betty Ford patient , you can deduct the expenses of treatment .
Let ’s hope you never have to though .
Any losses due to theft .
Away on business , your laptop gets stolen … write it off .
Moving expenses related to your blogging or freelancing .
You can deduct 50 % of your self - employment tax Home improvements .
Turn the basement into a home office , those expenses are deductible .
Clothing and accessories .
If you have to buy any clothing for a particular job ( maybe you needed protective clothing & headwear to write an article about a building site ) then those costs are also deductible .
But do n’t try and write off your new Gucci watch .
Business checking expenses .
If you have anything more that free checking , it ’s a deduction .
Business gifts .
This is cool .
If your mom watched the kids while you went off to do an interview or write an article , and you then bought her flowers or choccies , well , the gift is tax deductible .
Very sweet .
Annual fees for business credit cards .
Physical therapy .
Writing for eight hours a day can cause all sorts of problems , including the dreaded Carpel Tunnel Syndrome .
I 've been advised by many accountants that you can deduct the cost of that therapy .
However , medical expenses are a complex beast , and usually need to be a percentage of your income .
Check with your accountant for details .
Headache pills , eye drops and so on .
If staring at the screen all day gives you a killer migraine , you can write off the cost of the meds to help you get through it and keep on working .
Wages .
Say you pay your kid $ 20 a month to empty your office trash can , maybe as a way to earn an allowance .
Well , you can deduct that expense .
Your dog .
No kidding , if you can prove it's a guard dog and is protecting your equipment , you can write - off the doggie expenses .
Net operating loss .
If your deductions outweigh your earnings , which often happens in your start - up year , you can use that loss to lower your taxes next year .
And one big final deduction you may want to think about :
Your TV cable or satellite bill .
I can deduct it because I need it …I work in the movie business .
It ’s a very nice deduction , too .
If you blog about soaps , movies , TV shows , or anything else in the entertainment field , this could be a nice write - off for you .
It 's a big list , but even if only 25 % of it applies to you , it could add up to a nice chunk of cash back in your pocket .
And before I get chastised , I 'm not against paying taxes .
But when corporations are finding ways to jump through every legal loophole and pay almost no federal tax , I do n't think it hurts you to take the legitimate tax deductions on the table .
Go stake your claim .

A new service to dispense digital content , which involves using self - service kiosks to download movies and music to flash memory cards , was jointly announced by a group of companies including Toshiba on Thursday .
Self - service kiosks placed in public locations -- like retail stores , airports and cafes -- will dispense movies that can be downloaded to cell phones and SD ( Secure Digital ) Memory cards .
The content can then be replayed on multiple devices with SD slots .
Toshiba will make TVs and set - top boxes with SD slots that can replay the movies downloaded using the service .
Prototypes of the devices will be shown at the Consumer Electronics Show being held in Las Vegas Thursday through Sunday .
Toshiba is developing the service with NCR , which will make the self - service kiosks , and MOD Systems , which is providing the technology to manage and securely distribute digital content .
By offering movie playback via SD cards , Toshiba is beginning a new chapter in its high - definition media - format battle with Sony .
Toshiba suffered a major setback last year when the HD DVD format it backed lost favor among top retailers and movie studios , which opted for Sony 's Blu-ray DVD format .
SD cards are removable media commonly used into portable devices to store or move images , video or other data .
SD card slots are available in 8,000 devices in more than 400 brands , including digital cameras , game consoles and camcorders , claims the SD Association , which provides the specifications for SD card development .
Users will be able to download close to 4,000 titles from top studios including Warner Brothers and Paramount Digital Entertainment , and 4 million [ M ] music tracks from self - service kiosks .
Pricing will be determined by the retailers holding the self - service kiosks , according to MOD Systems .
The kiosks will be in stores later in 2009 , though neither company provided an exact date .
NCR hopes to install the kiosks internationally , a MOD Systems spokeswoman said .
It takes two to three minutes to download a standard - definition full - length film from a kiosk to an SD card , according to MOD Systems .
Toshiba is trying to improve the download speeds and capacity of SD cards to make high - definition movies downloadable in the future .
SD cards saw a major jump in storage capacity and transfer speeds on Wednesday .
The SD Association announced the SDXC ( extended capacity ) memory card specification , which could increase the size of SD cards to 2TB and transfer speeds up to 104 Mbps .
Current SD cards can store only 32 GB of data and are limited to transfer speeds of up to 25 Mbps .
Toshiba was one of the original founders of the SD Association in 2000 .
SD technology is evolving faster than DVDs , though both offer benefits like portability and compatibility across devices , said Mark Phillips , CEO of MOD Systems , in an interview .
" In the past 10 years the capacity of optical disc technology has increased less than 10 times [ while ] NAND flash has increased about 100 times , " Phillips said .
Files can also be securely downloaded to SD cards , while the DVD faces challenges in securing content .
" Because content protection is tied to the disc , the disc must be manufactured , merchandised and transported -- it lacks the benefits of a pure digital system , " Phillips said .
SD cards support digital rights management , which allows music and video files to be secure .
The host controller manages SD card drivers and security .
But more work is needed for the SD format to reciprocate the success of the DVD format , which was the fastest consumer format ever adopted , Phillips said .
People lapped up DVDs because of its consistent user experience and support for a broad range of players .
" We certainly think more awareness and education is needed though for consumers to widely adopt and understand the benefits of SD , " Phillips said .
Researchers have found that two proteins which work in tandem in the brain 's blood vessels present a double whammy in Alzheimer 's disease .
Not only do the proteins lessen blood flow in the brain , but they also reduce the rate at which the brain is able to remove amyloid beta , the protein that builds up in toxic quantities in the brains of patients with the disease .
The work , described in a paper published online Dec. 21 in the journal Nature Cell Biology , provides hard evidence directly linking two processes thought to be at play in Alzheimer 's disease : reduction in blood flow and the buildup of toxic amyloid beta .
The research makes the interaction between the two proteins a seductive target for researchers seeking to address both issues .
Scientists were surprised at the finding , which puts two proteins known for their role in the cardiovascular system front and center in the development of Alzheimer 's disease .
" This is quite unexpected , " said Berislav Zlokovic , M.D. , Ph.D. , a neuroscientist and a senior author of the study .
" On the other hand , both of these processes are mediated by the smooth muscle cells along blood vessel walls , and we know that those are seriously compromised in patients with Alzheimer 's disease , so perhaps we should n't be completely surprised . "
The new findings are the result of a seven - year collaboration between two laboratories .
Zlokovic heads the Center for Neurodegenerative and Vascular Brain Disorders , looking at molecular roots of diseases like Alzheimer's .
Several years ago , after he found that several genes well known to cardiovascular researchers seemed to be especially affected in Alzheimer 's patients , he turned to Joseph Miano , Ph.D. to help analyze the findings .
Miano is interim director of Aab Cardiovascular Research Institute and associate professor of Medicine , and he is senior co-author of the new study .
" To some , it might seem odd that a cardiovascular group would intersect with a neuroscience group to study Alzheimer 's disease , " Miano said .
" But there 's a great deal of evidence to suggest that Alzheimer 's disease is a problem having much to do with the vascular plumbing .
And Rochester is the type of institution where partnerships like these are easy to strike up . "
For 15 years Zlokovic 's laboratory has focused on the molecular mechanisms regulating blood supply and the role of the blood - brain barrier in the development of Alzheimer 's disease .
It 's not simply that reduced blood supply hurts brain cells by causing a shortage of oxygen and other nutrients .
Rather , deterioration of blood flow seems to gum up the brain 's ability to remove toxic amyloid beta .

Normally , amyloid is picked up efficiently by blood vessels that then whisk the toxic trash away .
But in Alzheimer 's disease , the system no longer is able to keep up with the body 's production of the substance .
The molecular trash accumulates , and Zlokovic and others believe the buildup kills brain cells .
The current work focuses on two proteins well known to cardiovascular researchers , SRF ( serum response factor ) and myocardin .
The two work together within smooth muscle cells that line blood vessels to activate genes that are necessary for smooth muscle to function properly .
SRF binds to certain snippets of DNA called CArG boxes and serves as an anchor , while myocardin piggybacks along and turns on the genes to which SRF sticks .
Together they act as a master switch that determines whether smooth muscle cells contract – one of many ways the body controls just how much blood is flowing in the body .
Two years ago , Zlokovic and Miano published a study showing that the two proteins are much more active in the blood vessels of brains of people with Alzheimer 's disease than in people who do not have the disease .
They showed that when they reduced the activity of the proteins , blood flow in the brain increased , and when the genes were more active , blood flow decreased .
The latest report goes further , implicating the molecular duo in the slowed removal of amyloid beta .
The team found that SRF and myocardin working together turn on a molecule known as SREBP2 .
That protein inhibits a molecule known as LRP - 1 , which helps the body remove amyloid beta .
In other words , when SRF and myocardin are active , toxic amyloid beta accumulates .
The findings came primarily from the team 's studies of brain cells taken from people who had Alzheimer 's disease and comparing them to cells from healthy elderly people .

Compared to the smooth muscle cells from healthy adults , the cells from patients with Alzheimer 's disease had about five times as much myocardin and four times as much SRF , about five times as much SREBP2 , and about 60 percent less LRP - 1 .
That translated into a reduced ability to remove amyloid beta :
Cells taken from patients with the disease had only about 30 percent of the ability to remove the substance as cells taken from their healthy counterparts .
When the team lowered levels of SRF to the same level that exists in healthy cells , the cells from Alzheimer 's patients improved in their ability to remove amyloid beta , doing it just as well as cells from healthy individuals .
Conversely , when the team boosted levels of SRF and myocardin in the healthy cells , the changes lowered by about 65 percent those cells ' ability to remove amyloid beta .
In mice , the team found parallel results .
When the team boosted SRF or myocardin in healthy mice , those mice had about twice as much SREBP2 in their smooth muscle cells in the brain 's blood vessels .
They also had 90 percent less LRP - 1 , three times as much amyloid beta in their arteries , and 70 percent more amyloid beta in their brain tissue .
When the team reduced SRF and myocardin in mice prone to developing Alzheimer 's disease , those mice had 60 percent less SREBP2 , about four times as much LRP - 1 , and a 50 - percent reduction in amyloid beta in their blood vessels .
The first author of the study is Robert Bell , a graduate student in Zlokovic 's laboratory who is in Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine 's graduate program .
He had searched for months , without success , for evidence of a direct effect on LRP - 1 by SRF / myocardin .
A subsequent literature search turned up findings that the molecules might affect SREBP2 .
With that finding , the team was able to move forward and put the whole picture together .
Now the team has turned its attention to studying the role of hypoxia , which seems to play a role in turning on myocardin , as well as searching for molecules that block the hookup between SRF and myocardin .
The work was funded primarily by the National Institute on Aging .
Other funding came from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , and from Socratech Laboratories , a company founded by Zlokovic that is seeking to commercialize discoveries related to his work on Alzheimer 's disease and stroke .
Both Zlokovic and Miano hold a significant equity stake in the company .
In addition to Bell , Miano and Zlokovic , other authors of the paper include Rashid Deane , Ph.D. , research professor ; Nienwen Chow , Ph.D. , a scientist at Socratech ; Xiaochun Long , Ph.D. , research assistant professor ; Abhay Sagare , Ph.D. , instructor ; post - doctoral associate Itender Singh , Ph.D. ; Jeffrey Streb , Ph.D. , a former graduate student and now a post - doctoral researcher at UCLA ; Huang Guo , Ph.D. , research assistant professor ; pathologist Ana Rubio , M.D. , Ph.D. ; and William Van Nostrand , Ph.D. , of Stony Brook University Medical Center .
TROUBLED :
The ship has been dogged with problems
Holidaymakers on the Aurora say they have effectively been held prisoner after engine problems forced P&O Cruises to abandon five planned stops .
More than 600 passengers on the 93 - night cruise attended an emergency meeting and formed a protest committee after the £ 200 million ship failed to dock at three ports in New Zealand and at two Pacific Islands .
P&O said passengers , who have each paid upwards of £ 8,599 for the cruise , will receive compensation including £ 500 and a refund of the cost of four days cruising .
But the protest group is now threatening legal action as some had saved for 20 years to afford the cruise .
The Aurora was approaching San Francisco last night but some say the cruise has already been ruined .
Protest committee member Jennifer Dunthorne said : “ This failure to visit three ports in New Zealand and two Pacific Islands has turned this cruise ship into a prison for some .
“ Only visiting two ports in 22 days is not what I saved for 20 years to do .
“ This beautiful ship which has been the pride of the P&O fleet has become a red hot bed of distress , frustration and anger .
“ So many people worked hard for so many years to afford this cruise .
It is truly unforgivable . ”
It is the latest setback in a history of failings and bad luck for the ship – after the champagne bottle even refused to smash at its naming ceremony .
A second protest committee meeting with the ship ’s captain Paul Brown was due to be held last night .
Problems on the 76,000 - tonne Aurora , whose home port is Southampton , began within hours of leaving Sydney when it developed engine problems .
The ship limped to Auckland , New Zealand , with the 1,736 passengers told each day for six days that it could not leave port .
This meant missing out on stops at Wellington and Napier , in the Bay of Islands , plus Moorea and Tahiti in French Polynesia .
Mrs Dunthorne said : “ P& O offered some free drinks and derisory payments to compensate for shattered dreams .
“ Passengers are outraged at the company ’s apparent sole concern to concentrate on driving forward the ailing ship to pick up the next unsuspecting passengers on April 13 in Southampton – by abandoning much of the cruise it contracted to deliver . ”
P&O said last night : “ Having sustained damage to a thrust bearing , Aurora sailed from Auckland at 5 pm on Thursday March 12 after a delay of five days to enable repairs to be undertaken .
“ We greatly value the support and loyalty of our passengers and very much regret the disruption to Aurora ’s world cruise .
In recognition of this we have offered a compensation package which we believe to be a fair reflection of the disruption to the cruise , the actual amount of which will vary depending on the fare paid . ”
After leaving Auckland , Aurora took the most direct course to Honolulu from where she continued towards San Francisco before heading for Southampton .
When Aurora was launched by Princess Anne in 2000 , the champagne bottle did not break , which was considered a bad omen .
Then , on her maiden voyage , she broke down in the Bay of Biscay and had to return to port .
Some £ 6 million compensation was paid to passengers .

The global recession manifests itself in big and small ways , most gloomy , some quirky and often reflecting the inventive human spirit .
Here is a look at some signs of the times .
* In the working - class community of Weymouth , south of Boston , Easter ’s Country Kitchen , a crowded little diner , captured the mood in a notice near the food counter :
“ DUE TO BUDGET CUTS , THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL IS BEING TURNED OFF . ”
* Many companies are scaling back on holiday parties .
New York ’s billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who says the city faces a $ 1.6 billion budget deficit , personally paid for refreshments at his staff party .
A dinner with the City Hall press corps , usually at the mayor ’s residence , was moved to a Chinatown restaurant and journalists will be charged $ 45 a head .
* In another sign of holiday cheer , the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department reported a 250 percent rise in the number of guns handed over in a no-questions - asked program to exchange weapons for holiday gift cards .
The department ’s station in a high crime suburb received 964 guns , two hand grenades and two briefcases full of dynamite .
* More people are seeking love online to compensate for the pain of losses .
Match.com , which has online dating sites in 40 countries , had its largest membership growth in the last seven years in November .
“ During these trying times , people are looking for hope in their inbox , ” said CEO Thomas Enraght - Moony .
* It ’s not just meeting someone that is hard in times of stress .
It ’s also staying together .
Britain ’s counseling service Relate reported a rise of almost 60 percent in the number of couples seeking help with their relationships in October and November compared with last year .

“ The problems are to do with the recession , to do with job insecurity , to do with interest rates changing and also the escalating costs of running the family , ” said spokeswoman Christine Northam .
* Finding a job is hard everywhere , and a 23 - year - old Chinese woman took drastic action -- she sold herself online .
Using the name tony615_2007 , she put herself up for sale on Taobao.com , China ’s most popular auction site .
She told the China Daily she had about a dozen bids and was about to sign a contract , but declined to say how much for .
* As struggling U.S. car companies begged for a government bailout , TV stations and newspapers ran free advertisements urging people to go out and buy a new car .
The campaign was initiated by the National Automobile Dealers Association , whose members , in times of plenty , are one of the top sources of revenue for ... TV stations and newspapers .
* And where do you go in your new car ?
To the opera , of course !
The Metropolitan Opera in New York announced that “ in response to the recession ” , it was making 16,000 prime seats available for $ 25 each through the rest of the season through a weekly draw .
Normally those seats fetch $ 295 .
“ The $ 3 million dollar cost to underwrite the program has been contributed entirely from among the Board ’s 45 managing directors , ” it said .
Some , at least , seem immune to money worries .
* Restaurants are hurting almost everywhere , but from Chicago came word from the chicken company Sanderson Farms
Inc that even bar - stool sports fans may be cutting back .
There was no sign of the usual surge in sales of chicken wings , a traditional accompaniment for football games on TV .
“ That did not happen this fall , ” said a Sanderson spokesman .
Shopaholic spinster found dead under 3ft of unopened goods
The queen of collecting : Joan Cunnane in her home , where she was buried under 3ft of goods
A spinster who obsessively hoarded clothes died in her home after a mountain of suitcases fell on her , burying her alive .
Joan Cunnane , 77 , owned 300 scarves as well as thousands of trinkets and valuables .
They took up so much space in her bungalow that she had only a 2 ft - wide path to get around them , and her car and garage were packed with other goods .
After she was reported missing earlier this week , it took police searching her home two days to sift through her possessions .
Miss Cunnane was eventually found buried under a 3ft pile of cases in a back bedroom where she had apparently gone in search of a favourite item .
The eccentric pensioner , who had no known family , is thought to have died of dehydration several days earlier on Boxing Day .
Yesterday , neighbours spoke of their shock at the macabre death of Miss Cunnane , a retired BT operator and devout Roman Catholic who attended church services every weekend .
Her closest friend , Roy Moran , 77 , said : ' I think it just gave her pleasure to buy things - none of it was really essential .
I once asked her how many scarves she had .
She said she thought about 300 .
I asked her why she needed that many .
She said they were all different colours .
' She bought everything .
It had been going on over 16 years from when she bought the property . '
Miss Cunnane had enjoyed Christmas dinner with Mr Moran , a retired hospital supplies worker , before returning to her £ 170,000 bungalow in Heaton Mersey , near Stockport .
Crammed : Miss Cunnane 's garage was filled to the rafters
Neighbours became concerned when they did not see her for a few days while her car , which was usually piled high with bags and boxes , remained parked outside the bungalow .
She was reported missing on Tuesday after failing to attend a hospital appointment and police officers with sniffer dogs were sent to her home but failed to find her .
An expert search team and environmental health officers were also called in to help and on Wednesday evening her body was finally found buried under the suitcases .
The house was stacked with brand - new umbrellas , candles , ornaments , trinkets , clothes and electrical items , many of them unopened , as well as piles of videotapes .
Mr Moran said his friend would spend hours at branches of Marks & Spencer , John Lewis and Ikea rather than spend evenings at home , which was crammed full but amazingly tidy .
' I went in three times and could n't find her , ' he said .
' There was stuff in every room - it was so bad there were concerns about the police dogs going in .
' There were thousands of videos .
When I walked they all fell down .
It was a deathtrap , really .
Heavy goods vehicle : Miss Cunnane even used her Metro for storage
' It took two days with two teams of six policemen putting the stuff from her house into the van .
Now , they say they are going to put it all back . '
A neighbour said Miss Cunnane once asked for help in emptying her Rover Metro so it could go in for its MoT - a process which took four hours .
' I do n't know how she saw out of the back of it because it was so full of stuff , ' she said .
' There were six umbrellas , ornaments , pots , IKEA candle holders and an oil heater which was very heavy . '
She said Miss Cunnane was a deeply private lady who would not even open the door to the postman .
Greater Manchester Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances and the missing person file had been closed .
Over at Fight Aging ! , Reason spanks Oprah and sensationalist popular - medicine author Dr. Oz for promulgating unrealistic expectations about the lifespan extension benefits of CR :
Hence for a discussion of longevity , wild and unsupported claims are fair game .
At the present time , the scientific consensus is that human practice of calorie restriction will not greatly enhance maximum longevity , but does greatly improve health and greatly reduce risk of age - related disease .
That is n’t as exciting , however , as earlier speculation on attaining 120 year or more life spans , so the more exciting “ fact ” is what gets aired : Dr. Oz says calorie restriction is the number one way doctors say we can extend longevity .
“ The data that we have in rodents and some larger animals now indicate you can probably extend your life expectancy by up to 50 percent potentially from doing this , ” he says .
Do n’t get us wrong :
As Reason takes care to point out , CR is almost certainly good for you .
Biogerontologists have shown that CR yields benefits at the molecular , mitochondrial , and cellular level , and it ’s likely to improve human health .
It is not clear , however , whether CR will extend the human lifespan to the extent seen in short - lived animal models ; indeed , there are reasons to believe that it wo n’t .
( Qualification : the definitive studies are ongoing and have n’t been completed yet — by their very nature , they take a long time .
The issue is still controversial , in the way that issues often are when the data ’s not in yet .
The scientific consensus has n’t really been established ; to the extent that there is one , it ’s based on extrapolation from preliminary data , and the jury is still out . )
On the show appeared members of the Calorie Restriction Society , who are plugging the broadcast on their website .
( I want to preface the following by saying that I generally respect CRS ; I ’m pretty picky about what goes into the blogroll ) .
In light of Reason ’s commentary , I realize that their website is rhetorically slanted in favor of the claim that CR confers life extension : from their motto ( “ Fewer calories .
More life . ” ) , to the big graph of rodent lifespan curves on the front page , to the conclusion that CR is a “ proven life - extension method ” ( eliding the lack of definitive human data ) , the site is rich with implication that CR will extend longevity — a claim that has n’t been proven .
CRS could be doing a lot better job of portraying the subject in a scientifically accurate way — toning down the implications about certain lifespan extension , focusing on the more clearly established health benefits , and giving voice to countervailing studies .
Openness about the weaknesses of a theory , after all , are part of the rigorous logical testing that produces better theories .
And just as with book reviews , acknowledging the negative might go a long way toward increasing the credibility of positive claims about CR .
I came across the following news item today which might be of interest to many of the readers of this blog : as part of a bipartisan effort ( headed by Sen. Susan Collins ( R - ME ) and Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) ) to reduce the size of the U.S. federal government stimulus package ( currently at over $ 900 billion ) by about $ 77 billion , the entire appropriation for the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) in the package ( $ 1.4 billion – about 0.15 % of the entire stimulus package ) is being proposed to be eliminated , with significant cuts in related agencies ( NASA , DOE office of science , NOAA , etc. ) .
The $ 1.4 billion for the NSF in the Senate version of the package is already a reduction from the $ 2.5 billion allocated in the House version .
For comparison , the entire 2009FY budget for the NSF is $ 6.9 billion , or about 0.5 % of the discretionary federal budget of $ 1.21 trillion .
[ Full disclosure : a majority of my own research funding comes from the NSF . ]
[ Update , Feb 8 : It now appears that $ 1.2 billion of the funding for the NSF has been restored in a Senate compromise . ]
[ Update , Feb 12 : After the House / Senate reconciliation process , the amount allocated to the NSF has been increased to $ 3 billion .

President Barack Obama Monday is expected to fulfill a campaign promise by rescinding federal funding restrictions on embryonic stem cell research .
It ’s expected to reopen a moral debate which could become more divisive than the ideological political confrontation over rescuing the economy .
For me it ’s a no-brainer .
Diabetes has ravaged my body for a quarter century .
Extended research jump started with renewed federal grants holds promise for a cure not only for diabetes but many others such as cancer , Parkinson ’s and spinal injuries .
If you are doomed to die from these diseases , it is akin to being tossed overboard and become desperate enough to clutch to any flotation devise to keep you alive .
Or to recall an historical example , during the 1960s and early 70s thousands of Americans went to Mexico to obtain the cancer - fighting drug Laetrile which was banned in the U.S.
The drug ’s effectiveness was inconclusive .
This is not the case with various forms of stem cell research .
I ’m no geneticist nor a moral ethicist .
But no matter how hard I try , I fail to comprehend the reasoning behind the basic argument offered by opponents .
They have no problem discarding unused days - old embryos obtained from fertility clinics .
But they yell “ murder ” when the embryos to obtain the cells are destroyed for scientific research .
My fervent plea to the president : Leave politics and God out of the discussion and turn it over to scientists at the National Institutes of Health and let them establish the research grant guidelines .
Obama either by executive order or through Congress will end limited federal funding enacted by President Bush .
Under Bush , taxpayer money for that research was limited to a small number of stem cell lines that were created before Aug.
9 , 2001 , lines that in many cases had some drawbacks that limited their potential usability .
But hundreds more of such lines — groups of cells that can continue to propagate in lab dishes — have been created since then , ones that scientists say are healthier , better suited to creating treatments for people rather than doing basic laboratory science .
Nor does Obama ’s change fund creation of new lines .
But it means that scientists who until now have had to rely on private donations to work with these newer stem cell lines can apply for government money for the research , just like they do for studies of gene therapy or other treatment approaches .
From the Associated Press :
“ America ’s biomedical research enterprise experienced steady decline over the past eight years , with shrinking budgets and policies that elevated ideology over science .
This slowed the pace of discovery and the search for cures , ” said Sean Morrison , director of the University of Michigan ’s Center for Stem Cell Biology .
Critics immediately denounced the move .
“ Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for experiments that require the destruction of human life , ” said Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council .
Indeed , there are different types of stem cells :
So - called adult stem cells that produce a specific type of tissue ; younger stem cells found floating in amniotic fluid or the placenta .
Scientists even have learned to reprogram certain cells to behave like stem cells .
But even researchers who work with varying types consider embryonic stem cells the most flexible and thus most promising form — and say that science , not politics , should ultimately judge .
Finally , from the New York Times :
Obama ’s announcement is not likely to lead to any immediate change in government policy , since it may take many months for the National Institutes of Health to develop new guidelines for research .
Still , research advocates are expected to push for the process to go as quickly as possible to ensure that universities have time to submit grant proposals that can be reviewed and accepted before September 2010 , when the health institutes must commit the last of the $ 10.4 billion given to the N.I.H. as part of the economic stimulus program .

Some 118 artists from 24 countries used the wall - the " anti- fascist protection barrier " in the argot of the socialist rulers of the German Democratic Republic - as a canvas upon which to paint their farewell to the regime which erected it back in 1961 .
It now ranks with the Brandenburg Gate and the Holocaust Memorial as a must - see icon for tourists to the city .

Roger Rufe , Homeland Security ’s head of operations , wants to further erode the Second Amendment .
Rufe told lawmakers more restrictive gun control and law enforcement may be needed in the Southwest United States in response to the drug war in Mexico , according to the Associated Press .
According to Congress and the DHS , the Second Amendent and the right to gun ownership is at the root of Mexican drug cartel violence .
Rufe also said protecting border may require “ deploying military personnel and equipment to the region if other agencies are overwhelmed . ”
He did not specify what circumstances would trigger a call for troops .
“ We would take all resources short of DoD ( Defense Department ) and National Guard troops before we reach that tipping point , ” Rufe told lawmakers on a House homeland security subcommittee .
“ We very much do not want to militarize our border . ”
Democrats joined the chorus rallying against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
In order to solve the problem of violence associated with the drug cartel war in Mexico , Rep. John Tierney ( D - Mass ) said during a House subcommittee hearing on Thursday that the government should think about imposing further restrictions on the Second Amendment .
“ Let ’s examine our gun laws , let ’s cut down on U.S. drug consumption , let ’s ask there to be more resources to root out drug money laundering , ” said Tierney .
Instead , we should examine the role of the U.S. government in the illegal drug trade .
As former DEA agent Cele Castillo has told Alex Jones on numerous occasions , the DEA and CIA are intimately involved in drug smuggling .
Castillo has “ personally witnessed CIA drug smuggling operations funneled through terrorists that were also involved in kidnappings and the training of death squads on behalf of the U.S. government , ” writes Michael Webster for the American Chronicle .
Evidence of this surfaced on September 24 , 2008 , when a Grumman Gulfstream II jet crashed near Cancun , Mexico with 4 tons of cocaine onboard .
The plane had the same registration number as a CIA transport plane used to ferry prisoners to Guantanamo Bay between 2003 and 2005 .
CIA involvement in cocaine trafficking in partnership with the Contras was so rampant in the 1980s that the CIA ’s Inspector General Fred Hitz was obliged to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence admitting as much .
In 1999 , it was estimated by the Department of Justice that that $ 100 billion in drug funds were laundered in the U.S. each year .
Catherine Austin Fitts , the former Assistant Secretary of Housing under Bush Senior , placed the figure at $ 250 to $ 300 billion ( see Fitts ’ Narco - Dollars for Beginners :
How the Money Works in the Illicit Drug Trade ) .
Others place the figure closer to $ 1 trillion annually .
In this clip from Kevin Booth ’s American Drug War , the former head of the DEA , Robert Bonner , admits the CIA smuggles drugs into the United States .
So important are illicit drug profits for Wall Street and the banksters , Richard Grasso , Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange , to flew to Colombia in 1999 to meet with a spokesperson for Raul Reyes of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia ( FARC ) , the supposed “ narco terrorists . ”
It was explained at the time that Grasso was dispatched “ to bring a message of cooperation from U.S. financial services ” and discuss foreign investment and the future role of U.S. businesses in Colombia .
In fact , as a Wall Street mob boss , Grasso was talking with the Marxist FARC in order to keep to the circulation of cocaine bucks surging through Wall Street financial institutions .
In February , the United Nation ’s Office on Drugs and Crime Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa told an Austrian magazine that drug money has been the only thing that has kept many major banks in business .
“ In many instances , drug money is currently the only liquid investment capital , ” said Costa .
In 2008 , the U.S. Justice Department opened an investigation into money transfers conducted by Wachovia bank .
It is alleged that Wachovia transferred funds from drug deals in the United States to Mexican and Columbian money - exchange houses , or casas de cambio .
It is not only Wachovia , however , that is suspected of laundering money for the drug cartels .
American Express International Bank , Bank Atlantic , the Union Bank of California , the Sigue Corp. and others , according to the Justice Department , have resolved cases of money laundering to avoid federal prosecution .
The Mexican Attorney General ’s office says many of the casas de cambio are part of an elaborate system which funnels drug money through U.S. banks , on to European banks and then back to the U.S. and Latin America ( see The Banking Industry ’s Dirty Little Secret : Money Laundering For The Drug Cartels ) .
[ efoods ]
If Rep. John Tierney was sincerely interested in ending drug money laundering , he would take his investigation to Wall Street .
Of course , if he did that , he would likely be the victim of an unfortunate accident .
But then the idea here is not to put an end to the lucrative Mexican drug business .
Instead , it is a cynical effort to contrive yet another excuse to chip away at the Second Amendment and take guns away from law - abiding American citizens that have nothing to do with the problem - reaction - solution drug war in Mexico .
Roger Rufe and the Ministry of Homeland Security will eventually call for the deployment of troops but this has nothing to do with ending the violence along the border – or ending illegal immigration for that matter .
“ The State Department recently estimated U.S. - originated guns were used in 95 % of Mexico ’s drug - related killings , ” the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week .
“ Ms. Napolitano has promised a total of $ 45 million more for border protection next year , but it ’s unclear how much of that would be directed toward stemming the flow of guns and money to Mexico . ”
In other words , the problem is not illegal immigration or the bankster spawned drug cartel war in Mexico – the problem for the government and the global elite is the American people , their guns , and archaic belief in the Second Amendment and the Constitution .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
After a week of pointed verbal barbs , host Jon Stewart sat face - to - face with financial analyst Jim Cramer on Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show " and continued the assault Thursday .
Stewart blamed Cramer and cable network CNBC for being irresponsible cheerleaders in the lead - up to the stock market meltdown .
Jim Cramer , left , appears on " The Daily Show " Thursday with host Jon Stewart .
Stewart , whose acerbic brand of satire centers largely on the political news of the day , has held Cramer 's frenetic , nearly cartoonish , stock - advice show , " Mad Money , " and other CNBC programming up as examples of an anything - goes attitude that contributed to the financial collapse .
" I understand you want to make finance entertaining , but it 's not a [ expletive ] game , " Stewart said during the recorded interview , segments of which aired on Thursday night .
" When I watch that , I can't tell you how angry that makes me . "
Stewart 's blistering criticism of Cramer this week has included a censored , two - word phrase he spoke into the camera after airing video of Cramer enthusiastically urging viewers to buy stock in Bear Stearns .
Watch the hard queries for CNBC's Cramer »
The global investment bank and brokerage firm collapsed soon after the comments aired and was eventually sold with stock prices less than one - fifth what they were when Cramer pushed them .
Cramer has fired back .
In a string of interviews with NBC news outlets affiliated with CNBC , Cramer disputed some of Stewart 's claims and noted times he 's made more cautious comments about the economy .
In one interview , he sarcastically feigned distress at being attacked by a comedian and , on an appearance on Thursday 's " The Martha Stewart Show , " pounded a wad of dough with a rolling pin , pretending it was Stewart 's face .
" Mr. Cramer , do n't you destroy enough dough on your own show ... ? "
Stewart said early in the program .
After declaring he 's a " big fan of the show , " Cramer appeared contrite during the interview .
" I think that everyone could come in under criticism because we all should have seen it more , " Cramer said .
" I do n't think anyone should be spared in this environment . "
Cramer pushed back very little in an interview far more serious than most that Stewart conducts .
iReport.com : Stewart ' demolished ' Cramer
He complained when Stewart suggested CNBC 's reporters are " in bed " with Wall Street financiers and said he 's worked with government officials to try to crack down on abuses in the industry .
" Absolutely , there 's shenanigans , and we should call them out , " Cramer said .
" Everyone should .
I should do a better job at it . "
Stewart did call it " unfortunate " that Cramer has become the prime whipping boy in a larger complaint -- " the gap between what CNBC advertises itself as and what it is . "
" We 're both snake - oil salesmen to a certain extent , " Stewart said .
" But we do label it ' snake oil ' here . "

Campaigners hope huge spending packages aimed at easing the slump will spell the first serious attempt to tackle climate change .
But are they as green as billed ?
With governments around the world continuing to pump colossal sums of money into their plunging economies , a grand global experiment is under way : can the unprecedented spending provide not only a quick fix for the economic catastrophe but also the measures vital for dealing with global warming ?
Many hope so , and Barack Obama is foremost among them .
He sees his presidency as a rare moment in history when crisis can be converted into opportunity , and his $ 787bn economic recovery plan is putting that theory to the ultimate test .
His goal is to seize the opportunity to put in place the architecture of a low - carbon and sustainable economy .
Calls for " green new deals " are coming from every part of the world and the US plan presents a case study on an epic scale , one that is being carefully monitored by other governments .
Environment ministers at a United Nations meeting in Nairobi last week saw the US plan as a powerful signal to other governments to raise the green quotient in the next round of recovery plans .
The G20 leading industrialised states will be grappling with those choices when it meets in London in April .
" It is very clear that a lot of countries are watching the green component of the Obama plan because they are very interested in quick wins , " said Ed Barbier , a University of Wyoming economist and author of a United Nations Environment Programme report on a green recovery .
So how does the US plan stack up ?
American environmentalists are delighted .
" We would never have been able to imagine legislation funding developments on this carte blanche scale , " said Kert Davies , research director of Greenpeace .
" However , now you have an opportunity within this crisis , so let the experiment begin . "
Elsewhere , the verdict is mixed .
The $ 100 bn ( £ 68 bn ) in green measures represents just under 13 % of the total package , falling short of the benchmark set in a recent report led by economist Nick Stern , that green measures should account for 20 % of global economic recovery plans .
It also fails to meet the UN target of 1 % of GDP .
South Korea devoted two - thirds of its $ 36bn recovery package , or about 3 % of its GDP , to green investment .
China allocated about a third of its $ 580 bn recovery plan to green measures , concentrating on energy efficiency .
That is much higher than most European countries .
The green portion of the EU recovery plan comes in a notch higher than the US plan at 14 % .
Germany 's green investments account for 19 % of its plan , but France is spending just 8 % .
There is no green component whatsoever to Poland 's recovery plan , and Italy 's efforts , in its $ 101 bn package , are also negligible , according to a study by the climate change centre for excellence at HSBC .
" I suspect that one reason some governments , including European ones , are reluctant to adopt green stimulus initiatives is they are still stuck in the ' old school ' thinking that we have to revive the economy first before thinking about long - term low - carbon strategies , " said Barbier .
However , Stern 's colleague Dimitri Zenghelis , at the Grantham Institute , London , said that it was too early to draw up a definitive green ranking : " We have yet to see the full amounts governments are going to spend to stimulate the economy . "
Seen in that context , the American plan comes off well , especially considering the political battle that was waged as the plan moved through Congress .
The green recovery plan was incubated at a liberal thinktank , the Centre for American Progress .
Its founder , John Podesta , was a former White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton and led Obama 's transition team .
The thinktank produced a plan late last year for a green new deal and many of those ideas survived in the 1,100 - page package passed by Congress .
The green elements include :
• funding to insulate domestic and public buildings ;
• tax breaks and loans for solar and wind power firms ;
• investment in a new electric grid ;
• expansion of subways and inter-city trains .
American environmentalists say it is not worth quibbling about a few percentage points , given the huge sweep of the package and its swift passage .
" The US a year ago was still in denial on issues of energy conservation , " said Earl Blumenauer , a Congressman from Oregon and a champion of the environment .
Nick Robins , who heads the climate change centre at HSBC , argues the plan more than makes up in breadth what it lacks in total spending levels : " It gives a very , very comprehensive stimulus to the green economy across the key pillars : renewables , building efficiency , auto vehicle efficiency , mass transit and water . "
The American plan also meets Stern 's other prescriptions for an effective green stimulus - a concentration on building efficiency and renewable energy .
Efficiency measures , such as insulation , sealing , and double glazing , account for the largest share of the $ 100 bn .
It is also thought to score well on its most basic purpose : rapid job creation .
It is projected to create 2 m jobs over the next two years , half of the 4m total envisaged by the package .
Congress , in giving shape to Obama 's proposals , was adamant that programmes should be ready to go within the two - year deadline .
But that meant that some of the most transformative measures - modernising the electrical grid and developing electric cars - were scaled back because the institutions involved could not handle such vast sums of money in a short timeframe .
There are other gaps .
Davies would have liked to have seen estimates of the emissions reductions promised by each measure in the package .
In Washington , the plan is often described as a down payment on the new green economy .
Ultimate success will depend on whether Congress manages to push through legislation expected this year in three areas : expanding public transport , developing wind and solar energy and moving to cap carbon dioxide emissions .
" You ca n't just flip a switch on the green economy , " said David Foster , director of the Blue - Green Alliance , which combines trade unions and environmental groups .
" But if we do all three , in addition to the down payment , we will be well down the road to getting the green economy really roaring . "
As vast sums of money begin to flow into the US economy , and other governments prepare to commit even more , observers around the world will be watching closely to see whether saving the economy can , in fact , also save the planet .

Sweet and Spicy Candied Bacon Recipe
Ingredients
2.5 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ - 1 teaspoon black pepper ( depends how spicy you want it )
1 lb thick - cut bacon ( about 10 - 12 slices )
To make
1 . Place your oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 °F .
2 . In a small bowl , sift together the brown sugar , cayenne , and black pepper .
3 . Place a broiler rack over a baking sheet ( in a pinch , foil will also work ) .
Spread out the bacon slices on the rack trying to keep them from overlapping .
Place in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes .
4. Remove from the oven and flip the slices .
Sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly over the slices , using a brush or the back of a spoon to rub into the meat .
5 . Return to the oven for another 10 to 30 minutes until the bacon is crisp and deep golden .
Transfer to paper towels and serve hot .
I 'm afraid I do n't have a very pretty photo for you today .
I made this for breakfast on Sunday to go along with some pumpkin challah French toast and we were already down to the last two strips when I decided I wanted to snag a shot for the blog .
Unfortunately , the battery in my camera was dying and only gave me enough time to get this one ( sorta - blurry ) picture .
Fuzzy or not , I think it gets the point across .
The point in question is bacon of course .
Crisp , perfectly cooked bacon with , well ... a little bit of a twist .
It 's salty .
It 's sweet .
It 's spicy .
It 's bacon that wakes up in your mouth and makes you go " oh ! " and then seconds later , after that second wave of flavor hits you feel yourself go " oh ! " yet again .
This recipe originally came from a 2006 issue ofmagazine , but I kicked up the spices a bit ( as I 'm wont to do ) .
It does n't require a lot of effort and the results are positively decadent ; just perfect for a Sunday morning !
I have always maintained on this Blog and elsewhere that there is a difference between Jews and zionists .
The following photos are proof of that .
Over 1,000 New York Jews demonstrated in front of the Word zionist Organisation and Jewish Agency against Israel ’s policies in Gaza .
It was a 24 hour long demonstration ( still going on as I write this ) .

how do you spot an alien ?
The first step to figuring out if we found alien life is to define what we mean by living .
Today , as we ’re searching for life on Mars and are thinking about sending probes to a number of possible habitats in the outer solar system , we lament that robots can only do so much and it would take a human to find and recognize an alien organism .
But is that really true ?
Would humans really do a better job of identifying alien life than robot probes ?
After all , we need to keep in mind that no one has ever seen an alien creature and none of us have any idea what an extraterrestrial microbe or bacterium would look like .
Let ’s say that we land a robot on Europa and manage to slip a submarine into the ocean under its icy shell .
Some bizarre being no one has ever seen before swims up to the camera .
Well that would be pretty cut and dry .
It ’s living in an alien ocean , it moves , it ’s active , so it ’s obviously an extraterrestrial organism .
However , what if the only living things in that ocean are bacteria and various slime ?
Maybe it ’s not as warm and active as we think and complex organisms would n’t evolve there .
When we focus our microscopes on them , would we be able to tell what ’s living or what ’s just a collection of organic compounds ?
What does alive mean on a microscopic level ?
Believe it or not , we have a very similar dilemma right here on our planet .
Viruses are abundant and they do a lot of things that all organisms on our world do .
They reproduce , they mutate all the time and they evolve into new and different forms .
However , until they can find a host with the cellular machinery to help them spawn more copies of themselves , they ’re more like a ball of inert biochemical components .
Their outer shells , or capsids , resemble crystals rather than cell walls and the genetic material they use for replication is sometimes like looking back to the very start of evolution , when hereditary materials were being passed by RNA rather than DNA .
It was usually thought that because viruses required other living cells to replicate , they must ’ve evolved after the first microorganisms and persisted because they evolve so quickly .
With their usually tiny genomes , very few repair mechanisms like the ones found in DNA and astounding amounts of copies they make , viruses exemplify natural selection at hyper - speed .
But now , the experts think that viruses could ’ve actually been one of the very first life forms and replicated in other ways until they could interact with other microorganisms .
Their proof is the fact that a typical genome of a complex organism like a human has more viral genetic data that the actual encoding genes we use on a constant basis .
Most DNA on Earth is basically legacy code from a wide variety of primordial and ancient viral mechanisms .
So if we land on another world , start looking around and nothing comes out to greet us , maybe we should focus our efforts on finding alien viruses as they ’re replicating themselves .
It would be a far cry from little green men with ray guns but it would still be an actual , living alien .
Albeit living by technical definition only .

( Adds details on relationship with Ford ; Pickens comment )
WASHINGTON , March 11 ( Reuters ) - AT&T Inc T.N will spend $ 565 million over 10 years to replace or buy about 15,000 vehicles in its corporate fleet with cars and other vehicles that run on alternative fuels , the company said on Wednesday .
The telecommunications giant said the investment would be the biggest of its kind by a U.S. company , with struggling Ford Motor Co F.N a key beneficiary .
AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told the Economic Club of Washington that fleet modernization would significantly lower fuel costs .
The company will buy about 8,000 work vans or technician trucks that run on compressed natural gas over five years -- to be built by Ford .
“ Natural gas is cheaper , cleaner and we have plenty of it here domestically , ” Stephenson said in comments prepared for delivery to the meeting .
AT&T also plans to replace 7,100 other vehicles with hybrids and other advanced technology power systems over 10 years .
The hybrids will include a combination of gas-electric and plug-ins , and the trial includes mostly those made by Ford , with some from Toyota Motor Corp 7203 .
TTM.N , according to Tim Harden , president of supply chain at the company .
T. Boone Pickens , a Texas billionaire oilman who has promoted the use of natural gas , praised AT&T ’s actions .
In a statement , Pickens said it was a “ demonstration of real American corporate leadership that will be good for their bottom line , the environment and the country . ”

According to the ICRC , four infant children were found too weak to stand after clinging for 48 hours to what ambulance crew believed to be the corpses of their mothers while Israeli soldiers were less than 100 yards away .
And I take it from the Wall Street Journal piece you wrote last week ... well , the piece is just specifically about measuring multipliers , but I take it that you are fairly skeptical in general that fiscal policy will boost aggregate demand .
Right .
There 's a big difference between tax rate changes and things that look just like throwing money at people .
Tax rate changes have actual incentive effects .
And we have some experience with those actually working .
What would you say is the best empirical evidence there ?
Well , you know , it worked to expand GDP for example in ' 63 and ' 64 with the Kennedy / Johnson cuts .
And then Reagan twice in ' 81 and ' 83 and then in ' 86 .
And then the Bush 2003 tax - cutting program .
Those all worked in the sense of promoting economic growth in a short time frame .
I 'm the middle of a study where I am trying to estimate this overall , going back to 1913 -- sort of constructing some measure of the overall effect of the tax rate at the margin , at the moment .
I 'm just looking at that now , actually ...
You 're talking about the multiplier on a dollar of ...
Well both things , but here I 'm talking about the tax rate stuff .
Get some measure of the effect of marginal tax rate that comes from the government -- federal , state , local .
And then you can see what it looks like going down or going up and how the economy responds .
And then , in addition to that , the government might be spending more or less money on either military stuff or not on military stuff .
And we can estimate that at the same time .
With the government spending stuff , the clearest evidence is in wartime .
It 's not that it 's the most pertinent , but it 's the clearest in terms of evidence because it 's the dominating evidence at those times , especially during the world wars .
Do you read Paul Krugman 's blog ?
Just when he writes nasty individual comments that people forward .
Oh , well he wrote a series of posts saying he thought the World War II spending evidence was not good , for a variety of reasons , but I guess ...
He said elsewhere that it was good and that it was what got us out of the depression .
He just says whatever is convenient for his political argument .
He does n't behave like an economist .
And the guy has never done any work in Keynesian macroeconomics , which I actually did .
He has never even done any work on that .
His work is in trade stuff .
He did excellent work , but it has nothing to do with what he 's writing about .
I 'm not in a position to ...
No , of course not .
I 'm not in a position to know things like the degree to which Paul Krugman counts as a relevant expert on new Keynesian economics .
He has n't done any work on that .
Greg Mankiw has worked in that area .
And Greg Mankiw is , I guess , skeptical of spending for the same reasons that you are : he says that there 's some empirical evidence -- I think he cites the Christina Romer study from 15 years ago -- that a dollar of tax cutting has a larger impact than ...
The Romer evidence is very recent actually .
It 's an ongoing project .

Thai police have erected fake crash sites , like the one above , as a drunk driving deterrent .
They 're intended to frighten locals out of drinking and driving .
Hmm , works for us .

Anheuser will have to rely on trademark laws in individual states
Brewer Anheuser - Busch has lost an appeal to a European Union court to use the term Budweiser across Europe .
It is a victory for the Czech brewer Budejovicky Budvar , which said it had registered the name in France , Austria and the former Czechoslovakia in 1958 .
A European court backed Budvar in December last year after US - based Anheuser applied for an EU trademark .
This ruling is the latest instalment of a long - running dispute between the two brewers stretching back decades .
Six years ago , Anheuser lost a case to stop Budvar selling beer in the UK under the Budweiser name .
In the latest hearing , the European Court of First Instance upheld a 2007 decision by the EU 's trademark agency , saying Budejovicky Budvar had already legally registered the name in several EU countries .
Anheuser , therefore , could not be allowed an EU - wide trademark .
The brewer is still free to sell beer using the Budweiser name under trademark agreements it holds with individual countries .
Budejovicky Budvar was founded in 1895 in Ceske Budejovice , which was known as Budweis by its German - speaking inhabitants .
Beer has been brewed there since 1265 .
Budweiser was first produced in St Louis in 1852 and was America 's first national beer brand .
Anheuser - Busch has now been renamed Anheuser - Busch - Inbev after a $ 52bn takeover by Belgian - Brazilian brewer Inbev .
A New Approach to the Functional Design of a Digital Computer by R. S. Barton , 1961 .
The present methods of determining the functional design of computers are critically reviewed and a new approach proposed .
This is illustrated by explaining , in abstracted form , part of the control organization of a new and different machine based , in part , on the ALGOL 60 language .
The concepts of expression and procedure lead directly to the use of a Polish string program .
A new arrangement of control registers results , which provides for automatic allocation of temporary storage within expressions and procedures , and a generalized subroutine linkage .
The simplicity and power of these notions suggests that there is much room for improvement in present machines and that more attention should be given to control functions new designs .

SACRAMENTO —
After months of heated negotiations and with California on the brink of insolvency , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders have nearly completed a deal to erase the state ’s giant budget deficit with a mix of tax increases , spending cuts and borrowing .
A vote that would end one of the most contentious and costly stalemates in state history is expected Friday .
Though details are still emerging , the plan to close the state ’s $ 40 billion shortfall through mid-2010 includes a series of tax increases and program cuts , as well as a cap on state spending that would go before voters in a special election later this year .
The proposal would raise the sales tax by 1 cent on the dollar , nearly double the vehicle license fee that motorists pay annually , increase taxes on gasoline by 12 cents a gallon and impose a 2.5 percent surcharge on personal income taxes .
Spending on most state programs — from public schools and universities to health and human service programs for the poor — would be cut by billions of dollars .
The plan would need to pass by two - thirds majorities in the Assembly and Senate , a hurdle that has frustrated negotiations for months .
But GOP leaders indicated that they have lined up the minimum number of votes from their members to reach the two - thirds threshold .
The tax measures would be temporary and tied to the fate of a ballot measure curbing the growth of state spending .
If voters approve the spending cap , the new taxes would remain in effect for five years ; otherwise , they would go away after two years .
That Republican - driven provision is meant to create a disincentive for Democratic interests to try to defeat the spending cap at the ballot box .
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , also indicated Wednesday that the package includes a tax break of at least several hundred million dollars for corporations with extensive out - of - state business .
In a potential boon to the high - tech and biotech industries , it would ease the state tax burden for companies with significant sales outside California .
Companies that operate exclusively within the state would not benefit .
Proponents say the break would make the state more inviting for large corporations to set up shop in , but critics counter that the state ca n’t afford tax cuts given the deficit .
In another concession to win GOP votes , the pending compromise includes some , but not all , of the environmental and labor concessions that Republicans sought , Steinberg said .
While he would not offer specifics until the deal is formally announced , some ideas broached in the past included easing rules requiring meal breaks for workers in hourly jobs and delaying implementation of regulations to curb diesel emissions .
The plan relies almost equally on spending cuts and tax increases to close the deficit — $ 15.1 billion in cuts and $ 14.3 billion in new revenue — as well as $ 10.9 billion in borrowing .
Funding for schools and community colleges would drop by $ 8.6 billion , by far the largest single spending reduction .
Cost - of - living increases would be denied for welfare recipients and for the aged , blind and disabled ; those savings , along with other cuts , would be more than $ 1 billion .
And spending on state universities would be pared by $ 890 million .
The proposal would require state employees to continue to take off two Fridays a month without pay through summer 2010 , and it would eliminate two of 14 paid state holidays .
But the mass layoffs Schwarzenegger threatened this week would be avoided .
Voters also will be asked to approve borrowing $ 5 billion against future lottery revenue — an unpopular idea , polling shows .
The state intends as well to take out a $ 5.5 billion loan , an uncertain prospect given the state of the credit markets .
If California receives enough money from the federal stimulus package approved Wednesday , the state would forgo the $ 5.5 billion loan .
Officials also expect the federal money to alleviate the need for roughly $ 1 billion in proposed spending cuts and $ 1.8 billion in tax increases .
If the budget plan is approved , Santa Clara County ’s sales tax rate would increase to 9.25 percent from 8.25 percent .
Motorists would have to pay 1.15 percent of their vehicle ’s value to the state each year , up from 0.65 percent currently .
And prices at the gas pump would jump 12 cents a gallon .
Although both of the Democratic legislative leaders involved in the talks and a spokesman for Schwarzenegger all cautioned that a deal was not final , the remaining differences appear to be relatively minor .
“ They are making progress ; they ’re getting close , ” said Aaron McLear , the governor ’s spokesman .
Steinberg said some “ loose ends ” still need to be resolved but that the parties had reached “ a common framework . ”
And the office of Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Los Angeles , said in a memo that while leaders have made “ enormous strides ” toward a deal , “ there is no final agreement . ”
At least three Republicans in both the Senate and Assembly would have to vote for the package , risking a backlash among conservatives .
All but one Republican lawmaker have signed a pledge vowing not to raise taxes .
Still , Senate GOP leader Dave Cogdill , R - Fresno , told fellow Republicans during a briefing Friday that the deal being negotiated is n’t going to get any better .

Police said that because of the possibility of arson each case has to be treated as a possible homicide .
After he was briefed at the fire scene yesterday a grim Prime Minister Kevin Rudd warned Australians to brace for more bad news when the true picture of the devastation is revealed .
Police Disaster Victim Identification teams are moving in to begin the process of formally identifying the bodies .
PHOTOS : Victoria 's horror
DVI units from around Australia are flying into Melbourne as a national disaster plan , designed to respond to a terrorist attack , is invoked .
Police say the intense heat means some victims have been effectively cremated and can only be identified through jewellery or circumstantial evidence .
The teams have a formal checklist to complete to try and prove the identity of those who have died .
The unprecedented number of victims means identification will take several days .
Priority will be given to victims found in cars on roads , so those areas can be reopened .
Then the teams will move to damaged and destroyed farms and houses .
Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon urged the public to be patient .
" This will take some time .
We will do this as fast as we can so that people can return to their properties , but it is a complex matter and we must be accurate , " she said .
Ms Nixon said that because of the possibility of arson each fatality had to be treated as a possible homicide case and each site as a crime scene .
Homicide squad police would also be used in the exhaustive police investigation .
Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe said an offender implicated in the fatal fires could be charged with the homicide - related offence of arson causing death - a crime with a maximum penalty of 25 years ' jail .
But anyone who lit a fire that resulted in several deaths would be charged multiple counts .
An arsonist responsible for a fatal fire in Saturday 's conditions could be charged with the alternative offence of reckless murder that carries a possible life sentence .
Mr Walshe said that anyone who was found to have caused the fires through stupidity would also be charged with recklessly causing a bushfire that has a maximum jail term of 15 years .
Advisors to the police 's forensic services department said it would be a long time before many of the bodies can be identified .
Investigators must comb vast areas of remote , burnt - out bushland in the hope of finding remains .
When asked how long it would take , advisor Greg Hough said : " Imagine drawing a line across a third of Victoria and and try and estimate how long it would take you to find gold rings in that area .
" Potentially the only indicators could be jewellery and teeth , it depends on how bad it is . ''
Mr Hough , who worked on body identification during the Bali bombings and Boxing Day tsunami , said investigators faced dangers from the fragile nature of the structures they had to comb through as well as fallen and burnt out trees .
" It will all be very time - consuming , '' he said .
" Wherever there is report of a deceased person , forensic investigators will go and the scene has to be photographed and recorded and the human remains recovered .
That can take considerable time . ''

I have discovered that there is small but budding group of cognitive scientists who study the psychological impact of indoor plants .
For example , here is a study on the effects of an indoor plant on creativity and mood from the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology .
Effects of an indoor plant on creative task performance and mood .
Shibata S , Suzuki N. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology .
2004 Nov;45(5):373-81 .
In this study , we investigated the effect of an indoor plant on task performance and on mood .
Three room arrangements were used as independent variables : a room with ( 1 ) a plant , or ( 2 ) a magazine rack with magazines placed in front of the participants , or ( 3 ) a room with neither of these objects .
Undergraduate students ( M= 35 , F= 55 ) performed a task of associating up to 30 words with each of 20 specified words in a room with one of the three room arrangements .
Task performance scores showed that female participants performed better in view of the plant in comparison to the magazine rack ( p < 0.05 ) .
Moreover , mood was better with the plant or the magazine rack in the room compared to the no object condition ( p < 0.05 ) .
However , the difference in task performance was highly influenced by the evaluation about the plant or the magazine rack .
It is suggested that the compatibility between task demand and the environment is an important factor in facilitating task performances .
Somehow , I feel my world view has not actually changed after reading that study .
But wait , there are also published research studies on :
Effects of the foliage plant on task performance and mood .
Effects of indoor plants on task performance and mood : a comparison between natural and imitated plants .
Influence of limitedly visible leafy indoor plants on the psychology , behavior , and health of students at a junior high school in Taiwan .

for your version of An Owned Life .
Is there such a thing as the right One ( one ) ?
I hear many who come into this lifestyle who are seeking that right person .
To me , this is a loaded question which necessitates some unraveling .
As with anything in theworld , there are many facets to explore .
The first is in the area of romance .
Are you getting into this lifestyle with another person or are you presently in a committed relationship which you are looking to expand ?
This is an important matter .
If you already found the one with whom you have that heart connection , then that aspect of the relationship is taken care of .
However , there are those who seekas a way to fulfill that void in one 's life .
This can be a risky proposition since there are many involved in BDSM who arent seeking that committed one - on - one relationship .
This is something that one should look at before getting into this way of life .
Another thing to explore is the different personalities you come across .
Just because
One is a Dom does not mean that person is the right Dom for you .
There is more to a relationship than sex and play .
What are the similarities that you both share ?
Is there a common ground that you both share ?
Are you seeking 24/7 when the other person is looking for a " playmate " ( or vice versa ) ?
Look are these issues to resolve what your desires are .
The final point I want to mention is the concept of " test driving " .
We do it with cars .
The same is true for clothing .
In the traditional world , a test drive is commonly referred to as " dating " .
How many people marry the first person they ever go out with ?
Very few .
Most try out different people before settling with the one whom they make a life commitment to .
Of course , half the time that ends in divorce thus making the marriage a test drive .
My point is that the first Dom might not be the best one for you .
It is not uncommon for people to be involved with different people over the years .
There are personality conflicts to take into account .
Also , one must consider the experience of the other person .
I have seen instances where a sub needed more than a Dom could give over time .
She grew , he did not .
Hey , it happens .
The idea is to enjoy the time you have and to find what makes you happy .
As I like to say , this is not a " one size fits all " .
Amazon.com launched a used game sales service today where gamers can trade in used games for store credit .
And Toys ‘R
Us is also starting to test sales of used games in its stores .
Best Buy is as well .
The Amazon news prompted a 14 percent drop in GameStop ’s stock price today , falling $ 3.84 a share to $ 23.46 .
That ’s because GameStop gets about 25 percent of its sales from used games .
The practice draws the ire of game industry professionals and game publishers , who feel the retailers are n’t sharing enough of the profits with them .
It ’s particularly irksome because GameStop pays high prices for recent games and thereby blunts the sales of brand new games .
Game publishers and developers only get a cut of the brand new game sales , so they feel like they ’re being robbed by the likes of GameStop .
That feeling is only going to worsen now .
Retailers of games are clearly trying to pad the bottom line during the recession .
In tough economic times , consumers are far more likely to buy used games than to pay as much as $ 60 for full price new ones .
There are likely to be consequences .
Smaller used game players such as Dawdle are going to have to be quick on their feet to adjust to the new environment .
Consumers may like having new ways to get cheaper games in more places .
But the game retailers had better consider the long - term costs .
In the short term , they can make more money .
But in the long run , it wo n’t pay to hurt the game publishers and developers .
And it will only hasten the move to digital distribution that will leave retail out in the cold .

Were the election officials who allegedly manipulated votes on e-voting machines in Clay County , KY , Republican or Democratic ?
And does it actually make any difference ?...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/23/2009 , 4:09 pm PT
Since I first covered the story of the arrest of election officials ( including a circuit court judge , the county clerk , the school superintendent and other members of the county elections board ) in Clay County , KY , for buying and selling votes , as well as manipulating votes on electronic voting machines without the knowledge of voters , folks have been asking about the political affiliation of the conspirators and whether they were working on behalf of any particular political party .
The subject came up , as well , while I was on the Mike Malloy Show last Friday discussing these arrests , as they had just come to light .
You can download the MP3 of that interview , or listen to it online here ( appx. 17 mins ) ...
While the federal indictment [ PDF ] notes that a number of those involved in the cabal appear to be members of the local Democratic Party , the scheme also involved at least one conspirator who served as the Republican Party 's polling place judge at one of the precincts .
Clay County is also a heavily Republican county .
On this point , a commenter who wrote in to respond to last week 's article , who claims to be " from Clay County " and to know " each of the people arrested , " writes that " ALL of the eight arrested this week " were actually Republican .
" They registered as Democrat and took leadership roles in the local party to control precinct officer seats , ensuring all officers at the precinct were hand picked . "
I can't yet confirm that fact , but that reader 's comment is posted in full below , with another one from a Kentucky writer , as both contain some helpful background .
Of course , it could still very well be the case that the crooks were Democrats at work .
Either way , from what I 'm able to understand about the scheme so far , it seems that it was more about personal power and financial enrichment than anything else .
If they were Democrats , they do n't seem to have been particularly successful in affecting Democratic wins in their county , even though their scheme was " successful " enough to be repeated election after election and year after year .
At the heart of their scheme , after all , was bribing money out of candidates in order to be placed on a " slate " that the cabal would then help to get elected .
As the commenter suggests , it could well be that these " Democratic " officials were only signed up as such in order to affect primary elections ( in order to ensure the weakest possible " D " candidate , for example ) or even in hopes of adversely affecting general elections as " Democrats , " secretly working on behalf of the Republican Party .
I 've been unable to learn the party affiliations , yet , of the candidates who paid to be on their " slate , " which , once we learn that , could be somewhat instructive .
Maybe .
But until then , a major point that I 'd to make in any case : I do n't really care what their party affiliations were .
Here 's why ...
Whomever these folks were representing , Rs , Ds , or just themselves , they were violating the democratic ( small " d " ) rights of voters in Clay County and , more disturbingly , had concocted a new way to exploit electronic voting systems --- by taking " low - tech " advantage of a poorly devised user interface on the touch - screen voting machines --- in order to do so .
( NOTE : I hope to have more soon on how their scheme worked , and why it 's so troubling , in the near future .
And no , the same scheme to change the votes of voters without their knowledge , a major aspect of the alleged crimes , could not have happened the same way with paper ballots , as some , like this blogger , have suggested .
At least not in a way that would make detection as difficult , and allow them to continue the scheme without being caught for so long , over so many elections , before being caught . )
Nonetheless , for the moment , on the political issues at play here , I 'd like to defer to a couple of comments left by readers of last Thursday 's article .
One is from the person I mentioned above , who claims to be " from Clay County , " who says they " knew each of the people arrested . "
The other is from " someone who grew up in that part of the country . "
I believe both comments may be instructive here , as to understanding the underlying political environment at work in Clay County .
Both of the comments underscore , in their own ways , how the known political affiliations of the accused bad guys are n't necessarily indicative of much of anything .
They point out how , in this case , " party is irrelevant , " as one of the commenters writes , not just in regard to the disturbing revelations of the ability to undetectably exploit the electronic voting system to compromise elections by any party or election insider , as I mention above , but more to the cultural background issues at play in this particular part of rural Kentucky .
Party affiliations , both commenters suggest , do n't necessarily have the same meaning there that many of us likely understand them as meaning in different parts of the country .
As reader " Mark " wrote :
A little background from someone who grew up in that part of the country :
The party is irrelevant .
Many , if not most rural Kentucky counties are registered 95 % one party or the other .
It 's a self perpetuating system , if you grew up there , you register the majority party because all the elections are decided in the primary elections .
Many counties do in fact have competitive elections , the " reform " factions and " status quo " factions operate under the same party registration .
At the local level , there 's very little ( if any ) ideological difference in the Republican and Democratic counties , it 's really just a name .
Frequently , the ruling faction has control over the party apparatus of the other party , which makes it easier to control an election because you can field both election judges in a given precinct .
School superintendents are extremely powerful in rural Kentucky .
In the more corrupt counties , it 's a powerful position of political patronage , frequently the biggest employer in a poor , small county .
I do n't think it 's an elected position , but appointed by the school board .
That 's why some of the most highly contested elections are for school board .
[ ed note :
One of the conspirators arrested was , in fact , the local school superintendent .

I think Clay is a Republican County .
I 've seen this pattern repeated many times in rural Kentucky , and as i've said before , party affiliation is completely irrelevant .
And , even more directly to the point , from reader " CCKY " :
I am from Clay County , Kentucky and know each of the people arrested .
I also knew the officials previously convicted who are in prison now ( former mayor Daugh White , former county Clerk Jennings White , former Asst.
Chief of Police Todd Roberts , former 911 Director Vernon Hacker , former Manchester Fire Dept. Chief Charles " Dobber " Weaver , and former city councilman Darnell Hipshire ) .
There will likely be more to follow the current group arrested .
Clay County is roughly 90 percent Republican , including ALL of the eight arrested this week .
They registered as Democrat and took leadership roles in the local party to control precinct officer seats , ensuring all officers at the precinct were hand picked .
Notice that all of the elections in question are PRIMARY elections .
It 's common knowledge that if you win the Republican primary in Clay County you will win the general election .
If you want just check the political registration of the county and the party affiliation of current and former elected officials .
I ca n't attest to the guilt or innocence of any of those most recently arrested but I know for a fact that Clay County is very much a Republican county .
By the way , Jennings White 's attorney prior to his guilty plea was David Williams , the Republican President of the Kentucky Senate .
Look it up .
It 's all public record .

CORRECTION 3/24/09 : I had originally linked to Brian 's coverage at Incertus , as an example of someone who had suggested that the election fraud at the polls in Clay County " could not have happened the same way with paper ballots . "
I had meant to link to Jeremy 's article at Abqorida instead , where he had incorrectly argued : " Paper ballots would n't help - the same types of vote buying and stealing can happen with paper ballots . "
I 've substitued one link for another in the appropriate graf above by way of correction .
After my mistake , Brian had subsequently written a new article at Incertus which helped to point out my error .
All of which reminds me how confusing it can get when using computers , and why they should never be used in American democracy ( " paper receipt " or otherwise , Brian ! )
Apologies to Brian for my error and accidental mischaracterization of his original post in the above .
I really started to notice it starting in 3E D&D , and it ’s become even more prevalent in 4E .
Adventures for D&D are breaking down to a collection of encounters .
That ’s the way the DMG addresses adventure creation , that ’s the way the majority of the published adventures are written , and that ’s the way I ’ve been thinking about creating adventures .
What ’s wrong with that ?
Nothing , really .
But it does encourage a specific type of thinking about adventure construction , and that in turn shapes the type of game play you get in that adventure .
Let ’s start with some definitions of terms .
According to the DMG :
An encounter is a single scene in an ongoing drama , when the player characters come up against something that impedes their progress .
p. 34
Also according to the DMG :
An adventure is just a series of encounters .
How and why these encounters fit together – from the simplest to the most complex – is the framework for any adventure .
p. 94
For contrast , I ’m going to be talking about White Wolf ‘s SAS adventure structure .
Here ’s what they say about scenes in their SAS Guide pdf :
Each scene is built as a discrete game encounter ( or a closely - tied collection of game encounters ) for the troupe to play through .
p. 2
And here ’s what they say about their adventures :
Think of a Storytelling Adventure System product ( SAS ) as a story kit …
The basic parts that make up most SAS stories are simple : Storyteller characters , scenes and some advice on how you can put them together .
p. 2
So much for contrast , huh ?
They both seem to say pretty much the same thing .
Except they do n’t , really .
D&D focuses on encounters , challenges for the characters to face , things that cause them to struggle .
Whether it ’s a combat or non-combat encounter , it is a point of conflict .
White Wolf adventures focus on scenes , which may or may not contain conflict , but that are focused on moving the story ahead .
What difference does this make ?
Well , after my last D&D game , the discussion of the high points were things like how tough a monster was , or what a cool combat that one encounter was .
After my last Hunter : The Vigil game , the discussion was about what a cool NPC the Rag Man was .
It ’s a subtle but profound difference .
By thinking about the basic building blocks of the game – encounters / scenes – differently , a different mindset is created during both adventure creation and play .
In D&D , the focus is on challenges overcome .
In World of Darkness games , the focus is on story progression .
Let me put it another way .
In most D&D games * , the idea of spending an entire session attending a party with minimal dice rolling and no combat would be seen as a very unconventional session .
Not necessarily bad , but different from the normal adventure .
Especially if they did n’t have a mechanically - governed objective in mind **.
In most World of Darkness games , the idea of spending an entire session prowling through the sewers killing monsters and looting their corpses would be seen as a very unconventional session .
Again , it would n’t necessarily be bad , but it would almost certainly be a departure from the norm .
Especially if success ( whatever that means in context ) was based on the number of monsters killed .
Now , there are a number of reasons why this is .
We can talk about genre conventions , the differences in appropriateness of tropes between fantasy and horror , modern versus medieval setting , and target market for the games .
But all these things are focused through the lens of adventure creation , and the way the designers have chosen to address the universal RPG question of , “ What do I do with my character ? ”
D&D is a game about heroic pseudo - medieval fantasy adventure .
World of Darkness games are about dark modern horror stories ***.
The designers have chosen the tools , including the philosophy behind the adventure creation , to focus on the ideas that they feel work best given their respective games .
And in many ways , I feel , the difference between the two is encapsulated in the simple choice of encounter or scene to represent the basic building block of the adventure .
So why am I going on about this ?****
Because I was running into a brick wall designing the next adventure for my Post Tenebras Lux campaign .
Part of the goal was moving away from what my players called the Fight Club design of adventures , giving them more options and more freedom to respond to different situations .
So , I ’ve got a fairly loose , open - ended kind of adventure set up , with a small adventure site and a fair bit of exploration and interaction surrounding it .
I sat down and created the combat encounters , and the traps and skill challenge portions , Â for the adventure in an hour or so , then sat looking blankly at the connecting portions , trying to think how to make the adventure more than just a bunch of strung - together encounters .
So , what to do ?
Well , I ’m stealing from the SAS school of adventure design , along with my years of experience running other games *****.
I ’m putting together a bunch of NPC notes , notes on the locales , little roleplaying scenes that provide story information without conflict , and other things .
I ’m using a very loose flowchart of the the adventure to show how one thing may lead to another , and how different parts interrelate .
And then , I ’m gonna play it by ear , and let the characters set the pace and direction .
I think this will give me what I ’m looking for .
See , I needed to make the mental transition from encounter - based design to scene - based design to make this adventure what I wanted it to be .
Once I did that , I was able to look at the whole setup in a very different way , and see what needed doing to produce the result I wanted .
I want to be very clear about something , though .
I do n’t think that scene - based design is intrinsically superior to encounter - based design .
I do n’t think that D&D is wrong about how they design their games and adventures .
I do n’t think White Wolf games are inherently superior , or that all games should follow their model of adventure design .
What I do think is that we , as GMs and players , need to be aware of the underlying assumptions and design philosophy inherent in the games we play if we want to be able to make them be the games we want .
The design and the system is just the toolkit .
What matters is that , when you sit down to game , you and your friends have fun .
That ’s all .
Â
Â
* Yes , I am generalizing here and , therefor , lying to some degree .
I know that some people have different play styles .
And do n’t worry ; I ’m going to generalize about White Wolf games in the next paragraph .
** This is one of the blessings and curses of the skill challenge rules in D&D .
Now , you can have a whole skill challenge centered around making a good impression at a party , and everyone can roll their dice to do it .
*** Another example of the impact of language : adventure vs. stories .
**** Dude , I ’m at about 750 words , and you ’re just asking this now ?
***** In trying to gain some mastery of the 4E rules , I ’ve been cleaving very close to the party line with adventure creation , doing things by the book .
This has meant ignoring some of the skills at improvising in the middle of a game , or building a very loose structure , that I ’ve picked up in running things like Unknown Armies , Vampire : The Masquerade , and Amber Diceless RPG .

A new way to raise conservation funds has captured attention worldwide .
The Australian Marine Conservation Society ( AMCS ) has auctioned the naming rights of a newly discovered species of shrimp on Ebay .
“ The shrimp is in the group or genus of shrimps known as Lebbeus , but is awaiting the addition of a unique species name , ” said Anna McCallum , a Melbourne scientist who discovered the new species in deep waters off the Southwest coast of Australia .
AMCS describes the new shrimp , which was found 400 meters below the surface , as having a “ jewel - like appearance ”
This unique - looking shrimp awaits a name .
Photo courtesy of Australian Marine Conservation Society .
McCallum concurs , adding that the species is quite unique in appearance .
“ Morphing from yellow to green , this species is covered in scarlet spots and sports a toothed crest across the top of its body , which gives it the appearance of having a mohawk . ”
When the auction ends on April 1st at 9 AM ( Australian Eastern Daylight Standard Time ) the shrimp will have a new name chosen by the highest bidder .
Monies from the auction will go directly to a new campaign by AMCS to protect southwest marine waters in a system of national parks .
Over 80 percent of the species off Australia ’s southwest coast are found no where else in the world .
Name a new species of shrimp from south - west Australia .

In the name of combating child pornography , federal lawmakers are proposing that internet users ' online surfing habits be retained for two years .
The so - called " Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today 's Youth Act of 2009 , " or SAFETY Act , was floated in both the House and Senate on Thursday .
Among other things , it demands : " A provider of an electronic communication service or remote computing service shall retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user . "
In short , if approved , everybody from employers to ISPs to coffee shops and universities would be required to keep logs of all data associated with IP addresses assigned randomly to individual users – from e-mail logins to search queries to sites visited , legal experts said .
" This provides a historical picture of individuals that I think a lot of people think would find creepy , " said Albert Gidari Jr. , a Seattle attorney who successfully defended Google in the government 's bid to acquire billions of customer - search queries .
" When you 're on the phone , there may be a phone record of what you called , but it does n't contain what you said .

The European Union has a similar law directed solely at ISPs .

Act of 1986 , ISPs based in the United States must retain data affixed to an IP address for at least 90 days upon the request of law enforcement .

The measures also open the door for such data to be obtained for private purposes as well , like the Recording Industry Association of America and Motion Picture Association of America in their bids to limit online piracy , Gidari said .

On Tuesday morning Director of National Intelligence , Admiral Dennis Blair , employed the indicative mood in describing the high value that Chas Freeman , his appointee to head the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) , will bring to the job  " his long experience and inventive mind , " for example .
By five o’clock in the afternoon , Freeman announced that he had asked that his selection " not proceed . "
Not one to mince words , Freeman spelled out the strange set of affairs surrounding the flip - flop and the implications of what had just happened .
Borrowing the pointed warning from George Washington ’s Farewell Address against developing a " passionate attachment " to the strategic goals of another nation , Freeman made it clear that he was withdrawing his " previous acceptance " of Blair ’s invitation to chair the NIC because of the character assassination of him orchestrated by the Israel Lobby .
The implications ?
Freeman was clear :
" The outrageous agitation will be seen by many to raise serious questions about whether the Obama administration will be able to make its own decisions about the Middle East and related issues … [ It casts ] doubt on its ability to consider , let alone decide what policies might best serve the United States rather than those of a Lobby intent on enforcing the will and interests of a foreign government
" The aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process through the exercise of a veto over the appointment of people who dispute the wisdom of its views and the exclusion of any and all options for decision by Americans and our government other than those it [ the Lobby ] favors . "
Foreign policy analyst Chris Nelson described the imbroglio as a reflection of the " deadly power game on what level of support for controversial Israeli government policies is a ‘ requirement ’ for U.S. public office . "
Before the flip - flop on Freeman was announced , Nelson warned , " If Obama surrenders to the critics and orders Blair to rescind the Freeman appointment , it is difficult to see how he can properly exercise leverage , when needed , in his conduct of policy in the Middle East .
That , literally , is how the experts see the stakes in the fight now under way . "
The fight is now over .
Schadenfreude
Sen. Chuck Schumer , ( D - New York ) led Lobby boasting just minutes after the Freeman debacle was announced .
Schumer was clear : " His [ Freeman ’s ] statements against Israel were way over the top I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him , and I am glad they did the right thing . "
And , as Glen Greenwald has noted , " Lynch mob leader Jonathan Chait [ of the New Republic and author of a recent Washington Post op - ed on the subject ] , who spent the last week denying that Israel was the driving force behind the attacks on Freeman , " now concedes the obvious .
Greenwald quotes Chait : " Of course I recognize that the Israel Lobby is powerful , and was a key element in the pushback against Freeman . "
Neoconservative Daniel Pipes offered an anatomy of the crime , blog - bragging about how it was conducted :
" What you may not know is that Steven J. Rosen of the Middle East forum was the person who first brought attention [ on February 19 ] to the problematic nature of Freeman ’s appointment Within hours , the word was out and three weeks later Freeman has conceded defeat .
Only someone with Steve ’s stature and credibility could have made this happen . "
The same Steve Rosen ?
The same one who is currently on trial for violations of the Espionage Act involving the transmission of classified information intended for Israel ?
Yes , one and the same !
This has to be the purest brand of gall that ever came down the Pipes .
This " morning after , " I find myself wondering when White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel  another staunch supporter of the Lobby who reportedly was Schumer ’s go - to guy on the get - Freeman campaign  saw fit to let Admiral Blair in on the little secret that no way could he have Freeman .
And why Blair tucked tail .
In a March 8 letter to Admiral Blair , we at Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) endorsed his appointment of Freeman and decried the campaign to derail it .
We seven signatories ( with cumulative experience of 130 years ) noted that the Freeman case was the first time we witnessed such a well - coordinated campaign to reverse the appointment of an official to an intelligence job not requiring Senate confirmation .
In other words the influence of the Israel Lobby is seeping ever deeper into the ranks of the intelligence community .
Military Mindset
It seems altogether possible that Admiral Blair , accustomed to military command authority , assumed he had the right to appoint his senior staff and did not think to check out the naming of Freeman with White House and other politicians hypersensitive to pressure from the Lobby .
And this points up a host of other problems .
One is that of having military officers , active or retired , running national intelligence .
It appears to be beyond their ken to consider resigning on principle .
I imagine it never occurred to Blair that he might have quit on the spot as soon as he learned that Freeman was being jettisoned a couple of hours after Blair had praised him to the skies ; or that , earlier , he might have threatened to resign if the Obama administration let itself be bullied in this way .
Blair is no neophyte , but he clearly underestimated the Lobby ’s power compared with his own .
It appears the White House told Blair to treat the Freeman appointment as though in the subjunctive mood  long enough to " run it up the flagpole and see who salutes , " as the saying goes .
Then , when the Lobby made sure there were no salutes , but rather the strongest and most scurrilous spitting , Freeman was hauled on down .
That may be the way they do things in Chicago , as well as in Washington .
The Freeman flip - flop is merely the latest sign that Obama is afraid to take on the Lobby .
But the world is watching the new president .
Most will interpret the new president ’s acquiescence in this charade as a sign of weakness  of his not being his own man .
This is a distinct liability as Obama prepares to meet next month with the likes of Vladimir Putin who will be taking his measure .
The encounter with Putin brings to mind another young president ’s first meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961 .
Khrushchev had studied the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs in April 1961 ; he would have understood if Kennedy had chosen either to leave Castro alone or to destroy him .
When Kennedy was rash enough to approve a strike on Cuba but not bold enough to finish the job , in Khrushchev ’s view , the latter decided he was dealing with an inexperienced young leader who could be intimidated and blackmailed  one who would shrink from hard decisions .
Kennedy later said of his encounter with Khrushchev in Vienna , " He beat the hell out of me . "
The meeting gave him to believe that Kennedy might well back down if the USSR put missiles in Cuba .
As for Israel , the Russians were better able to understand Washington ’s " passionate attachment " to Israel in strategic terms , as the Cold War played out in the Middle East and Washington had a perceived need to have Israel as a permanent " battleship " there .
Now the Russians see the power of the Israel Lobby for what it is  who can miss it ?
The Obama administration is seen as caving under political pressure .
Although the Russians continue to be amazed at the Lobby ’s strong influence over U.S. policy , the Russians are happy as clams to sit back and watch as the identification of the U.S. with Israeli policy inflicts incalculable damage to U.S. interests throughout the region and beyond .
Though a sportsman , Putin is best at chess .
He is likely to shy away from playing basketball with our new president .
Obama will have to beat Putin at his own game  and Obama now has shown himself easy to push around .
Israeli Adventurism
With Freeman ’s withdrawal , there is surely much gloating among the politically aware in Israel .
Gloating is one thing ; dangerous miscalculation is another .
The danger is particularly high as Benjamin Netanyahu takes over as Israeli prime minister .
Netanyahu and his close " neoconservative " friends in the U.S. make no bones about their preference for a Bush / Cheney - style preventive strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
As Gareth Porter and I write in today ’s Miami Herald , the specter of such a strike takes on more reality with Netanyahu as prime minister .
He , too , is taking the measure of our young president and may draw very dangerous conclusions from his subservience to the Lobby , as well as the key role played by chief of staff Rahm Emanuel in the White House .
Impact on Intelligence
The effect of the Freeman affair on the intelligence community is easy to predict .
Those who were looking forward to a fearless integrity will be deeply disappointed .
They may seek honest work elsewhere , if they perceive that Blair is only titular head of intelligence and that pro-Lobby political operatives like Emanuel are calling the shots .
On the other hand , those managers and analysts who were pleased as punch to be sent over to brief the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) , created by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) will be delighted .
This briefing practice , encouraged by the Bush / Cheney administration , was highly irregular for a non-partisan intelligence community to be engaged in .
It can be expected to flourish now , with the abject object lesson of Freeman ’s demise .
Unconscionable Timidity
On October 5 , 2007 I published an article on Israel ’s deliberate attempt , on June 8 , 1967 , to sink the USS Liberty in international waters off the Sinai , killing 34 of the Liberty crew and wounding over 170 in the process .
The lead was :
" So Who ’s Afraid of the Israel Lobby ?
Virtually everyone : Republican , Democrat  Conservative , Liberal .
The fear factor is non-partisan , you might say , and palpable .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee brags that it is the most influential foreign policy lobbying organization on Capitol Hill , and has demonstrated that time and again , and not only on Capitol Hill . "
The point ?
In June 1967 , the Israelis learned that they could get away , literally , with murder and still not endanger their influence in Washington .
Events of the past weeks demonstrate that they and their Lobby are equally good at character assassination .
It is embarrassingly shameful to watch President Obama acquiesce in all of this .
This article first appeared at Consortiumnews.com .

As expected , the Republican Senate leadership sold supporters of the Second Amendment down the river in a , you cover my crimes against the Constitution , I ’ll cover yours , agreement to confirm Eric Holder as Attorney General .
The agreement was reportedly reached when Holder agreed to not seek criminal charges against agents of the state ( CIA etc. ) who participated in the torture of suspected terrorists at Gitmo .
Holder has a long history of opposition to the Second Amendment ; he supports federal licensing of handgun owners , rationing gun sales , national gun registration , notifying the BATFE of every firearms purchase , and denying firearms purchases to anyone who might find their way on to any secret government " watch list . "
Holder has stated his belief that no one under the age of 21 should ever have access to a firearm .
Of course he would not extend this prohibition to servants of the state , specifically those in the military .
He would have no problem implementing the desires of the state on others , at gunpoint .
The state and the MSM , ( do I repeat myself ) scream from the rooftops the necessity of disarming American citizens so no one will ever be subjected to violent crime .
Yet , the state endorses arming convicted felons as long as they are members of their enforcement arm , the US Military .
Convicted felons in the military , bearing firearms to commit atrocities and murders for the state , are readily accepted into the fold .
Having already committed a violent crime puts one on the proper career path and in line for possible promotion .
The state will immediately see violent felons are provided with fully automatic weapons and explosives ; similar possession is forbidden if by law - abiding civilians .
These state - armed felons are mandated to attend a " warrior transition " course " in order to comply with Army Regulations .
Once in the employ of the state , these new warriors are no longer referred to as " felons , " but instead , those who have participated in " serious criminal misconduct . "
Misconduct covers a lot of serious , violent crimes in the eyes of the master .
A prudent person would wonder if the perpetrator of " serious criminal misconduct " will be advanced in grade to the rank of E - 4 upon enlistment , for " civilian acquired skills " as listed in Army Regulation 601- 210 ( para 7 - 12a ) .
Interesting indeed are the criminal misconduct acts that are willing to be forgiven by the state should one decide to become a uniformed supporter .
Under 4 - 9 , the following criminal acts , among others , are excused , " discharging a firearm through carelessness or within municipal limits , killing a domestic animal , poaching , shooting from the highway , using unlawful identification , and violation of fish and game laws . "
Accepted under 4 - 10 , are the following , " carrying of a weapon on school grounds , desecration of the American flag , domestic battery / violence , false bomb threat , looting , prostitution or solicitation of prostitution , selling or leasing weapons , reckless endangerment , eluding police , unlawful carrying of concealed firearm , and willfully discharging a firearm so as to endanger life . "
Under 4 - 11 , we find additionally accepted criminal acts : " assault with a dangerous weapon , carnal knowledge of a minor , child abuse , Hate crimes , indecent acts with a minor , kidnapping , manslaughter , murder , perjury or subornation of perjury , rape , incest or criminal sexual abuse , robbery , possession with intent to use a bomb or other explosive device , terrorist threats and violation of civil rights . "
One must wonder : would any criminal activity prohibit state employment ?
Troubling indeed is the increasing number of gang members serving in the military .
The fact the state has no problem training and arming violent criminals and gang members for deployment on America ’s streets , should make all who believe in freedom very , very afraid .
The message here is abundantly clear : the state has no problem with criminals ( birds of a feather you know ) having guns , explosives , and training in the use of both , as long as they are willing to support the state .
It does have a problem with anyone arming themselves who might seek to limit the state and its unconstitutional , criminal pursuits .
If the above does not shake you from your post - election euphoria , please drop me a postcard from the gulag in the more than likely event you get caught up in some " rapidly developing new program . "

The music industry has taken some extreme measures to counter piracy , but it has n't found the silver bullet yet .
The key is to come up with a service that will fulfill the needs of music lovers , and one that would even be embraced by the most hardcore pirate .
With Spotify , this might just become possible .
Spotify is a music service that gives users access to a huge library of music , through a lightweight application that looks like a mashup of the best parts of iTunes and Last. fm .
Music is streamed , partly supported by P2P technology , but it plays instantly , like we ’ve never seen before .
One of the software engineers at Spotify is Ludvig Strigeus , the creator of uTorrent .
It is therefore no surprise that the application uses very few resources , just 12 k memory when we tested it .
The rumor goes that some of the money made when uTorrent sold to BitTorrent Inc. , has actually been invested in Spotify , an application that competes with piracy .
When we asked Andres Sehr of Spotify to describe the service , he told us “ Spotify is a new way of enjoying music .
We believe Spotify provides a viable alternative to music piracy .
We think the way forward is to create a service better than piracy , thereby converting users into a legal , sustainable alternative which also enriches the total music experience . ”
The quality of the music on Spotify is comparable to 160 kbps MP3s , which is more than decent for a streaming application .
To fill its library , Spotify has cut deals with EMI , Warner Music , Sony BMG and three other major labels , which all responded positively to the new concept .
Interestingly , Spotify also uses P2P technology to stream the more frequently accessed tracks .
“ Spotify uses a hybrid p2 p system where music is delivered both by our servers and using P2P , ” Andres Sehr said .
“ This allows us to deliver the long tail of music which may not be very popular , as well as quickly serve up the latest hits that the majority of users listen to .
P2P allows us to both increase the speed that we deliver music and also lower the cost of streaming it . ”
Aside from being a music streaming application , Spotify also allows users to create and share playlists with each other , the top 100 tracks of 2008 according to Pitchfork editors for example .
On top of that , the Spotify interface helps you to discover new artists with its “ similar artists ” and “ artist radio ” feature .
The overall response from Spotify users seems to be very positive , but can it compete with piracy ?
Time will have to tell , but Spotify invites are actively being traded within the BitTorrent community , and it has even been well received on some of the most elite music trackers .
One user at the music tracker What.cd wrote : “ Honestly it ’s going to be huge .
I ’ve been browsing and playing from its seemingly endless music catalogue all afternoon , it loads as if it ’s playing from local files , so fast , so easy .
If it ’s this great in such early beta stages then I can’t imagine where its going .
I feel like buying another laptop to have permanently rigged . ”
Spotify is not perfect though .
One of the mentioned downsides is that it is not compatible with iPods and other portable MP3 players .
The Spotify team has n’t ruled out the option of an iPod compatible version in the future , but for now they will focus on optimizing the Windows and Mac application .
Overall we can conclude that Spotify definitely has potential , but time will tell if it ’s able to compete successfully with piracy .
Spotify is currently in Beta stage , invites to the free ( ad - supported ) version can only be used in the UK , Sweden , Finland , Norway , Spain and France , but restrictions usually do n’t stop pirates .
Update :
We have a few invites left , please remember though that it ’s only available in the UK , Sweden , Finland , Norway , Spain and France .
Those who ’d like to receive an invite , send me an email with “ spotify ” as subject .
According to some of the commentary , an invite is not even needed though .
PITTSBURGH , Jan. 12 – A new area of the cerebral cortex has evolved to enable man and higher primates to pick up small objects and deftly use tools , according to neuroscientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Pittsburgh 's Veterans Affairs Medical Center .
The brain 's primary motor cortex turns out to have neighboring " old " and " new " parts .
In most animals , including cats , rats and some monkeys , the old primary motor cortex controls movement indirectly through the circuitry of the spinal cord , explained senior author Peter Strick , Ph.D. , professor in the department of neurobiology at the School of Medicine and senior career scientist at the VA Medical Center .
But in man , the Great Apes and some monkeys , another area of the motor cortex developed and is now home to a special set of cortico - motoneuronal ( CM ) cells , he said .
These cells directly control spinal cord motor neurons , which are the nerve cells responsible for causing contraction of shoulder , elbow and finger muscles .
The direct control exerted by CM cells bypasses the limitations imposed by spinal cord circuitry and permits the development of highly complex patterns of movement , such as the independent finger action needed for playing an instrument or typing .
" What we 've shown is that along with evolution of direct control over motor neurons , a new cortical area has evolved that 's right next to the old one , " Dr. Strick said .
" We still have much the same spinal machinery the frog has , but the new cortical area with CM cells endows humans with the superior hand skills to manufacture and use tools – an especially human trait . "
He and co-author Jean - Alban Rathelot , Ph.D. , a research associate in Dr. Strick 's lab , based their conclusions on a series of experiments in which rabies virus was injected into single muscles in the shoulders , elbows or fingers of monkeys .
The virus , chosen because of its unique ability to travel between networked nerve cells , was tracked to locate CM cells in the primary motor cortex .
The findings have been published in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Dr. Strick noted that the direct connection from the cortex to motor neurons is not present at birth , but develops during the first few months of life and becomes fully mature around two years of age .
Thus , the progress of an infant 's motor skills is a display of the establishment of these connections .

In yet another sign that the line between real news and fake news is getting thinner , one of CNN ’s main anchors during the 1980s and 1990s , Bobbie Battista , has taken a step through the looking glass and can now be seen anchoring reports online for ONN , The Onion News Network .
In the report below , “ Prague ’s Franz Kafka International Named World ’s Most Alienating Airport , ” Ms. Battista reports the fictional news with the same aplomb she brought to the real thing during her 20 - year career at CNN :

In a recent interview with the blog CNN Observations , Ms. Battista said she enjoyed the fake reports , though she admitted : “ I was n’t sure I should do them at first . ”
She also advised aspiring journalists to “ practice journalism , not blogging , ” and had some harsh words for her former employer for cutting back on international news :

Here is a new fact of life : America ’s economy is getting a little smaller .
This “ shrinkage ” is likely to be a secular — as opposed to a cyclical — sets of changes .
Out goes the conspicuous consumption of the 1990s and 2000s . . .
Lean and green is in ; Grotesque and self - indulgent are out .
Downsize that McMansion !
Replace the SUV with something fuel efficient !
Save instead of consume !
This is much more than a philosophical view — its what all of the economic data over the past year has been practically screaming .
In terms of actual data , here is what the new , leaner American economy looks like :
• Asset Deflation : Equity portfolios are on average down about 40 % ; Dividends are being slashed , stock repurchases canceled .
Nationally , home prices are down 20 - 25 % ; • Consumer Spending : Down significantly , after the US had its worst Xmas in 40 years .
Savings rate has turned positive ; Conspicuous Consumption replaced with Conspicuous Conservation .
• Retail Stores :
Have been hard hit ;
Many chains are filing bankruptcy ( Circuit City , Linens ‘n Things Sharper Image , Steve & Barry ’s Tweeter , Mervyn’s ) ;
The survivors ( Starbucks , Macy’s , Sears , Office Depot ) are closing stores — some , as many as 10 - 20 % or more of exiting stores .
Retail shopping will emerge from the recession with a much smaller footprint than before ; • Employment : 3.6 million jobs lost already , with anywhere from 1 to 4 million more to go ; Real Unemployment hit a record this past month ; • Finance & Wall Street : The Street has been hard hit — look for much smaller revenue , with staff cuts of 25 - 35 % .
The safest players ?
Those with green P&Ls , and / or substantial assets under management .
In employment peril ?
Everyone else .
• Autos : US auto sales have plunged ; Annual Sales are down 37 % , from a 15 million annual run rate to barely over 10 million .
Its not just Detroit , either .
Toyota , Honda , BMW , Lexus are all suffering ; • University Endowments :
The intellectual engine of America ’s brain trust has just taken an enormous hit to the frontal lobe : Harvard , Yale , Stanford , others are down - 25 % plus over the past 6 months alone .
The big endowments fund Professorships , grants , student scholarships , pure research .
The loss will be deeply felt over ensuing decades .
• Wages : US
Wages have been punished by globailization , and have been stagnant over the past 10 years ;
Now , we are likely to see contractions in wages over the next 1 - 3 years ; • Media : Cirucaltion at major newspapers are falling ;
Its likely that 50 % of print Newspapers will be gone ( or web only ) in 5 years ; Will Fox Business channel , which launched just at the peak of the Stock market in 2007 , manage to survive this onslaught ?
Less than even money .
• Pharmaceutical Industry : Huge R&D budget and staff cuts — 15 - 20 % — at several major pharmas ( Pfizer ’s huge research layoffs most recently ) do n’t bode well for new drug development and cures ; Misallocated resources over the past decade , and lots of dead ends do n’t help .
>
What is the sum total of all this ?
The US GDP will contract 4 - 6 % 2008 Q4 – 2009 Q2 ; Down 1 - 3 % for the second half 2009 ;
And is possibly flat in 2010 —

Back in 2001 , we had forecast the US Economy could hit $ 15 Trillion by 2010 - 11 ;
That now gets pushed back to 2015 - 17 . . .
It popped up on television last night and I had two reactions .
The first was a sense of met expectation .
Part of the rationale for Obama 's presidency from a foreign policy perspective was always his unique capacity to rebrand America in the eyes of the Muslim world .
Since even the hardest core neocons agree that wooing the Muslim center is critical to winning the long war against Jihadism , Obama 's outreach is unremarkable and should be utterly uncontroversial .
Bush tried for a while to do the same .
But Karen Hughes is not exactly Barack Obama .
And the simple gesture of choosing an Arab media outlet for his first televised interview as president is extremely powerful .
It has the elegance of a minimalist move with maximalist aims .
It is about the same thing as inviting Rick Warren or supping with George Will : it 's about R - E - S - P - E - C -T .
This respect came with the following astonishing words :
Now , my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well - being of the Muslim world , that the language we use has to be a language of respect .
I have Muslim members of my family .
I have lived in Muslim countries ... the largest one , Indonesia .
And so what I want to communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world , what I 've come to understand is that regardless of your faith  and America is a country of Muslims , Jews , Christians , non-believers  regardless of your faith , people all have certain common hopes and common dreams .
And my job is to communicate to the American people that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives .
My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy .
What Obama is doing is appealing over the heads of Muslim leaders directly to Muslim populations .
I cannot think of any other president with the same kind of personal credibility in such a critical time .
And his appeal is to relieve the state of humankind :
[ T ]he bottom line in all these talks and all these conversations is , is a child in the Palestinian Territories going to be better off ?
Do they have a future for themselves ?
And is the child in Israel going to feel confident about his or her safety and security ?
And if we can keep our focus on making their lives better and look forward , and not simply think about all the conflicts and tragedies of the past , then I think that we have an opportunity to make real progress .
Onto the choppy waters of religious strife , the old oil of material improvement .
It 's a way in ; a way to change the subject ; a subtle appeal to Muslim and Arab peoples on common ground .
Downing Street is looking to avoid potential humiliation after the White House scaled down the profile of Gordon Brown 's first formal meeting with Barack Obama .
While the Prime Minister is expected to hold nearly two hours of talks with the US president , the White House has categorically ruled out a traditional joint press conference before the White House media .
After overnight protests from British diplomats , the White House agreed to allow journalists into the Oval Office later for a brief round of questions after the talks .
Gordon Brown ’s officials have played down the significance of the decision and deny the Prime Minister is being snubbed .
However , the move will distinctly lessen the prestige of the PM ’s coup of becoming the first European leader invited to Washington for talks with Obama since his inauguration in January .

That Obama will find time to meet with the Boy Scouts of America later this afternoon is sure to add to the embarrassment .
The trip is in marked contrast to the hospitality lavished on Tony Blair by George Bush when they met for the first time .
( Mandates include 15,000 + pages controlling and limiting world wide production of all supplements , holistic care and your rights to choose nutrients that will be implemented by the pharmaceutical industry that runs CODEX )
If countries do n't comply , world export / import trade may be cut off to that country .
We need everyone to be educated about this issue , so you will take the action that will prevent this invasion of our freedoms .
Sample letters for your congressional reps are available for your convenience .

Dear friends and colleagues , Each of us is deluged daily with so much information that we are forced to choose quickly between what deserves our attention and what to throw in the circular file .
I implore you to read the following .
Your professional and personal lives , as you know them , depend on it .
No doubt you have received as many rambling , lengthy e-mails about Codex Alimentarius as I have .
I have deleted more of them than I can count that were either too alarming or too complacent in nature and lacking in credibility .
Now , let me ask you if you know anyone who has actually read all 15,000 + pages of the working documents of the Codex Alimentarius Commission ?
Well , I have .
As such , allow me to attempt to put an end to any confusion you may have about Codex Alimentarius by sharing what I have learned and what I believe to be a reasonable and appropriate level of concern .
What 's the bottom line for a healthcare professional practicing alternative , nutritional , natural , or environmental healthcare ?
The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) is poised to take away your right to practice the healing arts guided by natural laws , scientific principles , and your clinical expertise and judgment .
Through the Orwellian process of harmonization ( forced alignment ) with WTO standards that regulate trade , distribution , and processing of food , herbs , and nutrients , your professional rights and options will be eliminated within the next few years .
The proposed standards are extremely detrimental to the environment , your medical practice , and the food supply .
Okay .
I saw that one eyebrow go up and heard that deep sigh .
Let me tell you that alarmism is not and never has been in my nature .
I am a medical doctor , have a wide variety of interests , am passionate about healthcare freedom , and pride myself in my rational thinking and logic skills .
I floss my teeth regularly and eat a nutrient - dense whole foods diet and , yes , occasionally sample the more decadent side of the culinary arts .
Neither my family nor I had a bomb shelter during the Cold War era and I did not withdraw from society or stock up on gasoline , food , or batteries in anticipation of Y2 K .
Read on .
The ability of physicians to legally practice environmental or natural medicine , their access to the substances they rely on to do so , and the rights of patients to chose these treatments are about to be criminalized in the United States by a draconian set of international regulations which have already become law in Australia , Canada and the European Union ( EU ) .
These standards , collectively known as Codex Alimentarius , ( from the Latin for " Food Rules " ) have been promulgated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission [ established for this purpose in 1963 by the United Nations ( UN ) ] in every area having to do with the production , processing , packaging and use of food , herbs and food components .

Think that can't happen here ?
Think again .
It can and it will , unless we take appropriate action and activate each member of our personal and professional networks .
Skillful disinformation would have you believe that Codex Alimentarius ( hereafter referred to as CODEX ) is a hoax and that , at the same time , it is beneficial for you and your patients .
( The inherent illogic of this position is obvious to the discerning reader ) .
The Codex Alimentarius Commission was empowered to work with other UN - linked organizations in order to develop and promulgate uniform world - wide standards for food , nutrition and agriculture .
The WTO , successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , is empowered to enforce global compliance with all CODEX standards via trade sanctions across the entire economic spectrum .
Member nations ( including the United States ) agreed , upon signing the WTO treaty , to always allow the standards and regulations of the WTO to supersede and take complete precedence over national standards , laws , and regulations .
Once accepted CODEX takes on the force of law and cannot be repealed or changed by the WTO member nations .
Presenting itself as a consumer protection strategy , CODEX policies masquerade as both benign and beneficial while , in reality , they are neither .
Given the medically and environmentally horrific stipulations and requirements , the implementation of these standards will result in incalculable harm to the healing arts and to the patients who depend on them .
Once CODEX is adopted by a nation , there is a phase - in period during which the administrative structure is established according to a strict time - table .
Bear in mind that in the United States , nutrients are currently classified as foods [ under the 1994 Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act ( DSHEA ) ] and that any substance not explicitly forbidden is permitted as a nutrient in the United States .
Under CODEX , any substance not explicitly permitted by CODEX policy is banned as a nutrient .
The CODEX preamble specifies that supplements and nutrients may not be used to prevent , treat or cure any disorder .
Yet , more than 80 percent of Americans use supplements for exactly these purposes .
Nutritional and environmental physicians , naturopaths , nutritionists , chiropractors and other licensed health professionals employ hundreds of natural minerals , supplements , and herbs precisely because they are effective in preventing , treating and curing many diseases .
These natural health options will become illegal if the United States is harmonized with the WTO this spring while compliance with CODEX is still voluntary , or when total compliance becomes mandatory , as it will be after the next CODEX Commission meeting in Rome .
Health food stores will no longer be able to market and distribute nutritional supplements .
Most health food stores and privately owned nutrient manufacturers will , I believe , no longer be in business after CODEX takes effect .
Back to Top I know .
This is all difficult to believe upon first hearing it .
You may have heard that it is easy to get people to believe a lie , particularly an outrageous lie .
In my experience , the opposite is also true :
It is difficult to get people to believe the outrageous truth .
Keep on reading , because this is a truth you definitely need to understand .
Once CODEX is implemented ( either through harmonization or mandatory compliance ) , we will be forced to follow the European CODEX model in which it will be illegal to manufacture , buy , sell , recommend , or use any but 28 ultra - low dose nutrients whether you are a licensed health professional or not .
Only synthetic versions of that short list will be allowed and natural supplements , herbs , enzymes and other non-pharmaceutical treatments will be banned .
The only legal health option left will be the pharmaceutical one .
CODEX regulations have been harmonized ( i.e. , approved ) in the EU , Canada and Australia .
The United States is next unless we act decisively and act now .
Though CODEX regulations are passed quietly and without effective public notice in infrequent meetings abroad that are invisible to most Americans , they have grave and devastating impact on Americanbs health freedom .
Here in the United States , the harmonization laws which will enact CODEX policy have been defeated by Congress several times , each time by a smaller margin .
Given the composition of the current Congress , it is virtually certain that it will be passed unless we take swift and immediate steps to assure that does not happen .
This legislative stealth attack on health freedoms will probably play out in May or early June of 2005 unless we take effective steps to help assure that health freedom becomes the Mother of all third rails for every politician in the country .
CODEX is the result of a complex relationship between the UN ( which established the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 1962 ) ; the WTO ( which is authorized to enforce CODEX through trade sanctions ) ; the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , which subscribes to the CODEX regulations [ despite the fact that they directly and explicitly conflict with their own findings and policies such as the FAO / WHO official publication , " Diet , Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases " ] ; the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ; and the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) working in concert with industry representatives of ( and others unofficially representing the interests of ) the pesticide , chemical , pharmaceutical , and dairy industries .
Consumers , health scientists , physicians and other practicing natural medicine and other health - focused voices have been totally absent from official CODEX deliberations .
A few observers have been present at official deliberations but they have not been permitted to speak in the sessions .
Full ratification is expected in Rome during the July 4 - 9 , 2005 meeting of the CODEX ALIMETNARIUS Committee
Of course , the real work of such a complex regulatory structure takes place outside of those official sessions .
And none of the health advocates have had access to those meetings , agreements and sessions .
Yet CODEX will take away our health freedoms if we allow ourselves to be harmonized or mandated to comply with CODEX .
Everyone knows if they have a jar of pickles and they remove the pickle label and put a mayonnaise label on it , that they 're going to find pickles when they open the jar .
The packaging of CODEX policy under the label of protection of fair trade , public health , and safety does not make it so .
Underneath CODEX altruistic labeling is a poisoned apple of extremely adverse global policy that is , in fact , driven by economic concerns of large corporate interests .
Back to Top
Once implemented , CODEX ALIMENTARIUS does the following : 1 . VITAMINS , MINERAL , NUTRIENTS AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES
The CODEX preamble forbids the use of nutrients to prevent , treat or cure any condition or disease .
CODEX defines minimum allowable dosages of permitted nutrients as 15 percent of the amounts naturally occurring in foods , while maximum allowable doses of any permitted nutrients may not exceed the dose of that nutrient found in food .
Supplement values subtract the amount assumed to be in the daily diet from the maximum allowable dose and the result is the permitted upper limit of a nutrient .
This system is based neither in science nor clinical requirements .
Higher doses of permitted nutrients and nutrients not explicitly permitted will be classified as illegal substances ( in the same class as heroin )
Theoretical exceptions exist for natural substances which are submitted and accepted for testing .
A substance successfully tested in this way may then be prescribed at the tested dosage only .
The permission to use a nutrient in this way , by prescription only , however , expires in 2009 .
The cost of this procedure is staggering , Most applications for such testing have been turned down and , since natural molecules cannot be patented , potential manufacturers are unable to recoup the costs of testing through later sales .
The period for submission of applications for this process ends on July 12 , 2005 and cannot be extended
The European Union ( EU ) , whose European Supplements Directive is the model administrative agency for CODEX implementation , permits a total of 28 ultra - low dose nutrients .
All other nutrients ( e.g. , alpha lipoic acid , 1 gram doses of vitamin C , Co Q 10 , fish oil , and curcumin ) are banned substances and may not be manufactured , distributed , recommended , sold , supplied or be in the possession of anyone , including licensed health professionals .
Vitamin C , for example , at any dosage higher than 200 mg per day will be illegal .
A gram of Vitamin C will be an illegal substance !
The dose of Co Q 10 which has been shown to resolve breast cancer in some patients ( 400 mg per day ) will be illegal because Co Q 10 will be totally forbidden at any dose ( following the European Supplements Directive model ) .
The allowable maximum upper limits for permitted nutrients have been set so low that they have little or no clinical impact in keeping us healthy and none at all in returning us to a state of health if we are ill .
Those which are available will be exorbitantly priced , as current experience in Norway and Germany reveals , where profit margins of synthetic , permitted nutrients are being harmonized to match drug profit margins .
On August 1 , 2005 , 75 percent of the natural substances currently available in healthfood stores and pharmacies in Europe will become illegal as a direct result of CODEX .
Only synthetic forms of permitted nutrients will be available .
All natural versions will be illegal substances .
Only synthetic nutrients ( at ultra - low dosages ) manufactured by pharmaceutical companies will meet the molecular standards for use in humans or animals .
Back to Top 2 . HERBS AND HERBAL TREATMENTS
Herbs , originally part of the CODEX deliberations , were summarily removed and placed under a closed committee of the WHO where they are held to be untested drugs and therefore illegal The European Supplements Directive , the model agency for CODEX administration , has produced a very short list of herbs which may be used and the conditions for which they may be used ( another short and very trivial list ) .
All other applications of herbs and any other herbs besides those listed are strictly forbidden
There is the possibility that a few formulas of well known Chinese herbal medicines may be exempt ( but that remains to be seen ) 3 . TRADITIONAL HEALING ARTS CODEX stipulates which conditions may be treated using herbs and allows only minor , self limited conditions .
Treating any other conditions with herbal remedies will constitute a crime .
Some complex oriental herbal formulas may be permitted but most will be lost .
Ayurvedic , Tibetan , tribal and other traditional medicines which use herbs and natural substances will be forbidden world - wide .
Since most people do not have access to pharmaceutical medicine , this effectively removes the legal possibility of people legally accessing any form of tribal or traditional medicine .
Herbal , shamanic , energy based ( e.g. , Reiki and acupuncture ) medicine are forbidden forms of treatment 4 . GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS ( GMOs ) CODEX makes the un-labeled use of GMOs legal in all foods under all circumstances , even though there is significant opposition to the widespread use of GMOs at this time .
Farmers in Iraq , for example , must purchase their seeds from Monsanto and are forbidden from retaining seed crops under the new Iraqi constitution .
Similar laws exist in other less exotic places .
Many GMOs have been genetically engineered so that seeds WILL NOT GERMINATE without the use of specific pesticides ( such as Roundup " by Monsanto ) .
In fact , mounting scientific evidence makes it clear that the incidence of birth defects , chemical sensitivity , chronic fatigue syndrome , asthma , severe allergies , and a host of other conditions have a causative or contributory relationship with increasing levels of pesticide exposure that these crops will require .
GMOs themselves are far from scientifically established as safe for either the planet or its people by objective , non-industry scientists .
Genetic drift through the spread of GMO genetic material is recognized as a major threat to the biological integrity of the entire planet .
Back to Top 5 .
TOXIC RESIDUES CODEX sets permissible upper limits for pesticide residues , toxic chemicals , hormones in food and other environmental contaminants that are many times higher than levels advocated by chemical and pesticide industry lobbying groups .
The current acceptable levels of toxins are already responsible for most of the incidence of cancers , heart disease , autism , chronic degenerative conditions , and organ failures that associated with mortality and morbidity globally .
Increasing the permissible levels of toxins can only accelerate personal and global suffering .
6 . ANTIBIOTICS , GROWTH STIMULANTS AND OTHER HORMONES IN FOOD ANIMALS CODEX mandates that all animal feed must be treated with antibiotics , hormones and growth stimulants world wide .
Organic , free range and biodynamic farming will become illegal .
7. IRRADIATION OF FOOD : CODEX mandates irradiation of food under circumstances now hotly contested by food safety advocates .
Allegedly designed to protect us from food borne illness , the irradiation of food is by no means agreed to be a safe procedure ( by non-industry scientists ) since there is considerable scientific evidence that protein structures are modified in unhealthy ways by introducing ionizing radiation into food before it is consumed .
The irradiation of food produces huge free radical populations .
The only protection against their pervasive damage is high doses of anti-oxidants ( which will be illegal under CODEX ) .
At this point it will likely come as no surprise to you that there has been no effective representation from health advocates , nutritional supplement manufacturers , natural healthcare professionals , or other non-pharmaceutically oriented group at the Codex Alimentarius Commission meeting .
The Codex Alimentarius Commission meets every two years , always offshore ( Rome , Bonn , Paris , etc. ) and never in Smallville , USA , a fact that helps perpetuate its opacity to the United States citizenry .
The United States ' representatives to the Codex Alimentarius Commission have well - documented , very unwholesome conflicts of interest with the very industries that stand to profit and benefit from the wholesale implementation of the CODEX standards .
CODEX sets international standards for everything from parmesan cheese to sweet cassava , canned sardines to chicken meat , Echinacea to rice .
The standards which comprise CODEX are virtually complete : final ratification of the entire package is expected at the Codex Alimentarius Committee meeting in Rome from July 4 - 9 , 2005 .
Before ratification , harmonization is voluntary but can be enforced by WTO trade sanctions .
After ratification , compliance with CODEX is mandatory and enforcement by the WTO is a powerful threat to make sure that it is complied with properly .

It is imperative that concerned health professionals and their patients , friends , relatives , suppliers , etc. , become fully activated to stop CODEX from being enacted in the United States .
Now that we know more about the boat in which we are adrift , let me hand you a paddle .
This threat to our profession and to our ability to choose the type of healthcare for our selves demands one of the most powerful tools available to us : grass roots political action .
We can use the Democratic Process to our advantage by : Becoming activated .
If you do nothing now , when CODEX is ratified you will have nothing left of your environmental or nutritional medicine practice .
It is imperative that you alert your colleagues , friends , patients , relatives , suppliers and everyone else you know to this danger so they can join you in taking effective action .
FAX , do not use regular mail or email , your Congressional Delegation re : your strong outrage at the limitation of our health freedoms through CODEX and a group of domestic efforts to reclassify nutrients as drugs and eliminate them as foods .
Visit www.healthfreedomUSA.org to find your Congressional Delegation 's FAX number and three sample letters to Congress .
Send each targeted Congressman all three letters signed by you .
We need to have a minimum of 1 million faxes to Congress in the next 4 weeks .
Provide sample letters and a list of local Congressional District members FAX numbers for patients in your office .
This information is available on the Natural Solutions Foundation website , www.healthfreedomUSA.org.
Offer to FAX letters for those patients who do not have fax machines available to them .
Become a supporter of the Natural Solutions Foundation , a not for profit organization ( of which I am the Medical Director ) to preserve , protect and defend health freedom in the United States .
In addition to our other activities , the Natural Solutions Foundation has commissioned a major documentary to tell the story of CODEX to the American public .
Become a supporter of this effort .
See www.healthfreedomUSA.org for details .
We would all like to put our heads in the sand and try to believe that CODEX would , could and should not happen here .
But it can and , unless we take action now , CODEX will become the law of our land .
For a full discussion of the domestic legislative assault on health freedoms , go to www.healthfreedomUSA.org
Whether your motivation is global or local , professional or personal , I ask that you take action now .
FAX letters supporting health freedom , a safe food supply and a clean world : FAX letters to Congress and alert your entire network to do that same .

For their part , aid groups have not always been clear with respect to requests from the court for cooperation or testimony .
Many groups supported the creation of the I.C.C. , thinking it would contribute to the prevention of war crimes and reconciliation of war - torn societies , and some went so far as to claim they could be “ an important source of information . ”
At the time , few organizations fully grasped how international judicial processes could come in direct conflict with providing humanitarian aid .
Delivering lifesaving assistance to civilians and noncombatants requires constant negotiation with local authorities as well as warring parties , who might be responsible for war crimes .
The moment aid workers are perceived as collecting information for possible prosecutions , our ability to reach victims in need is undermined .
An organization simply cannot provide humanitarian aid and at the same time fight against impunity .
Our teams spend a good amount of their time in Darfur negotiating the movement of ambulances through checkpoints manned by commanders of various factions , some of whom were directly responsible for the displacement of people we are assisting or the wounded we are evacuating .
Though inspired by the same objective — containing the violence of war — humanitarian assistance is not necessarily compatible with punishing war criminals or , for that matter , the armed protection of civilians .
The crisis in Darfur highlights the need for aid organizations to acknowledge these contradictions and dispel any doubts about what their priority is and what they will or will not do .
While Doctors Without Borders respects the I.C.C. , we have not cooperated and will not cooperate with the court or relay any information to it , a position we have publicly and privately affirmed both to the I.C.C. and to the Sudanese authorities since 2004 .
Making clear the role of humanitarian aid and demonstrating a commitment to impartiality and neutrality allows groups to work on both sides of the frontline not only in Darfur but in other conflicts as well .
Of course , independence from the I.C.C. is not enough to avoid being blocked from providing lifesaving humanitarian aid .
Recent events demonstrate that whatever position international groups have taken with regard to the I.C.C. , emergency assistance in Darfur is being held hostage to political wrangling between the international community and the Sudanese government .
While we want to vomit all over our keyboard when we see this ( dead ) term pop up in the comments -- because we 're just that real -- Laughing Squid has a fantastic linguistic conversation going on about , exactly , a " hipster " is .
Some think of a " hipster " as anyone who blows rails in the bathrooms at Pop 's , some view them as anyone who is n't a fat IT slob with an Asian fetish , and others think of a " hipster " as anyone who dons slim - fitting jeans (?! ) .
Scott Beale asked his Twitter ilk how they personally define this hot - button noun .
Jeffrey Kalmikoff responds , " A self - assumed coolness , individuality and importance surpass their ability to see their conformity . "
How do we define it , you ask ?
Not sure .
However , more often than not , we see it used by those who have n't forgiven God for allowing them grow out of the cherished 18 - to - 25 year - old age range .
But what say you ?

His winning Hugo base design will be unveiled at Anticipation ’s Hugo Awards Ceremony on Sunday , August 9 at the Palais des congrès .
Feb 6 , 2009
This post was discussed thoroughly on Hacker News .
Even Mr. Graham was kind enough to comment — though not in the affirmative .
There was moderate discussion on Reddit as well .
A long time ago , in a galaxy far far away , Steve Yegge wrote an essay on Common Lisp named Lisp is not an Acceptable Lisp .
As far as Yegge essays go , it was one of the more Molotov - esque .
There are a few items in this ancient tract that I feel are spot on with reality and another few that seem to miss the mark these many centuries later .
Precognition
Arc ’s going to be a new religion , of course , because programmers just haaaaaave to make it that way .
Looking back on the reaction to the announcement of Arc , Yegge was reading the writing on the wall with this particular comment .
Paul Graham has always tended to be viewed as a living / breathing / walking religion because of his spectacular essays on high school life , education failures , and general purpose geekery .
However , his essays are likely to be remembered for the way that they generated a frenzy - tinged lust for LISP .
There are a 1000 reasons why this could be , but the most likely lies in the fact that when his most groundbreaking essays were written , the world of programming was mired in the world of Java , C , Visual BASIC , and C ++.
His essays on LISP elucidated an almost Utopian world of programming power , long forgotten or little imagined to those mired in Blub .
… My prediction : someone will get tired of waiting , and they ’ll Torvalds Arc into obsolescence before it ’s ever released .
The release of Arc was a grand day in the history of the Internets .
Birds sang that day my friends .
The air smelled of the finest of perfume .
I believe even Christopher Hitchens thanked the gods that day ( speaking of cult - like figures in the world of geekdom ) .
As a result of this unparalleled software release , mzscheme was downloaded over a trillion times .
However , the honeymoon was short and the grumbling was indeed furious thereafter .
“ Is this it ? ” Now bear in mind , over the years leading up to the release , the fledgling Arc community had nurtured such expectations of Mr. Graham ’s language that anything short of The Singularity occurring as a result of its execution was tantamount to Global Thermonuclear War followed by the cancellation of Heroes and the concurrent deaths of Adam and Jamie .
It was running on top of mzscheme ?
It did n’t support UNICODE ?
No module system ?
Few libraries ?
Unhygienic macros ?
Lists for dinner — again ?
These criticisms festered into essentially an Internet meme 1 ; everyone was jumping in on the lashing .
Eventually , the buzz of Arc wore off and all that remained was the negativity .
Eventually , Mr. Graham himself seemed to spurn 2 the language , and it has since been relegated to the dustbin of the github fork .
3
And then along came Clojure .
For all intents and purposes , Clojure ’s creator Rich Hickey is Arc ’s Torvalds quipped on by Mr. Yegge .
Adding powerful namespacing coupled with the fact that it ’s built on top of the JVM dispels the questions and gripes aimed at Arc from the start .
Any momentum that Arc may have gained from its release and subsequently maintained once the love affair ended was squashed under the heel of the Clojure juggernaut .
Sure ,
Arc still has its proponents , desperately clinging to their language of choice like a desperate Humbert Humbert to a very pregnant Lolita 4 , but even they have the preliminary itch of disillusionment .
Truth be told , Lisp should probably have a skinnable syntax .
That implies a canonical abstract syntax tree , which of course has n’t been defined ( and in many implementations is n’t even available to you , the way it is in the Io language , say ) .
Now I ’m not a LISP expert , but it seems to me that the S - Expression is popularly regarded as the canonical representation of the LISP AST ( and many other languages for that matter ) .
That is , the LISP syntax is as close to an AST as one can get .
Perhaps the presence of macros , # , ` , ‘ , and , muddy the waters a bit , but not much .
Misses
Your only other option is to design a new language , and you wo n’t get any help from Lisp people , because they will hate you .
It seems to me that the greater LISP community is embracing Clojure and its creator Rich Hickey most amiably .
Not coming from a LISP background , it ’s difficult to say what the condition of vitriol and hatred was when the original article was written .
Additionally , I do not have a herd of LISP hackers roaming my office halls in order to observe any low - frequency mummers disparaging Rich Hickey .
In any case , Clojure has garnered a lot of excitement from some highly credible LISP hackers .
If Mr. Kenny Tilton would come around , then the coup would be complete .
Or maybe you could go the Haskell route and not have OOP at all .
That seems to alienate most programmers , though , despite the attractions of not having to create nouns for everything .
It ’s tough to be negative on Mr. Yegge on this quote considering that 2006 was still during the time when OOP principles were drilled into every C.S. majors ’ skull and could be heard in the laughter of children .
However , the functional programming para - dig - em is finally starting to gain a handhold in an otherwise homogeneous programming language landscape 5 .
Still True ?
Macros are notoriously hard to debug , and honestly it need n’t be that way .
If your editor knows all about macros , then you should be able to click to see the expansion , and click again to see its sub-expansions , all the way down to the primitive functions .
It may simply be my own ignorance , but I still do not know of an editor that does this for any current LISP .
( pointers welcome )
Conclusion
In order to wrap up this post , I would like to quote a comment posted in the comments section of the original article :
Lisp indeed leaves you with your own ideas and your own limitations .
It does n’t pose any artificial restrictions on your programs that you have to work against , and it does n’t provide any “ color by numbers ” examples that make you feel like you have achieved something .
Lisp requires you to be creative .
The quote above by Pascal Costanza says it all : about Clojure , about Common Lisp , about Qi , Scheme , and even about Arc .
Having spent a majority of my programming career writing Blub , I have only recently 6 discovered the power of languages in the LISP vein .
Like many programmers , my interest was stoked by the excellent and iconic ( as far as Internet noise goes ) LISP essays written by Mr. Graham .
I , like many others , dreamed of the 100 Year Language and was pulling for Mr. Graham to deliver it .
However , I think that a language such as Clojure ( or more likely one of its inevitable derivatives ) will instead be the language of 2109 .

KAMILA SZEJNOCH
Swing
Kamila Szejnoch installs a tiny swing at the monumental bronze ' Berling Army Soldier ' in Warsaw .
She suggests a change in the function of the monuments , attempting to build a bridge between the present and the past , adding a contemporary layer distinct from their original style and function .
She asks , what a particular memorial actually refers to and what kind of history it conceals .
The US Navy has handed out a $ 12 m contract to Texan academics to carry out research into electromagnetic hypervelocity railguns .
According to the Pentagon contracts feed :
The Institute of Advanced Technology at the University of Texas , Austin [ will ] perform railgun assessment including laboratory testing and scalability between small and medium scale launcher , pulsed power assessment and conceptual prototyping and assessment of electromagnetic railgun contractor development items including advanced containment launcher and pulsed power systems .
Railguns work by driving a conductive armature down a pair of rails , with heavy electric current flowing through the armature from one rail to another .
This generates magnetic forces which push the armature along the rails .
The armature may be the projectile itself , may be attached to it , or may merely be a driving sabot intended to drop off after clearing the end of the gun " barrel " .
The advantage of a railgun is that it can potentially deliver much higher muzzle velocity than a normal chemically - powered cannon .
This could offer the prospect of guns able to throw their hypersonic shells hundreds of miles .
As the incoming projectiles would still be moving at many times the speed of sound at impact , they would also be very hard to defend against .
One of the very few sorts of battle machinery where the necessary amounts of ' leccy might be available will be the next generation of warships , which are expected to use electrical transmissions in their propulsion .
Thus one can see why it 's the US Navy - not the air force or someone - pushing this technology .
Railguns able to deliver unstoppable hypersonic strikes from afar , perhaps also able to pick merely - supersonic missiles or planes out of the sky with ease , might also restore the surface warship to its lost dominion over the seas .
There would also be logistic benefits : instead of needing to ship dangerous explosive warheads and gun propellants about , all the supply chain would have to handle would be inert projectiles and fuel for the ship 's engines .
For now , though , the best the Office of Naval Research has been able to achieve is an admittedly - impressive ten megajoule laboratory test shot ( vid above ) .
The ONR wants to see 64 MJ before actually looking to put anything into service .
Then there are other problems : existing launch rails only last three or four shots , and squashing down a steady supply from a ship 's engines into ultra - brief 64 megajoule pulses * is n't a simple matter .
This is presumably where the Texas Uni boffins come in . ®
Bootnote
* The proposed Zumwalt - class destroyers , cancelled last year , were to have used 80 megawatt gas turbine prime movers and electric drives .
If fitted with ONR 's desired 64 - MJ railguns , they could theoretically get off a bit better than one round per second ; though this would leave no juice left for propulsion .
At the other end of the spectrum , a Nimitz - class supercarrier has twin 550 - megawatt nuclear reactors .
A railgun dreadnought built to the same outrageous scale would be able to ripple off 15 irresistible Mach - 7 thunderbolts every second and still maintain steerage way .
Personally we 'd rather see the USN ( or someone , anyway ) building space battlecruisers : but the concept has a certain baroque appeal .
The families of Shankill bomber Thomas Begley and LVF leader Billy Wright would receive a £ 12,000 payment if proposals by the Eames - Bradley group on the past are accepted , the Belfast Telegraph can reveal today .
In a £ 40 m costed plan , all families who lost a loved one in the Troubles — security force , republican , loyalist and other — would be entitled to the new payment .
The proposal — from the Consultative Group on the Past — will be viewed as the most controversial recommendation as it will pave the way for families of terrorists killed during the Troubles to receive money .
Begley died in 1993 while planting a bomb in a fish shop on Belfast ’s Shankill Road which killed nine others .
Wright was murdered in 1997 by the INLA in the Maze Prison where he had been serving eight years for threatening to kill .
The plans aimed at dealing with Northern Ireland ’s violent past also propose that victims should be able to discover more details on how and why loved ones were killed .
Over 30 recommendations will be made in a nine - chapter , 200 - page report due to be unveiled by Lord Robin Eames and former Policing Board vice - chairman Denis Bradley in Belfast on Wednesday .
The document will be presented as The Report of the Consultative Group on the Past , which was formed in June 2007 by then Secretary of State Peter Hain .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown was briefed on the plan in Downing Street yesterday .
Today , the Telegraph reveals key elements of the Eames - Bradley blueprint — its plan and proposals for dealing with the past .
The recommendations also include :
l The Legacy Commission — three commissioners including an international chairman appointed by the British and Irish Governments after consultation with the First and Deputy First Ministers .
l Investigations Unit — part of the new Legacy Commission and headed by one of the three commissioners .
The proposal is confirmation that there will be no amnesty .
It will continue to investigate unsolved killings .
This replaces the Historical Enquiries Team and some of the Police Ombudsman ’s work .
Information Recovery Unit —
Part of the new Legacy Commission and headed by one of the three commissioners .
Its role will be to draw out information from republicans , loyalists , security forces and intelligence services as requested by families .
The aim is to provide families with as much information as possible on past killings .
Reconciliation Forum — will work alongside The Legacy Commission .
It will include the International Chairman of that commission , the Victims ’ Commissioners and the Community Relations Council .
The Belfast Telegraph understands there is a 12 - page chapter on Remembrance , but no proposal for a single memorial to remember all victims of the conflict .
Big goals in the recommended process will include combating sectarianism and creating a story - telling process on the conflict .
Eames - Bradley will set out aims and criteria for this .
Yesterday in Downing Street Mr Brown and Secretary of State Shaun Woodward were briefed by the co-chairs of the Consultative Group on the Past .
Belfast Telegraph
Our Colonial ancestors petitioned and pleaded with King George III to get his boot off their necks .
He ignored their pleas , and in 1776 , they rightfully declared unilateral independence and went to war .
Today it 's the same story except Congress is the one usurping the rights of the people and the states , making King George 's actions look mild in comparison .
Our constitutional ignorance -- perhaps contempt , coupled with the fact that we 've become a nation of wimps , sissies and supplicants -- has made us easy prey for Washington 's tyrannical forces .
But that might be changing a bit .
There are rumblings of a long overdue re-emergence of Americans ' characteristic spirit of rebellion .
Eight state legislatures have introduced resolutions declaring state sovereignty under the Ninth and 10th amendments to the U.S. Constitution ; they include Arizona , Hawaii , Montana , Michigan , Missouri , New Hampshire , Oklahoma and Washington .
There 's speculation that they will be joined by Alaska , Alabama , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Georgia , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Nevada , Maine and Pennsylvania .
You might ask , " Is n't the 10th Amendment that no - good states ' rights amendment that Dixie governors , such as George Wallace and Orval Faubus , used to thwart school desegregation and black civil rights ? "
That 's the kind of constitutional disrespect and ignorance that big - government proponents , whether they 're liberals or conservatives , want you to have .
The reason is that they want Washington to have total control over our lives .
The Founders tried to limit that power with the 10th Amendment , which reads : " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . "
New Hampshire 's 10th Amendment resolution typifies others and , in part , reads : " That the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General ( federal ) Government ; but that , by a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States , and of amendments thereto , they constituted a General Government for special purposes , delegated to that government certain definite powers , reserving , each State to itself , the residuary mass of right to their own self - government ; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force . "
Put simply , these 10th Amendment resolutions insist that the states and their people are the masters and that Congress and the White House are the servants .
Put yet another way , Washington is a creature of the states , not the other way around .
Congress and the White House will laugh off these state resolutions .
State legislatures must take measures that put some teeth into their 10th Amendment resolutions .
Congress will simply threaten a state , for example , with a cutoff of highway construction funds if it does n't obey a congressional mandate , such as those that require seat belt laws or that lower the legal blood - alcohol level to .08 for drivers .
States might take a lead explored by Colorado .
In 1994 , the Colorado Legislature passed a 10th Amendment resolution and later introduced a bill titled " State Sovereignty Act . "
Had the State Sovereignty Act passed both houses of the legislature , it would have required all people liable for any federal tax that 's a component of the highway users fund , such as a gasoline tax , to remit those taxes directly to the Colorado Department of Revenue .
The money would have been deposited in an escrow account called the " Federal Tax Fund " and remitted monthly to the IRS , along with a list of payees and respective amounts paid .
If Congress imposed sanctions on Colorado for failure to obey an unconstitutional mandate and penalized the state by withholding funds due , say $ 5 million for highway construction , the State Sovereignty Act would have prohibited the state treasurer from remitting any funds in the escrow account to the IRS .
Instead , Colorado would have imposed a $ 5 million surcharge on the Federal Tax Fund account to continue the highway construction .
The eight state legislatures that have enacted 10th Amendment resolutions deserve our praise , but their next step is to give them teeth .

Irish budget airline Ryanair has said it is considering charging passengers for using the toilet while flying .
Chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC that the Dublin - based carrier was looking at maybe installing a " coin slot on the toilet door " .
Consumer group
Which ?
said the airline was putting " profit before passengers " .
Ryanair 's PR chief Steven McNamara later played down the idea , saying : " I do n't think it 's going to happen in the foreseeable future " .
" Will it happen long - term , I 'm not really sure , " he said .
" It 's one of those things that when Michael starts looking at something , you know , it 's always up for discussion . "
Last week Ryanair confirmed it planned to close all of its airport check - in desks by the end of the year in a bid to reduce the cost of its flights .
' Fast buck '
Ryanair aims to offer low basic ticket prices , and then charge extra for items such as checking in at the airport or for additional luggage .
" One thing we have looked at in the past , and are looking at again , is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on the toilet door , so that people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future , " he told the BBC .
He added : " I do n't think there is anybody in history that has got on board a Ryanair aircraft with less than a pound . "
But Rochelle Turner , head of research at Which ?
Holiday , said : " It seems Ryanair is prepared to plumb any depth to make a fast buck and , once again , is putting profit before the comfort of its customers .
" Charging people to go to the toilet might result in fewer people buying overpriced drinks on board , though - that would serve Ryanair right . "

Brazilian Ministry of Education Embraces Open Source in a Big Way
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 03 , 2009
It 's no secret at this point a few of us at OStatic are passionate about the use and adoption of open source software in educational environments .
Education is an area where the use of open source software feels so natural , but hardware lifecycles , the timing of support and license expirations , and budget crunches slow down the adoption process for many educational institutions .
The Brazilian government officially embraced open source software in its schools , announcing it had selected Userful , Positivo , and ThinNetworks to supply 324,000 virtualized desktops in each of the country 's municipalities .
This is not only the largest deployment of virtualized desktops in the world -- it's also the largest single deployment of Linux desktops .
I 've talked a bit about Userful previously .
The Userful Multiplier software takes a single workstation and turns into a multi- head machine .
There are some specific hardware requirements , of course ( the number of " heads " the machine can support depends on video cards , available peripheral ports , and processing power ) , but a relatively modest desktop can support between two and ten seats .
Looking at some of the figures in the press announcement , a few things become clear .
It 's estimated that Brazil is saving roughly $ 47 million in up - front costs with this switch , and thanks to the 1 to 10 model , about $ 9 million in energy costs annually .
Userful says the cost of the deployment works out to a little less than $ 50 per seat .
Those are significant savings with a relatively little amount of money invested in the product itself .
One argument against using open source software in education is the rather vague combination of " it costs more than it would seem " and " it costs more over time and any savings do n't offset this . "
Here , finally , is a large scale , real - world case study .
It 's not that there are n't costs involved , and without a doubt the size of Brazil 's deployment lowered the deployment costs and increased the savings -- but this is a case that can be studied , scaled , and observed as time passes .
Brazil 's Ministry of Education is taking a chance -- I think it 's one that will give them an amazing return on investment -- but it has invested what 's still an impressive amount of money in something that 's not been done on that scale .
I believe it will be deemed a success in the short term when costs and savings are tabulated .
The real payoff might not be seen until these children graduate , however .
This is n't just a gain for schools in Brazil .
The Ministry of Education has effectively given educators everywhere with an interest in open source a working case study -- a real , honest to goodness leg to stand on when presenting open source alternatives to administrators and faculty .

The lead story of the March 9 , 2009 , edition of Newsweek says it all : " Stop Saving Now ! "
Writer Daniel Gross declares ,
For our $ 14 trillion economy to recover and thrive , hoarders must open their wallets and become consumers , and businesses must once again be willing to roll the dice .
Nobody is advocating a return to the debt - fueled days of 4,000 - square - foot second homes , $ 1,000 handbags and $ 6 specialty coffees .
But in our economy , in which 70 percent of activity is derived from consumers , we do need our neighbors to spend .
Otherwise we fall into what economist John Maynard Keynes called the " paradox of thrift . "
If everyone saves during a slack period , economic activity will decrease , thus making everyone poorer .
We also need to start investing again — not necessarily in the stock of Citigroup or in condos in Miami .
But rather to build skills , to create the new companies that are so vital to growth , and to fund the discovery and development of new technologies .
Now , this should hardly be surprising , coming from Newsweek , which has managed to mangle everything from economic analysis to the Duke lacrosse case .
Furthermore , it is based upon economic myths that are repeated twice weekly by Paul Krugman at the New York Times and Larry Summers in the White House — and about every other public intellectual .
However , we need to remind ourselves that we are hearing myths that not only represent wrongheaded economic thinking but that are also driving the US economy into a deep depression through reckless spending and resource destruction .
The actions of Obama and the Beltway are political in nature , but they have the veneer of economic " theory . "
If I can put the whole Keynesian set of fallacies into one statement , it would be this : the modern Keynesians believe that the economy operates like a perpetual motion machine , with government spending being the " grease " that keeps it from slowing down .
The " friction " in this economic machine , according to the pundits , is private saving .
Eliminate it , and the economy goes on forever , adding energy and expanding indefinitely .
Such a notion , of course , is nonsense and dangerous and delusional .
In fact , everything Gross says about the economy represents a view that becomes destructive when carried into policy .
Therefore , it is imperative that we lay out what the real foundations of an economy are and point out that the present behavior by consumers is badly needed if there is to be an economic recovery .
The first thing to do is to explain that the " paradox of thrift " is simply wrong .
This " paradox " is based upon the belief that if people increase their savings during an economic downturn , they consume even less , thus driving the economy further down .
People respond by saving even more until the economy implodes into a perverse " equilibrium " of high savings , low spending , and widespread unemployment .
Such a viewpoint is based upon the theory of the " perpetual motion " of an economy in which there is a " circular flow " : individual households combine with firms and government to produce goods that , in turn , are consumed by individual households .
As long as this flow goes on unimpeded ( or as long as consumers spend as much as they can ) , the economy will perform admirably with full employment .
However , if consumers save or " hoard " some of their money , then there will be a " leakage " from the system , which means that households cannot " buy back " the products they have produced .
The unpurchased goods then pile up in the inventories , so businesses must then cut back production and lay off workers .
This further triggers consumer uncertainty , which means they save even more money , and we are off to the downward races .
Paul Krugman writes ,
One way to look at the international situation right now is that we 're suffering from a global paradox of thrift : around the world , desired saving exceeds the amount businesses are willing to invest .
And the result is a global slump that leaves everyone worse off .
So that 's how we got into this mess .
And we 're still looking for the way out .
To combat this evil , government must fill the spending hole until savers realize that they can have confidence to become reckless spenders again .
However , if government fails to act , then the economy will fall into an even deeper hole .
Such a view is hardly the product of modern intellectuals .
Nearly three centuries ago , Bernard Mandeville wrote the " Fable of the Bees , " which is an intelligent way of phrasing the economic doctrines championed by Keynes and Krugman .
Likewise , others have claimed that unless consumers are forced to spend and spend , the perpetual motion machine known as an economy will grind to a halt , done in by the friction of what Karl Marx called the " internal contradictions " of capitalism .
Yet there is another view that has been well stated by Austrian economists such as Ludwig von Mises , F.A. Hayek , and Murray Rothbard .
In the present era , investment analyst Peter Schiff has been carrying a lot of the water .
After having been scorned for years on the financial talk shows , he is finally receiving a small amount of respect .
In this view , the economy grows because the very structure of production — the mix of capital goods , resources , and labor — is put in line with the patterns of spending and saving by consumers and households .
This is not a circular activity in which production is propped up by spending and cheap credit that accrues back to the households .
Instead , the act of saving provides a means for producers to obtain capital , and capital goods are then used to produce more goods using fewer resources so that the newly freed resources can be used to produce those things that were unavailable before .
This is a viewpoint that recognizes the law of scarcity .
It also recognizes that more consumption is made possible only by more production , but production that is done in line with both the spending and saving patterns of individuals in the economy .
If lines of capital are created that are not compatible with saving and spending patterns set by consumers , then the capital is malinvested .
Malinvestment does not occur by accident .
It happens because the government , through monetary authorities , has suppressed real interest rates and has touched off a credit - inspired boom that can not be sustained .
We first saw that in the stock - market bubble and then later in the housing bubble .
In both cases , the monetary authorities chose to hold down rates of interest to below - market levels and then to encourage people to borrow , borrow , borrow .
Both the stock market and housing " booms " made it seem like the economy was in great shape .
( Arthur Laffer told Peter Schiff in 2006 something akin to " the American economy has never been better , " while excoriating Schiff for saying that the US economy was teetering on the brink of disaster . )
In his book about the Clinton administration , Paul Begala declared that the economy during Bill Clinton 's years in power was " the best economy ever . "
Indeed , booms are fun while they last , but they must always end .
The US economy — indeed , the world economy — is in peril not because people suddenly have stopped spending and borrowing .
Instead , it is in peril because government policies have led to massive malinvestments that markets ( without the permission of government ) are liquidating as we speak .
Furthermore , we see the Obama administration demonizing the very sectors of the US economy — such as energy — that have shown strength .
Instead of facing the truth and permitting not only the malinvestments to fail , but a real recovery to take shape , Obama , Krugman , and their allies are insisting that all this " perpetual motion machine " known as an economy needs is a little more spending to lubricate the gears and send it on its merry way .
The truth is elsewhere , but the pundits and the political classes have stopped up their ears , shielded their eyes , and continued to run toward the edge of the cliff , demanding that the rest of us follow them .
Money manager Robert Allen Stanford now has two things in common with embattled investment manager Bernard Madoff : both have come under scrutiny for allegedly defrauding their investors , and both have given significant funds to politicians .
The Securities and Exchange Commission today accused Stanford , chief of Stanford Financial Group , of “ fraud in the sale of about $ 8 billion of high - yielding certificates of deposit held in the firm ’s bank in Antigua , ” according to the New York Times .
Between its PAC and its employees , Stanford Financial Group has given $ 2.4 million to federal candidates ( including both candidate committees and leadership PACs ) , parties and committees since 2000 , with 65 percent of that going to Democrats .
Stanford and his wife , Susan , have given $ 931,100 out of their own pockets , with 78 percent going to Democrats .
The top recipients of cash in the current Congress include Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , who received $ 45,900 ; Rep. Pete Sessions ( R - Texas ) , who collected $ 41,375 ; and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who brought in $ 28,150 .
( For a full list of recipients in the 111th Congress , see below .
For a full list of party committees and lawmakers , past and present , who have collected money from Stanford Financial Group , go here . )
The company gave the most during the 2002 election cycle , when Congress was debating the Financial Services Antifraud Network Act , a bill that would have created a computer network linking the databases of state and federal banking , securities and insurance regulators to curb financial fraud .
Lobbying reports indicate that Stanford Financial Group lobbied on the bill , which the House passed but the Senate did not .
Nelson was vice chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during the ’ 02 cycle , when the DSCC collected more than $ 800,000 from the company .
( UPDATE 2/18/09 : A spokesman for Nelson pointed out to Capital Eye that Nelson was not a member of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , where the antifraud act appears to have stalled in 2001 .
Nelson ’s spokesman said the senator supported the bill , which Stanford presumably opposed . )
Stanford Financial Group has spent a total of $ 4.8 million on lobbying efforts since 1999 , primarily on issues related to money laundering , financial services and banking .
Last year the firm ’s lobbying spiked by more than 300 percent , totaling $ 2.2 million , by far the most it has ever reported spending .
In addition to sending its own in - house lobbyists to Capitol Hill , the company also hired lobbying shop Ben Barnes Group last year to represent its interests .
These members of the 111th Congress have received contributions from the PAC and / or employees of the Stanford Financial Group since 2000 ( includes contributions to both candidate committees and leadership PACs ) :

Citi approached the government regarding its financial status .
Nationalization ?
Feds , Citi at the table
The federal government is in talks to beef up its ownership stake in Citigroup to as much as 40 percent of the company 's common stock , the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday — just days after the Obama administration said it did n't want to nationalize America 's largest banks .
Citigroup proposed the move to regulators , the Journal reported , and a Treasury Department spokesman signaled late Sunday that the government is open to the idea , even as he refused to discuss Citi directly .
Advertisement Treasury spokesman Isaac Baker told POLITICO : " We do n't comment on conversations with specific banks .
However , we are open to considering a request to [ convert preferred stock to common shares ] if the institution and its regulator believe it would promote the long - term stability of that institution , and if we believe it's in the best interest of the long - term stability of our economy and financial system . "
That represents a dramatic change of tone from White House press secretary Robert Gibbs on Friday .
" This administration continues to strongly believe that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go , ensuring that they are regulated sufficiently by this government , " Gibbs said at the time .
" That 's been our belief for quite some time . "
But throughout the week , stock market investors did n't believe the denials , and continued furiously selling bank stocks out of fear that a government takeover would wipe out shareholder value .
By the close of trading on Friday , Citigroup , one of the most beleaguered banks , traded at just $ 1.95 per share .
In some ways , it looked like the market 's worries about nationalization could have become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The collapse of Citi 's stock price makes it much more difficult for the bank to conduct business on Monday , and could spark a broad loss of confidence in the company 's viability .
It could also impact the stock price and future viability of other banks .
As global markets open for trading Monday , the fate of Citi , a bank with 200 million customer accounts and operations in more than 100 countries , hangs in the balance .
Media disclosure of the existence of the talks puts enormous pressure on the administration and the bank 's executives to come to terms overnight .
One source familiar with Citigroup 's thinking said late Sunday night that it will be important to have some kind of announcement ready by Monday morning , because confidence in Citi is eroding at such a rapid pace .
" Citibank is in 109 different countries , and no other bank has that kind of presence .
If there 's a run on the bank in the United States tomorrow , what 's going to happen in Europe and Latin America and Asia ? " the source said .
On Wall Street and in Washington , fierce debate has raged about bank nationalization — whether it represents a cure for the financial markets ' collapse or could trigger further economic catastrophe .
And although a 40 percent ownership stake in Citigroup would not give the federal government majority control of the bank , some inside the bank believe it would represent nationalization in all but name .
" Tomorrow , we may see de facto nationalization , " said the source .
" The thinking is that the stock is at such a low point right now that it can't have that much of a dilutive effect on the shareholders . "
The U.S. government already has a modest stake in Citigroup as a result of a $ 45 billion cash infusion to the company last fall .
The Journal reported bank executives would like to keep the government 's share closer to 25 percent .
But a bigger ownership position would be designed to reassure investors , businesses and individuals with Citi accounts that the bank is safe to do business with .
And presumably , federal regulators would exercise some degree of control over the bank 's restructuring , although it 's unclear exactly how much authority the federal government would exert .
One element that many will be looking for in any Citigroup announcement will be whether or not a government official takes a seat on Citi 's board of directors — such a move would signal that the feds intend to take a firm hand in running the bank 's future .
The deepening bank crisis threatens to overshadow the White House 's plans this week to focus on the budget deficit and other long - term policy and fiscal priorities .
The White House on Sunday night referred questions to Treasury .
Meanwhile , Bank of America Corp. said Sunday that it is n't discussing a larger ownership stake for the government .
" There are no talks right now over that issue , " Bank of America spokesman Robert Stickler told the Journal .
" We see no reason to do that .
We believe the goal of public policy should be to attract private capital into the bank , not to discourage it . "
Ahhh , stoner comedies , that potent blend of humour and hemp has delighted movie - going audiences since the first time someone lit up a joint on screen .
Yes , stoner comedies have a proud history within the annals of American cinema and given the success of the recent Seth Rogen action - pot comedy Pineapple Express , it seems only appropriate to look back through the smoky haze of time and examine the very best of the best .
So roll up a fatty , break out the roach clips and prepare to finally drain that rancid bong water as Film Junk presents …
THE TOP 10 GREATEST STONER COMEDIES
10 . Half Baked ( 1998 )
Like Doritos , lava lamps and zig - zag rolling papers , Half Baked has become a staple in the repertoire of any self - respecting stoner .
While itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s perhaps best known as Dave Chappelle ’s comedic breakout role , the film also stars Canadian comic Harland Williams and long since forgotten Saturday Night Live cast member Jim Breuer ( Goat Boy , anybody ? ) .
The plot follows Chappelle and company as they decide to start selling pot stolen from the medical research clinic where they ’re employed .
A local drug dealer soon finds out that theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re cutting into his action and hilarity – and over the top weed jokes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ soon ensue .
While the film is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t nearly as funny as ChappelleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s later work on his now defunct television series The Chappelle Show , Half Baked does have a few hilarious moments , including a drug - fuelled cameo from Bob Saget and of course , Chappelle strutting his stuff as rapper and ganja connoisseur Sir Smoka Lot .
9. Outside Providence ( 1999 )
While it ’s probably best known as one of the Farrelly brother ’s more introspective films ( while still fulfilling the prerequisite number of fart jokes ) Outside Providence is also a classic stoner comedy .
Based on Peter Farrelly ’s semi-autobiographical novel of the same name , the film stars Shawn Hatosy as burned out slacker Timothy “ Dunph ” Dunphy ; a teen who is forced to attend a well - to - do private school after getting high and crashing his van into the back of a police cruiser .
What follows is a hilarious send up of prep schools and pot smoking as Dunph pisses off the obligatory crusty dean of the school , picks up a local hottie ( played by perennial comedy go - to - girl Amy Smart ) and of course smokes an almost ungodly amount of weed ( including constructing a homemade bong out of a 55 gallon oil drum ) .
The cast is further rounded out with an unforgettable performance from Alex Baldwin and a much underrated appearance from George “ Norm from Cheers ” Wendt .
With a smart script , hilarious dialogue and some surprisingly poignant moments , Outside Providence hits all the right marks ; a stoner comedy capable of bringing both laughter – and tears – to even the most jaded of pot heads .
8. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ( 2001 )
When you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re high his movies are hilarious , and when you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not high theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re still pretty damn funny .
Yes , there ’s no doubt that Kevin Smith is the man when it comes to blending irreverent indie- filmmaking and pot humour .
Nowhere is this more evident than in his weed - loving leading characters Jay and his Chaplain - esque cohort Silent Bob .
The film follows the duoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s plan to head to Hollywood to thwart the making of an unapproved blockbuster film based on their lives .
Sure it may not be as smart or dramatic as SmithÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s script in Chasing Amy , but thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no denying the sheer awesomeness in watching Bluntman and Chronic take on a light sabre - wielding Mark Hamill as the villainous Cock - Knocker .
Nooch !
7. Saving Grace ( 2000 )
And who says the British are stuffy ?
Saving Grace proved that a movie could successfully blend snooty upper crust English society with some grade - A cheeba .
The film stars Brenda Blethyn ( who recently appeared in Atonement ; a film which , coincidentally , is only bearable while super high ) and is based on a script from Scottish funny man Craig Ferguson of Late Night TV fame .
The plot follows prim- and - proper British housewife Grace Trevethyn who is left with a sizable debt after her husband passes away .
With her life and country manor hanging in the balance , the widow Grace decides to use her well - seasoned green thumb to cultivate a crop of potent ganja .
The result is a quaint , quirky and incredibly well - written movie that goes down smoother than a bong hit of Panama Red .
6. Pineapple Express ( 2008 )
These days it seems like screenwriter - actor Seth Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg can’t take a dump without Hollywood agents trying to option it into a six - figure deal .
With Pineapple Express , the duo blends the best of both stoner comedies and action flicks into a film which follows a low - level processing server and his bumbling pot dealer as they go on the run from vicious mobsters .
While the film does have a few noticeable flaws on its otherwise perfectly rolled exterior , it ’s still a half - way decent flick .
More importantly though , Rogen and Goldberg ’s work on Pineapple Express has almost single - handedly revitalized the entire stoner comedy genre , giving an entirely new generation of slackers and potheads a reason to get blazed .
5. Detroit Rock City ( 1999 )
An underappreciated masterpiece in the annals of stoner comedies , Detroit Rock City skilfully blends both reefer and rock n’ roll , while also resuscitating the post - Terminator 2 career of Edward Furlong .
Directed by Adam Rifkin and based on a script by little - known horror scribe Carl V. DuprÃƒ
Â© , the film takes place in the summer of 1978 and follows a group of weed - loving teens who decide to cut class and head to Cleveland to check out a KISS concert .
What follows is a hilarious pot-fuelled road trip into sex , drugs and rock nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ roll and a comedic masterpiece that will covers the demographic trifecta of pot heads , film geeks and KISS fans alike .
4. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle ( 2004 )
The quintessential buddy - stoner comedy , Harold & Kumar remains a ground breaking film not only because of its portrayal of two young ethnic - minority Americans , but also in its loving homage to all things weed .
The film follows Harold and his best pal Kumar over the course of a single evening as they get baked , are overcome with the inevitable munchies and decide to cap it all off with a trip to the fast food underdog that is White Castle .
With diseased raccoons , giant anthropomorphic bags of weed and of course , an appearance from a coked - out Doogie Howser , what more could any stoner comedy fan ask for ?
3. Dazed and Confused ( 1993 )
The crown jewel of both teen comedies and stoner flicks , the film follows a group of teens during their last day of high school in the summer of 1976 .
Written and directed by Richard Linklater , Dazed also included an ensemble cast featuring Jason London , Matthew McConaughey , Milla Jovovich , Cole Hauser , Parker Posey , Joey Lauren Adams , Nicky Katt and a show stealing performance from a young Adam Goldberg .
While only a modest success at the box office , the film has since become a cult hit among both potheads and cinephiles , even gracing Quentin TarantinoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s picks for his 12 greatest films of all time .
Throw in a dash of brutal ass paddling , copious amounts of cannabis , and a noticeably chunkier Ben Affleck and the end result is one of the greatest stoner comedies of all time .
2. The Big Lebowski ( 1998 )
Call him the Dude , His Dudeness or El Duderino if you ’re not into the whole brevity thing , there ’s little doubt that Jeff Bridge ’s portrayal of “ The Dude ” is one of the greatest stoner heroes in movie history .
Based on a real life friend of legendary filmmakers the Coen brothers , The Big Lebowski crams bowling , pot , nihilists , severed toes , art and a gun totting Vietnam Vet into a Chandler - esque mystery story .
Unusual ?
Maybe , but the film has since become a cult classic , even spawning its own annual film festival and a recent book documenting the film ’s almost unheard of popularity .
Sure , most film aficionados feel it pales in comparison to the Coen brother ’s Academy Award winning No Country For Old Men , but ask any Lebowski fan worth their roach clips and they ’ll tell you : sociopathic hit man Anton Chigurh could definitely take a chill lesson from The Dude .
1. Cheech & Chong ’s Up in Smoke ( 1978 )
Whether you love it or hate it , there ’s no doubt that Up In Smoke almost single - handedly pioneered the entire stoner comedy film genre .
The first feature - length film released by the comedy duo ( who ’d been performing together for almost ten years before going mainstream ) , Up in Smoke was perhaps unsurprisingly a controversial smash hit when it was released in the late 70s .
Directed by Lou Adler ( who has the incredibly fucked up distinction of being a producer on both The Rocky Horror Picture Show AND The Care Bears Movie ) , the film follows Cheech and Chong ’s efforts to avoid the cops , pick up chicks , and of course , get unbelievably stoned .
Sure you could read deeper into the film ’s subtle exploration of late 70s socio- economics or its comedic deconstruction of American racism , but the truth is that Up in Smoke ( along with almost all of the films on our list ) was – and still is – best enjoyed while really , really , really high .
What do you think ?
Any other classic stoner comedies that should be on our top 10 list ?

Parodies of Hitler have been hitting YouTube for a couple of years now .
With the most recent success of Hitler ’s reaction to the Bills signing Terrell Owens , I thought I would review this phenomenon .
There are over a hundred parody videos on YouTube of the climactic scene from the 2004 movie , “ Downfall , ” in which Hitler displays a frightening tantrum in the presence of his officers .
YouTube posters have taken to pasting humorous subtitles over the action .
Honestly , it is entertaining as all hell , so we collected a few to share with you .

With a high media profile Bob was asked by the Australian Chamber of Commerce to train their Dragon Boat team and with Bob as part of the team they were back in the winner ’s circle .
Bob was instrumental in starting an Amateur Roller Hockey League between Macau , Hong Kong , Japan and China during the mid 80s .
Several of Hong Kong 7 ’s Rugby players regularly sought Bob ’s advice on conditioning techniques .
In addition , Bob wrote weekly children ’s Health and Fitness supplements for the Hong Kong Standard newspaper .
He was regularly featured in many of the local magazines and newspapers .
Bob built an exclusive reputation and accumulated an impressive list of clients , including the Billionaires , Royalty and Tai Pans of Hong Kong , as well as regular visiting VIPs .
Bob teamed up with a Doctor , Physiotherapist , Dietician and a Clinical Psychologist and started another company called Corporate Fitness .
Together they would work with many of Hong Kong ’s leading corporate executives .
The 90s
As a result of Bob ’s years of experience in charting physical assessment progress and writing exercise programs for thousands of clients , he compiled all that data developing and publishing a four stage , 30 minute based Home Fitness Program .
By 1996 , Bob was well established as Hong Kong and Australia ’s leading fitness celebrity with his reputation now reaching back to his hometown Sydney , where he decided to pursue his passion of building a Health Retreat .
Bob was once again in demand by the media with features in the Sunday Telegraph , The Sydney Herald , Channel 10′s Sports Tonight , NBN Newcastle Today Show and Alan Jones talk back radio program , Vogue and many other leading media outlets .
With construction well under way of his 5 acre retreat , Tranquel Private Retreat located in Dural northwest of Sydney ’s CBD , Bob was approached by the management of Sydney ’s leading five star hotel - The ANA Hotel – to operate their Health Club .
As a result Designer Fitness at the ANA Hotel became one of the most respected and successful executive Health Clubs in Australia .
The Tranquel Private Retreat was just completed when Bob was approached by the Inter - Continental Hotel group asking whether he would establish a Health Spa at their five star Resort in Cable Beach , Broome , Western Australia .
He then established Designer Fitness at the Inter - Continental Cable Beach Resort .
2000s
Now a successful businessman , Bob and his family decided to move to the Gold Coast , Queensland to spend more time together .
The Marriott Hotel and the Royal Pines Resort in Surfers Paradise regularly consulted Bob in the operation and management of their Health Clubs .
Bob was now dedicating his attention on his family eventuating in a EPL soccer scout inviting their young twin sons to trial in England .
Now moving to England one of their sons was accepted into the EPL club , West Bromwich Albion Football Academy .
Taking advantage of their move Bob trialed his Fitness Program in an elite Sports Academy in Birmingham .
2010 - Today
A quick visit to Beirut , Lebanon resulted in Bob and his family deciding to move there .
Eventually , Bob ’s identity became known resulting in his committed involvement as the Fitness Conditioning Coach for the newly formed Lebanese and Palestinian International Rugby Teams .
He traveled with the teams to different countries in the middle east to support them .
This led to Bob being recognised by the UNRWA in front of a high level delegation for his participation .
Bob eventually purchased a 15m / 50 ft sailing yacht and enjoyed sailing all over the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas for many years , eventually sailing to Gibraltar and then moved his yacht to the South China seas spending several years sailing between Langkawi , Malaysia and Phuket Thailand .
Today , while visiting his eldest son in Saigon , Vietnam he has offered his services as fitness coach for the Saigon AFL Vietnam Swans men ’s team .
I 'll grant that OnLive — the streaming game service that its makers claim will bring high - end games to virtually any PC or TV — borders on implausible , but you gotta beliiieevve !
For the haters , here 's a demo video .

Plenty is discussed here , and it's worth watching all the way through if you were at all intrigued by yesterday 's announcement .
The genuine boner moment is at around 15:00 , when a lowly Dell Studio 15 plays Crysis without even flinching .
The presenters discussed latency and did their best to demonstrate that OnLive does provide the same experience as a proper gaming machine , but until the service rolls out it 'll be impossible to tell if this is true .
If the games feel even slightly laggy it 'll be a huge blow —
OnLive will live or die by a few milliseconds .

Tskhinvali , South Ossetia —
On the sunny afternoon of August 14 , a Russian army colonel named Igor Konashenko is standing triumphantly at a street corner at the northern edge of Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia , his forearm bandaged from a minor battle injury .
The spot marks the furthest point of the Georgian army ’s advance before it was summarily crushed by the Russians a few days earlier .
“ Twelve Georgian battalions invaded Tskhinvali , backed by columns of tanks , armored personal carriers , jets , and helicopters , ” he says , happily waving at the wreckage , craters , and bombed - out buildings around us .
“ You see how well they fought , with all their great American training — they abandoned their tanks in the heat of the battle and fled . ”
Konashenko pulls a green compass out of his shirt pocket and opens it .
It ’s a U.S. military model .
“ This is a little trophy — a gift from one of my soldiers , ” he says .
“ Everything that the Georgians left behind , I mean everything , was American .
All the guns , grenades , uniforms , boots , food rations — they just left it all .
Our boys stuffed themselves on the food , ” he adds slyly .
“ It was tasty . ”
The booty , according to Konashenko , also included 65 intact tanks outfitted with the latest NATO and American ( as well as Israeli ) technology .
Technically , we are standing within the borders of Georgia , which over the last five years has gone from being an ally to the United States to a neocon proxy regime .
But there are no Georgians to be seen in this breakaway region — not unless you count the bloated corpses still lying in the dirt roads .
Most of the 70,000 or so people who live in South Ossetia never liked the idea of being part of Georgia .
During the violent land scramble that occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union , the South Ossetians found themselves cut off from their ethnic kin in North Ossetia , which remained part of Russia .
The Russians , who ’ve had a small peacekeeping force here since 1992 , managed to keep the brewing conflicts on ice for the last 15 years .
But in the meantime , the positions of everyone involved hardened .
The Georgians were n’t happy about the idea of losing a big chunk of territory .
The Ossetians , an ethnic Persian tribe , were more adamant than ever about joining Russia , their traditional ally and protector .
The tense but relatively stable situation blew up late in the evening of August 7 , when on the order of president Mikheil Saakashvili , Georgia ’s army swept into South Ossetia , leveling much of Tskhinvali and surrounding villages and sending some 30,000 refugees fleeing north into Russia .
Within hours , Russia ’s de facto czar Vladimir Putin counterattacked — some say he ’d set a trap — and by the end of that long weekend the Georgians were in panicked retreat .
The Russian army then pushed straight through South Ossetia and deep into Georgia proper , halting less than an hour ’s drive from Saakashvili ’s luxurious palace .
All around me is evidence of a rout .
A Georgian T - 72 tank turret is wedged into the side of a local university building , projecting from the concrete like a cookie pressed into ice cream .
Fifty yards away you can see the remains of the vehicle that the orphaned turret originally was part of : just a few charred parts around a hole in the street , and a section of tread lying flat on the sidewalk .
Russian tanks now patrol the city unopposed , each one as loud as an Einstrzende Neubauten concert , clouding the air with leaded exhaust as they rumble past us .
But listening to Colonel Konashenko , it becomes clear to me that I ’m looking at more than just the smoldering remains of battle in an obscure regional war :
This spot is ground zero for an epic historical shift .
The dead tanks are American - upgraded , as are the spent 40 mm grenade shells that one spetznaz soldier shows me .
The bloated bodies on the ground are American - trained Georgian soldiers who have been stripped of their American - issue uniforms .
And yet , there is no American cavalry on the way .
For years now , everyone from Pat Buchanan to hybrid - powered hippies have been warning that America would suddenly find itself on a historical downslope from having been too reckless , too profligate , and too arrogant as an unopposed superpower .
Even decent patriotic folk were starting to worry that America was suffering from a classic case of Celebrity Personality Disorder , becoming a nation of Tom Cruise party - dicks dancing in our socks over every corner and every culture in the world , lip - synching about freedom as we plunged headfirst into as much risky business as we could mismanage .
And now , bleeding money from endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , we ’re a sick giant hooked on ever - pricier doses of oil paid for with a currency few people want anymore .
In the history books of the future , I would wager that this very spot in Tskhinvali will be remembered as both the geographic highwater mark of the American empire , and the place where it all started to fall apart .
An Australian woman has appeared in court in Adelaide charged with murdering her husband by setting fire to his penis .
Rajini Narayan , 44 , is alleged to have doused her husband , Satish , with a flammable liquid while he was sleeping .
When she set him alight , Mr Narayan jumped out of bed and knocked over the substance , causing the fire to spread .
Mrs Narayan told the court she had not intended to kill her husband but to punish him for his alleged infidelity .
Prosecutor Lucy Boord said Mrs Narayan had confessed to her neighbours , telling them she was a " jealous wife " and believed her husband was having an affair .
" I just wanted to burn his penis so it belongs to me and no one else , I did n't mean this to happen , " Ms Boord quoted Mrs Narayan as saying .
The fire , on 8 December 2008 , caused damage to the couple 's house estimated at A$ 1 m ( $ 715,000 , £ 490,000 ) .
Mrs Narayan was initially charged with arson and endangering life - including the lives of her three children who were in the house at the time .
The charge was upgraded to murder after Mr Narayan died from his injuries last week .
She has been held in police custody pending the results of a psychological assessment .

" It looked like hail on the ground - like snow - there were so many shrouds .
Everywhere you looked in the city , there were shrouds , " Yassir Nadir recalls with a shudder .
" The hospitals and mortuaries were overflowing .
People just dropped dead in the street while they were walking .
" I saw with my own eyes a dead man being taken on a stretcher to the morgue , when suddenly he sat up .
Who knows how many other living people did not wake in time . "
A quarter of a century has passed since Bhopal suffered the world 's worst industrial disaster , but its legacy lingers .
There is an air of palpable sadness hanging over the city - and everybody has a story to tell about that night .
And the Indian government has at last decided to fund new research into the long - term health effects of the toxic leak .
' Chaos on the streets '
At five - past midnight on 3 December 1984 , a gas tank exploded at the US - owned Union Carbide pesticides manufacturing plant , releasing 40 tonnes of methyl isocyanate ( MIC gas ) in a lethal cloud that dispersed over the densely populated city of nearly a million people .
My eyes began to sting , and I thought someone must be cooking nearby with chillies
At least 2,000 people died that night , according to government figures - aid organisations estimate 5,000 died in the first 72 hours , and a further 15,000 in the following weeks .
Of the living , at least 100,000 are chronically ill from their exposure to the toxic gas , and a further 30,000 are still drinking and washing in contaminated groundwater .
Nadir was lucky .
He was visiting friends a few kilometres from the old city .
" My eyes began to sting , and I thought someone must be cooking nearby with chillies .
We were watching The Godfather film and it started to look a little blurry , but I did n't think anything of it , " he says .
" The next day I went to the school where I worked as an administrator , and found it shut and chaos on the streets .
BHOPAL : THE TOXIC LEGACY
Prior to the 1984 leak , pesticide wastes were dumped to the north and east of Bhopal city
The chemical waste was disposed of in landfill sites and three purpose - built ponds Campaigners say chemicals from these ponds are now contaminating the groundwater Locals claim a range of disorders : skin , eye , joint and intestinal problems ; rising cancer rates Sambhavna Trust Clinic has campaigned for clean water to be piped in for drinking and bathing
It also wants the current site owner , Dow Chemical , to clean up and seal the ponds Dow Chemical , which bought Union Carbide , says it is not responsible for the mess Indian government says it does not have the resources to decontaminate the area Protests in 2007 led to the government funding a limited supply of piped water The Bhopal explosion remains the subject of ongoing court cases in India and the US " People were running from the city leaving everything behind - all of their belongings , even their children .
But nobody knew anything about what had happened . "
In fact , it was n't until three days after the incident that most people , including Nadir , learned what had occurred via radio and newspaper reports .
MIC is a highly reactive gas that attacks the eyes and lungs , blinding and suffocating its victims .
" It attacks the alveoli and crosses the pulmonary barrier into the bloodstream , from where it affects every other organ , " says Roopa Baddi , a GP who treats patients in the shanty area surrounding the now - defunct plant .
She reels off a list of conditions that she sees resulting from the gas , including incidences that are far higher than the national average of lung diseases such as fibrosis and tuberculosis ; cancers , especially of the bladder , cervix , lungs and oesophagus ; eye disorders , such as early - onset cataracts and blurred vision ; infertility and menstrual problems ; kidney ( renal ) failure ; joint problems ; mental health issues and damage to the immune system .
Women who were pregnant at the time of the explosion suffered a high proportion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths .
And many children born after in - utero exposure - or conceived after the incident but whose parents were exposed - have health problems and retarded growth and development , a team of researchers reported in 2003 in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( Jama ) .
A lack of data The Sambhavna Clinic , with its calm , clean design and beautifully tended garden of medicinal herbs , rises brilliantly out of the sprawl of slum dwellings , open sewers and litter - strewn alleys that surround the closed pesticides plant .
The charitable centre , with its eco design features including rainwater harvesting , solar panels and waste water recycling , feels like a physical embodiment of the area 's hopes .
And judging by the queues of patiently waiting locals , quite a few are pinning theirs on it .
The clinic , which treats only victims of the pesticide plant , using conventional and herbal medicines in combination with techniques such as yoga , was borne out of frustration at the lack of care being provided for the victims by the government .
GPs see patients with a range of disorders
It is funded through donations from individuals , mainly by British people responding to newspaper ads , and the royalties from a book on the subject by the French writers Dominique LaPierre and Javier Moro .
Inside , " Sathyu " ( Satinath ) Sarangi , a tall man , wearing Western clothes topped off with a traditional turban , greets me with a gentle smile .
Sathyu helped set up the clinic and research centre in 2001 and was one of the authors of the 2003 Jama study .
He says that one of the main difficulties doctors face is a lack of biological data on the effects of the gas .
" Union Carbide , and its current owner Dow Chemical Company , are continuing to withhold the results of studies into the effects of MIC on living tissue that were done at Carnegie - Mellon Institute in the late - 70s and early 80s , " he says .
" There is no treatment protocol for the complex conditions that people exhibit and so the doctors treat the symptoms with large quantities of painkillers , antibiotics or steroids , all of which compound the problem with their side effects . "
Union Carbide maintains that is has shared all toxicity information with the Indian government .
Memorial plant
There has never been an official investigation into the long - term health effects of the leak .
The Indian government stopped its research into the medical effects of the gas without explanation 15 years ago .
Now , the Indian Council of Medical Research has announced that it will fund scientists investigating the long - term health effects of the disaster and to " see whether the toxic waste posed a threat to people even now " .
It 's a small victory for Sathyu and his colleagues , who have spent the past two - and - a - half decades campaigning for adequate medical treatment and financial compensation for the victims , and for those responsible to be punished - so far , the US and Indian officials convicted have escaped sentences .
Many survivors want the UC plant preserved as a memorial
This is a tragedy that could so easily have been avoided .
If cost - cutting officials at the plant had not shutdown the tank 's regulatory pressurisation and refrigeration systems ; if the valves had been maintained properly and not allowed to leak water into the gas tank , sparking a catastrophic runaway reaction ; if the vapour absorption ( " scrubbing " ) system had been in use , it might never have happened .
Perhaps the sorriest fact is that the MIC need not have been there at all .
It was an intermediate , not a product or raw material .
After the disaster , Du Pont announced that it would use MIC in its plants as soon as it is produced , so that instead of 40 tonnes in a tank there would be only 5 - 10 kg in a pipeline .
Groups representing the survivors and victims of the tragedy appealed to Unesco earlier this month for the Union Carbide plant to be preserved as an Industrial Heritage Site of international importance , so that the building would stand as a memorial to the disaster and educate future generations .
Survivors say that they will " physically block " any attempts to dismantle the remaining structure .
Other Unesco Industrial Heritage Sites include the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz .
The ICMR initiative is directed at outside research groups because it does not have the staffing itself to undertake the research .
Study areas will include investigations looking at whether the toxic gases caused genetic disorders , low - birth weight , growth and development disorders , congenital malformation , retardation of genitalia ; and reproductive functions will also be assessed .
The issue of whether chromosomal abnormalities have resulted from exposure will be substantiated by a trans - generational study among those who were exposed , and unaffected people of Bhopal .
The research will also examine whether the toxic waste poses a threat to people even now .

In the face of increasing gang violence in Canada , Member of Parliament Bill Siksay ( Burnaby — Douglas , NDP ) called for an end to drug prohibition during members ’ statements yesterday .
“ Alcohol prohibition did not work , ” he said .
“ It took ending prohibition and implementing alcohol control policies to restore respect for the law and make progress . ”
His statement :
Mr. Speaker , people all over greater Vancouver are deeply concerned about gang violence .
While tough on crime measures always top the list of potential fixes , there is a growing realization that drug prohibition policies are making the situation worse .
Alcohol prohibition did not work .
Many of the same problems now associated with the drug trade were experienced in the United States during its period of alcohol prohibition .
Gang violence that often caught innocent citizens , impure and dangerous alcohol sold in black markets , home stills and underground production , untreated addictions and family dislocation were all serious issues .
It took ending prohibition and implementing alcohol control policies to restore respect for the law and make progress on alcohol related social issues .
We must apply what we know to be true .
We must move from prohibition to drug control regimes modelled on the experience of alcohol prohibition and control .
Bold steps to confront our drug use hypocrisy and end the profitability of illegal drugs will make our communities safer .

though it ’s not been mentioned much lately amid the sea of bailout headlines , the global economy is n’t the only thing melting down right now .
So are the polar ice caps .
As nasa climatologist James Hansen has warned , we are nearing — if we have n’t already passed — the tipping point at which the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere becomes so high that feedback loops will cause it to keep increasing on its own even if humans never emit another CO 2 molecule again .
To keep the planet habitable , he says , we must cut emissions not 10 , not 20 , but a full 80 percent by 2050 ; anything short of that will lead to “ global cataclysm . ”
Fine then .
We need to fix the climate , and we need to start yesterday .
President Obama plainly understands this .
His environmental rhetoric has focused mainly on things like wind farms and green jobs , but the backbone of his climate policy is actually an ambitious program that , if done right , will reduce greenhouse gases and raise desperately needed revenue — and , most important of all , has a fighting chance of making it through the congressional sausage factory in one piece .
If he sticks to his guns , the idea will be a household term before the year is out .
It ’s called cap and trade , and it springs from a simple yet surprisingly hard - to - answer question :
What ’s the best , and fastest , way to reduce pollution ?
When serious environmental regulation began in the late ’ 60s , the default approach was “ command and control , ” which is exactly what it sounds like .
Take , for example , the Clean Air Act of 1970 .
It gave the government power to regulate six airborne pollutants , and the epa did this by setting firm limits on these pollutants .
That ’s the command part .
States then developed various mechanisms for meeting epa standards ; one was to require companies to install “ Best Available Control Technology ” for reducing pollutants .
That ’s the control part .
Command and control works : Back in the mid-’70s , Los Angeles , the smog capital of the country , suffered through 200 days per year of ozone levels above the federal standard .
Today it has fewer than 100 .
But is there a better way ?
More to the point , is there a cheaper , more flexible way ?
Enter cap and trade , a concept that ’s been the go - to approach in environmental wonk circles for years .
The theory is straightforward .
Suppose you have two plants , and the first one is able to eliminate one ton of pollutants at a cost of $ 10,000 .
The second plant , perhaps because it uses a different fuel or newer boiler technology , can do the same for only $ 4,000 .
Under command and control , if you required them to remove one ton each , the cost would total $ 14,000 .
But what if all you mandated was that two tons of pollutants be removed overall ( the cap part ) and allowed the plants to work out how to do it ?
Naturally , the first plant would just pay the second plant $ 4,000 to remove an extra ton of pollutants from its emissions ( the trade part ) .
At first this seems suspect :
The first plant is being allowed to merrily pollute away .
But you ’ve still removed two tons of pollutants , and since it was done more cheaply — for $ 8,000 instead of $ 14,000 — you can afford to ratchet down the cap .
You can require that three tons of pollutants be eliminated overall , and since this still costs only $ 12,000 , everyone comes out ahead .
The public gets cleaner air , and the plants save money .
Sounds great , you say , but does it work in practice ?
We found out in 1990 , when the Clean Air Act was modified to address acid rain pollution caused by sulfur dioxide from coal - fired power plants .
Instead of requiring every plant to install a specific cleanup technology or meet a specific emission rate , the epa simply set a nationwide cap on the total volume of SO 2 emissions and required power plants to own a permit for each ton of SO 2 they emitted .
Each plant was allocated a certain number of permits , and if a plant reduced its emissions to the point where it did n’t need all its permits , it could sell them to the highest bidder .
The results were better than anyone expected .
According to figures collected by the Environmental Defense Fund , power plants regulated under the Clean Air Act did n’t just meet the cap but ended up with about 20 percent lower emissions overall — at about one - third the cost estimated before the law ’s passage .
Not all of that extra reduction was due to the trading option , but it ’s clear that the flexibility of the permits — and the chance to make money by selling them — motivated plants to cut emissions as much as possible , as cheaply as possible .
( You can check out the emissions market for yourself , if you ’d like , the same way you ’d check an online broker to see how your stocks are doing .
At press time , emissions - credit broker Evolution Markets listed a permit for a ton of SO 2 at about $ 185 . )
Carbon emissions , given that they are perhaps the defining feature of our economy , are a more daunting problem than SO 2 ever was .
No single proposal will solve the problem — not solar panels , wind farms , green buildings , better cars , new train lines , or new power plants .
But if there ’s a single force that can help drive all the other innovations we need , it ’s putting a price on carbon emissions .
That ’s the base on which we ’ll build everything else .
And the way that price will be set , it now seems , is the stuff of an epic political battle that will begin this spring if Congress takes up a global warming bill .
So as the rhetoric heats up , here are the 10 key things to keep in mind .
1. Price matters .
Honest .
The whole point of cap and trade is to raise the price of emitting carbon .
If power plants have to buy a $ 100 permit for every ton of carbon they emit , the price of electricity will go up , and people will use less of it .
Likewise , if refineries have to buy a permit for every ton of carbon their gasoline produces , the price of filling your tank goes up , and you end up driving less .
True , this effect sometimes takes a while .
Gasoline prices in the United States more than doubled between 2002 and 2007 , for example , and drivers barely responded .
In economic lingo , the “ elasticity ” of gasoline consumption is low :
It takes a big increase to make any kind of impact on people ’s driving habits .
Nonetheless , it does work .
Total miles driven started to flatten out in 2006 and finally dropped sharply last year , when a gallon of regular hit $ 4 .
( Interestingly , driving has n’t increased significantly since — economists blame the recession . )
What ’s more , price signals allow all of us to cut our carbon use in our own way , instead of being stuffed into a regulatory straitjacket .
For example , driving and eating meat are both fairly carbon intensive .
If the government requires everyone to cut back on their gas use and meat consumption equally , most of us will have something to be unhappy about :
Maybe I really love my sirloin , and you ’re attached to your suv .
But if instead it raises the price of carbon — an increase that will be reflected in the price of carbon - intensive goods — we ’ll each give up the thing we care about least simply because the cost has gone up .
You might keep your Jeep and eat more tofu , while I ’ll keep eating steak but buy a Prius .
And carbon is reduced just as much .
2 . Yes , it ’s basically a tax .
If you think that buying a $ 100 permit to emit a ton of carbon is pretty much the same thing as paying a tax of $ 100 per ton of carbon , you ’re right .
And if you talk to economists , you ’ll find that most of them actually prefer a straight tax .
It ’s simpler , more consistent , and more predictable .
Dan Rosenblum of the Carbon Tax Center , which advocates a straight - up tax , calls that approach the “ gold standard ” and asks , “ If you ’re going to have a tax , why not have the best possible tax ? ”
Even some conservative economists , like Greg Mankiw , a former chairman of George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisors , support a carbon tax as a way of more accurately capturing the true economic cost of carbon emissions .
Cap - and - trade plans have a couple of specific disadvantages over taxes .
They produce economic uncertainty because permits are sold on the open market and prices vary the same way stock prices do ; that ’s a problem for companies trying to decide which technologies are worth investing in .
As Rosenblum puts it , “ If you do n’t know where prices are going to be in two or three years , you ca n’t invest rationally . ”
Moreover , international trade organizations have a lot of experience harmonizing taxes and tariffs , but they have n’t been very good at setting quantitative rules for how much pollution should be allowed .
And since the entire world eventually needs to agree on a set of carbon pricing tools , this matters .
A lot .
Cap and trade can also mesh poorly with local rules .
If Colorado passes a regulation that cuts electricity use , for example , its utilities will pollute less and need fewer emission permits , which means the cost of permits goes down .
But if the cost of permits goes down , then utilities in other states will increase their emissions to the point where the Colorado rule might have no net effect at all .
Because of these two problems , says Dallas Burtraw , an economist at Resources for the Future , “ the tax approach , on net , wins in my mind . ”
Except it ’s not so simple .
As Grist ‘s David Roberts has pointed out , “ The carbon tax that economists talk about is a whiteboard tax ” ; in real life , things are messier .
Congress loves nothing more than fiddling with the tax code to favor one interest group or another , and corporate America knows better than to assume that today ’s levies will be the same tomorrow .
The basic tradeoff is this :
With a tax , you know exactly what the price of carbon will be , but you do n’t know for sure how much carbon reduction that tax will get you .
You have to guess .
With cap and trade , you do n’t know for sure how much carbon will cost , but you do know exactly how much carbon reduction you ’ll get .
Whatever technical flaws cap and trade may have compared with taxes , this by itself is enough to convince most environmental groups that it ’s a superior approach .
3. Europe is already doing it .
In 2005 the European Union started phase one of its Emission Trading Scheme .
The initial rollout was a fizzle .
Too many permits were allocated , enforcement was weak , and permit prices dropped to as low as 2 cents per ton by the end of 2007 .
As early as 2006 , one major European environmental group was already complaining that “ lax implementation of the ets is a major disappointment . ”
But phase two , which began in 2008 , has proved more robust .
At press time , CO 2 permits were selling for about $ 17 per ton .
That is still too low , but the plan is for cap levels to decrease in the future and for more industries to be brought under the ets umbrella .
As that happens , the price of permits will continue to rise , and the market will work its magic .
The EU is fully committed to cap and trade .
If the United States wants to be part of a global carbon reduction strategy , learning from the ets and eventually integrating with it is probably our best bet .
4 . There ’s no such thing as a free permit .
One of the key issues with any cap - and - trade system is how you allocate permits .
Power plants would like to get them for free , and at first glance this seems appealing .
If you set the overall carbon cap at 90 percent of current levels , and allocate only that number of permits , that should reduce carbon without raising prices for the consumer .
After all , the power plants did n’t have to pay for the permits , so there are no costs to pass along .
Right ?
Oddly enough , no .
The economic theory involved is a little hairy , but those permits have a value on the open market , and that means that in many cases marginal producers can make more money selling their permits than by producing power .
They ’ll only be willing to produce power if they can raise prices enough to make the power - producing business more profitable than the permit - selling business , and eventually everyone will jack up prices to follow suit .
This may sound abstract — even a bit fantastical — but it ’s absolutely real .
In fact , when permits in phase one of Europe ’s ets system were handed out for free , electricity prices rose and power companies pocketed a windfall profit ( which Britain ’s Department of Trade and Industry estimated at about $ 1.1 billion a year in the UK alone ) .
Dale Bryk , an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council ( nrdc ) , puts it bluntly : “ If you ask them point - blank if they ’ll charge customers for free permits , they wo n’t tell you .
But they know they will . ”
A better way is for the government to hold an auction to set the price of permits .
This has a couple of extremely salutary effects .
First , it puts everyone on a level playing field ( since Congress has no ability to allocate permits to favored interests ) .
Second , and even better , the money from selling the permits goes to the federal government , not to the carbon emitters .
That ’s a pretty useful revenue stream , one that would probably start out at about $ 20 to $ 30 billion per year and go up steadily as the cap came down and the price of carbon permits increased .
5 . It matters what you do with the money .
One of the problems with cap and trade , as with any energy tax , is that it ’s regressive .
In absolute terms , poor families spend less on energy than rich families , but they spend a greater share of their income , and this means that higher energy prices hit the poor especially hard .
The Congressional Budget Office , for example , estimates that the price increase from a moderate cap - and - trade plan would cost low - income families 3.3 percent of their income , compared with only 1.7 percent for better - off families .
Reducing greenhouse emissions may be a global priority , but should it be done on the backs of the poor ?
In a cap - and - trade system where permits are given away , there ’s nothing you can do about this .
In fact , because the windfall profits of such a system benefit shareholders in fossil fuel firms , who are generally high earners , you really would be taxing the poor to benefit the rich .
But in a system where carbon permits are auctioned off , this imbalance can be addressed .
James Boyce and Matthew Riddle of the Political Economy Research Institute favor a policy called “ cap and dividend , ” which rebates 100 percent of the auction revenue back to the public , much the way that Alaska issues checks to its residents based on tax revenue from the oil industry .
Alternatively , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has proposed a “ climate rebate ” program aimed exclusively at poor families that allocates 14 percent of permit auction revenues to replace the buying power that low - income households would lose from higher energy prices .
( Families would get the money via existing , proven programs such as the earned income tax credit . )
The rest of the revenue stream would be left over for investments in energy efficiency , mass transit , and green R&D .
This also might make cap and trade attractive to politicians who are wedded to congressional pay - as - you - go rules ( which prevent spending on new programs unless there are new tax revenues to pay for them ) .
“ Given the fact that Democrats want to stick to paygo rules and no one wants to raise middle - class taxes , ” says Tony Kreindler of the Environmental Defense Fund , “ an auction starts to look very attractive . ”
6. Technology innovation is key .
One reason the acid rain cap - and - trade program worked so well is that it did n’t require inventing any new technology .
That ’s decidedly not the case for carbon .
Here , cap and trade needs to fairly quickly generate prices high enough to not just prompt us to drive less , insulate our houses better , and install more solar panels .
To get to the 80 percent reduction we need , we also need major technology breakthroughs — what economist William Nordhaus calls “ radical innovation . ”
That ’s going to happen only if the price is so high that people can make a lot more money by eliminating carbon than by emitting it .
7. Cap and trade is politically feasible .
As Kreindler says , “ Mention the word ‘ tax ’ in Washington and everyone runs behind a tree . ”
Even 15 years after the fact , Democrats still talk nervously about being “ Btu-ed , ” a reference to the Clinton administration ’s proposed energy tax in 1993 , which some House Democrats blamed for losing their seats in the 1994 Republican landslide .
Cap and trade ’s market - friendly trading mechanism , combined with the fact that the acid rain program was so successful , makes it far more likely than a tax to survive on Capitol Hill .
8 . The cap needs to keep coming down over time .
Kreindler advises that the most important part of an effective cap - and - trade plan is setting a short - term target that prompts substantive action right away .
A good place to start , he says , would be to plan on a 2012 launch with the cap targeted to provide a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 .
But that ’s only the beginning .
“ It ’s important to keep compliance costs low at first in order to maintain political support , ” Kreindler says .
But if we want to eventually reduce emissions by 80 percent , the cap has to keep coming down year after year — and it should do so at a predictable rate .
If businesses know what the cap level will be in future years , they can estimate carbon costs more reliably and make green investments more rationally .
9 . You have to get the details right .
There are plenty of bells and whistles you can build into a cap - and - trade program .
A safety valve , for example , sets a maximum price on permits , providing some predictability .
A circuit breaker does much the same thing by freezing the cap level if the price of permits gets too high .
Banking , a feature of the acid rain program , allows carbon emitters to hold on to permits in years when they do n’t need them and then use ( or sell ) them later .
Finally , and most controversially , there are offsets .
A power plant in Georgia might fund tree - planting programs in the Amazon to earn permits , for example , which seems like a good idea at first glance .
But who ’s going to check that those trees really get planted and really stay put ?
Offsets can be useful , but tight regulation is critical .
10 .
It ’s not a panacea .
“ Cap and trade is just a tool , ” says the nrdc ‘s Bryk .
It might be the backbone of any effective long - term carbon reduction policy , but it ’s not the only tool we need .
Or even necessarily the best .
If you want to improve vehicle mileage , for example , raising federal fuel - efficiency standards is “ much cheaper for consumers than raising the price of gas , ” she says .
Michael O’Hare , a public - policy professor at UC - Berkeley , emphasizes the need for the government to take a more active role than just setting carbon prices .
Sure , higher energy prices might motivate people to change their behavior .
“ But , ” he points out , “ even if I want to take the tram , I ca n’t do it if there ’s no tram . ”
In other words , command and control will remain absolutely necessary .
As will taxes .
Even with a well - designed cap - and - trade plan in place , we ’ll need tougher efficiency standards , higher fuel taxes , more sensible land - use policies , green research programs , and plenty more .
But in the same way that cutting calories is the core of any weight loss no matter which fad diet you follow , raising the price of carbon is the core of any climate plan .
With luck , this could be the year we finally figure that out .
The Department of Modest Proposals
“ Gideon Rachman ” : http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2009/03/the-department-of-sensitive-words/ identifies a hitherto unknown apparatus of Britain ’s bureaucracy .
However , I have now discovered a genuine government department with a title straight out of Dickens – it is the Department of Sensitive Words .
This excellent institution has been brought to my attention by a man who is trying to establish a think - tank and to use the word “ Institute ” in its title .
Since my friend is still involved in sensitive negotiations with the Department of Sensitive Words , I have promised not to reveal his identity .
The problem is that Companies House deems certain words as “ sensitive ” because they are thought to convey an impression of authority or trustworthiness .
Institute is one such word ; British is another .
If you want to use a word like this you have to get special permission from a sub-unit of Companies House – the Department of Sensitive Words , which is based in Swansea .
In true Dickensian style , this is not an easy process .
Companies
House does provide a few guidelines on sensitivity on its web - site ( its chapter three ) .
But there is no form you can fill in and no obvious criteria to fulfill .
But this is probably for the best .
You do n’t want any old person calling themselves “ British ” or “ Institute ” .
This is an _excellent_ idea , and one which should have been implemented in the US decades ago .
From Kim Phillips - Fein ’s new book , _Invisible Hands : The Making of the Conservative Movement from the New Deal to Reagan_ ( Amazon , Powells )
In 1962 , the executive committee of the board of trustees recommended that [ the American Enterprise Association ] change its name to the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research , so that it would no longer be confused with a “ trade association ” lobbying on behalf of business : the new name would “ more accurately describe the nature and legal status of the organization . ”
An “ association ” sounded like the Chamber of Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers – an institute , on the other hand , was austere , noble and pure .
Heaven forfend that the American Enterprise Institute would _ever_ be confused with a group of people shilling on behalf of business .
More generally , there is a real problem in a political system where an organization with a grand title such as Americans for Fairness , Liberty and Free Choice in the Workplace ( this is an invented organization using some of the usual buzzwords – I imagine that lobbyists automate the process of name creation with a sekrit perl script ) typically consists of nothing more than a few reams of letterhead and a time - share arrangement over some law office ’s fax machine .
Not only will consumers will end up confused by the profusion of astroturf groups , but the generation of such confusion is precisely the purpose .
It is just this kind of market failure that governments are supposed to address .
Hence my modest proposal – that the Obama administration set up a similar office , with sweeping authority and immediate effect .
I can see that libertarians might possibly get upset , but they really should n’t .
After all , they suffer more than most from the market failure in question .
The term ‘ libertarian ’ has been heavily debased over the last few years by groups and individuals who describe themselves as libertarians , but are committed to state torture of suspected bad guys , semi-ubiquitous surveillance of electronic communications and the like .
One of the first tasks that the US Inter - Agency Task Force on Sensitive Words might set itself would be to institute a proper set of standards to police self - described libertarians , clearly distinguishing between libertarians themselves ( the real thing ) , schmibertarians ( those tacitly in favour of torture and surveillance ) , glibertarians ( those who prefer not to think about political commitments that extend beyond a cheery embrace of Econ 101 as teh awesome ) and Gibletarians ( I _WANT_ SLOW THROTTLING !!!
AND I WANT IT NOOWWWW !!!!!! ) .
I ca n’t see how this would n’t improve our public discourse .
About 60 people marched and rallied in Oakland on Wednesday to condemn the police and honor Lovelle Mixon , who was killed by Oakland police after he fatally shot four officers Saturday .
" OPD you ca n't hide - we charge you with genocide , " chanted the demonstrators as they marched along MacArthur Boulevard , near the intersection with 74th Avenue where Mixon , 26 , a fugitive parolee , gunned down two motorcycle officers who had pulled him over in a traffic stop .
He killed two more officers who tried to capture him where he was hiding in his sister 's apartment nearby .
Grendon Prison in Buckinghamshire is an unlikely bastion of old - world courtesy and so , as we begin a discussion group in G - wing in Britain 's only self - avowedly therapeutic jail , I have to be reminded by Roy , one of the inmates , first to go round the room to give everyone the chance to introduce themselves properly .
It is a small detail but one that goes to the core of Grendon 's community ethos .
This begins for new prisoners when they arrive at the main entrance and officers tell them that here – unlike any other penal institution they 've ever been in or ever will be in – everyone is on first - name terms .
I offer a short spiel about coming to observe a day in the life of a jail which is nearing its half century but remains an anomaly in Britain 's overcrowded prison estate , which is perpetually under threat from Ministry of Justice bureaucrats who favour " Titan " jails run by private contractors where inmates are stacked high and costs kept low , but which has just picked up the annual Longford Prize as , in the judges ' words , " a beacon of hope for the Prison Service because of its proven track record in cutting reoffending and promoting the principles of rehabilitation " .
The group listens to me in polite silence .
Roy is the next up .
He has been in Grendon , he announces matter - of - factly , for the past two - and - a - half years of his life sentence for rape and murder .
Then comes Andy , who sexually abused and then murdered his wife and daughter .
Tony is also a double murderer , but has , he adds , concurrent sentences for downloading pornographic images of children .
Neil is a convicted paedophile .
And so it goes on .
Each man speaks in an almost flat voice , as if acknowledging their crimes are what define them – which , of course , within a prison setting they do .
But there is a slight tentativeness in there too , as if they are still learning to say out loud and take responsibility for the details of their offences .
Which is where the therapeutic approach of Grendon comes in .

As the introductions proceed , the pen freezes in my hand .
It wo n't write what I know needs to be recorded in my notebook .
It is all that I can do to keep a blank expression on my face as the toll of death and abuse mounts in this small and suddenly claustrophobic room .
This is a challenge for anyone who rejects on principle the popular prejudice that sex offenders are monsters who can never truly be rehabilitated and who should therefore be locked up with the key thrown away .
As liberal theory comes face - to - face with real offenders and real crimes , a part of me instinctively recoils .
It is a fleeting insight , one of the prison officers remarks to me later when I admit to that moment of horror , into the challenge that daily faces them at Grendon .
The officers are a central part of the community , working side - by - side with therapists , psychologists and facilitators .
In group sessions , they do n't stand at the door , as in other prisons , maintaining order and turning keys , they participate .
Security and therapy are both part of the job description as the notice above the front entrance makes plain – " Her Majesty 's Prison Grendon – Therapeutic Communities " .
Many of the officers have been here most or all of their working life .
" Why did you want to be a prison officer ? " I ask Pauline , the officer in charge of F - wing , where new arrivals are introduced to Grendon .
" I did n't , " she replies without a beat .
" I wanted to work at Grendon . "
ntil the mid-1980s , Grendon did n't have a governor .
As a therapeutic community , it was headed by a Medical Superintendent .
Then its senior management structure was brought into line with the rest of the prison system by the Thatcher government .
Many feared a dilution of the idealism that had inspired Grendon since it opened in 1962 on a gentle hillside of chalky farmland outside Aylesbury .
And have gone on fearing for it ever after , particularly since its cost per each one of its current 190 prisoners , at £ 42,000 a year , is about £ 7,000 above the national average for other category - B high - security jails in the system .
But survive it has , because it works .
Successive academic studies have shown that re-conviction rates among " Grendon graduates " are lower than across the prison population as a whole .
When you bear in mind that Grendon is often dealing with some of the most serious and damaged offenders in the system – for whom every other option has failed and who might otherwise have to be sent to secure mental institutions at a cost to the taxpayer of £ 250,000 per year – its track record is nothing short of remarkable .
" Ever since Grendon opened , " acknowledges Peter Bennett , who has been governor since 2002 , " there has been a belief within the therapeutic tradition that it is vulnerable and also that it declines year on year .
And Grendon does feel itself isolated because it is very different from the mainstream of the prison system .
And the system does sometimes have difficulty in understanding what Grendon is about . "
Anxious not to fall into the trap of special pleading for Grendon – something that appears only to exasperate other governors and ministers – Bennett describes his role as that of a broker , helping a system that seems ever more interested in retribution and punishment to cope with and support Grendon , but also reminding his own staff that their workplace is still a prison and has to conform to directives from the Ministry of Justice , however much they resent such interference .

The prison operates as a therapeutic community round the clock .
In other jails , there are therapy sessions , even special therapeutic units .
Only at Grendon , though , does therapy pervade every minute of every day .
Its programme , says the director of therapeutic communities , Michael Brookes , is " soundly grounded in psycho - dynamic theory and practice " .
On weekdays , inmates , officers and therapists spend their mornings in groups .
Tuesdays to Thursdays , the 40 inmates on each of the five wings split into groups of eight for intensive work , looking at their upbringing and their crimes .
These sessions include art therapy and – something unique to Grendon – psycho - drama .
On Mondays and Fridays , the whole wing community gathers .
I 'm sitting in on the Monday meeting on G - wing .
There is no segregation at Grendon , but offenders are grouped according to their crimes so that in therapy groups they will have common ground .
G- wing is for sex offenders .
My participation in the meeting – and it is stressed that in a community there can be no observers – has been sanctioned not just by the prison authorities but also by the inmates themselves who , in this democratic forum , chaired by one of their number , vote on all matters .
If someone has been acting up on the wing , missing therapy sessions , or failing to pull their weight in the community life , it is raised , discussed and – if necessary – sanctions are decided by a show of hands .
If all else fails , the Wing Meeting can vote an inmate out of Grendon .
It is all part of the commitment to encouraging prisoners to take responsibility for their lives – past , present and , hopefully , for those among them who will one day be released back into society , future .
The colourful rugs and artwork on the walls of the room where we gather take the edge off the clinical feel of the place , but only just .
Mixed in with the prisoners are the four officers on duty on the wing , the full - time psychologist , Geraldine Akerman , one facilitator and one therapist .
Proceedings kick off routinely enough with a vote on whether to spend the wing 's social fund on getting some Calgon tablets for the washing machines , but the main topic for debate is how more reticent prisoners can be afforded greater opportunities to speak up in small and big groups .
There is , in this forum , no coyness about naming names .
It is simultaneously both supportive and exacting – the most exacting meeting I can remember attending .
Bruce , a wirey Liverpudlian with a shaved head , wearing a black and orange tracksuit , points out one of the quiet ones , Noel , an older , chubby man in a pale blue T - shirt sitting with his eyes fixed on the floor .
" Noel , you 're one who does n't say much at Wing , " Bruce begins .
Noel 's folded arms visibly tighten around his body .
" How could we help you to come out of your comfort zone ?
Because that 's what we are here for , is n't it ? "
Bruce 's tone – in contrast to his combative appearance – is concerned .
Noel puts his hands down between his knees and begins to rock as he speaks .
" I 'm not too bad when I get started , " he says , still looking down .
" But what can we do to get you started ? " Bruce persists .
" What you 're doing now , " Noel replies .
" Put me on my toes . "
Tom , a few seats further along in a blue fleecy top and tracksuit bottoms , joins in .
" I used to find it hard to speak too , " he offers , " but we 've come here to find a voice , have n't we ?
A lot of us in our lives have n't had a voice .
This is our chance . "
It crosses my mind that when they committed their crimes they had a voice , but it seems inappropriate to say it aloud .
When I mention it to Akerman later , she tells me I should have .
" They are used to us challenging them all the time . "
The language of the meeting is a curious mixture of politeness and street speak , swear words and therapy talk .
Towards the end , Nigel , a slight , carefully groomed man in his twenties , takes the floor .
" I 'm uncomfortable that we have n't said anything this morning about two of our community who are in trouble . "
Everyone else in the room apparently knows who he is referring to .
Living at close quarters , five cells to a landing , they would inevitably know each other 's business , but here that curiosity is overlaid with compassion .
Jeremy , who has self - harmed the previous night , is trying to hide the dressings on his arms .
Two places to his right , a faraway look in his eyes , sits Sid , who has just learnt of his son 's death .
" Do either of you want to share anything ? " asks Gary , the chair .
Sid snaps back into the moment .
" I just want to say that life goes on .
I 'm not going down the road to self - pity .
But I 'd like to thank you all for asking . "
Jeremy is more agitated : " I do n't want to talk about it , " he states several times .
Voices pipe up , gently urging him to share , but he is adamant , angry even , and no one tries to force him .
After the two - hour meeting , inmates , officers and therapists mingle in the wing corridors to mull over what has happened .
On a row of chairs , I spot Sid .
Bruce is next to him with his arm round his shoulder .
The staff office door is always open and prisoners walk in and out freely , sharing a joke , or checking on details of what they will be doing that afternoon .
All do some form of activity – whether it be in the kitchen , the gym , the medical wing or in education – but again this feature of every prison routine has a distinctly therapeutic twist to it at Grendon .
Instead of being escorted to and from their various workplaces , the prisoners make their own way .
It is called " freeflow " and makes absolutely real the commitment to no segregation .
Despite the serious crimes of many inmates , levels of bullying , violence , drug use and intimidation are exceptionally low in Grendon .
Each prisoner has to seek and receive approval from the Wing Meeting for whatever form of work or activity they want to undertake .
It has to chime with their therapy .
" I'm on healthcare , " Bruce explains .
" A lot of my crimes were linked with drugs and my attitude to women .
On healthcare , it 's mostly women staff and I have to be trusted with the drugs that are about . "
Though I cannot join any of the smaller therapy sessions , a group of 12 G - wing inmates do agree to sit and talk with me .
Which is where we start going round the room with each one detailing their crimes .
Every inmate at Grendon has to apply to come here .
Often there is a waiting list .
Some of those who make it to the induction wing are then rejected as unsuitable .
So what attracts them ?
Jim is a convicted rapist and murderer who has been at Grendon for two years .
His puppyish face belies his appalling crimes .
" I felt as if I had 10 pieces to a 20 piece jigsaw puzzle , " he says , " and I wanted to go back over my life and find the rest .
In other prisons Grendon has a reputation for being a cushy option , but there 's nothing easy here .
The therapy I have been doing here has turned my hair grey . "
Like Jim , Stan , a lifer , 20 years into his sentence , does psycho - drama therapy every Tuesday .
Here inmates attempt to put themselves in their victims ' shoes .
" I 've been here for three - and - a - half years and was having a really bad patch just before Christmas .
I was contemplating taking my own life .
Then in psycho - drama , they challenged me to look at my crime .
I had to watch myself doing what I did .
And I had to act out being my victim .
It made me retch into a bucket . "
There are tears in his deep - set eyes as he speaks .
Not everyone in the group is so positive .
Jerry wants a transfer , he says , even though he 's only been here 13 weeks .
" I just do n't have the memories they want you to have , " he says .
" I 've gone as far as I can with this therapy .
I 'd rather have more time behind the door [ locked in his cell ] at another prison than all this stress . "
The others listen respectfully as he damns the programme into which many of them have invested four or five years of their life .
Jim gently suggests that there is a cycle of highs and lows in therapy , and that Jerry may just have reached a particularly challenging place .
Jerry , though , is having none of it and walks out to go to lunch .
Nathan , a serial rapist , is up for parole soon .
Does he believe what he 's discovered about himself in therapy will stop him reoffending ?
" Grendon will never leave me , " he answers emphatically , with the zeal of a recent convert .
" Even if I leave tomorrow .
It gets so deep inside you .
It will have an impact on everything I do from now on . "
It may sound like telling me what he thinks I want to hear , or even trying out a good line for his parole board hearing , but at a time when reoffending rates are at record levels , Nathan 's hopes for himself are , according to academic studies of Grendon , soundly based in the experience of others who have emerged from this therapeutic community and rebuilt law - abiding lives .
The humane and challenging regime at Grendon has clearly given them something and – since it is the rest of society that their crimes impact on – ultimately made our lives safer too .
The names of offenders have been changed
After Monday ’s near miss , it ’s only a matter of time before we are gently nudged into oblivion by an asteroid .
Despite what the movies tell you , no amount of Bruce Willis or President Morgan Freeman can save us .
The last one missed us by 41,000 miles .
41,000 miles is the width of a galactic taint hair .
As a species we are doomed and I , for one , welcome our new Gay Mole Men Overlords .
I would get on their good side now .
If they intend to keep the species going , they are going to need some breeding stock .
Short post , because I ’m leaving for Austin for the weekend to visit family .
I ’ll be walking around STAPLE for a while on Saturday .
Say hi if you see me there .
I also want to mention that as of today , reader donations and artwork auctions have fully paid for my flight , and hotel expenses for Webcomics Weekend .
Thank you so much , guys .
This means more to me than you know .

The credit crunch computer is set to arrive tomorrow in India when officials unveil the 500 rupee ( £ 7.25 ) laptop .
In an attempt to bridge the " digital divide " in the country between rich and poor , the government will show off the prototype , low - cost laptop as the centrepiece of an ambitious e-learning programme to link 18,000 colleges and 400 universities across the country .
India has a reputation for creating ultra-cheap technologies , a trend sparked last year by the Tata Nano , the world 's cheapest car at Rs100,000 ( £ 1,450 ) .
The computer , known as Sakshat , which translates as " before your eyes " , will be launched as part of a new Rs46bn " national mission for education " .
This envisages a network of laptops from which students can access lectures , coursework and specialist help from anywhere in India , triggering a revolution in education .
A number of publishers have reportedly agreed to upload portions of their textbooks on to the system .
Prabhakar Rao , vice - chancellor of the university in Andhra Pradesh from where the Sakshat will be launched , said that India was " looking to get the hardware and software cheaper .
In a developing country , costs have to be kept low so that the maximum number of students will benefit .
That means cheap computers and cheap broadband access , so that students get access to ebooks and ejournals . "
Although half of India 's 1 billion people are aged below 25 , the country has fallen behind in terms of university places , with only 11 % of students enrolled , compared with double that in China .
India 's bigger northern neighbour already has 180 million internet users , five times India 's total .
Designed by scientists at the Vellore Institute of Technology , the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore , the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras and the state - controlled Semiconductor Complex , the laptop has 2 Gb of Ram and wireless connectivity .
In an attempt to keep costs low , experts say it is unlikely to use familiar Microsoft Windows software .
Officials are confident that the Rs500 price tag can be met .
RP Agarwal , the top civil servant for Indian higher education , told newspapers last week that " at this stage , the price is working out to be $ 20 [ Rs1,000 ] but with mass production it is bound to come down . "
The Indian machine would also be considerably cheaper than the " $ 100 laptop " , the lime - green computer known as the Children 's Machine or XO that was designed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US .
Launched in 2005 in a flurry of praise by Nicholas Negroponte , the former director of MIT 's Media Lab , the XO has failed to take off , partly because it costs $ 200 ( £ 141 ) to make .
However it has given rise to low - cost computers that save money by getting rid of hard drives and using cheap screens .
The Classmate PC made by Intel , the world 's biggest microchip manufacturer , can be bought for $ 400 .
Taiwan 's Eee PC costs as little as $ 200 .
However , some experts doubt that a laptop at $ 20 or $ 10 is commercially sustainable .
Rajesh Jain , managing director of Netcore Solutions and a pioneer of low - cost computing in India , said : " You can not even [ make ] a computer screen for $ 20 .
And India does not build much computer hardware .
So where will the savings come from ? "
Some bloggers today saw the new laptop as nothing more than a " souped up calculator " .
The scepticism was summed up by Atanu Dey , whose blog read : " If the government could pull - off a near - impossible technological miracle , does it not imply that the entire global computer industry is either totally incompetent or else it is a huge scam which produces stuff at very little cost and sells them at exorbitant prices . "
Officials have been reluctant to talk about the project ahead of the launch , however , one did say that costs have been kept low by using students and researchers to do much of the designing .
He said that in 2007 the cost was $ 47 , but further refinements meant it dropped dramatically .
Low - cost inventions
• India saw the launch of the $ 2,000 ( £ 1,410 ) " people 's car " by the motor company Tata last year .
• Wind - up everything .
Since Trevor Bayliss invented the wind - up radio in 1989 the technology has spread .
Wind - up power is now common in camping equipment and is being installed in African villages to provide lighting .
• DIY - adjustable glasses .
The brainchild of British inventor Josh Silver , whose aim is to offer the specs to a billion of the world 's poorest by 2020 .
• In Kenya Equity Bank recently launched mobile banking , which allows customers to deposit , transfer and withdraw cash using a mobile phone .
Thousands of people , including former company directors and lawyers , have applied for 150 low - paid seasonal jobs at a Leicestershire zoo , bosses said .
Applicants from as far away as Wales , Cornwall , London and Yorkshire turned up at Twycross Zoo 's recruitment day .
At one stage traffic tail - backs exceeded five miles .
The zoo has had to draft in extra people to help process the applications which managers said normally only attracted 16 to 18 - year - olds .
Low wages
The contracts available are short - term and for the minimum wage .
Kim Riley of Twycross Zoo said : " We 've had company directors who 've been looking after major companies , PAs , lawyers , really over - qualified people applying for jobs for catering assistants , retail and front - of - house ranger jobs , which are just directing cars . "
Catering manager Paul Bramble added : " There was one gentleman that sat down in front of me , he was a middle - aged man ... well - dressed in a suit and tie , he had a full CV in front in him , and I felt as if he should have been in my seat , he was kind of over - qualified to be going for one of the catering jobs that he was going for . "
Other applicants included former publicans , carpenters and Woolworths staff .
The zoo said it would let people know the outcome of the recruitment day within two to three weeks .

“ Whenever you see a successful person , you only see the public glories , never the private sacrifices to reach them . ” – Vaibhav Shah
What can we do to become more successful ?
How can we excel in all areas of life , whether professional or personal ?
A vast body of literature has been written on this subject over the decades , but here are five points which I regard as being fundamental .
1. Be Proactive
Viktor Frankl said that between stimulus and response there is a gap , and within this gap lies all our freedom .
Even as he was suffering immense privations in a Nazi concentration camp , he realized that he was responsible for his thoughts and actions and was not simply a bundle of conditioned responses .
Like Frankl , we should strive to be the creators of our own destiny , orchestrating our experience of life .
Everything starts in the mind and ripples out , so what happens around us is a reflection of our own inner world .
Whether we allow our inner world to grow wild , whether we let weeds spring up and take hold or whether we cultivate a green and pleasant garden – it is all our choice : this is what it means to be proactive .
2. Take Responsibility
Since we have the power to choose our experience , we also need to accept responsibility for this .
Perhaps not that everything that comes our way is a direct result of our own thinking ( though some might say it is ) but what we attract into our life is , largely , a reflection of our thinking .
Much of this occurs on a subconscious level , but the subconscious takes its lead from the thinking mind , so changing our thoughts will change our world , and we are responsible for this .
Our behavior is a natural outcome of our mental images , and so we are responsible for our behavior too , and also for the behavior we tolerate in others .
If we allow others to ride roughshod over us , then we have ourselves to blame .
3. Be a Good Leader
We can not be effective in any area of life unless we have good leadership skills .
Leadership is an art and each of us needs to find our own approach to it .
Primarily , we need to understand how to lead ourselves , and this means having a compass , a direction which guides all our actions .
This compass often takes the form of a personal mission statement , a document spelling out the values we live by .
As we lead others , whether as parents , bosses , in families or organizations of which we are a part , we need first and foremost to lead by example , making it clear what our values are and that we live by them .
Any inconsistency in our professed values and our behavior will be spotted , seen through and will ruin our effectiveness .
Personal complicity and double standards are the nails in the coffin of our ability to lead .
A good leader will lead quietly and subtly , from the rear , without fuss , without fanfare .
In the words of the Tao Te Ching ,
‘ A good soldier does not inspire fear ;
A good fighter does not display aggression ;
A good conqueror does not engage in battle ;
A good leader does not exercise authority .
This is the value of unimportance ;
This is how to win the cooperation of others ;
This to how to build the same harmony that is in nature . ’
4. Do n’t Let Fear Stop You
I love the movies of M Night Shyamalan .
My favorite is The Village .
The film is about facing the fears that haunt us and realizing that , when we do so , they disappear – nothing is as it seems .
I heard once ( though I ca n’t remember where ) that the most commonly given command in the Bible is ‘ do not be afraid . ’
Whenever we grow , there is fear .
Whenever we do something new , there is fear .
Whenever we push ourselves to new heights or expand our comfort zone , there is fear .
This is the nature of life .
Life is always moving – either we are moving forward , growing , or we are moving back , dying .
We have a choice – we can either grow or we can die .
Growth and fear go hand in hand .
It ’s part of a package , and if we fail to embrace the whole package , we will die .
Do n’t fear failure – failure is inevitable and necessary .
Look at the life of any successful person and you will see a litany of failure .
This failure is the foundation of success , so long as we learn from it .
Do n’t fear other people .
They are as vulnerable and as beautiful as you are – only sometimes they lash out in various ways to protect themselves .
Everyone is doing their best , so be gentle with other people and do n’t be scared of them .
When you face your fears , they will vanish like smoke .
5. Never Stop Learning
I have come to the conclusion that learning is the fundamental activity in a successful and purposeful life .
If we fail to learn , we fail to grow , and this means that we die .
Life gives us endless opportunities to learn , and the more difficult the situation , the more we are likely to learn .
We can learn from other people , especially difficult ones – they are like angels sent from heaven to teach us about ourselves .
We can learn from the things happening around us .
And most of all , we can learn by watching ourselves , seeing how we react and reflecting deeply on what moves us .
These five activities , if they can become habits , will lead to success in all areas of life .
They are not a quick fix , but are the foundation of a life lived well .
THE BACK DOOR TO GUN CONTROL
Bush disappoints gun owners by signing bad firearms bill restricting ownership rights SHORTLY BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE , President Bush managed to stick it to Americans one more time by signing into law a dangerous measure that makes it tougher for people to exercise their Second Amendment rights without fear of being tracked and monitored .
On Jan. 8 , Bush signed the “ NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 ” ( H.R. 2640 ) , which streamlines the process by which information on individuals prohibited from possessing firearms is transmitted by state and local government and federal agencies to the Justice Department - administered National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) .
Advocates of the bill argued that it would protect Americans by keeping firearms out of the hands of violent lunatics , like the mentally disturbed young man who shot up the university in Blacksburg , Va. , in 2007 .
But supporters of the Second Amendment counter that the bill creates an atmosphere where Americans are considered guilty and must prove themselves innocent before they can own a firearm .
Worse still , according to the bill , a “ thought crime ” conviction could even threaten your right to purchase or own a firearm .
This would all happen administratively without you ever going before a jury of your peers .
At the core of the bill ’s problem is section 101 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( C ) , which makes you a “ prohibited person ” on the basis of a “ medical finding of disability ” as a result of some sort of “ hearing ” before a “ lawful authority . ”
The language is frighteningly vague for a law , which leaves bureaucrats and law enforcement officials with the unchecked power to define a “ lawful authority ” as anyone from a psychiatrist to a bureaucrat at the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Those barred from owning firearms could include children with a past diagnosis for ADHD , people with Alzheimer ’s , veterans with post traumatic stress disorder , protesters , church members — anyone who is deemed “ dangerous ” or “ mentally disabled ” for any reason .
Following a judgment , there is no defined process for fighting the ruling .
It is clearly intended to be what it is : a backdoor to gun control .

( Issue # 5 , February 2 , 2009 )
The G20 summit meeting in London on 2 April will have a lot on its plate and will certainly fall short of expectations .
There is a world recession – the worst in more than 60 years – and the immediate problem of how to get out of it through fiscal and monetary stimulus , as well as possible coordinated action to fix the global financial system .
Then there is regulatory reform .
And sadly , last on the agenda is aid for the poorest countries who , through the drying up of credit , shrinking exports and falling commodity prices , pay the biggest price in human terms for a disaster caused mainly by the richest people in the richest countries .
The G20 will also have to make some decisions about the International Monetary Fund : how much money will they get and what will be their role in the coming months and years ?
The Obama administration has proposed an additional $ 100bn , in the hope that this will raise $ 500bn of new funding .
The European Union has committed a similar amount ( 75 bn euros ) .
This could be a mistake , unless the IMF is required to eliminate the harmful conditions that it often attaches to its lending .
About 10 years ago , in the last major international economic crisis – which began in Asia – the US led a large funding increase for the IMF , and the results were disastrous .
The fund worsened the crisis in Asia , mostly by attaching harmful economic and structural conditions to its lending in the countries hardest hit by the crisis – including Indonesia , Thailand , South Korea and the Philippines .
The IMF did at least as badly in Russia and other countries , and especially Argentina , in the same period .
These countries learned their lesson and piled up reserves so as to never need to go back to the IMF again .
The fund , without taking responsibility or firing anyone ( much like some American corporations recently ) , claims to have learned some lessons and also to have changed its policies .
But there are too many disturbing signs that it has not .
For example , at least nine agreements that the fund has negotiated since September 2008 – including with Eastern European countries , El Salvador and Pakistan – contain some elements of contractionary policies .
These include fiscal ( budget ) tightening , interest rate increases , wage freezes for public employees and other measures that will reduce aggregate demand or prevent economic stimulus programs in the current downturn .
The IMF has long had a double standard when it comes to dealing with economic downturns .
For the rich countries , it can be quite Keynesian : it is currently recommending a global fiscal stimulus of 2 % of GDP .
But for the developing countries that are actually forced to follow the fund 's advice , there is often a different story : they " cannot afford " these expansionary policies during a recession .
This attitude can defeat the purpose of lending money to developing countries in a downturn , which is to enable them to pursue expansionary policies .
The main reason they " cannot afford " to do what the US or other rich countries do during this recession – eg run large budget deficits – is that they may run out of foreign exchange reserves ( mostly dollars ) .
In other words , if they grow at a normal pace while other economies shrink , their imports will grow faster than their exports , and their trade balance will worsen .
The purpose of external support is to allow that to happen , rather than shrinking the economy to improve the trade balance .
In some sense it is not really fair to blame the IMF for its failed policies , since the fund has a boss : the US Treasury department .
Although the IMF has 185 member countries , Washington pretty much calls the shots .
This arrangement was established with the creation of the fund in 1944 , when Europe was in ruins and much of the developing world was still colonised .
China now has the world 's second - largest economy and 1.3 billion people , but only 3.7 % of the IMF 's voting shares .
That 's after a decade - long struggle to reform voting shares , and China 's getting one of the largest increases in voting shares among developing countries in last year 's fund " reforms " .
Europe , Japan and the other rich countries could outvote the US , but prefer not to rock the boat for fear that any challenge to Washington 's control over this institution ( and the World Bank ) might result in developing countries ' gaining a voice .
There was , understandably , discontent in the US when the Obama administration appointed people who had a large responsibility for the current economic mess to top positions .
The IMF has the same problem , but much worse .
The Obama appointees will be pressured to resign if they fail , and the Democrats have to worry about re-election .
There is no comparable accountability at the IMF .
What hope , then , for reform ?
For immediate reforms , there is the pressure from organizsed civil society that successfully forced some $ 88bn of poor - country debt cancellation over the past decade .
Coalitions such as the UK's 138 - organisation Put People First are pressuring the IMF and World Bank to refrain from inflicting harmful conditions on poor countries and to cancel more debt .
They 're asking the rich countries to live up to their aid commitments .
In the US , the religious - based Jubilee USA and allied groups are lobbying Congress to authorise the IMF to sell some of its tens of billions of dollars worth of gold reserves , and to use the money for debt cancellation for poor countries .
More ambitious proposals for longer - term reform come from the UN commission headed by Nobel - laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz .
This commission is proposing a Global Economic Council , an expanded global reserve system and other institutional arrangements – including steady aid to poor countries – that would not be subject to the veto of rich countries as are the IMF and World Bank .
This week the government of China announced its support for a new global reserve currency to replace the dollar .
In the meantime , the most important reforms will take place at the national and regional levels , bypassing the G7 and the nominally expanded G20 .
China has in recent months extended multi-billion - dollar currency swaps to South Korea , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Malaysia and Belarus , after refusing the rich - country pleas for more money for the IMF in the absence of governance reform .
The ASEAN + 3 countries ( 10 Association of South - East Asian Nations plus China , Japan and South Korea ) are moving toward a $ 120 bn Asian Monetary Fund .
And South America 's Bank of the South is expected to be launched in May with $ 10bn in start - up capital from Argentina , Brazil , Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador , Paraguay and Uruguay .
If the developing countries are willing to show the G7 that they can walk away from any agreements that can harm them , while creating alternatives on the ground at the national and regional level , the governments of the rich countries may eventually see the need for serious international financial reforms .
Lahore , Pakistan
YESTERDAY afternoon , Ali Raza went to the hospital .
A 25 - year - old constable in the Punjab police department , Ali Raza was accompanying an old man who needed an M.R.I. scan .
In the reception area , he noticed that the waiting patients had abandoned their chairs and were standing around the television .
They had been watching the same images all day : a dozen unidentified gunmen , two wearing backpacks , firing at a van near the Liberty Market roundabout .
The intended victims , the TV stations had reported , were members of the Sri Lankan national cricket team , in town here to play Pakistan .
The dead : eight Pakistanis , including six of Ali Raza ’s fellow police officers .
“ Everyone at the hospital was saying the same thing , ” Ali Raza told me later that night , as we stood in line at a brightly lighted stall selling paan  a mild stimulant made with betel nuts  near the Main Market roundabout , just a short walk away from the site of the attack .
“ They were saying that this was done to show the Indians that we in Pakistan are also the victims of terrorism . ”
“ You think our own government did it ? ” I asked .
“ No one else could get away with this kind of thing , ” he insisted .
He described the attackers ’ feat : they appeared out of nowhere at one of the city ’s busiest intersections and fired for more than 20 minutes at the van carrying the players to Qaddafi Stadium , and then fled in rickshaws .
Quietly and with baby steps , the Pentagon 's newest combatant command the U.S. is intervening in one of the world 's most tenacious conflicts .
Two - year - old Africa Command The Bush Administration has pledged $ 5 million to help build a new police force in Somalia that combines troops from the U.S. - backed Transitional Federal Government and – get this – former insurgents from an alliance of moderate Islamic groups .
Somalia has n't had a functional central government in 18 years .
Clan conflict , starvation and anarchy have contributed to what the U.S. Army 's top intel agent for Africa called a " vortex of violence " where the fighting at times escapes any rational motivation .
That vortex of violence is a hallmark of so - called " Fifth - Generation
Warfare . "
The Pentagon 's new Africa Command , more than any other U.S. command , is designed to wage 5GW , according to the command boss , Army General Kip Ward .
Since military force often makes the vortex worse , Ward said Africom would " foster continued dialogue and development ... enabling the growth of strong and just governments and legitimate institutions to support the development of civil societies . "
To that end , the hybrid Somali police force is , in theory , a great idea .
It cements a political compromise between U.S. allies in Somalia and their former enemies , and it puts a Somali face on international efforts to create street - level security .
But there are huge obstacles .
Without strict controls , which are hard to install in a place like
Somalia , corruption will siphon off most of the police funds .
Even with all the money , there 's no guarantee the peace deal between the
Transitional Government and the moderate Islamists will hold .
And there are spoilers : the hardline Islamic Courts group , which is n't part of the peace deal , has entered the capital of Mogadishu and has begun occupying deserted police stations , aiming to set up its own law - enforcement infrastructure that could compete with the U.S. - funded hybrid force .
UPDATE 1/6/09 : An Africom spokesman just pointed out that the money for the Somali police force actually is coming from the State Department , not the Pentagon .
Regardless , it 's an initiate that 's totally in line with
Africa Command 's " soft , " multi-agency strategy .

ALSO :
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's office is trying to play down a gaffe on the extent of the world financial crisis .
Mr Brown told Parliament that the world economy was in a " depression " , although his minders said he meant " recession " .
The Conservatives seized on the use of the word depression , insisting Mr Brown urgently clarify his statement .
A Conservative MP said prime ministers in particular needed to be careful about their use of language to ensure they do not undermine confidence .
Mr Brown 's office insisted the Prime Minister did not think the world was in a " depression " .
Asked if it was a slip of the tongue , a spokesman replied that that could be inferred .
Yesterday Rick Santelli , who reports from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade the for CNBC , unleashed a rant against Obama ’s newly announced housing bailout plan , intended to help some homeowners refinance mortgages and avoid foreclosure .
The clip was quickly linked to and embedded in Web sites everywhere , and provoked intense reaction that pretty much broke along partisan lines .
At National Review Online , for example , Kathryn Jean Lopez was busting out the Palin - Santelli 2012 posters :
I ’ve had a case of deja vu today .
I ’m noticing the tone .
I ’m seeing the enthusiasm .
And I ’m digging out from the sheer volume of e-mails I ’ve been getting today about that CNBC dude .
The reaction to Rick Santelli ’s Chicago - trading - floor incident this morning echoes the emotional reaction my inbox had to Sarah Palin ’s convention speech this summer .
I make no endorsements .
It ’s just an observation .
I think people are hungry for someone who is fed up with the way things are and who seem to believe in something enough to know there in an alternative worth fighting for .
Some of the voices may be far from perfect , but Americans are looking for signs of the life of an alternative .
And so if a representative pops up — someone who appears to have roots and energy , folks will cheer them on in the hopes there ’s a candidate here .
Maybe not a presidential candidate , but a leader of some sort .
Someone who can offer a vision of something other than a culture of bailout .
Today , Rick Santelli was that sign of life .
Also at NRO , Larry Kudlow seconded Santelli ’s call for a Chicago Tea Party to protest the housing plan :
Team Obama is rewarding bad behavior .
It is enlarging moral hazard .
It is expanding its welfarist approach to economic policy .
And with a huge expansion of government - owned zombie lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Team Obama is taking a giant step toward nationalizing the mortgage market .
. .
Reporting from the Chicago commodity pits , my CNBC colleague Rick Santelli unleashed a torrent of criticism against this scheme .
Santelli said : “ Government is promoting bad behavior .
. . .
Do we really want to subsidize the losers ’ mortgages ?
This is America !
How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor ’s mortgage ?
President Obama , are you listening ?
How about we all stop paying our mortgages !
It ’s a moral hazard . ”
All this took place on the air , to the cheers of traders .
Santelli called for a new tea party in support of capitalism .
He ’s right .
Across the aisle , Scarecrow at Firedoglake had a different take :
Thanks ,
Rick and CNBC , for making the case for a surcharge on transactions , greater securities regulations , and an increase in the top marginal tax rates .
At My DD , Charles Lemos weighed in with his experience of Wall Street :
After watching the [ Santelli clip ] , I first had to check my calendar .
Somehow I felt I traveled back in time to the early 1970s to witness first hand Richard Nixon ’s “ northern strategy , ” his pursuit of white ethnic voters who were so deeply disaffected over Great Society programs ranging from desegregation ( remember the Boston busing madness ? ) to affirmative action among others that they would desert the Democratic Party becoming “ Nixon ’s silent majority ” and “ Reagan Democrats ” .
. . .
Rick Santelli is heir to this legacy laced with racist overtones .
Note the promo before the rant in the video link at CNBC .
CNBC has an upcoming special entitled The Rise of America ’s New Black Overclass .
Fear mongering , it ’s worked before so let ’s try it again .
It ’s back to the 1970s for the GOP and their rabid white ethnics .
I spent a decade on Wall Street working for Alex .
Brown & Sons , Deutsche Banc Securities and Goldman Sachs .
I found Wall Street a largely liberal environment with one major exception , the trading floor .
In my experience I found traders , who are largely white ethnics — Irish , Italian , Greek , Polish or Slovak among others — and graduates of the Seton Halls , the Boston Colleges , the Notre Dames , the Penn States were the most rabid conservative and foul mouthed people on the planet .
Nor could any of them ever get my name right .
“ My name is Charles , not Chuckie ” was something I would repeat whenever I had the misfortune to have to interact with them .
Some of these folks made William Buckley appear moderate .
At Balloon Juice , John Cole marveled at Santelli’s “ audacity ” :
The most amusing thing to me about this Rick Santelli faux populist broker revolt is not his invocation of the Nixonian silent majority , but the utter lack of perspective it displays .
Yes , there is a simmering discontent and anger out there , and clearly the Republicans are going to try to tap into it , but the problem for Santelli and his crowd is that the anger is not directed at the people who are losing their homes , but at the people Santelli spends every day rubbing shoulders with at the trendy Chicago restaurants the brokers go to these days .
The audacity of Santelli’s “ revolt ” is that a mere 75 billion is being spent to help struggling families repackage loans - a mere pittance in the terms of the gargantuan amount of money being thrown at the banks , the Wall Street wizards , and the rest of the rocket scientists who are the root of this problem . . .
As a rebuttal of sorts to Santelli , David Sirota at Open Left offered a clip of a Fox News interview with Virg Bernero , the mayor of Lansing , Mich. , from earlier in the week , in which “ Bernero demands to know how anyone can be calling for wage / benefit cuts for workers at a time the government is taking workers ’ tax money and handing it to the very speculators that Santelli is whooping it up with . ”
Along the lines of Cole , Sirota frames the debate as one between market populism ( Santelli ) and grassroots populism ( Bernero ) :
Ownership is a strange thing .
Unlike possession , ownership is not easily defined in physical terms .
Possession we can define as having physical control over something .
Thus if I hold a thing in my hand I possess it .
But I also possess it if I keep it locked in my safe , since that keeps it under my control , even in my absence .
Ownership is not the same as possession .
It is quite possible to possess something that you do not own , and to lack possession over something that you do own ; if it were impossible there would be no such thing as theft .
Because ownership , unlike possession , cannot be defined in purely physical terms we are faced with three possible strategies for defining it .
First , ownership could be a matter of convention , such that to own something is to have ownership of it according to some rules ( the conventions ) , which lay out in more detail what conditions , physical or otherwise , grant and transfer ownership .
This is the legal view – that of the courts , which appeal only to the law to decide matters of ownership .
Thus if the law changes so does who owns what .
Secondly , ownership could be defined in terms of the popular or prevailing attitude , such that you would only own something if it was the consensus that you owned it .
Finally , ownership could be defined as a personal attitude : essentially that you own something if and only if you think that you own it .
Let ’s consider the first possibility , that ownership is a matter of convention .
Suppose this were so .
Then the question arises : which convention ?
There are so many conventions , both existing and possible , that for any object we could find some convention under which I own it and another under which I do n’t .
For this to be a meaningful definition of ownership we must pin down which conventions , exactly , determine what I own .
And to do that there are two natural possibilities : the prevailing conventions or those that I personally choose accept .
If it is the first then this option essentially reduces to the second strategy for defining ownership ; I own something only if it is the prevailing opinion that I own it .
And if it is the second then this option reduces to the third strategy ; I own something only if I think that I own it .
And so we are left with only two possibilities to consider .
Now let ’s turn to the second possibility , that I own something only if it is the prevailing opinion that I do .
Of course the prevailing opinion is subject to change , people change , and conventions change .
Thus whether I own something would change as well , independent of any changes in me , the thing , or my relationship to it .
Which is to say that one day I may own the items in my safe because it is generally agreed that this is so , but upon waking up the next day it may not be so because the general agreement had changed while I was sleeping .
Such is the nature of things that are socially constructed .
This means that , under this definition , my ownership of something is itself determined by , controlled if you will , by the majority opinion .
And thus the majority would possesses my ownership , as strange as that may sound .
They would possess my ownership of a thing because it is within their power to take it away from me .
Can I really own a thing if I do n’t possess the ownership itself ?
Or , in other words , can I maintain that I own something when my ownership of it is so vulnerable ?
It would appear that under this view it is the majority who really own things , and that they simply let me borrow them for a while .
Thus , under this definition there really is no such thing as individual ownership .
If we wish to maintain that personal ownership is possible it looks like we are left with the third possibility : that I own something if I think that I own it .
So defined , I do possess my ownership of things , because it is fully under my control , modulo scenarios of mind control , whether I do or do n’t conceive of myself as owning a thing .
Well , at least it is under my control to a certain extent .
I am still free to abdicate that control to the majority or to some convention ; I could come to believe that I only owned something when that convention dictated that it was so , or when the majority agreed with me .
If I abdicated my choice of what to view as owned in this way I would indeed lack control over my beliefs about ownership .
The result would be a contradictory situation where I would both own something because of my belief that I owned it , and lack ownership because I lacked control over my beliefs about what I owned .
( This contradiction is merely verbal , though . )
However , this still leaves the possibility open for other people to seize their freedom ( seize control over their beliefs rather than abdicating them to the majority or to convention ) , and thus individual ownership may still exist .
The other factor that influences whether I believe that I own something is my ability to exercise my ownership over it .
Exercising your ownership over something is to bring it into your possession .
For example , suppose that I have loaned one of my books to a friend .
I do not possess that book – it is out of my control – but I still think that I own it .
Eventually I may want the book back , thus I will attempt to exercise my ownership ; I will attempt to make my friend return it to me .
If my friend agrees to certain conventions of ownership , or is simply a nice guy , then he will return it to me .
And if he does n’t I may attempt to have society at large recover that book for me ( e.g. via the police ) , which is another way to exercise ownership .
But if all those methods fail , and I am unable to regain possession of the book when I want to , i.e. if the exercise of my ownership fails , then I will come to believe that the book is lost to me .
In other words , that I no longer own it .
Thus what we can own is also limited by a conjunction of external circumstances and situations in which we want to exercise our ownership .
We are free to believe that we own whatever we want , but as soon as we try to exercise that ownership we are reduced to being able to own only what the situation , other people , and society in general , will grant possession of to us .
Any attempt to exercise our ownership limits our ownership , in cases where we do n’t currently possess a thing , to the limits set by convention and the majority opinion .
Two unusual conclusions follow from this analysis of ownership .
First , that the more we attempt to exercise our ownership over things the less we will actually own .
Many such exercises ( where we do n’t already possess the thing ) grant control over our ownership to society at large , since if they chose they could prevent that exercise from being successful .
These exercises of ownership amount to giving up the thing in the hope that it will be given back , which is far from certain .
Thus the less we try to exercise our ownership the more we will keep .
From this the second unusual conclusion follows : that the man who desires nothing owns everything .
Because , desiring nothing , such a man would never be inclined to exercise his ownership .
And thus he would be free to own whatever he wanted , since his ownership would be constrained only by his choices about what to believed that he owned , which themselves are completely unconstrained .

Today , I decided to tell my mom about my choice to wait to have sex until after marriage .
Coming from a very christian family I thought she would be proud .
Instead she laughed and said , " is that your excuse for not being able to get laid ? " and walked out of the room .
FML
“ I have no idea what I was treating her for , ” he said .
She wrote other manuscripts and short stories , and , of course , there are the tales she told the few visitors she invited inside her house .
Image Barry Martin oversaw construction that surrounded Edith Macefield , and he befriended her .
She revised her will to give Mr. Martin , shown in her house with a photo of her , control of her estate .
Credit ... Stuart Isett for The New York Times
Ms. Macefield constructed her stories while the city surrounding her rushed to construct itself , while the new condos rose even as the big seagoing fish processors still sounded their horns on their way to Alaska , while the coffee shops became espresso shops and the bars became clubs .
She lived on a street whose other houses had been torn down decades ago .
Not only did she have no real neighbors , but she also had no known family .
Born in Oregon , she told people she had moved to Seattle from Europe as an adult to care for her mother .
Her mother died many years ago , apparently in the house that Ms. Macefield refused to sell .
For years Mr. Peck was the person closest to her .
They both loved music .
He was a divorced father without much money when he met her in the 1980s .
Soon he was driving her to appointments , helping get her groceries .
He bought her the word processor that still sits on a desk in her house .
She became like a grandmother to his sons .
“ She was a really curious person , but she was always fun , ” Mr. Peck said .
By the early 1990s , he said , Ms. Macefield had made him the beneficiary of her estate through a living trust .
Now that she is gone , he said he has hired a lawyer to determine his rights .
Not that Ms. Macefield had much beyond well - positioned real estate .
All Mr. Peck said he knew was that she worked decades ago making deliveries for the Washington Dental Service .
In the fall of 2006 , as developers were pressing Ms. Macefield , Mr. Peck tried to convince her to sell .
She was in the hospital after having fallen and broken some ribs , he recalled , and the sale would have paid Ms. Macefield about $ 1 million , as well as help her move to new housing .
“ She just pulled out , right there , at the last minute , ” said Mr. Peck , 63 .
“ She did n’t trust them .
It really hurt our relationship , too , because she thought I was in bed with these guys . ”
Mr. Peck has since moved to another part of the state .
I honestly think I can do about 3000 lines of good code in a day ...

It 's common to compare ourselves to doctors , lawyers , and other highly - paid professionals .
Unfortunately , almost every comparison breaks down dramatically , very quickly .
When doctors screw up ( massively ) they get sued .
When ( permanently employed ) programmers screw up they get let - go , and they go find a new job , usually with more responsibility and a pay raise .
There are no ramifications for software malpractice .
*Successful lawyers put in years to learn their craft , then they put in years trying to become partner .
Eventually they get to make the firm defining decisions , but only after maturing their abilities and proving themselves .

Architect promotions are not hard to come by .
I had an ' architect ' title with no college degree and only 3 years of experience .
At that point I 'd never heard of unit testing , refactoring , or design patterns .
In those days I was picking up information from O'Reilly In a Nutshell books and MSDN .
At the same time I was leading a team building software for the US government ( via contracts the company had won , not employed directly by them ) .
I was massively under - skilled , and yet , there I was writing software that troops would need to stay alive .** I wish my experience were isolated , but while I was consulting for 3.5 years I saw countless examples of exactly the same story .
I know the argument : demand is so high , we do n't have another choice .
I reject this argument on the basis that most good programmers spend the majority of their time fixing problems created by terrible programmers .
Good programmers fix problems created by terrible programmers in various ways .
Good programmers can directly address problems by rewriting poorly written custom code .
However , the less obvious way good programmers address poorly written code is when they write custom code because all the tools , that a company could potentially buy instead of building , are terrible .
Would so many companies write their own time tracking , project managing , bug tracking , expense tracking and other internal tools if they had reasonable commercial options ?
The argument that demand is too high completely ignores the opportunity cost of working with NNPP s.
The next common argument :
We do n't have that many NNPPs .
Really ?
Write a few blog entries , attend a few conferences , do some consulting .
I think you might change your mind .
And , remember , the people commenting on blog entries or attending conferences are the ones who actually care about what they are doing .
I 'm horrified to think what the less interested NNPPs produce .
Here 's a gem from a comment on my last blog post .
The commenter actually thinks writing 3000 lines of code a day is a good thing .
If you read through the comments you 'll find another commenter that does n't understand the difference between open classes and inheritance , but overall the majority of comments are well thought out reasonable responses .
Several people were able to create logical responses without being emotionally attached to Java .
That gave me some hope that things were a bit better than I generally picture them as .
But , then I checked out the dzone score of the entry .
Now , maybe it 's just not a well written or educational in any way post , that would be fine .
But , when I read the comments , I 'm back to disgusted by our industry .
In this day and age , is it really reasonable to think that Java does n't have limitations ?
I would say no .
Java is a great tool for certain tasks , but there are plenty of things to dislike about it .
I would n't want to work with people too blind to notice that .
Another common statement is :
In every industry you have people who do n't care about their jobs .
I do n't think that 's a good comparison either .
Bad doctors are sued until they can't afford malpractice insurance .
Lawyers , very publicly , lose cases and are fired .
In those industries , if you are n't contributing towards moving things forward , you 're quickly exited .
Professional sports is an industry that probably has very few professionals that do n't care about their job .
If you are n't good enough , you do n't make it , period .
In basketball , there 's no position for someone who is only good enough to dribble .
If you 're good enough , you 're paid well .
If you are n't , you do n't make it .
It 's that simple .
So what is the cost of NNPPs ?
I 'd say there are several ways to answer that question .
The first obvious cost is opportunity cost that companies lose when they can't provide quality software to their customers .
This can translate to significantly lower revenue due to lack of or cancelled subscriptions or licenses .
It can be the difference between the success and the failure of a start - up .
For businesses , I would say the cost is epic .
Is it any surprise that technology companies are some of the most volatile stocks .
There 's other costs as well .
When software fails , people do n't get the aid they needed .
This can be money , hospital care , legal direction , and many other life altering situations .
Poorly designed software can cause death , and yet rarely is that kind of thing considered by a programmer .
I heard once that in Great Britain 's MOD if you design software for a plane you go up in the test plane when the software is beta - tested .
If all programmers were held with that level of accountability , how many do you think would still be in our field ?
How many would you want to collaborate with before you went up in the plane together ?
Of course , we do n't all write life - threatening software , but does that give us an excuse for lowering our colleague - quality requirements ?
Picture the things we could do if we did n't spend most of our time making up for terrible programmers and you 'll know why I 'm passionate about the topic .
Terrible programmers also slow us down as an industry .
When I talk about Open Classes people are terrified .
They always say :
That 's fine on your team , but we could never work with a language that has Open Classes .
Is that a problem with Open Classes or a problem with the team ?
I worked on several teams , large and small , that used Open Classes diligently and I can't remember a single problem we ever had with them .
Much the opposite , the teams were often , clearly more effective because they were talented and the language let them solve problems in the most effective way .
Java and C# are not silver bullets .
The languages are good solutions to a certain class of problems , using them for problems that could be better solved with a different language stagnates the growth of other languages .
The longer great programmers use a less - effective tool for the job the less time they have to work with and mature languages that are more suitable .
As a result our entire industry loses out .
There 's also a cost to your future colleagues .
There 's a big difference between a NNPP and someone new to the industry .
Someone new to the industry benefits greatly from a mentor , but what if the mentor is an NNPP ?
Some NNPPs do small scale damage in isolated components of applications .
But , the most insidious NNPPs are the architects who 's ideas belong on The Daily WTF .
These NNPP architects build entire armies of NNPPs around them and single - handedly waste millions , if not billions of dollars , annually .
And , potentially worse , they ruin or at least drastically hurt the careers of eager to learn teammates .
The Cost of NNPPs is high enough that it 's become my soapbox issue .
But , truthfully , I 'm not saying anything really new , so is there any hope for our industry ?
I do think there are things we can do to help move the industry in the right direction .
The good programmers can refuse to work with bad programmers .
That might mean moving to an organization where that 's a goal , or making that a goal of your current organization .
Providing negative feedback directly to a NNPP teammate is always hard , but I do believe the ROI justifies the action .
It 's also helpful to provide that feedback to your manager , so the manager knows your opinions on the skill levels of your teammates .
You can also suggest to managers that employees who refuse to take advantage of training budgets should be looked closely at .
Lastly , you could suggest moving developer compensation to be based on the success of the project .
A royalties model would be really interesting .
And , if you have a blog , you could write your own entry expressing your opinions on the topic . *
The exception being freelance developers , who are the minority , at least here in the US .**
Thank God , the government never ended up using the software we delivered .
The English - language blogosphere predictably talks about the tech news that 's relevant to us as the only tech news , but in Asia the technology landscape looks very different .
To wit :
The popularity of Korean sites like Daum and Naver have two American Internet giants , Google ( GOOG ) and Yahoo ( YHOO ) , teaming up in a bid to stay relevant in the Korean market .
Korea Times :
Google Korea and Yahoo !
Korea announced plans Tuesday to merge their key Web services over the platforms of their digital maps and other location - based services , hoping that the enriched applications would drive up traffic on both sites .
Under the agreement , Google sprinkles video clips from YouTube ( kr.youtube.com ) on Yahoo's map ( map.yahoo.co.kr ) , while Yahoo interconnects its local search service , Gugi ( kr.gugi.yahoo.com ) , with Google 's map ( www.maps.google.co.kr).
The changes will be made this month and the content sharing will be extended to the international version of Yahoo's Gugi services ( global.gugi.yahoo.co.kr ) , the companies said .
Korea has been one of the few rare markets where Google and Yahoo have struggled to stay relevant , with Naver controlling around 75 percent of the search market and Daum gobbling up the biggest of table scraps .
A smart move for the two companies : Market research company Korean click says Daum 's maps gathered 2.5 million visitors in one week in January .
By contrast , Yahoo got only 530,000 and Google did even worse .

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) -
Two judges pleaded guilty on Thursday to accepting more than $ 2.6 million from a private youth detention center in Pennsylvania in return for giving hundreds of youths and teenagers long sentences .
Judges Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan of the Court of Common Pleas in Luzerne County , Pennsylvania , entered plea agreements in federal court in Scranton admitting that they took payoffs from PA Childcare and a sister company , Western PA Childcare , between 2003 and 2006 .
“ Your statement that I have disgraced my judgeship is true , ” Ciavarella wrote in a letter to the court .
“ My actions have destroyed everything I worked to accomplish and I have only myself to blame . ”
Conahan , who along with Ciavarella faces up to seven years in prison , did not make any comment on the case .
When someone is sent to a detention center , the company running the facility receives money from the county government to defray the cost of incarceration .
So as more children were sentenced to the detention center , PA Childcare and Western PA Childcare received more money from the government , prosecutors said .
Teenagers who came before Ciavarella in juvenile court often were sentenced to detention centers for minor offenses that would typically have been classified as misdemeanors , according to the Juvenile Law Center , a Philadelphia nonprofit group .
One 17 - year - old boy was sentenced to three months ’ detention for being in the company of another minor caught shoplifting .
Others were given similar sentences for “ simple assault ” resulting from a schoolyard scuffle that would normally draw a warning , a spokeswoman for the Juvenile Law Center said .
The Constitution guarantees the right to legal representation in U.S. courts .
But many of the juveniles appeared before Ciavarella without an attorney because they were told by the probation service that their minor offenses did n’t require one .
Marsha Levick , chief counsel for the Juvenile Law Center , estimated that of approximately 5,000 juveniles who came before Ciavarella from 2003 and 2006 , between 1,000 and 2,000 received excessively harsh detention sentences .
She said the center will sue the judges , PA Childcare and Western PA Childcare for financial compensation for their victims .
“ That judges would allow their greed to trump the rights of defendants is just obscene , ” Levick said .
The judges attempted to hide their income from the scheme by creating false records and routing payments through intermediaries , prosecutors said .
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court removed Ciavarella and Conahan from their duties after federal prosecutors filed charges on January 26 .
The court has also appointed a judge to review all the cases involved .
After the 9/11 terror attacks , thousands of people faced a weighty and uncomfortable decision .
Congress had created a special fund to compensate survivors and victims ’ families , but said that those who received compensation from it could not sue airlines or airport security firms , among other entities .
People with claims had to decide whether to accept an early , assured payment from the fund or take their chances in the courts , possibly facing legal hardball tactics , delays and the risk of losing .
In the end , a vast majority sought compensation from the fund , which paid out more than $ 7 billion to survivors of 2,880 people who were killed and to thousands of others who were injured .
Now , more than seven years after the attacks , a new court report suggests that the small minority who went their own way and sued made out better financially : 93 of the 96 claims have been settled , for an average of $ 5 million , or more than twice the average payment from the special fund .

Web exclusive posted Jan. 27 , 2009 , at 4:13 p.m. CSTOntario - based Stonehedge Bio-Resources Inc. announced Jan. 21 it had received $ 2 million from United Kingdom investors to construct an industrial hemp processing plant in eastern Ontario .
Stonehedge has been researching industrial hemp for over a decade , and began work towards commercialization in the past few years .
John Baker , founder and chairman of Stonehedge , said an exact location for the plant has not been secured yet , however , once finances are in line , a site will be chosen .
" We 've been working on it and are very close , " he said .
The company expects to begin construction of the facility this spring , which may employ up to 27 people within the next two years .
The products and coproducts , such as wood - like chips and pellets , produced at the plant will be used for multiple applications , including energy production .
Baker said the plant 's power source has not been determined yet , however , the company would like to use its own product .
The company would also like to construct the facility with " hemcrete , " a product made from hemp containing similar characteristics to concrete .
He added that it may be difficult to do since the facility is n't built yet , and it will be the first of its kind .
" Hemp is the best crop for biomass , especially in this area , " Baker said .
" We are utilizing plant genetics that date back 200 years - the constitution was written on hemp paper .
" The feedstock for the plant will be grown locally on an area of 15,000 acres to 20,000 acres .
Baker said the facility will be capable of processing approximately seven tons of biomass per hour .
Testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer among males age 15 to 44 .
After motor vehicle accidents and suicide , cancer is the leading cause of death in this age group , followed by homicide , heart disease , and HIV .
Testicular cancer is known as the young man 's cancer .
Early detection is the key to survival .
Testicular cancer has a very fast onset since the tumors can be very aggressive .
When the cancer is confined to the testicles , there is often no pain .
By the time pain develops , it is often a sign that the cancer has already spread .
Survival rates increase significantly if treatment has begun before the cancer has a chance to metastasize .
Upon reaching puberty , all men should conduct testicular self - exams at least monthly and preferably every time they shower .
The purpose of a testicular self - exam is to familiarize yourself with the size , shape and texture of your testicles .
If you notice any change , especially a lump , it is imperative that you see your doctor immediately .
Diagnosis is non-invasive , and involves using ultrasound to look at the density , size and shape of the testicles and other masses in the scrotum .
The ease of hosting material on the Web is radically changing the publishing industry , and its effects on scientific publishing have been dramatic .
A number of open access journals have been established , and many traditional journals have started offering the authors of the papers they publish the option of making their material open access for a fee .
The National Institutes of Health , which funds the majority of biomedical research in the US , has encouraged open access to the research it pays for , and Congress eventually mandated an open access policy as part of the NIH 's funding .
But , for the second year running , a group of Congressmen have introduced a bill that would overturn the effort .
We described the genesis of the NIH policy in detail before .
In short , researchers typically have to sign away their copyright to the papers resulting from NIH funding when they appear in a commercial publication .
To improve the access to the research it funds , the NIH requested that scientists hand a copy of the papers over within a year of publication ; the agency would then host it online , where the public and other researchers could access it .
The voluntary policy , however , was n't a rousing success , as researchers either neglected to send in the papers , or were n't sure about any copyright issues doing so presented .
As a result , Congress eventually made the policy mandatory ; any papers resulting from NIH - funded research had to be turned over for open access hosting a year after publication .
Publishers , however , objected , viewing the policy as a threat to the value they could extract from copyrighted publications .
Their objections , in part , eventually led to the introduction of a bill that would roll back the NIH policy , which allowed the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on it last year .
In reporting on that testimony , it was clear that there were issues that went well beyond any threat to the scientific publishing industry created by the mandatory open access policy .
Both witnesses and members of Congress suggested there were a huge range of concerns ; a general mistrust of government involvement in markets , worries about the general fight over intellectual property , and Congressional turf battles all featured .
The hearings also made clear that many committee members had some significant gaps in their knowledge of scientific publishing .
Ultimately , however , that bill never made it beyond those hearings .
That has n't , however , stopped its sponsor from trying .
John Conyers ( D - MI ) has reintroduced the bill in this year 's Congress .
The fact that the bill 's cosponsors are all members of the Judiciary Committee adds credence to our earlier impression that a Congressional turf battle was threatening an NIH policy that the Institutes ' former director , Elias Zerhouni , felt was a major success .
It turns out that the Judiciary Committee feels that the open access policy is an intellectual property issue , but they were n't consulted because the change in policy was enacted as part of a budgetary decision .
Unfortunately for open access fans , this year 's bill seems to present a greater threat to the NIH 's policy .
For one , Congress is distracted by other issues , which might allow a minor amendment to a funding bill to slip through unnoticed .
In addition , Zerhouni gave a strong defense of the open access policy on scientific grounds at last year 's hearings ; he 's since stepped down and , with Tom Daschle withdrawing his nomination , it 's not even clear when a new head of Health and Human Services will be named ; until that position is filled , there wo n't be a new NIH chief named .

RNC Chairman Michael Steele has only been on the job for a handful of weeks , yet he is likely to face a no confidence vote after the special election in New York to fill the vacated House seat of now Sen.
Kirsten Gillibrand .
Republicans are so dissatisfied with Steele that they are ready to boot him out .
Originally it was thought that Steele ’s fate as chairman hinged on the outcome of the special election , but Teagan Goddard is reporting that Republican sources are telling him that the outcome of the election wo n’t matter because the second place finisher in the RNC election is organizing a no confidence vote against Steele .
This information contradicts an AP story yesterday afternoon that claimed that Steele still has party support .
Steele was not elected chair by an overwhelming mandate .
He defeated Dawson on the sixth ballot by only 14 votes .
The RNC apparently panicked and tried to install a black leader of their own to counter President Obama .
However , it seems that this situation came about because RNC members were not enthralled with any of the candidates .
Steele ’s rise to power mirrors the same path that John McCain took to win the Republican nomination last year .
It seems that both men won their elections more by default than enthusiasm .
Advertisements
The GOP has a long history of scapegoating its leaders .
in contrast , the Democratic Party tends to bury its losers .
Rarely , does a failed presidential candidate get a true second chance in the Democratic Party .
Part of me thinks that the GOP is trying to use Steele as an excuse for why Obama is routing their opposition right now , but more realistically I believe that the Republicans have not accepted Steele ’s message that their party has to change .
Many Republicans are still in denial about 2006 and 2008 , and they want to be fed the lie that things will be fine if they keep doing what they have been doing .
Many Republicans do n’t want their party to be more appealing to the urban hip hop crowd .
They like their identity the way it is , and they see no need to change it .
If Steele is removed it will be another ugly symptom of the complete turmoil inside the GOP , and will also illustrate just how far the Republican Party has managed to fall in a few short years .

Renowned financial publication
The Economist reports that , based on the characteristics of the current financial crisis , the U.S. is in a depression , not a recession .
The Economist piece makes the argument that the current crisis is far closer to a depression than a recession and that the only question remaining is how deep the downturn will be .
Photo : Unemployed people looking for work in 1935 .
The admission marks the first time that a major international financial news outlet has acknowledged that the scale of the economic mess is unlike anything seen in recent decades .
Under the headline , Diagnosing depression , the article asks , “ What is the difference between a recession and a depression ? ”
A depression is characterized by “ falling asset prices , a credit crunch and deflation , ” according to the article , all factors that we see unfolding in the current crisis .
“ A depression is the result of a bursting asset and credit bubble , a contraction in credit , and a decline in the general price level , ” according to the article .
“ In the Great Depression average prices in America fell by one - quarter , and nominal GDP ended up shrinking by almost half . ”
Fast forward to the start of 2009 and house prices have fallen by at least 17 per cent over the last two years with that number only set to plunge further over the coming 18 months .
Overall , American homeowners have lost $ 2 trillion of equity during what has become the worst housing slump since World War II .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
U.S. GDP in the fourth quarter last year fell an estimated six per cent , but that number is expected to accelerate through 2009 .
The piece also states that assurances from economists who say that a repeat of the 1930 ’s is impossible “ because policymakers are unlikely to repeat the mistakes of the past , ” are coming from the same people who confidently predicted that “ a nationwide fall in American house prices was impossible and that financial innovation had made the financial system more resilient . ”
The Economist piece makes the argument that the current crisis is far closer to a depression than a recession and that the only question remaining is how deep the downturn will be .

( Updates with official lowering the death toll )
LANDI KOTAL , Pakistan , March 27 ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber killed 37 people when he blew himself up in a crowded Pakistani mosque near the Afghan border on Friday , government officials said .
The attack came hours before U.S. President Barack Obama announced a new strategy for the Afghan war , an approach U.S. officials said would also recognise Pakistan as a key part of the conflict .
[ n N26525038 ]
Militant violence has surged in nuclear - armed Pakistan since mid-2007 , with numerous attacks on the security forces and government and Western targets .
Police , paramilitary forces and government officials were among the congregation in the mosque near Jamrud town , about 30 km ( 20 miles ) from the Afghan border , when the attack happened .
The bomber set off his explosives as an imam , or prayer leader , began the service .
“ The moment the imam said Allahu Akbar ( God is Greatest ) , the blast went off , ” said Tauseer Khan , 70 , from a hospital bed in the nearby Pakistani city of Peshawar .
“ It was huge .
I still ca n’t hear properly , ” said Khan , who had wounds to his hands and face .
His son and grandson were also wounded .
Rahat Gul , a spokesman for the Khyber administration had earlier said 50 people had been killed and 75 wounded but Tariq Hayat Khan , Khyber ’s top government administrator later revised the death toll to 37 .
Among the dead were 14 policemen and paramilitary soldiers while 160 were wounded , Khan said .
Between 250 and 300 people were in the mosque at the time of the blast , he said .
“ The attacker was seen jumping into the courtyard of the mosque and blowing himself up , ” Khan told Reuters .
The two - storey building collapsed .
Worshippers and rescuers searched through piles of bricks , pulling out bodies and carrying them to ambulances in sheets and on rope beds .
Police caps , prayer caps , prayer beads and mobiles telephones were later lined up on a wall outside the mosque .
Rows of abandoned shoes were nearby .
“ ENEMIES OF ISLAM ”
Police initially said a bomb blew up at a police post next to the mosque , which is by the main road leading to the Khyber Pass and the Afghan border beyond .
Pakistani Taliban militants last year stepped up attacks on supplies going through the pass bound for Western forces in landlocked Afghanistan .
Since mid-2007 , much of the violence in Pakistan is believed to have been carried out by militants based in lawless ethnic Pashtun lands on the Afghan border .
In Afghanistan , the Taliban have also sharply escalated their attacks , often operating from the same strongholds in Pakistan .
Obama ’s new strategy will aim to disrupt , dismantle and eventually destroy militant sanctuaries in Pakistan and prevent them from establishing safe havens in Afghanistan .
“ It ’s surprising , those who claim that they are doing jihad ( Muslim holy war ) and then carry out suicide attacks inside mosques during Friday prayers , ” Khan told Geo TV .
“ They are infidels .
They are enemies of Pakistan .
They are enemies of Islam , ” he said .
On Thursday , a suicide bomber killed nine people at a restaurant frequented by militants opposed to a top Pakistani Taliban commander in the South Waziristan region , southwest of Khyber .

Whenever I hear about a rampage massacre like the one that just took place in southern Alabama a few hours ago , so far leaving 11 dead and untold wounded ( casualty numbers seem to tick up every hour ) , the first thing I look for is how the company treated the shooter or the workforce as a whole : did they recently fire him in the usual callous manner that companies do it these days , leaving him desperate and devastated ?
Has the company been following the typical post - Reagan management model in which workers are squeezed with endless downsizings , slashed benefits , and more time at the job for less pay , all in order to fatten the filthy - rich executives ’ already - obscene bonuses ?
The answer in the case of today ’s Alabama shootings already appears to be yes .
It turns out that the plant where the rampage shooter , 27 - year - old Michael McLendon , worked –Reliable Metals Products in Geneva , Alabama–just laid off a sizable portion of their workers a couple of weeks ago , devastating the local community .
But so far little has been mentioned about it in connection with the shootings .
According to a report dated February 18 from a local TV station , WTVY :
Local prefabricated metal manufacturer lays off worker Last Updated : 8:46 AM Feb 18 , 2009
At one time , Reliable Corporation based in Geneva employed 800 .
We ’re being told by those who work there that fellow employees have been receiving their lay - off notices .
Reliable Corporation has been manufacturing pre-fabricated metal products for more than 50 years .
Over recent days , News 4 has received several calls from those who ’ve been laid - off .
They have n’t been told if it ’s temporary , or if it ’s a permanent job loss .
In one correspondence , we ’ve learned that those who ’ve been laid off will meet with a delegation of company and state officials early next month in Geneva .
Following the loss of a body - armor company late last year , Geneva Mayor Wynnton Melton says any loss of jobs for his city is tragic .
News 4 was unsuccessful in getting a statement from reliable officials in Geneva .
In the 1990’s , Geneva lost more than 2,000 textile jobs as they went to overseas ’ countries .
At this time , we ’re not being told if the layoffs are due to the national recession .
We will continue to follow this story as details become available .
As the local news crew reported , it ’s almost impossible to find out any news about the layoffs because Reliable was keeping quiet .
There ’s something creepy about the way locals were n’t able to get any information out to the public about the layoffs , even though they happened , and even though it was big news in the non-official world there in Geneva .
I wonder if this is symptomatic of some larger problem with Reliable ’s treatment of its employees .
You get some clues to the answer via the three lonely comments at the bottom of the WTVY story :
Posted by : Rudy Location : New York on Feb 18 , 2009 at 04:28 PM
My heart goes out to the layoff victims of Reliable Corp .
I found immediate advice and strategies in an iTunes app called “ Pink Slip . ”
It helped me know my rights and keep my head during and after the meeting with HR .
Posted by : Gwynn Location : Westville on Feb 18 , 2009 at 07:56 AM
I have been laid - off from Reliable .
I have not been informed of any meetings .
We were told that the lay - offs were due to lack of work and that if work picked up , we would be called back to work .
If work orders did n’t , we would be terminated at the end of the month .
Posted by : RELIABLE WORKER on Feb 17 , 2009 at 10:35 PM
COMPANY LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES AND GIVING OVERTIME TO OTHER WORKERS IS MORE OF A LOSING BATTLE EITHER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT !
EMPLOYEES WERE TOLD IF THEY WERE CALLED BACK BY MARCH 2ND THEY WOULD HAVE A JOB IF NOT THEY NO LONGER HAD A JOB !CUT OUT OVERTIME AND PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK , NOT ONLY ARE YOU HURTING YOUR EMPLOYEES BUT THE CITY OF GENEVA AS WELL .
LOSS OF INCOME IS A LOSS OF SALES FOR THE CITY .NOT MANY JOBS IN THE CITY MAKES PEOPLE SEEK NEW JOBS ELSEWHERE .
MAKES YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE VOTED WET ON THE WET DRY BALLOT .
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF TAX MONEY FOR THE CITY , WHICH IS NOW BEINGG LOST BY LOSS OF JOBS !
Here you can see the anger , typical yet marginalized for decades , now expressed in the comments section .
Reliable is following a classic Reaganomics corporate policy of treating workers like disposable assets rather than as human beings .
After all , if you fire employees en masse , and squeeze the terrified remaining workers into overtime work , the result is that it saves rich shareholders and executives a few extra bucks .
And that ’s a good thing because the rich need to be taken care of first and foremost , or so we ’ve been told for the past 30 years by all the vile little Ayn Rand kommisars who somehow worked their way into power in this country .
We ’ve been conditioned for 30 straight years to accept the insane idea that companies only exist to serve shareholder / executive interests , and that workers are there by the grace of the plutocrats , and if they do n’t like it , well , they ’re free to quit and find another job .
Which is to say , anyone who ’s not an executive can fuck off .
As I wrote in my book Going Postal , these rampage massacres at workplaces are an entirely new and distinct species of murder which first arose in the mid-1980s ; it began with post office shootings , and quickly spread across America to the private sector , with rampage shootings at companies and factories from coast to coast , year after year .
Why did it all start in that point in time , in the mid-1980s ?
Why did these shootings start then , and not in the 1970s or 1960s ?
What changed ?
It was n’t as though guns suddenly became legalized in the 80s , or that movies just started to get violent .
No , what changed was the Reagan Revolution , and the massive transfer of wealth from the majority of America ’s workforce up to the tiny plutocrat class .
Reaganomics changed the corporate culture , and since we spend most of our lives working , it means our lives were changed –our lives were literally transferred into the offshore bank accounts and Aspen cabins of our bosses ’ bosses .
For the rich to get richer , they had to destroy the old corporate culture which emphasized a mutually beneficial relationship between company and employee , thereby limiting how obscenely rich they could get , and put in its place an ideology which dictated that companies only exist to enrich the executives and major shareholders .
Workers could fuck off and die if they did n’t like it .
So from 1981 on , companies squeezed workers of their “ unlimited juice ” ( in the words of GE ’s former CEO “ Neutron ” Jack Welch , nicknamed that for his firing of 120,000 GE workers while he took in hundreds of millions of dollars in personal bonuses ) , firing them en masse and stripping more benefits from them whenever the executives and shareholders wanted to drive up their quarterly earnings a few cents .
This kind of treatment pushed people to the brink .
While the executives ’ lives got better and better , the average American middle - class worker ’s wages stagnated , their benefits were slashed , and their work hours soared .
The rich got so rich that they even left the rich behind to create a new super - rich class of their own , creating what the New York Times called the “ hyper- rich ” :
Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind When F. Scott Fitzgerald pronounced that the very rich “ are different from you and me , ” Ernest Hemingway ’s famously dismissive response was : “ Yes , they have more money . ”
Today he might well add : much , much , much more money .
The people at the top of America ’s money pyramid have so prospered in recent years that they have pulled far ahead of the rest of the population , an analysis of tax records and other government data by The New York Times shows .
They have even left behind people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year .
Call them the hyper-rich .
They are not just a few Croesus - like rarities .
Draw a line under the top 0.1 percent of income earners – the top one - thousandth .
Above that line are about 145,000 taxpayers , each with at least $ 1.6 million in income and often much more .
The average income for the top 0.1 percent was $ 3 million in 2002 , the latest year for which averages are available .
That number is two and a half times the $ 1.2 million , adjusted for inflation , that group reported in 1980 .
No other income group rose nearly as fast .
The share of the nation ’s income earned by those in this uppermost category has more than doubled since 1980 , to 7.4 percent in 2002 .
The share of income earned by the rest of the top 10 percent rose far less , and the share earned by the bottom 90 percent fell .
This is n’t rocket science .
Workers from management on down had their wealth stripped and transferred up to the plutocrats .
That ’s why these massacres make so much sense to us .
If looked at historically , these workplace - inspired shootings are a logical consequence of this savage ideology .
The details of today ’s massacre suggest that over the past few months , as the Great Depression - 2 deepened , a new pattern in these “ going postal ” shooting sprees has emerged : now , killers take their families down with them .
In today ’s rampage , the shooter began by killing his mother and torching her home , then driving to where other family members lived and killing them , before ending it all at his former employer ’s , Reliable Metals .
This sequence strongly resembles a couple of other recent high - profile family - massacres : one in Los Angeles which left 7 family members dead this January , and another in Ohio a few weeks later leaving 3 dead .
In those massacres , the shooter and his family were left financially devastated by the Great Depression - 2 .
It ’s interesting that McLendon began his attack by taking out his family , but ended it off attacking the source of the pain–inside the company premises , where he ended his life .
It was as if he did n’t want his mother to see how it ended .
For years , these shootings were considered “ random acts ” committed by people who “ snapped for no reason . ”
Now , hundreds of dead victims and a massive financial collapse later , we know better : they ’re reactions against corporate oppression .
If the super - rich and the corporations constantly squeeze their workers of time , money and health , a few are naturally going to “ snap ” and fight back with guns .
These “ going postal ” shootings are , in many ways , like Nat Turner ’s slave rebellion : gory , horrifying , resulting in scores of “ innocents ” dead , led by a nutcase ( Turner was a paranoid - schizophrenic ) , but justified given the intolerable conditions that pushed Turner to rebel .
People did n’t see it that way 1831 , just as we do n’t see these shooting rampages as rebellions today .
Back then , Americans asked why did Turner have to slaughter so many women and children , entire families , while they were sleeping ?
What kind of “ rebel ” is that ?
Turner was considered the incarnation of evil , and was only celebrated much later .
Just as Turner ’s contemporaries were horrified , we ’re shocked today by the gruesome details of the Alabama shootings and the scores of others .
And some of us are wondering under our breaths why he did n’t kill the people who actually created the economic Armageddon that destroyed him ?
Why kill so many innocents , even desperate as he was ?
When my book Going Postal came out explaining workplace massacres as rebellions against Reaganomics , and comparing the workplace shooters to slave rebels of the past , most people reacted violently or tried to dismiss my argument with a roll of the eyes .
The total economic collapse over the last year has finally exposed once and for all the awful truth : that the last 30 years has been little more than a Roman plundering of America ’s wealth , with America ’s hyper- rich as the Roman colonials stripping the rest of the nation ’s wealth while giving them a few coliseums and togas to divert their attention ; a ruthless class war that in the end destroyed even our hyper - rich class , much as the Russian oligarchs ’ boundless greed eventually led them to devour each other and their country with it .
These past few decades have been nothing short of a one - way class war , and we ’re all now kicking ourselves too late for not realizing it .
Only those few workers who took up arms against their companies have any claim to posthumous dignity .
Schopenhauer was right as always : “ All truth passes through three stages .
First , it is ridiculed .
Second , it is violently opposed .
Third , it is accepted as being self - evident . ”
Today was just another bloody battle in America ’s Thirty Years ’ Class War .
Update : Newest reports coming in suggest that McLendon may have stoppped working at Reliable Metal a few years ago , rather than during last month ’s layoffs .
Instead it appears he lost a job at a different plant last week : sausage - maker Kelley Foods , in nearby Elba , Alabama .
As predicted , the workplace is already being fingered as the trigger - motive .
Kirke Adams , district attorney for Geneva and Dale counties where the shootings took place , told CBS ’ The Early Show , “ It appears to be something involving a domestic dispute plus a disgruntled employee from his former place of employment . “
Also , as so often is the case , the rampager was n’t a Marilyn Manson - loving Guns ‘N Ammo psycho or a godless liberal moral relativist the way people want him or her to be after every such attack ; instead , a fellow classmate described him as “ an A student ” who “ never got into trouble . ”
Latest Update : Now it ’s official , the workplace drove him to murder , according to Bloomberg : “ Authorities in southeastern Alabama investigating what prompted a man to kill 10 people in a shooting spree discovered a list of former co-workers and supervisors in his house , a prosecutor said today .
While Tom Anderson , a Coffee County assistant district attorney , said he would n’t characterize it as a hit list , “ next to those names he had written descriptions of having been reported for infractions or being reprimanded . ”
The descriptions of how McLendon carefully handled the bodies of his mother and 4 dogs suggests not a serial murderer ’s rage but something much more tragic and painful : it was as though he was arranging a kind of funeral pyre .
Here is the first photo of McLendon that ’s appeared .
He looks like a casting agent ’s idea of the “ nice all - American kid . ”
It ’s going to be hard to make him out to be a monster unless they can find a more villainous - looking photo .

Nothing like seeing people doing things that make you saw “ Wow . ” and they are using your project !
First , I posted on the Mozilla Labs blog about Boris Bokowski and Simon Kaegi and their work with Bespin fronting a headless Eclipse .
Their demo is exciting to us as they were able to implement the Bespin Server API in short order , and use Eclipse to run Java compilation on the server , thus returning errors back to Bespin .
This is exciting as this would enable a huge variety of languages and functionality .
I was fortunate enough to meet Boris , Simon , and an Eclipse crew today .
It was a real pleasure to talk tech and share ideas .
Amazing when you are surrounded by smart engineers who have been doing tools for a long time !
Then , as I sit at the airport , I see a message from Avi Bryant of Seaside and DabbleDB fame ( as well as many other things ) .
He did something very cool indeed .
He backed Bespin with Squeak :
I work in Smalltalk , which deals with source code at method
granularity rather than file granularity .
I spent a few minutes today
playing with a Bespin backend for Squeak that exposes the package /
class / method hierarchy as if each method were a separate file , which
works very nicely , and feels very familiar ( since column browsers
were , AFAIK , invented for Smalltalk - 80 in the first place :) .
He points out the issues of the current Dashboard to Editor design , which we agree with .
Our plan is actually to unify the two , and now we want to do it even faster to help his use case .
What if you can be in the editor and quickly bring down the horizontal file pane ( moving down the editor ) .
Then you can select the methods and the code will change below .
Excited to get that going .
We also need small things like having the dashboard remember state .
Thanks to the people that have spent time playing with Bespin .
Very much appreciated !
about this card
Greetings from London !
On Wednesdays I like to post an older card and then spend the day working as a cryptozoologist .
I spent the day lurking in the shadows of Paddington Station , hoping to spot an upright walking bear believed to be from Darkest Peru .
I 'm not very good at cryptozoology .

Like over usage of antibiotics , using some forms of mouthwash consistently could actually be detrimental to your dental health and the environment .
I was talking to my dentist about mouthwashes and he said they usually do not kill all the bacteria .
The bacteria left behind can become resistant to a particular mouthwash ; ultimately resulting in a colony of “ superbugs ” in your mouth .
Additionally , most mouthwashes have a high level of alcohol , which can present problems for people with alcoholism .
Also , some mouthwashes actually stain your teeth if you use them too often ; however dentists can usually recommend ones that wo n’t .
On the environmental side of things , some mouthwashes can contain nasty chemicals such as :
formaldehyde – toxic to aquatic organisms
sodium lauryl sulfate – toxic in aquatic environments
polysorbate – toxic to aquatic organisms
cetylpyridinium Chloride – toxic to aquatic organisms
benzalkonium chloride – highly toxic to aquatic life
.. notice a pattern ?
What you do n’t accidentally swallow , just winds up down the drain and from there into our waterways ; many of which are becoming increasingly toxic soups .
There are some greener alternatives .
Bad breath is most often caused by an excess of bacteria in the mouth .
An easy way to help control these bacteria aside from regular brushing and flossing is with a salt water mouth wash .
Add as much salt as you can to a glass of warm water ( to the point where it will no longer dissolve ) , then gargle and swish around your mouth .
Do this daily .
This preparation is also particularly useful for infections of the mouth for short term relief .
I had a recurring infection under a molar which was extraordinarily painful and was going to require a root canal – pretty much immediately by the time I finally hauled my butt into the dentist .
He said there was no guarantee the root canal would work , so I just got him to clean things up as best he could , then by gargling salt water a few times a day , the infection rapidly receded – without any antibiotics required .
It was n’t a miracle cure by any means as I did have flare - ups , mostly due to me not keeping up the regime I think ; but it certainly helped keep the infection at bay until I finally admitted to myself 5 years later it was time to get the darn thing yanked .
The other positive effect of using a salt water mouthwash is that it will also whiten your teeth to a degree , but do n’t expect miracles if you ’re a heavy smoker or coffee drinker .
If you ’re looking for a mouthwash with a bit of flavor kick , you can also try these simple home made mint , lemon and tea tree mouthwash recipes .
Strong alcoholic beverages such as gin or vodka are also effective mouthwashes ; but if you ’re tempted to swallow , perhaps do n’t drive afterwards – and there ’s the additional problem of perhaps smelling like a distillery :) .
There are non-alcohol based mouthwashes available commercially , but be sure to check the label for environmentally unfriendly and unhealthy chemicals .
Often they ’ll be as bad as their alcoholic counterparts – sometimes worse , as they ’ll have different chemicals to take the place of alcohol .
Do remember that mouthwashes are n’t a substitute for brushing your teeth or regular dentist visits , just an extra line of defence .
Do you have tips or recipes for human and earth friendly mouthwash ?

Charter Communications , headed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
Charter says it is the nation 's fourth largest cable company and that it will be shedding $ 8 billion in debt by restructuring .
The company originally announced it was seeking Chapter 11 protection on February 12 and today announced details of its plans .
It will continue operations as it restructures .
Allen , who is also owner of the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trailblazers , holds about 35 % of the shares of Charter , according to the company 's latest annual report ( 10 - K ) filing with the SEC .
He is the chairman of the board and he will continue to be the company 's largest stakeholder .
In accordance with the greedy trend of the times , it seems that one of his company 's first orders of business , was to ensure that Charter 's top execs were adequately set up in their golden parachutes and post - bankruptcy bonuses .
According to an SEC filing on March 12 , 2009 , they will qualify for giant hunks of cash if the company reemerges from bankruptcy , and potentially , even if it does n't , or they are terminated .
The bonuses are : CEO Neil Smit - $ 6 million ; COO Michael Lovett - $ 2.38 million ; CFO Eloise Schmitz - $ 765,000 ; and do n't forget the lawyer , general counsel Grier Raclin - $ 765,000 .
Here is the precise wording regarding these bonuses :
" The [ Restructuring Value Program ( the “ RVP ” ) ] provides incentives to encourage and reward participants for a successful restructuring of the Company .
Participants who continue to be employed by the Company or its subsidiaries until payment of RVP awards earn payments under the RVP upon either ( i ) the Company ’s emergence from its Chapter 11 restructuring proceeding ( the “ Proceeding ” ) or ( ii ) , if the Company ’s restructuring plan is the Joint Plan ( as defined in the Plan ) , when the Commitment Fees under the Joint Plan are first payable .
Participants also earn their RVP payments upon an earlier of ( i ) their termination of employment due to death or disability , or their termination on or after the Company ’s emergence from the Proceeding by the Company for a reason other than “ cause , ” or voluntarily due to a “ good reason ” ( as each such term is defined in the Plan ) or ( ii ) a “ change in control ” of the Company if they are then employed by the Company or its subsidiaries .
The target RVP awards for the Company ’s named executive officers as of the date hereof ( which are subject to change in accordance with the terms of the Plan ) are : N. Smit - $ 6 million ; M. Lovett - $ 2.38 million ; E. Schmitz - $ 765,000 ; and G. Raclin - $ 765,000 .
But wait , there 's more !
These executives may qualify for yet another set of bonuses which are labeled as the Cash Incentive Program .
Here are the amounts : Smit - $ 2.5 million ; Lovett - $ 910,000 ; Schmitz - $ 664,000 ; and Raclin - $ 597,000 .
The best job in America these days has to be executive of a large publicly traded company .
Does n't matter how you perform , the cash just keeps a - flowin ' .
Marketing veteran Cindy Gallop and software developer Wendell Davis are on a quest to make the world a better place , with a crowdsourcing project to motivate people to do big things by taking small bites .
Their theory : Small , good intentions can bring about great leaps .
Gallop is the former global marketing chief and U.S. chairman for the BBH marketing behemoth that ran campaigns for Levi's , Axe Body Spray and other brands .
She 's joining with former Splice and Zooomr CEO Davis ( pictured ) to accomplish this lofty task one piece at a time .
They 'll encourage corporations to work with the customers they seek , as the community tackles a user - generated database of large and small causes .
Their unlaunched site , IfWeRantheWorld.com , should succeed in giving online activism some sorely - needed teeth .
Rather than raising awareness , the site is set up to convert intent into action , to get things done .
As a side effect , it could reinvent advertising as a transparent interaction between corporations and individuals .
" The single largest pool of untapped resource in this world is human good intentions that never translate into action , " said Gallop , who founded the company with Davis two years ago after digital guru Esther Dyson introduced them .
Gallop says current do - gooder networks make it too hard to find achievable , concrete tasks that fit one 's skill set , time and budget – and that offer instant gratification .
" For a large amount of the world , doing good is fundamentally very , very boring , " explained Gallop .
" If you go to the homepage of something like DoSomething .org , or any one of the many [ like it ] , there is an instant yawn factor - – ' I know this is really good stuff , I should be doing it , but I 'm half asleep already . "
" There is no Google of action , " she added .
IfWeRantheWorld.com breaks even the largest goodwill projects ( " feed Darfur " ) down into discrete tasks , which it distributes to members through a commercially supported , socially networked environment .
When people have the urge to act on something that irritates them about the world , they can actually do something .
Their plan ( more below ) not only impressed us , but also Dyson , who said it will create " a liquidity of goodness . "
Former Google executive Katie Jacobs Stanton , who joined the Obama administration as " director of citizen participation , " heard about the plan from Gallop at the TED conference last month .
Here 's how it works .
A simple , Google - like search box on the site will greet first - time visitors with the partially - completed sentence , " If I ran the world I would .... "
Their entries join a database of action platforms , which platform originators and community members break down into discrete tasks – irreducible atoms of action .
Members complete these tasks , assign them to friends , offer kudos for jobs well done and offer advice to various action platforms .
Completed tasks and kudos appear on your profile page , which lists everything you 've done – a little different for most people than everything you say you support .
" I deplore Facebook causes , " said Gallop .
" I absolutely do n't deplore the people behind them and what they 're trying to do , but all too often , they allow people to affiliate -– not to act , but to affiliate . "
She and Davis believe their site 's reality - based user profiles will lead to merit - based online dating , real reputation building and other phenomena not found on other social networks .
On IfWeRantheWorld , it 's not enough to claim that your awareness has been raised – you 'll have to prove it .
An example of an action platform would be something like " plant a garden to feed the local homeless . "
One person might secure the site , another might convince a local nursery to donate seeds , someone else might know a graphic designer with the time and inclination to create promotional leaflets , another participant could print those , while volunteers plant , harvest and distribute crops – and so on .
These tasks appear will in a zoomable timeline with photos , videos and blog - style updates , putting each step into context so individuals can see the effect they 've had .
There 's no shortage of sites dedicated to online activism , but this one lets individuals contribute time , ingenuity and other resources with greater efficiency , while exerting a sliding level of control .
Davis and Gallop studied World of Warcraft to create a structure in which a rotating cast of leaders might direct a given project at different stages – the same way WOW teams self - organize around different people , depending on how their areas of expertise stack up to the task at hand .
Many in the digital generation will prefer this to writing a check , dropping it in the mail and assuming someone somewhere has put it to good use .
Davis and Gallop hope to make money on this humanitarian enterprise – and why not ?
Corporations will participate in the system for an annual fee ( $ 200 to $ 10,000 , depending on their size ) , in order to build action platforms or encourage their employees to help out with certain platforms .
Commercially , the site 's special sauce is an ability to match corporations and causes .
If Coca - Cola wants to target 18 - to 25 - year old males , it could use the site to determine which action platforms that demographic supports , and lend financial or employee support .
This would let it interact with a targeted audience in a positive way , with relative transparency — no greenwashing allowed .
Or , they could offer product giveaways as task completion incentives that double as a marketing technique .
" Coca - Cola 's Consumer Social Responsibility agenda is ' bring fresh water to the world , ' " explained Gallop .
" Coca - Cola might say , ' for this period of time , we 're going to reward everybody working on this agenda above a certain level activity with Coca - Cola points . '
The cause wins , because it galvanizes action , people win because they get something of value for doing something they were doing anyway , and the brand wins , because you 're bringing people into the brand franchise . "
If We Ran the World would let corporations demonstrate verifiable social responsibility while reaching a public that has grown increasingly resistant to traditional strains of marketing .
" It 's really about bringing individuals and businesses together on a completely level playing field , " said Gallop , " where both are judged by one thing and one thing only , which is , ' What are you doing ? ' "
Gallop calls this " action branding , " and says it will work as well for corporations that want to improve their reputations as it will for individuals looking to define themselves and impress potential mates .
Rarely — if ever — has an idea managed so neatly to fuse the do - gooder instinct that appears when an individual is frustrated by a disagreeable reality , companies ' corporate social - responsibility and marketing budgets , and worthy causes .
Soon , we 'll find out if it works .
Gallop and Davis explained the site to me at length , showing off several well - thought - out wireframe mock - ups .
They 're seeking individuals and corporations willing to fund the site 's launch in return for charter member status .
Once they 've funded the site 's launch , Gallop and Davis say they 'll use web 2.0 to propagate it : A Twitter account ( @IWRTW ) will let people participate without ever going to the main site , SMS messages will assign tasks to friends and monitor action platforms , a Facebook widget will display members ' profile information and contain a fully - functional version of the main IWRTW site and mobile apps ( for iPhone , Android and others ) will encapsulate the site while adding a local component .
If you have an extra 45 minutes to spare , you might shake your phone for a list of micro-actions in your immediate area .
The founders of If We Ran the World have each found success in their previous ventures .
If this action - oriented , accountable , commercially viable operation gets off the ground , it 's not hard to see how it could make the world a quantifiably better place .

We really dropped the ball on letting people know ahead of time , but Joey and I were at the New England Webcomics Weekend !
On the first night I might have had too many opinions ( see above ( or below ) ) , but otherwise things went swimmingly .
Turns out maybe webcomics - makers are the nicest ever , even the ones you think might be scary .
Perhaps even especially those ones ?
We were wined ( beer - ed ? ) and dined by the excellent people of TopatoCo , and when I was n't meeting folks at our table I explored their really great building .
Now I 'm beset with jealousy that I do n't have an enormous factory to wander around .
I took some photos , of course

Social neuroscientists criticized for exaggerating links between brain activity and emotions .
A study attacking some of the most prominent research in the burgeoning field of social neuroscience is flawed and unfair , according to top scientists who have been accused of overselling their results .
Brain imaging is used to assess neural mechanisms in social behaviour .
SocialBrainLab , Univ. Med. Center Groningen
Social neuroscience is the study of the neuro­biological mechanisms underlying social behaviour .
The field frequently uses functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to reveal which brain areas are activated while a subject is exposed to specific social interactions — for example , situations that may evoke jealousy or the perception of unfairness .
But a no-holds - barred paper1 , accepted for publication in Perspectives on Psychological Science and already circulating widely on the Internet , claims that many studies in the field are worthless because brain imaging data have been poorly analysed .
The paper was written by Edward Vul , a PhD student supervised by neuroscientist Nancy Kanwisher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , along with psychologists at the University of California , San Diego , including Harold Pashler .
The paper has touched a nerve : brain imaging studies were derided by some as " the new phrenology " when they became common 15 years ago , and interpretations of their highly complex data were denounced as naive .
But those directly attacked say they are familiar with , and avoid , the pitfalls .
Vul and his co-authors say they wrote the paper because they were concerned by what they considered to be the " implausibly high correlations " reported between brain activation and particular forms of behaviour , and the lack of methodological details provided .
So they selected 54 papers in social neuroscience and sent a brief questionnaire to the authors requesting details of their analyses .
They concluded that in a 'red list ' of 31 cases — often in high - profile journals , including Nature and Science — the authors made fundamental errors in data handling and statistics .
They particularly criticize a ' non- independence error ' , in which bias is introduced by selecting data using a first statistical test and then applying a second non-independent statistical test to those data .
This error , they say , arises from selecting small volumes of the brain , called voxels , on the basis of their high correlation with a psychological response , and then going on to report the magnitude of that correlation .
" At present , all studies performed using these methods have large question marks over them , " they write .
In a rebuttal2 , four authors of different red-list papers explain that there was no non-independence error because calculating the size of the correlation is not a statistical test .
Appropriate corrections ensure that the correlations between the selected voxels and psychological responses are likely to be real , and not noise , they add .
And the strictness of the correction means that those correlations are necessarily less frequent and of higher magnitude — a situation far from implausible .
Vul and his colleagues also claim that the magnitude of correlation is limited by the average reliability of fMRI data generally .
Not so , the accused respond : although the reliability of fMRI is very variable , the upper ceiling on data quality is extremely high .
The swift rebuttal was prompted by scientists ' alarm at the speed with which the accusations have spread through the community .
The provocative title — ' Voodoo correlations in social neuroscience ' — and iconoclastic tone have attracted coverage on many blogs , including that of Newsweek .
Those attacked say they have not had the chance to argue their case in the normal academic channels .
" I first heard about this when I got a call from a journalist , " comments neuroscientist Tania Singer of the University of Zurich , Switzerland , whose papers on empathy are listed as examples of bad analytical practice .
" I was shocked — this is not the way that scientific discourse should take place . "
Singer says she asked for a discussion with the authors when she received the questionnaire , to clarify the type of information needed , but got no reply .
" We did n't disclose all our potential criticisms before asking these people to tell us things that should have already been in their method sections , " says an unrepentant Vul .
" Would they have described their methods differently if we had ? "
They would indeed , says bio­psychologist Turhan Canli of Stony Brook University , New York , who has four papers on the red list .
He argues that the questionnaire , which was billed as taking no more than a few minutes to complete , was not able to capture the rationale for using particular analyses .

The article is scheduled for publication in September , alongside one or more replies .
But the accused scientists are concerned that the impression now being established through media reports will be hard to shake after the nine - month delay .
" We are not worried about our close colleagues , who will understand the arguments .
We are worried that the whole enterprise of social neuroscience falls into disrepute , " says neuroscientist Chris Frith of University College London , whose Nature paper3 on response to perceived fairness was called into question .
" On the other hand , we all agree that there is a kernel of truth in what Vul and his colleagues write about some of the literature being shaky , " adds Christian Keysers of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands , whose 2007 paper in NeuroImage on empathy was highlighted4 .
" We can never be reminded often enough of the importance of good statistical practice . "
Ministers should prepare the British people to " adapt " in the longer term to a landscape devastated by climate change , including the possible abandonment of parts of London and East Anglia , a leading industry body warns today .
Action to curb carbon emissions is failing , so the UK should immediately change the way it designs buildings , transport and energy infrastructure in preparation for aworld potentially characterised by extreme heat and high sea levels , argues the Institution of Mechanical Engineers ( IMechE ) in a new report .
The institute said it wanted its latest research to provoke serious action for future planning " not just for the sake of our planet but also for the human race .
Yes , we need to mitigate [ emissions ] – but the evidence shows this is not working alone . "
Even with significant global commitment to avert climate change it could be many centuries before average temperatures can be stabilised , says the document , Climate Change : Adapting to the Inevitable ? , which was described by environmentalists as a " wake - up call " for government .
IMechE said that sea levels are predicted to rise by 2 m by 2250 and 7 m by the end of that century .
" A seven - metre rise in sea levels would impact on vast areas of the UK , including parts of London which border the Thames , [ such as ] Canary Wharf , Chelsea and Westminster , all of which would need to be abandoned , " the report argues .
Although they were long - term predictions , the authors say Britain should be preparing for change today and they questioned whether Britain should be considering new nuclear power stations at places such as Sizewell on the Suffolk coast .
Tim Fox , head of environment and climate change at the IMechE and one of the authors of the publication , denied the institute was being alarmist or seeking to undermine actions against greenhouse gases .
They were merely trying to be " pragmatic " engineers who needed to prepare for extreme scenarios , he said .
The action the members of IMechE want includes :
• Building new railways because many of the existing routes use valleys that could be flooded
• Building reservoirs underground to prevent evaporation
• Spending heavily on researching new forms of energy such as fusion
Environmentalists said the report was prescient .
" If we do n't take action quickly to reduce carbon emissiosns we could be facing catastrophic change .
This could have long - term implications but the action needs to take place in the next few years , " said Robin Webster , energy and climate change campaigner at Friends of the Earth .
Vicky Pope , head of climate change advice at the government 's Meteorological Office , said she agreed with much of the IMechE report .
" We clearly must continue with action against carbon emissions but adaptation is also important .
The Climate Change
Act puts into place policies which support people to assess risk and take action on adaptation , " she added .
The climate change modelling used in the IMechE report was developed by the University of East Anglia and was in line with current international thinking , Fox said , claiming that politicians and others tended to be more focused on short - term actions without considering longer term consequences and solutions .
The British canal systems , the Forth Road Bridge and further afield the Panama Canal were projects that were constructed to last up to 250 years and it was time that government considered what kind of infrastructure would be needed post - 2100 especially as the Kyoto Protocol against climate change had produced no reduction in carbon output , he added .
IMechE said that even under less extreme circumstances there would be a need for decisions on the building or enhancement of flood defences , or ultimately whether an area will be no longer fit for habitation .
Fox said he realised that the current credit crunch made it difficult for governments to invest , but he said cash spent now would offer future savings .
These are from the weekend paper .
Actual quotes from South Africa ’s minister of foreign affairs , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma ( Jacob Zuma ’s ex-wife , and the ex-ex- minister of health who introduced the idea that AIDS is simply a disease of poverty , easily cured with garlic and African potatoes ) …
“ A judge is not supposed to do that .
It ’s not for judges to decide on foreign policy .
They do n’t run government and they do n’t run foreign policy .
There is separation of powers .
They run the judiciary .
I do n’t comment on the judiciary . ”
( This after a judge in SA ’s constitutional court sided with the current minister of health that it was unadvised to prevent the Dalai Lama from visiting ) .
“ Tutu does not run government .
Remember , he said he was not going to vote .
If it were up to him , there would be no elections next month . ”
( In response to Archbishop Desmond Tutu declaring that he would now boycott the conference . )
Which got even the usually intelligent finance minister , Trevor Manuel , involved : “ Is he just the spiritual leader of the Buddhists in Tibet or is he the one who on March 28 1959 established the government of Tibet in exile in the same way Taiwan was established to counter the legality of a single China ? ”
“ The reason why the Dalai Lama wants to be here is to make a big global political statement about the secession of Tibet from China .
He wants to do it on the free soil of SA , ” Manuel said .
“ I am sure he is welcome to come at any other time but we should not allow him to raise the global issue that will impact on the standing of SA .
Quite frankly this has nothing to do with the PSL ( Professional Soccer League ) .
It is a matter of the relationship between states and that is what we have to stand up for . ”
But , back to the continuing lunacy of the foreign minister :
“ Foreign policy has to be discussed and has to be understood .
But at the end of the day we ca n’t all conduct foreign policy .
I ’m not casting any aspersions on anyone .
But the truth of the matter that foreign policy has to be conducted at one level and has to be co-ordinated . ”
“ China can not bully us .
But of course , they also have their own interests .
As a country , they will further their own interests .
But we are not hiding the fact that we want to have good relations with China – like everybody else in the world . ”
“ Human rights are also about jobs , education and shelter .
You ca n’t divorce economic interest from human rights .
Our [ Bill ] of rights is much more broader than that of many countries . ”
“ But when we took a decision on his visit we looked at what is the national interest - which includes making sure that the country runs , human rights , in the broad sense , are protected , people have food , shelter and jobs .
What brings stability is the combination of each of all these rights . ”
Which earned the following response from Professor Geir Lundestad , director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute :
“ We are disappointed that the South African government did not stand up to Chinese pressure , particularly bearing in mind the strong support the ANC got from abroad and the Norwegian Nobel Committee in its historic struggle against apartheid . ”
And my take : claiming that denying the Dalai Lama entrance to a conference to discuss peace and global harmony is actually in the DEFENCE of human rights is the sort of double - speak gobbledygook you ’d expect from a government with absolutely no respect for human rights .
Claiming that Desmond Tutu , one of the greatest humanists alive , is in favour of the destruction of democracy because he WON’T vote in a political system that has become nothing but a collection of favouritism and corruption is just spurious bullshit .
About the only ANC / government representative who has said anything approaching sense is the current Health Minister , Barbara Hogan ( who has now earned the ire of the unsackable Dlamini - Zuma ) : “ Just the very fact that this government has refused entry to the Dalai Lama is an example of a government who is dismissive of human rights .
I believe [ the government ] needs to apologise to the citizens of this country , because it is in your name that this great man who has struggled for the rights of his country … has been denied access . ”
The government decision was , said the Dalai Lama , “ another manifestation of one of the fundamental challenges to world peace as a whole : namely , a lack of understanding and mutual respect ” .
“ I believe religious , social and political leaders throughout the world have a responsibility to ensure principles triumph over the obsession with money and power . ”
Except for the missing word “ unearned ” in front of “ money and power ” , I have no problem with those sentiments .
On Wednesday , we discussed news that AT&T had begun sending takedown notices to users whom the RIAA has accused of illegally downloading copyrighted works .
Cox and Comcast are both cooperating with the RIAA in that regard as well .
However , while Cox seems willing to shut off service in the case of repeat offenders , Comcast denied that it was considering a similar penalty , and AT&T said they 'll flat out refuse to terminate service on the RIAA 's word alone ; it will take a court order .
They seem satisfied with the effect letters have had on inhibiting such downloads : " ' It 's a standard part of everybody 's terms of service , ' [ AT&T senior executive vice president Jim Cicconi ] said .
' If somebody is engaging in illegal activity , it basically gives us the right to do it ...
We 're not a finder of fact and under no circumstances would we ever suspend or terminate service based on an allegation from a third party .
We 're just simply reminding people that they can't engage in illegal activity . '
Cicconi said the company began testing this kind of ' forward noticing ' late last year and even experimented with sending certified letters .
Cicconi said the notices worked .
The company saw very few repeat offenders . "
It seems every news story about the AIG bonuses now makes reference to anonymous death threats that are pouring into the company .
I started making left - wing political cartoons one month after 9/11 .
At that time , most people were n’t exactly pumped to hear someone making fun of the whole idea of a “ War on Terror ” and calling President Bush an idiot .
I got my share of nasty emails .
I also received death threats .
( I soon learned this comes with the territory . )
I set up a special folder in my email program where I dumped all the creepy junk : the missives from the guy who fantasized about sodomizing me with a grenade launcher ; the guy who said he was gonna personally beat the shit out of me ; the guy who asked inappropriate questions about my wife , etc. etc .
Anyway , my point is : Did I go around crying about all these threats ?
NO .
Did I punk out like a little baby and stop making cartoons ?
NO .
Did I go whine to Congress about “ Boo - hoo , I ca n’t tell you who got the bonuses , they might receive a nasty email ” ?
NO .
I took a deep breath and rolled up my sleeves and — after a strange phone call in the middle of the night — got my number de-listed and went about my business like a champ .
And mind you , when I received these threats , I was n’t working in some high - security office building and living in a fancy gated community with no sidewalks where you need a passcode just to go to the golf course .
Hardly .
I was a schlub in a bathrobe living in a third - story Brooklyn walk - up .
The only way I could ’ve been a softer target would be if I was made out of Yoplait .
And I was n’t exactly getting paid millions of dollars for my troubles , either .
I was temping part - time for $ 20 / hour and GIVING ALL MY GODDAMN MONEY AWAY , because it was post - 9/11 America and we were all supposed to pull together and chip in for the common good .
Remember when ?
My God , though — if I had been making that sweet AIG money , not only would I have happily endured a few more death threats , I WOULD HAVE ACTIVELY LET PEOPLE TRY TO KILL ME .
Pay me $ 700,000 a year , or however much the AIG guy whining in today ’s New York Times made , and you can threaten me with death all goddamn day .
Because do you have any idea how much money that is ???
Hell , I ’ll let you throw rocks at me .
I ’ll let you poison my soup .
You can slash my tires and spray - paint my driveway .
AND ONCE I GET ALL THAT MONEY , I ’M TOTALLY PAYING OFF SOME STUDENT LOANS AND FIXING THE GARAGE ROOF AND BUYING SOME NEW PANTS .
Because that ’s an insane amount of money .
These AIG losers bring the country ’s financial system to its knees , get paid millions of dollars for their troubles , walk away unscathed , and then turn around and complain because some idiot using a computer at the public library decides to hit “ send ” before catching his breath ?
Meanwhile American teenagers are getting shot at in Iraq because maybe the Army will help pay their college tuition ?
“ Death threats ? ” Seriously ?
Here ’s my proposal to all AIG bigwigs :
You give me the money you made at AIG and I ’ll shoulder the impossible burden you ’re living with .
Any takers ?
IT took 24 years , but PepsiCo now has its own version of New Coke .
The PepsiCo Americas Beverages division of PepsiCo is bowing to public demand and scrapping the changes made to a flagship product , Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice .
Redesigned packaging that was introduced in early January is being discontinued , executives plan to announce on Monday , and the previous version will be brought back in the next month .
Also returning will be the longtime Tropicana brand symbol , an orange from which a straw protrudes .
The symbol , meant to evoke fresh taste , had been supplanted on the new packages by a glass of orange juice .
The about - face comes after consumers complained about the makeover in letters , e-mail messages and telephone calls and clamored for a return of the original look .
Some of those commenting described the new packaging as “ ugly ” or “ stupid , ” and resembling “ a generic bargain brand ” or a “ store brand . ”

With Android getting all Flash - ey , Apple 's " Goldilocks " position on Flash -- the full Flash player is too hefty , Flash Lite is too weak -- seemed pretty untenable .
Now Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen has revealed that Apple and Adobe are " collaborating " on making Flash a reality on the iPhone , citing the technical challenge it presents .
What 's clear is that with all this work to do , it does n't seem they 're going the watered - down Flash Lite route , but we 're trying not to hold our breath for a full - on , Hulu - friendly version that will finally help us get that Doogie Howser fix on the go .

A fluorescent polymer that can accurately measure the temperature inside living cells has been invented by researchers in Japan .
Seiichi Uchiyama and his group at the University of Tokyo have developed the heat - sensitive fluorescent polymer , which they have packaged in a chemically inert polymer gel .
The gel can be injected directly into cells and used to detect variations in temperature as small as half a degree , without interfering with cellular functions .
The gel ’s covering of hydrophilic sulfate groups ensures it disperses throughout the cytoplasm rather than sticking to the cell membrane .
’ At the moment we can measure the average temperature of the cell as a whole , ’ explains Uchiyama , ’ but we are working on attaching a localising agent ( such as a peptide ) to the surface so that individual organelles can be targeted more specifically .
This will allow us to map the spatial and temporal variations in temperature within the cell . ’
The thermometer unit works by incorporating a water - sensitive fluorophore inside a thermally - responsive polymer .
At low temperature the polymer has an open structure and absorbs water , which quenches the fluorescence .
When it is heated , the polymer structure contracts , driving out the water and making the gel fluoresce .
The level of fluorescence can be measured , revealing the temperature within the cell .
Previous molecular thermometers , employing europium complexes or green fluorescent protein , were hampered by poor thermal sensitivity , meaning that they could n’t really detect the subtle temperature variation accompanying biological processes .
This lack of sensitivity , coupled with the fact that their output could be confused by variations in pH or ionic strength , limited their utility .
Prasanna de Silva from Queen ’s University in Belfast , UK , says Uchiyama ’s success in introducing the thermometer gel into living cells sets an excellent precedent for future applications of the technology .
’ If you have a thermometer of such a small size , then you can put it into all sorts of interesting places .
The demonstration that this gel functions inside a cell means that there ’s almost nowhere it ca n’t go .
’ I think people might have felt before that temperature was not worth measuring , ’ adds de Silva , ’ because we expect it to be held constant most of the time .
We are beginning to realise that , while the cell ’s buffering mechanisms do eventually work , there are short - term local effects .
So if you can watch a cell in small spatial detail , with good time resolution then you can pick up on things which would n’t be seen otherwise . ’
The ability to measure variation in cell temperatures accurately will not only give insights into the intimate workings of the complex chemical systems at work within them , but also aid understanding and diagnosis of disease .
’ Pathological cells are generally slightly warmer than normal cells because of their enhanced metabolic activity , ’ says Uchiyama .
’ We ’re working on a way to get cells to absorb the thermometer gel from culture media , which would eliminate the need for microinjection and make it much more useful for diagnosis .
We can also tune the solubility and functional temperature range to make the gel suitable for a wide range of cell samples . ’

Price - slashing failed to rescue a bleak holiday season for beleaguered retailers , as sales plunged across most categories on shrinking consumer spending , according to new data released Thursday .
Despite a flurry of last - minute shoppers lured by the deep discounts , total retail sales , excluding automobiles , fell over the year - earlier period by 5.5 % in November and 8 % in December through Christmas Eve , according to MasterCard Inc. 's Spending Pulse unit .
When ...
Tomorrow Japan and South Korea will celebrate White Day , an annual event when men are expected to buy a gift for the adored women in their lives .
It is a relatively new concept that was commercially created as payback for Valentine 's Day .
That 's because in both countries , 14 February is all about the man .
On Valentine 's Day , women are expected to buy all the important male figures in their lives a token gift : not just their partners , but their bosses or older relatives too .
If the present is a romantic one , it is known as honmei- choco ( chocolate of love ) .
If it is a mark of respect , it is known as giri- choco ( chocolate of obligation ) .
This seems fair enough .
Surely it 's reasonable for men to be indulged on one day of the year , given the number of times they 're expected to produce bouquets of flowers on spec and surprise their woman with perfume or pearls ?
But the idea of a woman spoiling a man did n't sit easily with people .
In 1978 , the National Confectionery Industry Association came up with an idea to solve this anomaly .
They started to market white chocolate that men could give to women on 14 March , as compensation for the male - oriented Valentine 's Day .
It started with a handful of sweetmakers churning out candy as a simple gift idea .
The day captured the public imagination , and is now a fully - fledged , nationally recognised date in the diary - and one where men are obliged to whip out their credit cards .
In fact , men are now expected to give gifts worth triple the value of those they received .
What a complication : not only do men have to remember who bought them what , they have to estimate the value and multiply it by three .
The temptation for women in Japan must be to buy every man they know some cheap chocolates on Valentine 's Day as an investment .
A month later , they could happily sit back as their 300 % return of flowers , lingerie , jewellery came flooding in .
More seriously , the fact that a cynical commercial event to ' even things out ' is now a well - established day on the calendar is symptomatic of the inescapable fact that men are simply expected to give more , financially speaking .
Not just in these two east Asian cultures , but all around the world .
For example , the website TopTable looked at British dinner daters and found that 85 % of men would sneakily pick up the bill when their date was n't looking , even if the evening had n't gone well .
Just one third of the women said they would offer to go dutch .
A similar Europe - wide study by SABMiller found that 81 % of men expect to pay for all the drinks on a first date .
It does n't seem to be just a wooing factor : men also fork out more in established relationships .
The price comparison website MoneySupermarket worked out that this Valentine 's Day , the average man spent £ 48 on his lucky lover , compared to the £ 22 spent by women .
Then there 's the convenient tradition ( also started by a company in a bid to boost sales ) that the woman receives two to three months ' salary worth of diamonds when her beloved proposes .
This idea lives on , yet the convention of the bride 's family paying for the wedding is gradually dying out .
I hate to support the opposition , so to speak , but it does seems that men are getting a bit of a rough deal at this stage of our transition to a modern , gender - equal world .
The word on the dating scene suggests it 's a significantly more expensive game for the blokes .
" I 'd always offer to pay my way , but I 'd actually think it a bit lame if the man did n't get the first meal , " says a single 32 - year - old advertising executive , who did n't want to give her name for fear of not getting any more free dates .
" I would n't feel obliged , " says Martin Hansford , a 40 - year - old telecoms consultant .
" But I probably just would pay .
Unless she 's one of those girls who insist , and almost argues , that she pays half . "
What about married couples ?
Alexandra Todd - Nelson , a 38 - year - old sales director , agrees that men do tend to buy more material gifts over the course of a relationship .
" But " , she says , " once we go through labour , that says it all , we 're worth every penny . "
Does she have a point ?
Some argue that women , being the childbearers , by default put more into a relationship emotionally and physically .
I 'm not sure that this requires men to forever try to compensate women .
But it was certainly a savvy move by the Japanese confectionery firms .
They put chocolate sales through the roof simply by spotting the one occasion when women bought something for their man and got nothing back in return .

“ Mexican authorities have suspended their search for a Florida woman who went missing during a Christmas week cruise and whose family said they fear she took her own life .
The U.S. Coast Guard on Monday suspended its search for a Jennifer Ellis Seitz , 36 , who officials say fell from balcony of the cruise ship Norwegian Pearl off the coast of Cancun , Mexico .
Mexican authorities said they would continue their search for another 48 hours , but announced Tuesday morning they had suspended their efforts .
Seitz was on a first wedding anniversary cruise aboard the Norwegian Pearl with her husband , Raymond , and her mother , Donna Ellis , when her family reported her missing Friday , according to a statement released Monday afternoon by her family .
“ The family suspects that Jennifer chose an unfortunate ending to her life .
She was a beautiful and caring person and will be truly missed by all who love her , ” said the statement , released Monday in an e-mail by her brother , Christopher Ellis .
“ Jennifer , however , has had previous emotional issues , ” the statement said .
The statement said her husband and mother saw no signs of problems on the cruise .
“ Jennifer was in a very happy and uplifted mood both before and during the cruise .
She was excited about starting a new job and her future career with a local newspaper .
She and her husband had been talking about starting their family , ” the statement said .
Seitz had been talking with Winter Haven News Chief Managing Editor Joe Braddy about doing freelance work for that newspaper .
She had previously worked at the News Chief as a reporter .
She had also done freelance work for The Ledger and The Tampa Tribune and had worked as a reporter at Florida Today in Melbourne .
Authorities say a ship surveillance camera showed someone falling overboard at 8 p.m. Christmas night .
They are still investigating and have n’t said what they think happened .
Television station WFTV - Ch. 9 in Orlando reported the ship has about 1,000 cameras on board , so there may be more images to help authorities piece together what happened .
FBI spokesman Mike Leverock said agents met the ship as it arrived in Miami on Sunday and collected materials .
“ We are looking to see if a crime was committed with an American citizen on the high seas , ” Leverock said .
The family ’s statement said Seitz ’s husband and mother discovered her missing about 2 a.m. Friday .
They said it was common for her to walk around the ship when she was unable to sleep .
Raymond Seitz searched for his wife , the statement said , but could not locate her , so he and his mother - in - law notified ship security about 3:30 a.m. that she was missing .
The couple met in a weight - loss support group .
Both had undergone bariatric surgery .
She chronicled her weight loss journey for an Orlando TV station and for some time kept an online journal of her battle to lose weight and keep it off .
At one undated point in the journal , she said she was down to a size 10 from a size 28 .
At the Garden Grove Oaks , Seitz ’s neighbors in the well - kept mobile home park were hopeful she is alive .
Reporters were kept out of the neighborhood by two guards , but some people driving in and out of the park stopped to answer questions .
Neighbor Betty Kirckl said she and her husband Robert bowled with the Seitzes every Monday and did so on the Monday before the cruise began .
Kirckl said Jennifer Seitz was proud of her marriage and showed off her wedding pictures .
“ She was a wonderful , beautiful girl , ” Kirckl said .
She said Jennifer Seitz was “ real enthusiastic ” about going on the cruise .
Raymond Seitz was arrested on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge April 18 when a deputy was called to the mobile home belonging to her mother on Knotty Pine Drive Southeast , east of Winter Haven , where the three lived .
Raymond Seitz was accused of head - butting his wife , but not causing obvious injury .
The charge was dropped when he completed a diversionary program .
Jennifer Seitz did n’t want to press charges .
Jennifer Seitz had been married previously .
Ex-husband Michael Rich in Melbourne said they separated in mid-2006 after a year of marriage .
They divorced in February 2007 , and he said he has n’t had any contact with her since .
Rich said they had no children , but she had children from a previous marriage .
He would n’t say why they split up , but said “ she was very energetic and friendly to those she met . ”
Rich said she had been working for Florida Today and was freelancing when they were together .
He said he was n’t sure where she went when she left Melbourne .
Norwegian Cruise Line said the ship returned to Miami on Sunday after a seven - day western Caribbean cruise .
On land , several passengers said they were not aware Seitz was missing , though they recognized the couple because of their role in the game show , which was shown on the ship ’s closed - circuit television system .
Several passengers interviewed on the Today show after disembarking in Miami , said Seitz and her husband participated in the on - board mystery game show called “ The Not So Newlywed Game . ”
Suzanne Nestor said Seitz was “ very excitable ” and “ outgoing , ” and had spoken of plans to take a New Year ’s trip to Bridgeport , Conn. , and New York City .
Her husband , Jim Nestor , said he ran into Raymond Seitz the day after his wife was reported missing .
“ I had given him my condolences , and he had a plastic bag filled with quarters , and he said to me that he was going to the casino to see if he could change his luck , ” Nestor said .
Another cruise passenger , Carter Scurry , told Today that Seitz ’s husband appeared calm after his wife disappeared .
The cruise ship did not make a formal announcement .
“ It was eerie to me , ” Scurry said .
“ He was nonchalant . ”
The search took place just more than 17 miles east of Cancun over an area of more than 2,500 square miles , officials said .
Waters in the search area have been in the mid-70 degree range since Seitz went missing , Coast Guard officials said .
A Coast Guard crew from Clearwater joined Mexican search boats by Monday morning , but they suspended efforts Monday afternoon .
The Mexican search crew looking for Seitz reported rough waters Sunday .
While a Coast Guard Falcon aircraft based in Miami and a C - 130 aircraft based in Clearwater searched for Seitz over the weekend , only the Mexican crew searched overnight , said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Nick Ameen , a spokesman .
Seitz ’s disappearance marks the sixth time in 2008 that a cruise ship passenger went overboard in Caribbean waters , Ameen said .
Of those six cases , only once was the Coast Guard able to rescue a stranded person , Ameen said .
“ You ’re looking for a head in an ocean of water , ” Ameen said .
“ It ’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack . ”

UCLA geographers think they have a good idea where Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has been hiding .
Using standard geographical tools routinely employed to locate endangered species and fugitive criminals , the group said there is a high probability that Bin Laden has been hiding in one of three buildings in the northwestern Pakistani city of Parachinar , a longtime hide - out for mujahedin fighters .
“ He may be sitting there right now , ” said UCLA biogeographer Thomas W. Gillespie , who led the study published online Tuesday in the MIT International Review , an interdisciplinary journal of international affairs .
Gillespie said he and his students contacted the FBI ’s local field office -- walking distance from the Westwood campus -- before publishing their paper , but they have n’t heard back .

Laura Eimiller , a spokeswoman for the agency ’s Los Angeles bureau , said the information was forwarded to two people working on the case , but “ because it is an active investigation , it would not be appropriate ” to comment on the information ’s fate .
The study relies on two geographic principles used to predict the distribution of wildlife .
The first , known as distance - decay theory , holds that as an animal -- or person -- moves farther away from its preferred habitat , the probability of finding a compatible environment decreases exponentially .
The second principle , called island biogeographic theory , holds that the animal or person is most likely to move into the largest , closest area that can fulfill all its needs .
Gillespie and his students started with a satellite map centered on Bin Laden ’s last known location , in Tora Bora , in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border .
The group eliminated areas in Afghanistan because they were under the control of U.S. forces at the time of Bin Laden ’s disappearance .
Then the group evaluated the cities and towns in the remaining territory and calculated the likelihood that Bin Laden would have relocated to them .

They concluded that he must have trekked nearly 2 miles over mountainous terrain to the Pakistani tribal area of Kurram and settled in Parachinar , the largest city in the region , with a population of half a million .
The class zeroed in further by searching satellite images for buildings with walls at least 10 feet high ( for safety ) , at least three rooms ( to house Bin Laden ’s bodyguards ) and electricity ( to power his kidney dialysis machine ) , among other features .
The sleuths settled on two compounds that are thought to be residences , and a third , with crenelated towers on the corners , that may be a prison or an army officers club .
“ You develop a testable hypothesis that can be accepted or rejected just like in any other type of science , ” Gillespie said .
In this case , the testing would require checking the buildings to see who is there .
Getting that ground truth “ is the hardest part , ” he said .

Such geographic profiling techniques have been used to capture lesser criminals , including Raymond Lopez , who committed 139 burglaries in Orange County between 2003 and 2005 , said Kim Rossmo , director of the Center for Geospatial Intelligence and Investigation at Texas State University .
The approach might also help identify general regions where investigators should search for America ’s most - wanted terrorist , though not necessarily the specific buildings pinpointed in the study .
“ This is a paper that should be paid attention to by the military and intelligence agencies for some of the ideas , ” Rossmo said .
“ But it ’s not going to be a case of , ‘ X marks the spot , there ’s Osama bin Laden . ’ ”
One conclusion the group is fairly confident about is that Bin Laden is not living in a cave .
A cave would have to have a sealed entrance , be heated and ventilated , and have supplies trucked in regularly .
Those physical manifestations could be easily detected from space , they said .

You know , maybe it would n't be such a bad idea if General Motors did go out of business .
What has the destruction of the nation 's street car system cost the country ?
A trillion dollars ?
Ten trillion dollars ?
You'd have to add up all the oil consumed that did n't have to be , all the environmental diseases that did n't need to happen , and all the economic constraints on poor and low income people that did n't need to be .
Then there are the quality of life issues which are incalculable .
Go to super - prosperous cities like Basel and Zurich in Switzerland and you 'll see they excellent street car systems - just like we used to have in the US .
A British couple 's trip of a lifetime , sailing around the world on a yacht called Mr Bean , ended in horror after pirates allegedly killed the husband , tossed his body overboard and then tied his wife up in a cabin .
The attack occurred in the Malacca Strait , the body of water notorious for piracy , running between mainland South - East Asia and Indonesia .
Malcolm Robertson and his wife Linda on their Mr Bean adventure before pirates struck .
British reports say three Burmese men boarded the $ 632,000 boat , attacked 64 - year - old Malcolm Robertson with a hammer , and might have slit his throat before they threw his body into the sea on Monday .
His wife , Linda , was tied up but wriggled free and called for help after the pirates left the boat in a dinghy .
Defining new typeclasses is regarded as an important part of Haskell programming , as the normal way of introducing overloaded functions .
This message shows that if the ability to define typeclasses is removed , no expressivity is lost .
If Haskell had only one , pre-defined typeclass with only one method , we could still do normal Haskell programming with standard and user - defined overloaded numerical functions , monads , monad transformers , etc .
Haskell with only one typeclass can express all of Haskell98 typeclass programming idioms including constructor classes , plus multi- parameter type classes and some functional dependencies .
If we additionally admit TypeCast as a pre-defined constraint , the rest of functional dependencies are expressible .
Besides clarifying the role of typeclasses in Haskell as method bundles , this message proposes a model of overloading resolution that is simpler than that of Hall et al .
Perhaps this model might be of interest to Haskell ' committee .
The present approach is inspired by HList 's class Apply , which seems to be , after a small adjustment , the universal class .
For clarity of terminology , we call as Haskell1 the language Haskell98 with no typeclass declarations but with a single , already declared typeclass C ( which has two parameters related by a functional dependency ) .
The programmers may not declare any typeclasses ; but they may add instances to C and use them .
We show on a series of examples that despite the lack of typeclass declarations , Haskell1 can express all the typeclass code of Haskell98 and then multi- parameter type classes and some ( most useful ? ) functional dependencies .
Haskell98 methods are defined as ordinary functions in Haskell1 .
To represent the rest of functional dependencies , we later define Haskell1 ' as an extension of Haskell1 with a pre-defined constraint TypeCast ( which is not user - extensible and can be considered built - in ) .
Finally we introduce the analogue of Haskell98 classes -- method bundles -- and use them for defining bounded existentials .
Obviously Haskell1 is merely a subset of Haskell rather than a new language ; the removal of typeclass declarations is a matter of discipline rather than that of syntax .
We offer a model of overloading resolution that is a bit different from that of Stuckey and Sulzmann 's ` A theory of overloading . '
When an instance is selected , its dependent arguments are improved ( `typecast ' ) .
If an instance is not selected , no type improvement is applied .
Granted , this model is not formalized .
But then , this message is not an ICFP paper .
The complete code described in this message is available at http://pobox.com/~oleg/ftp/Haskell/Haskell1/Class1.hs
http://pobox.com/~oleg/ftp/Haskell/Haskell1/Class2.hs
We first disclose our one and only type class : > class C l t | l -> t where ac :: l -> t
The constraint C is pervasive , which makes some signatures in want of syntax sugar , which we purposely avoid for clarity .
We start by building overloaded numeric functions , the analogue of Num .
The following defines the functions `a la carte ' .
Later we shall see how to bundle them into what Haskell98 calls `classes ' .
We begin with addition , to be denoted ( +$ ) to avoid the confusion with the Prelude . > data
Add a > infixl 6 +$ > (+$ ) :: forall a. C ( Add a ) ( a->a->a ) => a -> a -> a > (+$ ) = ac ( __ : : Add a ) Whereas (+ ) in Haskell was a method , here the overloaded addition is a regular function , albeit bounded polymorphic .
As we shall see , the constraints of such functions are analogues of Haskell98 class constraints .
The above signature , sans the constraint , is the same as that of Prelude .(+ ) .
We will see later a way to avoid writing the C constraint explicitly .
Let 's define the instances of the generic addition for Ints and Floats > instance C ( Add Int ) ( Int -> Int -> Int ) where ac _ x y = x + y > instance C ( Add Float ) ( Float -> Float -> Float ) where ac _ x y = x + y as well over Dual numbers > data Dual a = Dual a a deriving Show > instance C ( Add a ) ( a->a->a ) =>C ( Add ( Dual a ) ) ( Dual a -> Dual a -> Dual a ) where > ac _ ( Dual x1 y1 ) ( Dual x2 y2 ) = Dual ( x1 +$ x2 ) ( y1 +$ y2 )
The latter is defined inductively , with the addition over base types being the base case .
> ta2 = let x = Dual ( 1:: Int ) 2 in x +$ x -- sample test Likewise , we define the overloaded multiplication .
This time , we use partial signatures to avoid writing the C constraint : > infixl 7 *$ > mul_sig :: a -> a -> a ; mul_sig = undefined > mul_as :: a ->
Mul a ; mul_as = undefined > x *$ y | False = mul_sig x y > x *$ y = ac ( mul_as x ) x y Functions frmInteger and shw are analogous .
As in Haskell98 , we use the available overloaded functions to define new generic functions .
For example , > genf x = x *$ x *$ ( frmInteger 2 ) > tm1 = genf ( Dual ( 1:: Float ) 2 ) +$ ( frmInteger 3 ) The complete code demonstrates the overloading of not only functions but also of plain values : minBound .
Next we turn to constructor classes and Monads , which can be easily restricted as frequently desired .
> data RET ( m :: * -> *) a > data BIND ( m :: * -> *) a b > ret :: forall m a. C ( RET m a ) ( a -> m a ) => a -> m a > ret = ac ( __:: RET m a ) > bind :: forall m a b. C ( BIND m a b ) ( m a->( a -> m b ) ->m b ) => > ( m a->( a -> m b ) ->m b ) > bind = ac ( __:: BIND m a b )
We show one particular monad : Either e > instance C ( RET ( Either e ) a ) ( a -> Either e a ) where ac _ = Right > instance C ( BIND ( Either e ) a b ) > ( Either e a -> ( a-> Either e b ) ->
Either e b ) where > ac _ ( Right x ) f = f x > ac _ ( Left x ) f = Left x with the goal to demonstrate MonadError , which is defined in Haskell 's monad transformer library as follows -- class Error a where -- strMsg :: String -> a -- class Monad m => MonadError e m | m -> e where -- throwError :: e -> m a -- catchError :: m a -> ( e -> m a ) -> m a In Haskell1 , the above code becomes > data ERROR a > strMsg :: forall a. C ( ERROR a ) ( String ->a ) => String -> a > strMsg = ac ( __:: ERROR a ) > instance C ( ERROR String ) ( String - > String ) where ac _ = id > data ThrowError ( m :: * -> *) a > throwError :: forall e m a b t1 t2 . > ( C ( ThrowError m a ) ( e -> m a ) , C ( RET m a ) t1 , C ( BIND m a b ) t2 ) => > e -> m a > throwError = ac ( __:: ThrowError m a )
Here the constraints C ( RET m a ) t1 and C ( BIND m a b ) t2 are not called for , but we specified them anyway .
That is , we require that `m ' be an instance of a Monad .
These extra constraints are Haskell1 analogue of Haskell 's `class constraints ' .
The definition of catchError is similar .
The Either e monad is an instance of MonadError > instance C ( ThrowError ( Either e ) a ) ( e -> Either e a ) where ac _ = Left > instance C ( CatchError ( Either e ) a ) > ( Either e a -> ( e -> Either e a ) ->
Either e a ) where > ac _ ( Left x ) f = f x ; ac _ x _ = x so we can write a test > te1 x = runEither $ catchError ac ( \e -> ret e ) > where > ac = ( if x then throw Error " er " else ret ( 2:: Int ) ) `bind` > ( \x -> ret ( x *$ x ) ) `bind` ( ret.shw ) > runEither :: Either a b ->
Either a b ; runEither = id > te1r = ( te1 True , te1 False ) The MonadError example demonstrated that we already have some functional dependencies .
To get them in full , we extend Haskell1 with the ``pre - defined '' constraint TypeCast .
For example , to express the following Haskell method of two arguments with the type of the first argument determining the types of the result and of the second argument -- class FC3 a b c | a -> b c where fc3 :: a -> b -> c -- instance FC3 Bool Char
Int we write in Haskell1 ' > data FC3 a b c > fc3 :: forall a b c. C ( FC3 a b c ) ( a->b->c ) => a->b->c > fc3 = ac ( __:: FC3 a b c ) > instance TypeCast ( FC3 Bool b c ) ( FC3 Bool Char Int ) > => C ( FC3 Bool b c ) ( Bool - > Char -> Int ) where ac _ x y = 1 > tfc3 = fc3 True ' a ' > tfc31 = fc3
True undefined
The latter two sample definitions are accepted as they are .
Without the functional dependencies , however , we would have needed type annotations .
The accompanying complete code has the expanded example .
Finally , we introduce the analogue of Haskell98 `classes ' -- bundles of methods -- whose compelling application is bounded existentials .
Let 's define the Num bundle and numeric functions that are truly NUM - overloaded > data NUM a = NUM {nm_add , nm_mul :: a->a->a , > nm_fromInteger :: Integer ->a , nm_show :: a-> String} > data CLS a > instance ( C ( Add a ) ( a->a->a ) , C ( Mul a ) ( a->a->a ) , > C ( FromInteger a ) ( Integer - >a ) , > C ( SHOW a ) ( a-> String ) ) > => C ( CLS ( NUM a ) ) ( NUM a ) where ac _ = NUM ( +$ ) ( *$ ) frmInteger shw We re-visit the overloaded addition , multiplication , show and fromInteger functions , defining them now in terms of the just introduced `class ' NUM .
We should point out the uniformity of the declarations below , ripe for syntactic sugar .
For example , one may introduce NUM a => ... to mean C ( CLS ( NUM a ) ) ( NUM a ) => ... > infixl 6 +$ $ ; infixl 7 *$$ > ( + $ $ ) :: forall a. C ( CLS ( NUM a ) ) ( NUM a ) => a -> a -> a > ( + $ $ ) x y = nm_add ( ac ( __ : : CLS ( NUM a ) ) ) x y and similarly for the other operations .
We are in a position to define a bounded existential , whose quantified type variable ' a ' is restricted to members of NUM .
The latter lets us use the overloaded numerical functions after opening the existential envelope .
> data PACK = forall a. C ( CLS ( NUM a ) ) ( NUM a ) => PACK a > t1d = let x = PACK ( Dual ( 1.0 : : Float ) 2 ) in > case x of PACK y -> nshw ( y * $$ y + $$ y + $$ ( nfromI 2 ) ) _______________________________________________

A new dating method finally is allowing archaeologists to incorporate rock paintings — some of the most mysterious and personalized remnants of ancient cultures — into the tapestry of evidence used to study life in prehistoric times .
That ’s the conclusion of a new report in ACS ’ Analytical Chemistry .
In the study , Marvin W. Rowe points out that rock paintings , or pictographs , are among the most difficult archaeological artifacts to date .
They lack the high levels of organic material needed to assess a pictograph’s age using radiocarbon dating , the standard archaeological technique for more than a half - century .
Rowe describes a new , highly sensitive dating method , called accelerator mass spectrometry , that requires only 0.05 milligrams of carbon ( the weight of 50 specks of dust ) .
That 's much less than the several grams of carbon needed with radiocarbon dating .
The research included analyzing pictographs from numerous countries over a span of 15 years .
It validates the method and allows rock painting to join bones , pottery and other artifacts that tell secrets of ancient societies , Rowe said .
“ Because of the prior lack of methods for dating rock art , archaeologists had almost completely ignored it before the 1990s , ” he explained .
“ But with the ability to obtain reliable radiocarbon dates on pictographs , archaeologists have now begun to incorporate rock art into a broader study that includes other cultural remains . ”

If you want to escape the Internet , taking flight will no longer be an excuse .
Internet access has arrived on dozens of planes flying domestic US routes , with hundreds of aircraft across seven airlines expected to be online by the third quarter of 2009 .
Early reviews indicate that at least two competing in - flight Internet services work consistently and offer reasonable speeds .
In this article , we 'll take an in - depth look into why WiFi up high failed once , and we 'll examine the technology behind its recent rebirth .
We 'll also look at the cost of using the Internet at 35,000 feet , which airlines have made which choices , and what the future brings for entertainment and coverage .
Prologue : missed Connexions
Boeing pioneered mile - high WiFi with Connexion by Boeing , a service the firm started planning in the late 1990s that was poised to launch with a number of US carriers before 9/11 kicked the legs out from underneath the airline industry .
American , Delta , and United had all planned to launch the service , but withdrew from their commitment .
Connexion 's Irvine , Calif. , operations center in headier times .
Although Connexion eventually got up in the air in 2004 , with a new focus on mostly over - water and long - haul routes , the weight , installation time and cost , and apparently low revenue could n't justify the service 's continued operation , especially after major management turmoil at Boeing .
In Dec. 2006 , with Lufthansa as its biggest partner with dozens of equipped planes , Connexion shut down .
While Connexion 's service worked quite well by all reports , its cost structure was out of control .
Installation , at one point , took weeks ( later shortened to days ) ; the dead weight and drag of gear was estimated by some experts at about 800 pounds ; and estimates varied from $ 500,000 to $ 1,000,000 for the full cost of equipment and installation .
At the same time that Connexion was taxiing to the gate , however , two firms were planning similar offerings that would use smaller antennas to reduce drag , lighter and cheaper gear in planes to reduce fuel costs , and a quicker installation process to roll planes out faster , while also taking advantage of the vast increase in the number of WiFi - toting passengers .
Since September 2008 , several airlines have been slowly installing in - flight Internet service from these two companies .
American was the first with a 15 - plane trial , followed by fleet - wide commitments that began with planes operated by Virgin America in November , and then Delta in December .
Alaska and Southwest launched long - delayed trials in February .
United will run a small trial later in 2009 , and Air Canada plans service for the U.S. portions of some of its routes .
JetBlue has one aircraft wired using a previous - generation technology , but apparently has plans to change this in the future .
So what happened to change the cost / benefit equation for in - flight Internet ?
Airlines are desperate for ways to retain customers , while filling planes fuller and charging more for seats .
Continuous Internet access might be both a competitive tool to capture passengers from other airlines , as well as a way to convince people to fly rather than stay home or take other transportation .
So the coming wave of in - flight Internet is predicated on the premise that productivity and entertainment will be strong selling points .
Also , and just as important , every business traveler and an increasing number of consumers are carrying WiFi- enabled devices : BlackBerrys , laptops , iPhones , Nintendo DSs — the list goes on .
They 're just waiting to unwire .
The basics of broadband at 35,000 feet
Unlike many subjects that involve telecommunications , providing Internet service to a plane in - flight is relatively straightforward .
You need an antenna on top of the plane for satellite services , or under the fuselage for ground - to - air offerings .
Onboard , WiFi access points provide the LAN .
A gateway page sometimes provides portal information from a provider like Yahoo ! , and it asks for either a purchase or the entry of credentials to use the network for paid rollouts .
A rack of gateway gear handles the WAN and LAN communication , and provide administrative tools to allow the flight crew to cut access .
( This last option may seem extreme , but pilots are both allowed and required to take any necessary action in air to ensure safety , for whatever reason they determine . )
On the regulatory side , by the way , radio equipment installed on planes needs to be tested by the FAA or other local aviation regulatory agencies for airworthiness ; the new gear , when installed , ca n't interfere with on - board electronics or avionics .
Planes are certified by model , such as an Airbus A319 or Boeing 767-200 .
( Interference means , in this case , that typically spurious signals sent outside of assigned bands do n't cause avionics to produce unexpected results .
This likely occurs only with older planes using avionics that are n't as heavily shielded as newer systems . )
Three in - flight ISPs currently have planes flying with their hardware in them : Aircell and Row 44 in the US , and OnAir in Europe and the Middle East .
Fortunately for all those who prefer their flights as quiet as possible , no US airline allows voice over IP calling , voice chats , video chats , or any variant thereof .
Aircell blocks well - known ports , and uses traffic shaping and other techniques to spot workarounds and block new methods as they 're discovered .
The FCC asked for opinions about this a few years ago , leaving a comment period open for years .
Thousands of commenters begged the agency not to allow any form of in - air calling .
The FAA and FCC do n't regulate what content people may view over an in - flight connection .
Aircell and Row 44 are neutral , but airlines are not .
After some initial back and forth between the flight attendant union and various airlines , American and Delta opted to have lightly filtered Internet service ; Virgin America has no filters whatsoever .
A VPN connection can bypass any filters , of course , and because this is a floating hotspot with no encryption against your data being sniffed , a VPN connection is a good idea in any case .
As some of you may know , my parents met in a religious cult .
I wo n’t get into which one , but they were out of it by the time I was in kindergarten .
Did it influence me and my brothers ?
Of course .
But it was less of an influence from the cult itself , and more of an influence from what my parents took away from it that still seemed worthwhile , even after the organization itself proved to be corrupt .
And what my parents took away from that religion was essentially affirmations of what they had brought with them to that faith .
They were and are both spiritual people , seeking spiritual answers .
They agree with things that feel right to them , and disagree with things that do not .
There ’s not a lot of facts and reasoning behind that , but that ’s really what spirituality is all about : listening to your gut about things that ca n’t be proven or disproven .
Part of their spiritual philosophy is that they do n’t tell other people what to believe , including their own kids ( i.e. , me ) .
The one exception to that is that they did encourage us to believe in our Self as something separate from our physical body–so , they encouraged us to believe that we are spiritual beings having a physical experience .
They were always willing to talk with us about possibilities –reincarnation , spiritualism , God / Goddess / divinity or the lack thereof– but it was always a conversation , never a lesson .
And though I ’ve gone through times where I wish I had a stronger spiritual practice and community , I am hugely and profoundly grateful for the independence I was given .
Whether by nature or nurture , I have also always been a spiritual seeker .
My book shelves are equally as full of books on spirituality , religion , mythology , and magic as they are full of stories , and I ’ve always been drawn to any kind of spiritual philosophy that implies humans have more power , more senses , more capabilities than we are currently aware of .
So it ’s no surprise that when I was in middle school I started reading about witchcraft and paganism , and by the time I was 12 I self - identified as a witch ( though I did not tell anyone else that for quite some time ) .
My self - identification as a witch has had its ups and downs over the years , mainly because of what other people have told me a witch is or is not .
Also , there ’s a bit of …I do n’t know … sensationalism attached to the word .
It felt ostentatious to call myself a witch–almost like I was asking for a confrontation or a misunderstanding .
So I called myself a witch in my head , where it felt right , but not out loud , to other people ( aside from my witchy best friend , who I met when I was 19 ) .
Now it ’s 2018 , and I ’ve been a self - identified witch for 21 years .
I feel comfortable saying this because , at the moment , being “ witchy ” is trendy as hell .
This is not surprising after the 2016 US “ election ” ( can we still even call it that ? ) –witchcraft is notoriously associated with people seizing power when they are feeling especially powerless ( especially women , especially the oppressed ) .
The most common witchcraft lore is concerned with death , healing , and harvest / prosperity , three things that can feel wildly out of our control .
But the power of witchcraft is not the same as the powers that oppress us , nor is it the same as the natural chaos that touches each and every one of us at some point in our lives .
Witchcraft is subversive .
It does n’t operate by the laws of the patriarchal world .
It ’s not about using the same old tricks to claim the throne .
Hell , it ’s not about wanting the throne at all .
Witchcraft is about subtlety .
It ’s about intuition and intention .
It ’s about inner strength and guidance , communion with the natural world , loving and respecting your body , the bodies of others , the body of the Earth .
It is about magic , but what magic is to each of us is subjective .
For me , magic has never been about casting spells * or performing rituals .
I ’ve never believed it was essential to have the right physical objects present to make magic happen ( this is part of why I do not like my practice to be conflated with Wicca ) .
Magic has always been about paying attention to how my inner life resonates or dampens in relation to my outer life .
It ’s about tuning the radio dial of my mind to match up with my heart and soul .
When I do that , life is good .
Not easy , but good .
Magical things happen .
Yes , butterflies land outside my kitchen window , and I find $ 20 bills fluttering across parking lots , and people offer me free stuff , and most importantly I just start to feel connected to the world around me .
But also , I have more clarity .
And with clarity of mind comes inspiration , action , and opportunity .
Can I prove it ’s magic ?
No .
But I know that when I do n’t make the effort to tune into myself , when I let the outside world overly influence my inside world , the magic disappears .
Maybe it ’s all just brain chemistry and mind games .
Maybe it ’s something we cannot currently explain in scientific terms .
All I know is that life is good when I ’m witchy , and life is bad when I give my power away to circumstance .
I believe in magic .
My kind of magic .
A fluid , ever - evolving , deeply personal kind of witchery .
Runcible witchery .
At her lecture on poetry at the VCFA residency this past July , Louise Hawes introduced many of us to the work of Edward Lear , specifically his poem “ The Owl and the Pussycat , ” which contains the passage :
They dined on mince and slices of quince ,
which they ate with a runcible spoon
I could paraphrase the definition of “ runcible ” but why make extra work for myself ?
Here ’s Wikipedia :
“ Runcible ” is a nonsense word invented by Edward Lear .
The word appears ( as an adjective ) several times in his works , most famously as the “ runcible spoon ” used by the Owl and the Pussycat .
[ 1 ]
The word “ runcible ” was apparently one of Lear ’s favourite inventions , appearing in several of his works in reference to a number of different objects .
In his verse self - portrait , The Self - Portrait of the Laureate of Nonsense , it is noted that “ he weareth a runcible hat “ .
[ 2 ]
Other poems include mention of a “ runcible cat “ , [ 3 ] a “ runcible goose ” ( in the sense of “ silly person ” ) , [ 4 ] and a “ runcible wall “ . [ 4 ]
The point is , “ runcible ” does n’t mean anything .
Or , it means whatever you want it to mean .
That ’s how I feel about magic .
That ’s how I feel about witchcraft .
The thing is , I have been in a crisis of faith for the last several years .
For a while , I stopped believing in anything .
I thought too much about proof , about evidence , about science and facts , and it ruined me for magic and synchronicity and finding meaning in anything at all .
I was deeply , profoundly depressed , partly because I had lost something that had always been an essential , integral part of who I am .
It ’s chicken or the egg , which came first .
But I can tell you that once I began to emerge from my depression ( thanks to affordable mental health care ! ) , magic slowly started coming back to me .
Then I was at residency , thinking about runcible spoons , and the power of language , and the power of community and authenticity and following your heart … and someone I love and respect looked at me and , out of nowhere , with nothing but equal love and respect , told me : “ You ’re totally a witch .
I know it . ”
And I was like , fuck .
Yeah , I am .
I ca n’t believe I let myself forget that .
Since I ’ve returned home from graduation , I ’ve been on a mission of rest , but also of listening .
I ’m listening for that inner voice , or spirit , or anything that helps me reorient myself to my Self .
I jokingly told myself that August was a good month to rest since not just Mercury ( planet of communication ) was retrograde , but Mars as well ( planet of action ) .
Then I discovered the night Mercury went direct that Mercury retrogrades are excellent times for self - reflection , and Mars retrogrades are best utilized by resting and recuperating .
Did I know that on some unconscious level ?
Did astrology predict my month of rest and reflection ?
Or did I find the connection after the fact because that ’s what humans do ?
Honestly , it does n’t matter .
It was a little nudge of affirmation , a little “ you ’re on the right track , sweetheart , keep going . ”
And like most people I ’m pleased with any affirmation I can get , especially when it comes to making a choice to do something that goes against my practical , semi-perfectionist brain .
But especially as a witch , these little synchronicities feel like signs from some higher order .
So anyway , after 21 years of cautiously self identifying as a witch , I ’ve finally found the name of my kind of witchcraft : Runcible Witchery .
It ’s whatever I want it to be , and I do n’t have to explain it to anyone .
Just as a good spiritual practice should be .
Anyway , I have a lot more to say about all of this … but I think that ’s enough for one post .
* for the record , I do believe in the power of spells .
I have done some good ones .
I have even been hexed and it was shitty and I still do n’t forgive that person .
FOR America 's colleges , January is a month of reckoning .
Most applications for the next academic year beginning in the autumn have to be made by the end of December , so a university 's popularity is put to an objective standard : how many people want to attend .
One of the more unlikely offices to have been flooded with mail is that of the City University of New York ( CUNY ) , a public college that lacks , among other things , a famous sports team , bucolic campuses and raucous parties ( it does n't even have dorms ) , and , until recently , academic credibility .
A primary draw at CUNY is a programme for particularly clever students , launched in 2001 .
Some 1,100 of the 60,000 students at CUNY 's five top schools receive a rare thing in the costly world of American colleges : free education .
Those accepted by CUNY 's honours programme pay no tuition fees ; instead they receive a stipend of $ 7,500 ( to help with general expenses ) and a laptop computer .
Applications for early admissions into next year 's programme are up 70 % .
Admission has nothing to do with being an athlete , or a child of an alumnus , or having an influential sponsor , or being a member of a particularly aggrieved ethnic group — criteria that are increasingly important at America 's elite colleges .
Most of the students who apply to the honours programme come from relatively poor families , many of them immigrant ones .
All that CUNY demands is that these students be diligent and clever .
Last year , the average standardised test score of this group was in the top 7 % in the country .
Among the rest of CUNY 's students averages are lower , but they are now just breaking into the top third ( compared with the bottom third in 1997 ) .
CUNY does not appear alongside Harvard and Stanford on lists of America 's top colleges , but its recent transformation offers a neat parable of meritocracy revisited .
Until the 1960s , a good case could be made that the best deal in American tertiary education was to be found not in Cambridge or Palo Alto , but in Harlem , at a small public school called City College , the core of CUNY .
America 's first free municipal university , founded in 1847 , offered its services to everyone bright enough to meet its gruelling standards .
City 's golden era came in the last century , when America 's best known colleges restricted the number of Jewish students they would admit at exactly the time when New York was teeming with the bright children of poor Jewish immigrants .
In 1933 - 54 City produced nine future Nobel laureates , including the 2005 winner for economics , Robert Aumann ( who graduated in 1950 ) ; Hunter , its affiliated former women 's college , produced two , and a sister branch in Brooklyn produced one .
City educated Felix Frankfurter , a pivotal figure on the Supreme Court ( class of 1902 ) , Ira Gershwin ( 1918 ) , Jonas Salk , the inventor of the polio vaccine ( 1934 ) and Robert Kahn , an architect of the internet ( 1960 ) .
A left - wing place in the 1930s and 1940s , City spawned many of the neo-conservative intellectuals who would later swing to the right , such as Irving Kristol ( class of 1940 , extra - curricular activity : anti-war club ) , Daniel Bell and Nathan Glazer .
What went wrong ?
Put simply , City dropped its standards .
It was partly to do with demography , partly to do with earnest muddleheadedness .
In the 1960s , universities across the country faced intense pressure to admit more minority students .
Although City was open to all races , only a small number of black and Hispanic students passed the strict tests ( including a future secretary of state , Colin Powell ) .
That , critics decided , could not be squared with City 's mission to “ serve all the citizens of New York ” .
At first the standards were tweaked , but this was not enough , and in 1969 massive student protests shut down City 's campus for two weeks .
Faced with upheaval , City scrapped its admissions standards altogether .
By 1970 , almost any student who graduated from New York 's high schools could attend .
The quality of education collapsed .
At first , with no barrier to entry , enrolment climbed , but in 1976 the city of New York , which was then in effect bankrupt , forced CUNY to impose tuition fees .
An era of free education was over , and a university which had once served such a distinct purpose joined the muddle of America 's lower - end education .
By 1997 , seven out of ten first - year students in the CUNY system were failing at least one remedial test in reading , writing or maths ( meaning that they had not learnt it to high - school standard ) .
A report commissioned by the city in 1999 concluded that “ Central to CUNY 's historic mission is a commitment to provide broad access , but its students ' high drop - out rates and low graduation rates raise the question : ‘ Access to what ? ' ”
Using the report as ammunition , profound reforms were pushed through by New York 's then mayor , Rudolph Giuliani , and another alumnus , Herman Badillo ( 1951 ) , America 's first Puerto Rican congressman .
A new head of CUNY was appointed .
Matthew Goldstein , a mathematician ( 1963 ) , has shifted the focus back towards higher standards amid considerable controversy .
For instance , by 2001 , all of CUNY 's 11 “ senior ” colleges ( ie , ones that offer full four - year courses ) had stopped offering remedial education .
This prompted howls from the teaching faculty , who said it would “ create a ghetto - like separation between levels of colleges ” , keeping black and Hispanic students out of the best schools .
In fact , the racial composition of the senior schools , monitored obsessively by critics , has remained largely unchanged : one in four students at the senior colleges is black , one in five is Latino .
A third have ties to Puerto Rico , Jamaica , China and the Dominican Republic .
Admissions standards have been raised .
Students applying to CUNY 's senior colleges now need respectable scores on either a national , state or CUNY test , and the admissions criteria for the honours programme are the toughest in the university 's history .
Contrary to what Mr Goldstein 's critics predicted , higher standards have attracted more students , not fewer : this year , enrolment at CUNY is at a record high .
There are also anecdotal signs that CUNY is once again picking up bright locals , especially in science .
One advanced biology class at City now has twice as many students as it did in the late 1990s .
Last year , two students , both born in the Soviet Union , won Rhodes scholarships , and a Bronx native who won the much sought - after Intel Science Prize is now in the honours programme .
All this should not imply that CUNY is out of the woods .
Much of it looks run down .
CUNY 's annual budget of $ 1.7 billion has stayed largely unchanged , even as student numbers have risen .
With New York City 's finances still precarious , city and state support for the university has fallen by more than one - third since 1991 in real terms .
It has , however , begun to bring in private money .
A new journalism school will open in the autumn , helped by a $ 4 m grant from the Sulzberger family , who control the New York Times , and led by Business Week 's former editor , Steve Shepard ( class of 1961 ) .
Efforts to raise a $ 1.2 billion endowment have passed the half - way mark , helped by ( formerly estranged ) alumni .
Intel 's former chairman , Andrew Grove , who graduated from City in 1960 as a penniless Hungarian immigrant , donated $ 26 m ( about 30 % of City 's operating budget ) to the engineering school , calling his alma mater “ a veritable American dream machine ” .
There are broader lessons to draw from CUNY , especially to do with creating opportunities in higher education for the poor .
Currently , only 3 % of the students in America 's top colleges come from families in the lowest income quartile and only 10 % from the bottom half , according to a study by Anthony Carnevale and Stephen Rose for the Century Foundation .
Most students are relatively well - off , and their numbers include plenty of racial minorities who receive preferential status independent of their economic circumstances .
For all its imperfections , CUNY 's model of low tuition fees and high standards offers a different approach .
And its recent history may help to dispel the myth that high academic standards deter students and donors .
“ Elitism ” , Mr Goldstein contends , “ is not a dirty word . ”
