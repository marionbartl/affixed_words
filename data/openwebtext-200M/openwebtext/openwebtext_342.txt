Thanks for raising an extremely important topic , one that I think we should all be examining closely and discussing in depth , especially with those who are starting from different positions , and even if we 're afraid we may have to - in the end - agree to disagree .
The author you quote suggests that the United States faces a threat that began with the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis .
That may or may not be so .
It does have a certain logic to it .
But it 's useful , I think , to understand what that hostage crisis was .
Understanding it does not require for one instant even contemplating condoning the taking of hostages .
When two children argue , it is not uncommon to ask " Jimmy , why did you hit Johnny " and " Johnny , why did you grab Jimmy 's toy " and so forth .
The point is not to condone the hitting or the grabbing but to try to get Jimmy and Johnny to talk to and understand each other , so that they do n't fight anymore .
With that in mind , I would offer this brief section of a recent column by R.K. Ramazani , who is a professor at the University of Virginia here in Charlottesville :
" Iran took the initiative to establish diplomatic relations with the United States in 1883 for two reasons .
First , by involving the United States in Iran 's affairs , Iranian officials sought to create a counterbalance to a century of British and Russian economic exploitation and political domination .
Second , by attracting American know - how , they believed they could modernize their backward economy .
" Enlightened Iranians , however , aspired to more than economic modernization .
They tried to create a democratic and representative government by constitutional means .
As a result , Iran ’s Constitutional Revolution of 1905 - 1911 aimed at limiting the tyranny of the monarch and ending British and Russian domination .
To these ends , in 1906 they established for the first time in their history a parliament , or Majlis , which continues to the present time .
" Given Iran - U.S. amicable relations , the parliament hired the American , Morgan Shuster , to modernize Iran ’s finances .
His reform efforts ran up against British and Russian imperial interests
The Russians bombarded the parliament building and , in collusion with the British , forced Shuster out of Iran .
As a result , Iran ’s first democratic and American supported experiment with democracy failed to materialize by 1911 .
" The United States returned the shah to the throne , and American economic , political , military and cultural domination ensued over the following quarter century until the Islamic revolution in 1979 .
Besides ending the shah ’s regime , the revolutionary forces aimed at terminating American domination .
" After the shah fled to America , the militant students took over the American embassy and held 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days .
The students claimed that they acted out of fear that the United States might try again to return the shah to the throne in 1979 as it had done in 1953 .
" Just as the American destruction of the Musaddiq government had burned deeply into the Iranian psyche , the Iranian taking of American diplomats hostage humiliated the American public .
These two events in combination have cast a long shadow over U.S. - Iran relations to date . "
Now , I know that neither you nor the person you quoted has an interest in installing a dictator in Iran or in stealing Iran 's oil , or in anything other than peace and cooperation .
And I know that most Americans had those same interests in 1979 .
But it 's useful to be aware of what the Iranians were afraid of .
They had elected a democratic leader in the 50s who had tried to keep Iran 's oil wealth for Iran , and our CIA had overthrown him and placed a US - puppet dictator in power .
Imagine what the Americans feared in 1812 .
They did n't want a British king placed back in charge .
They did n't want to lose their democracy .
Now , Iran today does not have a democracy , but it has more of one than , say , Saudi Arabia , which does play well with U.S. oil companies .
And if one thing could rally Iranians around an anti-democratic leader it would be an attack from a foreign power like the United States .
All of the incidents that Chong lists as constituting a single coherent threat to the United States over the past quarter century are equally complex and diverse .
His focus , of course , is on the later events in his list , the attacks by al Qaeda .
In point # 2 he asks why we were attacked , and offers one answer for the whole list of incidents : " envy of our position , our success , and our freedoms . "
Now , in terms of freedoms , by almost any measure there are other nations where citizens enjoy more freedom than we do .
In particular there are several European nations where people enjoy greater civil liberties , more wealth , better health , longer lifespans , shorter working hours , etc. , everything that is typically termed " success . "
But " position " may be headed in the right direction .
In fact , there is little mystery as to why most of the attacks listed occurred , since the attackers have tended to spell it out quite clearly .
In fact , al Qaeda has explained why they attacked on September 11th .
They could be lying or deceiving themselves , but it 's unlikely they would lie when the whole point of terrorism is to pressure those terrorized to change what they are doing .
Al Qaeda 's big concern was the presence of US military bases in Saudi Arabia .
Now , most Americans do n't know this , but we have over 1,000 foreign military bases spread through most of the countries on earth , and most of those countries resent them .
Chong says the United States made no provocative action , and yet clearly al Qaeda was provoked .
The step that THEY took was mass - murder , for which there can not possibly be any excuse .
But to refuse to even ask where it came from is as unhelpful as refusing to ask Jimmy why he hit Johnny .

ATLANTA  A nationwide study has found that the uninsured and those covered by Medicaid are more likely than those with private insurance to receive a diagnosis of cancer in late stages , often diminishing their chances of survival .
The study by researchers with the American Cancer Society also found that blacks had a higher risk of late diagnosis , even after accounting for their disproportionately high rates of being uninsured and underinsured .
The study ’s authors speculated that the disparity might be caused by a lack of health literacy and an inadequate supply of providers in minority communities .
The study is to be published online Monday in The Lancet Oncology .
Previous studies have shown a correlation between insurance status and the stage of diagnosis for particular cancers .
The new research is the first to examine a dozen major cancer types and to do so nationally with the most current data .
It mined the National Cancer Data Base , which began collecting information about insurance in the late 1990s , to analyze 3.7 million patients who received diagnoses from 1998 to 2004 .
The widest disparities were noted in cancers that could be detected early through standard screening or assessment of symptoms , like breast cancer , lung cancer , colon cancer and melanoma .
For each , uninsured patients were two to three times more likely to be diagnosed in Stage III or Stage IV rather than Stage I . Smaller disparities were found for non-Hodgkins lymphoma and cancers of the bladder , kidney , prostate , thyroid , uterus , ovary and pancreas .

Retro and vintage designs are often considered as being outdated , looking old , unattractive and dull .
That ’s not true .
Although compared to modern design , retro is mostly a completely different realm , it has a large variety of benefits modern graphic designers often tend to overlook .
And that ’s a pity .
Because we , as designers , can learn a lot from it .

Although compared to modern design , retro is mostly a completely different realm , it has a large variety of benefits modern graphic designers often tend to overlook .
And that ’s a pity .
Because we , as designers , can learn a lot from it .
Nostalgic designs arise feelings , awake memories and better manage to involve broad range of readers even although they do n’t really realize it .
Furthermore , retro can look cool and offer readers or visitors something they have n’t expected at all .
So why not try to impress them with some impressive vintage art for a change ?

OK , now it ’s time for a coffee break .
Should gadgets be simpler ?
Today ’s gizmos come loaded with features , most of which will never get used .
Take Canon ’s G9 , which Gadget Lab reviewed in September 2007 :
Sheer breadth of modes , features and options is almost too staggering for a normal person to learn in a reasonable amount of time .
It ’s easy to see why manufacturers pack more and more functions into their products : the check list on the back of the box has to have at least as many points as others on the same shelf .
But this obsession hurts ease of operation and generally makes the tool less useful .
In short , for the consumer , simple is often better .
There are examples of pared down gadgets .
Currently , the Flip Video camera is causing a storm amongst bloggers .
The Flip is a solid state camcorder with the most minimal feature set possible : A fixed focus lens , flash memory , a small screen and a sprinkling of buttons to record and playback footage .
It has a built in USB plug and runs on AA batteries .
No hi-definition , no optical zoom , no face detection .
And people are going crazy for it .
The tiny case , not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes , can be kept in a back pocket , ready to go .
This simplicity makes capturing video fun again .
Instead of playing with the settings , you just forget about how you use it and just use it .
David Pogue of the New York Times has this to say :
That ’s how it is with devices like the Flip .
They ’re so simple , mastery is immediate , and so is your sense of pride and happiness .
Apple has a good idea of what makes a simple product .
The original iPod did one thing , and it did it in a way that could be learned instantly .
Apple realized that you did n’t need to pack complicated file management software into a music player , and offloaded the heavy lifting to iTunes , a fully fledged computer application .
We all know what happened next .
Even so , Apple is affected by the need to constantly add new features in order to sell newer , better models .
The iPod Touch is a feature packed handheld computer .
It does , though , only have one button .
Often , the simplest tools can be the most flexible .
A good chefs knife will do anything that a modern food processor can do , and could probably replace 90 % of the uni-tasking gadgets in your kitchen .
And the humble Bic Biro is still used by millions every day .
We do n’t have to think about setting fonts , changing batteries or customizing its home screen .
The tool disappears into its function .
So why are n’t there more simple gadgets for us to buy ?
Because we are bovine idiots who graze on the latest marketing claims .
More megapixels , “ time - saving ” pizza - scissors , we ’ll buy anything that promises to make our lives easier , even if it really makes everything take twice as long .
There ’s hope .
The Flip proves that there is a demand for the cheap and cheerful :
It has a whopping 13 % of the camcorder market after just one year .
KISS .
I do n't like buying new .
It 's not that I consider myself to be some kind of Scrooge .
I just have a hard time paying more for something than I need to , and often we take that extra hit when we pay for a brand new item .
So , I buy second - hand things a lot of the time .
Here 's my guide to the main items you should always consider buying used .
DVDs and CDs
Why bother paying $ 21.99 for a new DVD or $ 14.99 for a new CD , when you can pick up a barely used copy of the same title for at least half the price ?
The improvements in modern DVD and CD players also mean that scratches and smudges do n’t really matter - the technology can deal with them .
It ’s the only way to get your home entertainment , and even places like Amazon offer avenues to get the titles used .
No more excuses , stop buying new DVDs and CDs .
Video games
This is just like DVDs and CDs , only the deals often come quicker and with greater discounts .
I recently picked up a used copy of an Xbox game for $ 1.99 that was still selling for $ 19.99 in the store .
It played perfectly , it still had the manual , and for an extra $ 1 I got insurance so if the disc did malfunction I could get a replacement or refund .
Sweet !
On some occasions , a store like Target will knock 75 % - 90 % off a game .
In that case , it ’s even cheaper new than it is in the used section of a store like GameStop , so in that case I ’ll pick it up .
However , those times are few and far between .
Cars
Car experts and sites like Edmunds and KBB will tell you that brand new cars lose around 12 % - 15 % of their value the second you drive them off the lot .
That ’s thousands of dollars up in smoke for your average mid-sized sedan .
Why should you take that financial loss ?
Instead , buy a car that ’s a year or two old .
It will usually have low mileage , a good chunk of the factory warranty left on it , and the depreciation is n’t anywhere near as bad for you .
That ’s smart spending .
Yard toys
I encourage my kids to play in the garden , and there are toys and games for them out there .
But why buy new one when they ’ll get scuffed up and worn out in days ?
Once again , places like Craigslist and Freecycle are a good place to find some excellent yard toys for the kids .
The slide in our back yard was free and has so far lasted 3 years .
It still looks as good as the day we got it ( very good in fact ) , from someone who had previously had it for 5 years .
They ’re built to withstand all weather and all kids … they are tough .
Workout / exercise equipment
This is an area where you can monopolize on impulse buying and laziness .
People will buy a big treadmill , a health rider , an exercise bike or a weight bench in the hopes of getting super fit and ultra trim .
The problem is , it takes hard work and dedication .
And most of the time , it ’s easier to let the new purchase rot in the basement or garage after a few weeks of use .
That ’s when the garage sale comes around , and you can go pick up an almost brand new piece of equipment at a fraction of the price you ’d normally pay .
Many people offer them free if you ’ll just haul it away and stop them feeling guilty about their over - optimistic purchase .
Most furniture
Have you ever seen the Antiques Road show ?
Desks , chairs , shelves , bed frames , sofas , tables , they last a long time .
Well , they do if they ’re built well anyway .
I scour Craigslist when I ’m looking for furniture .
You can often find a solid oak desk with great craftsmanship a lot cheaper than you can get one of those nasty MDF things that you put together yourself .
Sure , you ’ll need a way to get it home .
If you do n’t have a big truck , just rent one from UHaul for a few hours for $ 20 .
You ’ll end up with a great piece of furniture you can hand down to your grandchildren , rather than something that ends up in the garbage after 2 years .
Sports gear
Footballs , tennis rackets , bicycles , soccer balls , badminton nets , you name it , you can find it all used .
They ’re usually in excellent shape and a whole lot cheaper than store prices .
Houses
There ’s a huge caveat on this one ; make sure it ’s been checked out by an inspector and has the green light .
You do n’t want to take on major plumbing problems , damp basements or termites .
But , if the house is sound , the current economy makes a used home very , very desirable .
Sometimes it ’s just a few years old ; there are homes in my area that have decreased in value by $ 70 k in just a few years .
Ouch .
But not for you .
Of course , the used home sales market is also affecting new home sales .
If you insist on buying new , make sure you battle hard with the realtor and look for inventory houses .
They just want them sold , you can often negotiate serious discounts and tons of free upgrades .
Plants
I do not have green fingers .
No - one in my family does .
So , I like to let someone else do the hard work of establishing a plant and giving it healthy roots .
Then I ’ll pick one up cheap at a garage sale or off Craigslist .
Artwork / ornaments / mirrors
Stores like Goodwill are perfect hiding places for gems like these .
There was a story recently about a woman who found an old painting in Gooodwill , got it valued and it was worth over $ 1 million .
That ’s not the point though , most of the time you can pick up beautiful framed works of art , often original , and much cheaper than in stores like J C Penney or Kohl’s .
The same goes for figurines , mirrors and other home embellishments .
Buy them used , no - one will even know .
And FYI , things I would NEVER buy used ...
Infant / booster seats – they could have been in a crash and weakened .
Do n’t do it .
Shoes / sneakers –
Once they have conformed to a foot , they ’ll never fit your foot the way they should .
Buy your shoes and sneakers new , just look for sales .
Mattresses – Yikes .
Who knows what action they ’ve seen , and they could be filthy inside .
Major electronics / appliances – TVs could be ready to expire , CD players could skip constantly , washing machines could have a cruddy motor .
Nah .
Bigger is better ?

According to University of Utah researchers , using a larger monitor could save you 2.5 hours per day .
Specifically , test subjects completed everyday tasks like editing documents and massaging spreadsheets 52 % faster when using a 24 - inch monitor than they did with an 18 - incher .
Not sure who uses 18 - inch screens ( 17 ″ and 19 ″ are more typical ) , but I ’d be curious to see how productivity with a 24 - inch screen without Expose compares to a 17 ″ Mac with Expose activated .
If they are referring to docs and spreadsheets , it would seem to be a mostly scrolling - based discrepancy , n’est - ce pas ?
I suspect that if we use double - finger dragging on a scratch pad to scroll vs. a mouse , this gap would narrow .
Any theories to explain the difference , and how to make a smaller screen behave like a larger screen ?
Top picks for afforable 20 - 24 ″ monitors ?
I ’m planning on a 22 ″ Acer LCD in black and hope to quantify the difference over a 4 - week period .

A former sysadmin at Medco Health Solutions , a US prescription management and health information firm , has been jailed for 30 months over a failed attempt to destroy its systems using a " logic bomb " computer virus .
Yung - Hsun Lin , 51 , of Montville , New Jersey , was sentenced this week after earlier pleading guilty to booby - trapping systems at Medco .
The rogue employee was also ordered to pay $ 81,200 in compensation to his former employer at a hearing before US District Judge Jose Linares , the New Jersey Star - Ledger adds .
Yung - Hsun had feared he might lose his job after the firm 's spin - off from Merck , and set the ' bomb ' to go off after his expected departure .
The malware , planted in October 2003 , was designed to wipe out critical data stored on more than 70 servers .
The data included a patient - specific drug interaction conflict database as well as billing and payroll systems .
When the code failed to launch in April 2004 because of coding flaws , Yung - Hsun ( who survived a round of lay - offs ) reprogrammed the malware to go off on April 23 , 2005 - his next birthday .
Fortunately the malware was discovered and defused in January 2005 before it could do any damage , after a sysadmin investigating a system error discovered the malware embedded within other scripts on Medco ’s servers . ®
Britain's First Plans for Developing an Atomic Bomb
Report completed by William G. Penney on 1 July 1947
Concerning the Classification and Sensitivity of the Penney Report
The Penney Report , outlining the features of an atomic bomb based on the U.S. Fat Man pattern , and the tasks required to develop one for Britain , was declassified and made available to the the public under the Public Records Act ( now amended by the Freedom of Information Act which came into force in January 2005 ) .
The UK Public Record Office File AVIA 65/1163 , " Implosion " ( covering the years 1947 - 1953 ) has been withdrawn from public access since 2002 and this will not be reconsidered until 2014 .
The actual legal status of this file remains as a public record .
Its access condition has been changed to " Retained by Department under Section 3.4 " ( of the PRA ) which means that the file has been returned to the custody of the originating department ( Ministry of Supply ) or its successor .
This limitation of access does not constitute reimposition of a secret security marking , and no attempt appears to have been made by the UK government to contact people who had previously obtained copies of this file .
It should be observed that Penney 's description and discussion of development are no more revealing than descriptions of the United States ' first implosion bomb that have been publicly available for many years , and in fact are less precise than other descriptions that are now available , and are in any case the oldest material in the file , written before any actual bomb development work had been undertaken in the UK .
Penney 's description is by all accounts far less technical and detailed than " Tuck 's Bible " , detailed notes written around this same time by James Tuck , another member of the British Mission to Los Alamos who , unlike Penney , was deeply involved in the actual design and devleopment of the implosion bomb .
Tuck 's Bible has never been made public .
Penney and the Start of the Post - War British Atomic Bomb Program
William G. Penney , the British " Oppenheimer " , spent most of 1944 and 1945 as part of the British Mission at Los Alamos .
This was an elite team of British scientists , and emigres to Britain , who contributed to the development , testing and use of the atomic bombs during the Second World War .
Sent as a specialist on ocean waves , his gifts were readily apparent at Los Alamos and he soon was made one of the five members of the Los Alamos " brain trust " that made key decisions in the direction of the program , putting him in the company of Robert Oppenheimer , John Von Neumann , William " Deke " Parsons and Norman Ramsey .
On 27 April 1945
Penney became one of only two representatives from Los Alamos ( and the only Briton ) to be part of the ten man Target Committee that drew up the list of targets for the atomic bombing of Japan .
Penney travelled to Tinian Island in the Pacific to be on hand for planning and briefing the atomic bombing missions .
Penney actually witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki , flying in an observation plane accompanying the attack .
Afterward he conducted damage surveys there on the ground .
Penney returned to Imperial College immediately after the war , but accepted an appointment to head the Armament Research Department ( ARD ) on 1 January 1946 .
On 8 January 1947 the secret GEN.163 Cabinet committee of six Ministers ( headed by PM Attlee ) decided to proceed with development and acquisition of atomic weapons .
Penney did not receive word of this decision until May 1947 when he was finally asked by Lord Portal to lead Britain 's own nuclear weapon program .
The decision was not disclosed publicly in any respect until 12 May 1948 , when an oblique reference was made to atomic weapon development in parliamentary discussions .
In June 1947 Penney began assembling a team to work on the bomb .
One of his first steps was to prepare a document describing the features of the U.S. implosion bomb , breaking down the development tasks required to replicate it , and identifying outstanding questions that required further research .
This report was completed on 1 July , was entitled Plutonium Weapon - General Description ( UK Public Record Office File AVIA 65/1163 , " Implosion " ) and gave the British atomic weapons program a preliminary design description roughly equivalent in terms of detail to the description provided the Soviets by Klaus Fuchs .
A much more detailed technical discussion , known as " Tuck 's Bible " was created by British Mission member James Tuck , who had been instrumental in the development of the explosive lenses used in the implosion bomb .
( CNN ) -- Several prominent leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention said Monday that Baptists have a moral responsibility to combat climate change -- a major shift within a denomination that just last year cast doubt on human responsibility for global warming .
" We can do better " in responding to climate change , some members of the Southern Baptist Convention say .
Forty - six influential members of the Southern Baptist Convention , including three of its past four presidents , criticized their denomination in a statement Monday for being " too timid " in confronting global warming .
" Our cautious response to these issues in the face of mounting evidence may be seen by the world as uncaring , reckless and ill - informed , " the statement says .
" We can do better . "
The Southern Baptist Convention , the largest Protestant denomination in the United States , adopted a resolution last year urging Baptists to " proceed cautiously in the human - induced global warming debate in light of conflicting scientific research . "
The resolution said " many scientists reject the idea of catastrophic human - induced global warming . "
On Monday , however , dozens of Southern Baptist leaders expressed a different view .
" There is general agreement among those engaged with this issue in the scientific community , " their statement says .
" A minority of sincere and respected scientists offer alternate causes for global climate change other than deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels . "
The signatories pledged to do their part to fight global warming " without any further lingering over the basic reality of the problem or our responsibility to address it .
Humans must be proactive and take responsibility for our contributions to climate change -- big and small . "
The signatories include Frank Page , president of the Southern Baptist Convention since 2006 ; James Merritt , president of the convention from 2000 to 2002 and Jack Graham , president of the convention from 2002 to 2004 .
The group posted the statement on its Web site .
The signers of " A Southern Baptist Declaration on the Environment and Climate Change " acknowledged that some of them were skeptics at first .
" Some of us have required considerable convincing before becoming persuaded that these are real problems that deserve our attention , " the statement says .
" But now we have seen and heard enough to be persuaded that these issues are among the current era's challenges that require a unified moral voice . "
The Southern Baptist Convention 's 16 million members make up roughly 7 percent of the U.S. adult population , according to the convention and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .

The competing and evolving views on climate change within the Southern Baptist Convention mirror a debate that has played out among members of the theologically like - minded National Association of Evangelicals , an umbrella group that represents about 30 million people in 45,000 church congregations , including many Baptist congregations .
Its Washington policy director , the Rev. Richard Cizik , has pressed for years for more action to combat climate change , saying in a recent documentary that " to harm this world by environmental degradation is an offense against God . "
His advocacy raised eyebrows given that global warming sometimes conjured " impressions in people 's minds of being liberal , democratic , left wing , big government , tied to population control , all these kinds of things , " Cizik told CNN last year .
Several conservative evangelicals signed a letter in 2007 urging the association to rein in Cizik or encourage him to resign .
The signers included James Dobson of Focus on the Family and Gary Bauer , a former presidential candidate and president of American Values .
" We have observed that Cizik and others are using the global warming controversy to shift the emphasis away from the great moral issues of our time , notably the sanctity of human life , the integrity of marriage and the teaching of sexual abstinence and morality to our children , " their letter said .
" The issue ( global warming ) should be addressed scientifically and not theologically . "

In an aggressive move to finish 670 miles of barriers along the U.S. - Mexico border by the end of the year , the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced plans to waive federal and state environmental laws .
The two waivers , which were approved by Congress , will allow Homeland Security to slash through a thicket of more than 30 environmental and cultural laws to speed construction .
Environmentalists and local officials have strenuously opposed some of the planned infrastructure projects , saying they will damage the land and disrupt wildlife .
But Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Tuesday that the department was committed to minimizing the impact on the environment .
The draft environmental assessments , he said , show the projects will have only “ insignificant impacts on the environment and cultural resources . ”

“ DHS is neither compromising its commitment to responsible environmental stewardship nor its commitment to solicit and respond to the needs of state , local and tribal governments , ” Chertoff said in a prepared statement .
Critics , however , said the waivers were intended to sidestep growing and unexpectedly fierce opposition -- especially in Arizona and in Texas , where concerns have been raised about endangered species and fragile ecosystems along the Rio Grande .
“ The Bush administration ’s latest waiver of environmental and other federal laws threatens the livelihoods and ecology of the entire U.S. - Mexico border region , ” said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope .
“ Secretary Chertoff chose to bypass stakeholders and push through this unpopular project on April Fool ’s Day .
We do n’t think the destruction of the borderlands region is a laughing matter . ”
Environmentalists ’ concerns are that a fence could , among other things , disrupt the migration corridors of butterflies and two endangered species of wildcats : the ocelot , which resembles a miniature leopard , and the jaguarundi , an otter - faced relative of the puma .

In California , invoking the waivers clears the way for 4.5 miles of fencing and 6 miles of roads on Otay Mountain , east of San Diego , a plan that has not met with significant organized opposition .
Homeland Security ’s push to build more fencing came after Congress failed to overhaul immigration laws amid an acrimonious national debate over illegal border crossings .
In 2006 , conservatives in Congress championed the Secure Fence Act despite the reluctance of President Bush , who has insisted that a comprehensive approach is needed to deal with illegal immigration .
Congress subsequently gave Chertoff the power to waive federal law to hasten construction .
The department has faced intense opposition from border communities and has had to go to court against more than 50 property owners simply to survey land for the fence .
Experts said the congressional waivers would make it extremely difficult for successful legal challenges based on environmental or cultural claims .
But the waivers will not affect the legal battles between Homeland Security and private landowners .
On Tuesday , Republicans in Congress hailed Chertoff ’s decision , saying the accelerated plans for completing border projects would help stem illegal immigration and drug smuggling .

“ It ’s great ; this is the priority area where most of the illegal activity is going on and where most of the deaths are occurring , ” said Rep. Brian P. Bilbray ( R - Carlsbad ) , chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus .
But backers of comprehensive immigration reform said the waivers did little to address the fundamental weaknesses of immigration policy and would not lead to tighter border controls .
“ This is n’t the first time the DHS has used this authority , and each time it has resulted in increased frustration by all stakeholders , ” said Rep. Hilda L. Solis ( D - El Monte ) .
Homeland Security has completed about 300 miles of pedestrian and vehicle barriers .
An additional 370 miles remain to be built , along with all - weather roads , cameras , lighting and other infrastructure projects .
But much of that fencing -- along a 470 - mile span stretching from Texas to California -- has been held up by federal , state and local regulations , officials said .
Until Tuesday , the department had given few hints that waivers would be used .
Homeland Security had followed the environmental impact statement process , as required by the National Environmental Policy Act .
The public was allowed to comment on the draft environmental impact statements and assessments .
Some environmental groups said they were awaiting the final reports when Chertoff made the announcement .

Chertoff said the department had been a careful steward of the environment , even after exercising waiver authority .
Three previous waivers have been issued by Homeland Security .
One in September 2005 was issued to complete about 14 miles of fence near San Diego .
Another in January 2007 was to build infrastructure near the Barry M. Goldwater military range in southern Arizona .
A third waiver was issued in October 2007 near the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area , also in southern Arizona .
Chertoff said the department had helped in the recovery efforts of two endangered species in Arizona , the Sonoran pronghorn and lesser long - nosed bat , and had delayed fence construction to excavate a culturally significant site within the San Pedro River basin .
Critics , however , say the department ’s environmental assessments have been rushed efforts that present a distorted and incomplete picture .

“ It ’s surprising how cursory their reviews have been , ” said Kim Delfino , director of the California branch of Defenders of Wildlife .
“ There ’s a lot of boilerplate and analysis shifted from one document to another .
It ’s kind of like they were going through the motions . ”

Every Day Is Exactly The Same , am I right ?
l.o.l.
A while ago now - probably 2013 , if my file metadata is correct - I spotted a pretty sweet eBay auction for a collection of press clippings related to Nine Inch Nails .
Even longer ago , I had started archiving online articles into a searchable database after noticing that links in old backissues of this site were failing , but print articles still left a big gap , and this auction seemed like a pretty great opportunity to fill that gap .
I still had ambition , and had some success with OCR in the past , with a little massaging - but it ended up going for more than I felt comfortable paying for .
Never one to give up , and only slightly hesitant about asking lame questions , I reached out to the seller about a couple of the articles I 'd seen in the preview image - one was a really early interview I 'd never seen before .
I do n't remember what I asked , and I 'm having trouble finding the exchange , but I 'm sure I asked something along the lines of , " Do you think you could send me a scan of the article in the photos on your ebay listng ?
" Imagine my surprise and delight when in response , I was sent a 135 page PDF .
Everything in the auction , in digital form .
Oh , reader , I had big plans for this .
I may have even manually entered one or two of these into the archive , but do n't hold me to that .
Instead , life came at me pretty fast , and having moved house three times since then , I think the traffic to this remnant of the weird web that is the NIN Hotline is now low enough that linking directly to this PDF wo n't completely clobber my Dropbox account - but if you click on this and get an error , just try again over the weekend .
This link is to a 277MB PDF with 135 pages of press releases , magazine articles , and even a blank page or two , spanning from the very beginning of Nine Inch Nails up through Year Zero .
I may have to take it down at some point , so if you 're seeing this post - congratulations , I hope this helps pass some time during our pandemic lockdown civil unrest jackboot kidnapping motherfucker of a year .
Articles , full color promotional one - sheets , classic Nothing Records press releases , and as the art of the press release dies off , eventually we get to scans of printouts of unformatted MS Word docs - including a press release from Unviersal / Interscope with a link to Echoing the Sound that would have been an absolute bear to have to type in by hand .
Happy Pandemic Lockdown Friday , friends !
Stay safe , do n't go out unless you have to , and if you do go out , wear a mask , do n't touch your face , and wash your damn hands .
* Illustration : Riccardo Vecchio * Last spring , marketer and blogger Hugh MacLeod posted a question on his site :
If open source is such a phenomenon , where are all the open source billionaires ?
His audience was n't amused .
Open source software relies on a community of volunteer developers who tinker on , write for , or amend a program , then give it away free .
MacLeod 's site filled up with complaints that even to look for billionaires violated the spirit of the open source movement .
" There have to be rewards , " one commenter wrote , " but they do n't have to be financial . "
Another simply recommended that MacLeod " shut the fuck up , " adding : " You do n't know what you 're talking about . "
But not every open - sourcer has proven so averse to filthy lucre .
A number of open source companies have recently attracted investments and merger interest :
Whether they like it or not — and let 's face it , they probably do — more and more open source creators are striking it rich .
In 2007 , some 30 open source software companies were purchased for more than $ 1 billion — double the number of sales in 2005 , according to consulting firm 451 Group .
And 2008 is proving to be even more frenetic .
In January alone , Sun Microsystems announced the purchase of open source pioneer MySQL for $ 1 billion ; open source development players Covalent and SpringSource merged ; and Nokia agreed to pay $ 153 million for the open source mobile - software maker Trolltech .
On Wall Street , bankers are rooting around for a good open source company to take public .
" People call us all the time , " says John Lilly , CEO of Mozilla , which oversees the open source Firefox browser and Thunderbird mail application .
" We 're a valuable thing . "
On his Silicon Alley Insider site , defrocked Wall Street analyst Henry Blodgett recently estimated that the for - profit arm of Mozilla was worth between $ 1.5 billion and $ 4 billion .
Lilly says the estimate is about right but that Mozilla is staying private .
" As long as we can pay the bills , we can take a long view of the world that we could n't if we had shareholders and quarterly reporting . "
Which is not to say that open source companies can't hold their own in the business world .
The software is penetrating realms that few thought it ever would .
It 's being used to create trading platforms for hedge funds — which are notoriously insistent on proprietary systems — and Wal - Mart is deploying an open source - based system for its workers to track their health care records .
The cost savings come from not having to hire engineers to write code in - house or pay costly per-seat licensing fees .
" I think the software - license business model is archaic , " says Kevin Harvey , a venture capitalist at Benchmark Capital , which recently cashed in on its investments in MySQL and the open source mail - client firm Zimbra , which Yahoo picked up in late 2007 for $ 350 million .
" I would n't fund a company with that model , and I do n't think anyone else would , either . "
How can you build a business by giving away the store ?
The money comes from selling add - ons , service contracts , and hardware to go with the software .
But that model works only if you master a couple of basics .
Open source software makers have to win enough users that even the small percentage of customers who pay will generate a torrent of dollars .
( Mozilla gets most of its money from Google , which pays to be the browser 's default search provider — something Google is willing to do because Firefox has so many users . )
More important , software makers depend on the goodwill of outside developers , whom they rely on to keep updating their products .
So the new open source billionaires might want to think twice about going 767 for 767 with the Google guys .
For the coder drones , accustomed to being paid in warm feelings , such displays might make them take their coding skills elsewhere .

A 71 - year - old man alleged to have been a member of the Ku Klux Klan has been found guilty of kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 deaths of two black teenagers that sparked a summer of violence later depicted in the film Mississippi Burning .
James Ford Seale had pleaded not guilty to the charges relating to the deaths of Charles Moore and Henry Dee , both aged 19 at the time of their disappearance on May 2 1964 .
Their bodies were later found in the Mississippi river .
Seale 's conviction was achieved on the words of a confessed Klansman , Charles Edwards , who was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for turning on his old friend .
He testified that Seale had belonged to the same Klan chapter , or klavern , as he had , which was led by Seale 's late father .
The prosecution team admitted to the jury they had made " a deal with the devil " but argued that it was the only way to get justice 43 years after the killings .
Seale , who declined to testify , now faces up to two life sentences .
He is unlikely to leave prison alive .
As the guilty verdicts were returned , the victims ' relatives hugged each other and cried .
Seale 's prosecution may mark one of , if not the last trial of its kind from the brutal heyday of the KKK and its violent clashes with the civil rights movement .
As witnesses pass away , the likelihood of further trials diminishes .
During the trial , the jury heard that white supremacists , often with the complicity of local police officers and the courts , were consciously targeting civil rights activists in an attempt to terrorise them into silence .
Seale was arrested a few months after the men disappeared , but murder charges were later dropped against him .
Prosecutors alleged that the two victims had been picked up while they were hitchhiking , thrown into the boot of a car and taken to a forest where they were beaten in an attempt to extract information on firearms being brought into the area .
Edwards said that he saw Seale hold a gun to Dee and Moore , while the two young black men were beaten for about half an hour , 30 or 40 times each .
Edwards claimed that although he had been involved in the beating , he had not been present when the men had been thrown into the river .
He said Seale later told him how the men were dumped alive in a backwater of the Mississippi river with weights attached to them .
Defence lawyers that the case was flimsy because it relied on the evidence of one man , an " admitted liar " .
" This case all comes down to the word of one man , an admitted liar , a man out to save his own skin .
A case based on his word is no case at all , " the lead defence lawyer , Kathy Nester , said .
Seale has always denied membership of the KKK .
Before the trial started , a former FBI agent gave evidence that he had confronted Seale and accused him of the murder a few months after the deaths .
Edward Putz said Seale had replied : " Yes , but I 'm not going to admit it .
You are going to have to prove it . "
WASHINGTON , March 31 ( Reuters ) - More than half of U.S. doctors now favor switching to a national health care plan and fewer than a third oppose the idea , according to a survey published on Monday .
The survey suggests that opinions have changed substantially since the last survey in 2002 and as the country debates serious changes to the health care system .
Of more than 2,000 doctors surveyed , 59 percent said they support legislation to establish a national health insurance program , while 32 percent said they opposed it , researchers reported in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine .
The 2002 survey found that 49 percent of physicians supported national health insurance and 40 percent opposed it .
" Many claim to speak for physicians and represent their views .
We asked doctors directly and found that , contrary to conventional wisdom , most doctors support national health insurance , " said Dr. Aaron Carroll of the Indiana University School of Medicine , who led the study .
" As doctors , we find that our patients suffer because of increasing deductibles , co-payments , and restrictions on patient care , " said Dr. Ronald Ackermann , who worked on the study with Carroll .
" More and more , physicians are turning to national health insurance as a solution to this problem . "
PATCHWORK
The United States has no single organized health care system .
Instead it relies on a patchwork of insurance provided by the federal and state governments to the elderly , poor , disabled and to some children , along with private insurance and employer - sponsored plans .
Many other countries have national plans , including Britain , France and Canada , and several studies have shown the United States spends more per capita on health care , without achieving better results for patients .
An estimated 47 million people have no insurance coverage at all , meaning they must pay out of their pockets for health care or skip it .
Contenders in the election for president in November all have proposed various changes , but none of the major party candidates has called for a fully national health plan .
Insurance companies , retailers and other employers have joined forces with unions and other interest groups to propose their own plans .
" Across the board , more physicians feel that our fragmented and for - profit insurance system is obstructing good patient care , and a majority now support national insurance as the remedy , " Ackermann said in a statement .
The Indiana survey found that 83 percent of psychiatrists , 69 percent of emergency medicine specialists , 65 percent of pediatricians , 64 percent of internists , 60 percent of family physicians and 55 percent of general surgeons favor a national health insurance plan .
The researchers said they believe the survey was representative of the 800,000 U.S. medical doctors .

Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) appeared on ABC ’s “ This Week ” program today , and burned any bridges that he might have had remaining with the Democratic Party .
Lieberman claims that the Democratic Party is different than in the Clinton years , because it has been taken over by the left .
“ It ’s not the Bill Clinton - Al Gore party , which was strong internationalists , strong on defense , pro-trade , pro-reform in our domestic government .
It ’s been effectively taken over by a small group on the left of the party that is protectionist , isolationist and very , very hyperpartisan .
So it pains me , ” the former Democrat said .
Lieberman also continued to shill for his buddy John McCain .
He said McCain is , “ a reformer , somebody who understands ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country and remembers the other part of the Kennedy inaugural , which said that we will bear any burden , pay any price to assure the survival and sustenance of liberty .
That ’s John McCain . ”
As if Hillary Clinton did n’t already have enough problems , Lieberman praised her vote in favor of labeling the Iran Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group .
“ These people are responsible for killing hundreds of American soldiers .
Senator Obama voted against that .
Now , to me , that was an irresponsible vote .
And I give Senator Clinton credit ; she voted for it . ”

Joe Lieberman is completely delusional .
The Democratic Party ’s modern history has been as a left leaning party .
The problem during Bill Clinton ’s presidency was that the Party establishment , continued to move to the right , while rank and file Democrats were shifting left .
This is why the last two Democratic presidential candidates were met with such tepid enthusiasm .
As much as the Republicans , people like the Clintons and Lieberman want to tear down the legacy of the Democratic Party .
It is the invasion of righties like Lieberman that caused the Democratic Party to go through an almost decade long identity crisis that lasted until George W. Bush solved it for them by invading Iraq .
One of the reasons for Barack Obama ’s popularity is that for the first time , Democratic voters have been offered a serious candidate that is in step with where they are ideologically .
We all know that Lieberman is looking for a job in a McCain administration , but here is a frightening thought , if you can imagine that Gore / Lieberman won in 2000 .
Al Gore would be finishing up his second term , and Joe Lieberman would be the likely Democratic nominee .
In a Lieberman led Democratic Party there would be no difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on most important issues .
If people need any more reason not to support Hillary Clinton , keep in mind that she is Joe Lieberman ’s kind of Democrat on foreign policy .
It was n’t the Democratic Party that left Joe Lieberman .
Joe Lieberman was rejected by the Democrats in his home state .

( CNN ) --
The woman walked into the sprawling camp outside the Somali capital last month carrying her month - old baby , with her other seven children in tow .
Makeshift huts stretch to the horizon at the camp near Afgooye , Somalia .
Her husband had been killed the previous day , crushed to death when a shell demolished the family 's home .
" So she had been left with nothing .
Her husband , who was the income earner , was dead , " said Patrick Duplat of Refugees International .
" She had no family , no relatives , and she just walked all the way to this camp in the search for safety .
And this story is not an extraordinary story .
It 's the story of most of the people who have settled there . "
Duplat and Erin Weir of the Washington - based humanitarian group spent time last month at the city of huts , which stretches for at least 10 miles along a road just west of the capital , Mogadishu , outside the town of Afgooye .
Watch what aid workers found in the camp »
" The conditions are dire , " Weir said .
" What you see is just a mass of people who have fled from Mogadishu and have settled very informally on the road , between Mogadishu and Afgooye .
Most of them had to flee without anything at all , and so they 've built huts out of sticks and pieces of cloth . "
" I 've been to quite a lot of refugee camps , and this is simply the largest concentration of displaced people in the world .
It 's absolutely massive , " Duplat said .
Although other countries may have larger totals for internally displaced people -- Iraq has nearly 3 million , according to the United Nations refugee agency -- the U.N. calls the Afgooye camp " probably the single largest IDP [ internally displaced persons ] gathering in the world today . "
Refugees International estimates that there are 200,000 to 250,000 people living there , with more arriving every day .
These days , Somalia is so dangerous that most western aid workers spend little more than 24 hours at a time on the ground .
Duplat and Weir were protected by privately arranged security personnel while they visited the Afgooye camp .
They shared their impressions , their video and still pictures , exclusively with CNN .
People are abandoning their homes in Mogadishu and fleeing to the camp because of the violence and danger in the capital , Weir said .
See a map »
" Most of the people that we interviewed said they 'd fled because their homes had been shelled , their family members killed , they 'd lost their livelihood , " she said .
" People are leaving because they 've been left with nothing and because they fear for their lives . "
When they arrive at the roadside settlement , they face the challenges of building a hut and finding food .
Many seek out family or friends who fled ahead of them .
The U.N. and other agencies are providing aid , but as more people arrive every day , the conditions become more difficult , Duplat said .
" It 's one of the most massive aid operations in the world , but at the same time , they can't keep up .
The food is never enough ; water is never enough .
If somebody arrives the day after food distribution , they have to wait until the next month to get food , " he said .
The U.N. said last week that " numerous obstacles " prevent humanitarian aid from reaching all those in need .
They include " administrative delays , restrictions or delays in movement of goods , targeting of humanitarian workers and assets including the looting of aid and carjackings , piracy [ and ] negative perception of humanitarian workers , " among others .
Somalia , in East Africa , has been wracked with violence for years .
Islamist insurgents have been battling government and Ethiopian troops in Mogadishu and elsewhere since they were ousted from power in December 2006 .
Islamist groups seized power from U.S. - backed warlords in mid-2006 .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says that by the end of 2007 , an estimated 1 million Somalis were displaced from their homes inside the country , and thousands more were fleeing to neighboring countries .
About 60,000 Somalis have fled Mogadishu in only the first three months of this year .
Refugees International issued a report last week whose recommendations include a " dramatic " increase in UNHCR staff in Somalia and U.S. condemnation of human rights abuses allegedly committed by Ethiopian forces .
But , Duplat said , " there is no silver bullet in Somalia .
If there was , somebody would have found it . "
When Duplat and Weir climbed on the roof of a building at the camp , they were stunned by what they saw .
" My most enduring memory is quite clearly walking on the roof of that school and seeing the extent of displacement , " Duplat said .
" It is the largest camp in the world , and I think it 's tragic to see that families who used to live in a city -- had homes , apartments , kitchens -- now live in huts and with very little hope of going back .
" And all the people that we speak to want us to bring their voices and their story to the international community , because all they hear on the news are news of other crises , and they feel left out . "

This week , the Christian Century published an article by the Catholic theologian John Haught , titled “ Amateur atheists :
Why the new atheism is n’t serious “ .
Before I say anything more , I want to acknowledge that John Haught is not the real enemy .
He testified for the side of the plaintiffs in the Kitzmiller v. Dover intelligent design trial , for instance , arguing that religious faith is compatible with scientific inquiry and that ID is pseudoscience .
I ’m appreciative of his service on this issue .
That said , the rest of this post will show no mercy .
First of all , as the title implies , Haught presumes for himself the right to judge which atheists are or are not sufficiently “ serious ” :
For many years I taught an introductory theology course for undergraduates titled “ The Problem of God . ”
My fellow instructors and I were convinced that our students should be exposed to the most erudite of the unbelievers …
The recent books by Richard Dawkins , Samuel Harris and Christopher Hitchens would never have made the required - reading list .
Their tirades would simply reinforce students ’ ignorance not only of religion but also of atheism .
Although Haught makes noises about wanting his students to be exposed to the best arguments for nonbelief , when it comes time for practical application of that policy , he swiftly pivots and says , in effect : “ I ’m going to decide which arguments for atheism are most convincing , and take it from me , these guys are n’t saying anything worthwhile !
It ’s not necessary for you to read what they ’re writing .
Trust me . ”
Despite his pretense of allegiance to open inquiry , it seems clear that his wish is to act as a censor , deciding which are the best ( i.e. , the safest ) arguments for nonbelief , and sheltering his students from all the rest .
If these extremely successful , influential modern atheist authors are not worthy of mention as far as Haught is concerned , then he ’s doing his students a serious disservice by failing to acquaint them with what real atheists are actually saying today .
Who are the atheists that Haught wants his students to learn about ?
The next excerpt provides a revealing answer :
The classical atheists , by contrast , demanded a much more radical transformation of human culture and consciousness .
This is most evident when we consider works by Nietzsche , Camus and Sartre .
To them atheism not only should make all the difference in the world ; it would take a superhuman effort to embrace it .
Haught is infatuated with those few atheists who proposed a sweeping , dramatic reinvention of humanity from the ground up .
This is no surprise .
Clearly , his aim is to make atheism seem as radical and disturbing a proposition as possible , the better to frighten his students away from embracing it .
By contrast , the modern atheists he sneeringly dismisses are n’t proposing any radical social transformation .
They ’re simply pointing out that enormous potential for good already exists in the human mind .
We do n’t need to make ourselves into totally different creatures ; we just need to unleash the potential that ’s already there .
And one of the largest obstacles to that enlightenment is religion , which teaches that non-evidence - based faith and unquestioning obedience to authority are positive character traits .
They are not , and people who erroneously believe so have caused terrible violence and other tragedies .
It ’s these unmistakably deleterious effects of faith that the modern atheists are calling attention to .
No attack on atheism would be complete without the obligatory slander that atheism can provide no basis for morality .
Haught does n’t disappoint :
Has Harris really thought about what would happen if people adopted the hard - core atheist ’s belief that there is no transcendent basis for our moral valuations ?
What if people have the sense to ask whether Darwinian naturalism can provide a solid and enduring foundation for our truth claims and value judgments ?
As an expert witness at a creationism trial , Haught should be well aware that no prominent atheist claims either of those things .
In fact , Sam Harris ( whom he derides ) states in his books that he believes morality is objective , while Richard Dawkins ( whom he derides ) has argued that “ we , alone on earth , can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators . ”
Either Haught is grossly ignorant of the actual views of the atheists he ’s attacking , or else he ’s lying about their positions for rhetorical advantage .
I invite my readers to decide which is more likely to be the case .
Haught does say that “ logical rigor ” leads atheists to the conclusion of moral nihilism , implying that atheists who think otherwise just have n’t thought it through clearly enough .
But , for obvious reasons , a Catholic believer has no authority to decide what atheism “ really ” implies .
I ’ve said it many times before , but it can never be said often enough : atheism is compatible with an objective morality , one that ’s based on reason fused with compassion and conscience .
We do not blindly mimic nature , but instead apply our rational natures to determine what would be best for us , independent of what does or does not happen in the natural world .
The existence of God offers no surefire path to absolute morality , due to the Euthyphro dilemma : either God is simply communicating a preexisting standard which we could have discovered ourselves , or else his commands are wholly arbitrary and provide no objective basis .
I ’ll close with these words from Haught :
In fact , a distinguishing mark of the new atheism is that it leaves no room for a sense of moral ambiguity in anything that smacks of faith .
There is no allowance that religion might have at least one or two redeeming features .
No such waffling is permitted .
Their hatred of religious faith is so palpable that the pages of their books fairly quiver in our hands .
Even if we accept this insulting falsehood of a characterization , one thing Haught has notably failed to do is show any instance where these atheists are wrong .
He does n’t even attempt it .
Instead , he just asserts that these atheists are nasty and mean ( oh yes , and also “ amateurs ” and “ unserious ” ) , and so believers can safely ignore them , with no need to consider their argument on the merits .
He may call us amateurs , but I ’d like to return the compliment :
If this shallowly fallacious reasoning is all he has to offer , then he ’s the intellectual amateur , not the atheists who ’ve examined religious belief more dispassionately and incisively than he ever has or will .
I note one final point : whatever they wrote or said , Camus , Sartre and the rest made little effort to actually establish atheism as an organized and vital force in society .
Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris and the other modern atheists are doing exactly that .
I view it as entirely possible that Haught ’s entire essay is an elaborate exercise in concern trolling .
In effect , he ’s saying , we should stop making all these practical criticisms , stop pointing out the evils that religion has wrought , and stop trying to found a social and political movement that advances the interests of atheists .
All that is unserious and “ amateur ” .
Instead , you should be nihilists , and you should recognize that atheists have no morality and that they want to turn human society inside out and change everything .
In return , I ’ll teach about you in my introductory theology course !
If that ’s the bargain Haught is offering , then I hope he ’ll understand that real atheists neither want nor need his approval , and that we are likely to be utterly uninterested in taking him up on it .
Pentagon agency confuses Iran with Iraq in official history John Byrne

This US intelligence agency confuses Iran with Iraq in report about Israeli strike " George W. Bush is not stupid , " Jon Stewart told a crowd in 2005 .
" He invaded Iraq .
They did n't have weapons of mass destruction or ties to Al Qaeda ... but Iran does .
So he was only one letter off and that should be credited . "
The Agency that brought you bogus intelligence on the Iraq war -- a Defense Intelligence Agency operative who knew that a key US intelligence source was unreliable sat in on meetings with then - Secretary of State Colin Powell when he incorporated claims about mobile Iraqi weapons labs into his portfolio -- now brings you the Iran that is actually Iraq .
In a brief official history of their own agency , posted on their website ( pdf here ) , the DIA confused Iran and Iraq .
Noting " world crises " in the 1980s , the agency 's report cites an Israeli F - 16 raid to destroy an Iranian nuclear reactor .
( See page 14 ) The discrepancy was first caught by the Federation of American Scientists ' Steven Aftergood , who writes the blog Secrecy News .
In fact , Israel attacked an Iraqi nuclear reactor -- Osirak -- in 1981 .
Israel has not attacked Iranian nuclear sites -- or at least , not yet .
 The description appears to match Israels raid on Iraqs [ Osirak ] nuclear reactor in 1981 , Israeli scholar Gideon Remez told Aftergood on his blog .
 Todays preoccupation with Irans nuclear program seems to have been projected onto the events of 27 years ago . 
 If that is indeed the case , Id recommend a correction ,  he added .
The Defense Intelligence Agency , which authored the report , could not be reached for comment .
The DIA is n't the only one who 's made gauche comments about Iran recently .
On an official visit to the Middle East that was supposed to highlight his knowledge in foreign affairs , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) told reporters , " It 's common knowledge and has been reported in the media that Al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq .
That 's well known . "
Pressed by reporters , who knew there were no reporters that Al - Qaeda was being trained in Iran , McCain continued .
" We continue to be concerned about the Iranians taking Al - Qaeda into Iran and training them and sending them back , " he said .
Only after fellow Senator Joe Lieberman , who was traveling with him , whispered into his ear , did McCain correct himself .
" I am sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not Al - Qaeda , not Al - Qaeda , I am sorry , " McCain said .

A company called Psystar claims that it ’s selling a “ generic Mac ” for $ 549 ( or $ 399 without OS X ) .
While such a move seems to violate Apple ’s end - user license agreement , it indicates just how the age - old topic of running the Mac OS on non-Apple hardware has mutated in this modern , Intel - Mac age .
While I 'm not going to advocate that Apple ’s users rush out and configure a faux Mac of their very own , the reality is that Apple ’s computers are now Intel - based PCs through and through .
The existence of modern Mac clones — whether they come in a complete package from the likes Psystar or in pieces from a variety of computer - parts manufacturers — allows me to ask several questions about Apple ’s Mac hardware .
Yes , it lets me gauge the price and performance of Mac hardware by comparing it to non-Apple hardware .
But it also lets me explore a topic that , prior to Apple ’s switch to Intel processors , I could only speculate about :
The performance of Mac systems that simply do n’t exist .
Take the “ mythical mid-range Mac minitower , ” as Macworld 's Dan Frakes called it .
While Apple has an excellent selection of laptops , entry - level Macs , and high - end machines , it does n’t offer anything at all in the way of a moderately powerful expandable tower model .
Though the iMac offers good performance , it ’s an all - in - one machine with limited expandability and a monitor that not everyone may need .
As Dan wrote :
What I ’d like to see is a minitower design with — and this is just one possible configuration that would fulfill my wish — a reasonably powerful processor ( perhaps a higher - end Core 2 Duo or a single Xeon ) ; a good graphics card in an upgradeable slot ; a decent amount of RAM and hard - drive space ; a single free PCI Express slot ; and room for one additional hard drive .
The ability to swap out the optical drive would be a nice touch .
I ’m generally with Dan on this one — I do n’t want or need a machine with a built - in monitor , I do n’t need the power of an eight - core Mac Pro , but I ’d like my Mac to be faster and more expandable than a mini .
( I want more than one slot and room for more drives , however , so my minitower might be more of a medium - tower . )
Tired of waiting and hoping for the Mac of my dreams to appear , I decided to take the technology into my own hands and build it myself .
And thus began my experiment to assemble my very own OS X - running machine .
Note that I ’m not planning on diving into the technical details of building your own Mac .
Rather , for this article , I ’m focusing on the parts I used to make my own computer , the end result of my machinations , and how the machine performs .
Think of it as me building an off - brand Mac so that you do n’t have to .
Building the Frankenmac
To realize my dream Mac system , I set myself a budget of $ 1,000 ( not including keyboard , monitor , or mouse ) , and started shopping for computer parts .
While this amount is much more than what Psystar claims it will charge , I wanted to build a more powerful machine than what that company is offering , and then see how well it worked compared with machines from Cupertino .
When you build your own PC , you must decide exactly what goes into it — absolute freedom that comes with absolute responsibility .
You must choose the motherboard , processor , CPU cooling solution , video card , hard drives , CD / DVD burner , memory , case , and possibly even the power supply .
To make things even more challenging , if you ’re building a Mac - compatible PC , you ’ve got to stick with certain hardware that ’s known to work with Mac OS X .
I spent a lot of time web searching to find out what worked and what did n’t .
When I set out to configure my machine , I wanted to make it reasonably fast with the best video card I could fit into my budget , and with lots of room for expansion .
( I plan on using this machine as a platform to test various Mac - to - Windows tips , and of course it will be a dedicated machine for certain Windows - only applications that I absolutely must be able to run .
For those reasons , I need it to run Windows Vista as well as possible , as that will ultimately be the machine ’s primary role . )
Part Description
Cost
Motherboard
Asus P5K - E $ 152.99 CPU Intel Q6600 Core 2 Quad 2.4GHz $ 219.99 CPU heat sink
Zalman CPNS7700 - Cu $ 48.00 RAM 4GB DDR - 2 800 Mhz PC6400 $ 94.99 Video card
MSI NX8800GT 512MB OC $ 189.99 Case Antec Sonata III 500 $ 119.00 DVD / CD Burner
LG HL-DT -ST GSA - H62N $ 40.00 Hard drive
Seagate 500GB SATA 2 $ 93.00 Other
Shipping charges $ 23.45 TOTAL
$ 982.40
When the dust settled , I wound up with the following list of components as seen in the table on the right .
As you can see , the total cost of my parts was just over $ 980 , leaving about $ 20 for dinner out before I hit my budget limit .
As seen in the image at right , this was clearly a “ lots of assembly required ” project .
After all of the parts arrived at my home , it took a few hours to build the machine .
If you ’ve never built your own computer before , it ’s an interesting experience — there ’s something quite satisfying about putting it all together , powering it up , and hearing that first “ beep ” that lets you know you have n’t just turned your collection of parts into a collection of junk .
Of course , if you do n’t hear the beep , there ’s an entirely different reaction , one that borders on panic .
Thankfully , I heard the beep .
But building the hardware is actually the easy part of the process .
Next , I installed Vista on the PC , just to be sure everything worked .
From there , it then took many more hours to get OS X working right — while the process is relatively straightforward , there are a lot of steps involved , and BIOS settings to tweak .
If you want to run Windows and OS X on the same drive , there are more hoops to jump through to get it all working .
But after many hours of reading , assembling , disassembling , screaming , installing , uninstalling , reinstalling , saying bad words , pestering friends , and generally not having very much fun , I was done : my machine was up and running , and capable of booting into either Windows Vista or Mac OS X 10.5.2 .
Using a homebuilt Mac
My machine — which I ’ve named the Frankenmac — does n’t look anything like a Mac from the outside , of course .
The Antec case is glossy black , with a swing - open door that hides the externally - accessible drive bays , along with two USB ports , one eSATA port , and audio jacks on a shiny metallic strip on the front .
And if you happen to be sitting in front of it when it starts up , the BIOS loading screen and black - and - white text - based boot loader ( which lets me choose between Vista and OS X ) is a dead giveaway that this is not your normal Mac .
However , if I were to hide the case and set you down in front of the monitor when the system was already running , you ’d be convinced that you were using a “ real ” Mac — with one minor exception :
If you open the About This Mac box , you ’ll see a giveaway that this machine is n’t your typical Mac .
I do n’t think Apple ’s ever shipped an “ unknown ” processor !
But if you close the About box and just start using the machine , you ’ll be using a “ real ” Mac , one that performs ( mostly ) just like its factory - approved counterpart .
The Frankenmac runs any OS X program , including PowerPC - based programs via the Rosetta code- translation system .
The CD / DVD burner works with iTunes , iDVD , and iMovie .
Even low - level stuff like sleep works — although I have to wake the Frankenmac by touching the power button ; the keyboard and mouse are ignored while the machine is sleeping .
( That may be due to the fact that I ’m using a wireless Microsoft keyboard and mouse over USB — I have n’t tested it with Apple - branded hardware . )
On the hardware front , everything also seems to work fine .
The onboard Ethernet , audio , USB , eSATA and FireWire ports all work .
I even found an old USB / FireWire PCI card ( from a previous generic Windows machine I built ) , plugged it in , and connected my iSight camera to it — no problems whatsoever .
I plugged in my Wacom tablet , installed the drivers , and found that it also works just fine — including handwriting recognition via the Ink System Preferences panel .
Then I took advantage of the fact that I ’d built a machine in a case of my choosing : I installed a hot swap SATA drive bay — something like this one .
TIM HARFORD , " the undercover economist , " has assumed Paul Krugman 's old mantle as chief explainer of the dismal science to society at large .
It is a thankless task which he normally completes with erudition and style .
In this Sunday's
Washington Post
, Mr Harford
aimed to explain
Urban architecture matters , too .
This is something we feel intuitively but find hard to prove or to quantify .
Think of high - rise apartments .
Do they make a city safer by packing more people into an area and giving the streets a greater bustle ?
Or are cities safer if most buildings are low - rise , so that people feel a connection to the street ?
Two new - wave economists , Edward Glaeser of Harvard and Bruce Sacerdote of Dartmouth , matched crime figures with data on building height and discovered that the residents of high - rise apartments are much more likely to be victims of crime -- specifically street crime .
The effect remains similar after statistically adjusting for poverty , demographics and public housing :
It 's the height of the building itself that matters .
This is evidence in favor of urbanist Jane Jacobs 's persuasive -- but unproven -- insight that " eyes on the street " are what make a neighborhood safe .
The hero who sprinted across the street to knock the knife away was sitting on the stoop outside his home , not gazing out his penthouse window .
to readers the insight economics has contributed to the study of crime .
It 's a nifty read , with one small exception .
The problem portion :
File this under probably true but unhelpful .
For one thing , it 's rather naive to think that housing type might accomplish crime reductions through its effect on behaviour ( as opposed to its effect on the composition of the residential population ) .
Mr Harford may believe that replacing the luxury condos with a brownstone will encourage the cocktail mixing professional to instead sip lemonade on his stoop while local youths play stickball in the alley , but I doubt it .
In a more concrete vein , I think it highly likely that building height is instead capturing other neighbourhood variables .
It will be more difficult to build tall , for instance , in a highly regulated metropolitan area , and a highly regulated metropolitan area will be more likely to dictate a safer street design , greater police presence , and so on .
Height could also be capturing neighbourhood activism .
Those troubling community organisations who cause headaches for developers are also the sort to complain excessively to an inattentive police force or put together a community watch .
Building height is correlated , in other words , with the strength of social institutions .
Perhaps more importantly , the factoid quoted by Mr Harford does not appear to consider the opportunity cost of building shorter .
As Mr Glaeser knows better than anyone , limits on housing supply constitute a tight constraint on urban population growth .
As such , any citywide movement to reduce building heights will lead to greater population growth in suburbs and other low - density areas .
Those movements come with risks of their own , which cancel out most or all of the urban safety cost due to crime .
Low - density areas are subject to obesity and other health risks , the most serious of which is death and injury due to motor vehicle accidents .
That 's the danger of focusing on a single urban disamenity .
There are tradeoffs associated with building in different ways in different areas .
Attention to just one of many public safety factors paints a misleading portrait for readers .
Just another reason why being the layman 's economist is such a tough gig .
Any honest paragraph of straightforward explanation will usually require a good three pages of caveats and disclaimers .

One cleric said science had proved Mecca to be the centre of the Earth Muslim scientists and clerics have called for the adoption of Mecca time to replace GMT , arguing that the Saudi city is the true centre of the Earth .
Mecca is the direction all Muslims face when they perform their daily prayers .
The call was issued at a conference held in the Gulf state of Qatar under the title : Mecca , the Centre of the Earth , Theory and Practice .
One geologist argued that unlike other longitudes , Mecca 's was in perfect alignment to magnetic north .
He said the English had imposed GMT on the rest of the world by force when Britain was a big colonial power , and it was about time that changed .
Mecca watch A prominent cleric , Sheikh Youssef al - Qaradawy , said modern science had at last provided evidence that Mecca was the true centre of the Earth ; proof , he said , of the greatness of the Muslim " qibla " - the Arabic word for the direction Muslims turn to when they pray .
The meeting also reviewed what has been described as a Mecca watch , the brainchild of a French Muslim .
The watch is said to rotate anti-clockwise and is supposed to help Muslims determine the direction of Mecca from any point on Earth .
The meeting in Qatar is part of a popular trend in some Muslim societies of seeking to find Koranic precedents for modern science .
It is called " Ijaz al - Koran " , which roughly translates as the " miraculous nature of the holy text " .
The underlying belief is that scientific truths were also revealed in the Muslim holy book , and it is the work of scholars to unearth and publicise the textual evidence .
But the movement is not without its critics , who say that the notion that modern science was revealed in the Koran confuses spiritual truth , which is constant , and empirical truth , which depends on the state of science at any given point in time .

What are these ?
No matter where you get your news , it seems that the pitiful state of the American economy is the front and center story .
One day it ’s the foreclosure rate .
On another day it ’s about a major financial institution getting bailed out by the Fed .
The most telling , however , was the article I found about tent cities going up in the Los Angeles area .
This is particularly disturbing , especially when you look back at where this country was before George Bush took office .
When President Clinton took office , we were operating in deficit mode in part because of the disastrous economic policies of the Reagan - Bush ( George H.W. ) years .
In August of 1993 , President Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act , which raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 % of taxpayers and lowered the taxes on 15 million low - income families .
It also made tax cuts available to 90 % of small businesses and reigned in spending .
By 1998 , the United States had its first surplus in 42 years .
Now , everyone knows that all administrations take credit for these kinds of statistics , and the Clinton administration was no exception .
While it was a number of converging factors that led to the surplus , such as the economy outperforming estimates and cutting the interest on the federal debt , the Clinton package was certainly one of the factors that contributed to the economic recovery .
In 2000 , the year George W. Bush was elected , the United States had a surplus of $ 237 billion dollars .
It was Clinton ’s third consecutive surplus year , and the largest surplus in history .
(1) Fast - forward eight years and look around .
What do you see ?
A fiscal meltdown of titanic proportions
A $ 237 billion dollar surplus is now officially a $ 9 + trillion deficit .
Some estimate that national debt has increased an average $ 1.65 billion per day since September 29 , 2006 .
Another web site , http://www.truthin2008.com, states that the government keeps two sets of books and the actual deficit number is $ 55 trillion and growing .
The site is not merely an offspring of the “ liberal media . ”
It is a product of the Institute for Truth in Accounting and the information on the site has been confirmed by the outgoing Comptroller General of the United States , David Walker , who states , “ we have been diagnosed with fiscal cancer . ”
The institute calls for openness in dealing with the deficit issue and calls for the American public to find out if the candidates know how much we are really in the hole for and what plans each has to deal with it .
Whether the real deficit number is $ 9 trillion or $ 55 trillion , the economy is in dismal shape all the way around .
As he has done with so many issues facing the American people during the past seven years , President Bush continues to minimize the situation .
He touts the 52 months of uninterrupted job growth that his administration has delivered .
The fact is that his job growth performance is anemic .
Bush has created only 5.9 million jobs in seven years ( or 72,000 jobs per month ) .
By this time in his administration , Bill Clinton had created 20.2 million new jobs ( or 246,600 per month ) and he did it by investing in America .
Our own Mr. Optimism is competing with his father for the worst record of job growth since the presidency of Herbert Hoover .
He goes on insisting that his ineffectual economic stimulus package will take care of bolstering the sagging economy .
How did things get this bad ?
How we got here is a bone of contention .
Bush supporters say we ca n’t lay all of the economic woes at his feet .
Some want to blame the sub - prime mortgage meltdown entirely .
It is certainly one factor , but beware laying the blame here as some economists are tying Bush ’s tax cuts to this folly .
Yet , even if we take the position that the economy was slowing down when George Bush took office , his fiscal irresponsibility on a number of fronts has directly led to this economic meltdown .
Furthermore , anyone who believes that the money we are funneling into Iraq and Afghanistan has nothing to do with the failing economy is out of touch .
Prior to the Iraq invasion , President Bush went on national television and insisted that this war would be quick and inexpensive as wars go .
We were going to be greeted by the Iraqi people as liberators .
We ’d be in and out .
I still have the image in my mind of George Bush in airman get - up landing on the deck of a carrier and proclaiming “ Mission Accomplished . ”
That was the furthest thing from the truth .
Today the endless war in Iraq is being waged at a price of $ 12.5 billion per month .
When you add in the long - term bills as a result of the war , such as disability payments for veterans , it looks more like $ 25 billion per month .
The total economic cost for the Iraq war through 2008 is estimated at $ 1.3 trillion .
This war is not creating jobs for the American people .
It is , however , creating tidy little profits for businesses like Halliburton , Blackwater USA ( our own freelance mercenary army ) , and KBR ( formerly Kellogg Brown & Root ) .
To add insult to the economic injury , KBR , our leading Iraq contractor , avoids paying hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring employees through two Cayman Island shell companies .
The Defense Department has known this since 2004 and approves because it means KBR can do the work more cheaply .
Dwight D. Eisenhower ’s worst fears about an out - of - control military - industrial complex are coming to fruition .
Simultaneous to waging this fiscal albatross , President Bush has handed out $ 2 trillion in tax relief over the past seven years , primarily to those who need it the least .
This has never been done while the United States was at war .
The revenue from the tax cuts should be going toward offsetting the war ’s staggering costs .
What is most disturbing of all is that this president does not include the total amount needed to fight the war in his yearly budgets .
Instead , he routinely handles this as “ emergency spending ” which keeps it out of the normal budget channels .
At the time of this writing , President Bush is about to ask the Congress for another $ 107 billion for the war .
Where does this emergency money come from ?
We borrow it from China and other countries , compounding the size of the deficit .
These deceptive practices , and Bush ’s disastrous fiscal policies , are carried through in his $ 3.1 trillion budget for 2009 .
Bush ’s bunker busting 2009 budget
The 2009 budget calls for President Bush ’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to be made permanent .
These cuts are aimed at the top 20 % of earners in the country and not at the majority of American families whose income has remained flat ( or even declined ) during his administration .
It is in the hands of the average American family that the tax cut will stimulate the economy .
These families will spend the money on past - due bills and items of necessity , like food and clothing .
The rich will not spend the money .
They will bank it or invest it .
They already have everything they need .
Bush ’s proposed tax cuts will cost the country more than half a trillion dollars in revenue over the next five years and more than $ 2 trillion over the next decade .

An astute reader pointed out that there is a transactional integrity problem with the HAppS application built over the last 4 posts .
The function checkAndAdd in Finished HAppS Application contains a call to " query $ IsUser " as well as a call to " update $ AddUser " .
This violates that ACID guarantee that was desired from the checkAndAdd function .
If two people simultaneously try to create the same username , it 's possible that both of them could get past the " query " and " if exists " statements before either of the " update AddUser " statements are executed .
In this case , both of the AddUser updates would succeed and both users would think their account was created .
But if they had the same username , then first one would be overwritten by the second one .
The second user would n't notice a problem , but the first user would not be able to log in to the newly created account because his password would probably be different from the password chosen by the second user .
This would n't be the end of the world , but it would certainly create frustration for the first user .
The problem exists because HAppS gives us transactional guarantees at the query and update level only .
I just did n't think about it when I originally wrote the code .
I could just give the fix , but I 'll outline incorrect attempts I made before I got to the fix .
Hopefully it will be more beneficial to see some wrong solutions and how they got corrected .
Since I 'm still trying to overcome tendencies learned from years of imperative programming , maybe this will be useful to other people in the same position .
First we need to modify the addUser function to check for the existence of the user first .
What we want is something like the following :
Sometimes scientists wo n't understand it even after they see it , but at least they 'll believe it despite its improbability .
Such is the case with bats , the bumblebee and the hummingbird , which according to classic wing theory should not be able to fly .
Yet they seem to have forgotten to read that textbook .
In 1995 , bumblebee flight got its answer .
This week , the aerodynamics of a hovering bat species has been revealed .
Its flight was studied in the wind tunnel laboratory of Lund University .
The wind tunnel at Lund University is specially crafted for research on bird flight .
Birds fly “ at the spot ” against a headwind , allowing detailed investigation of wing movements using high speed video cameras .
It ’s also possible to visualize the vortices around the wings and in the wake using fog as tracer particles .
Vortex system on the bat ’s wings – it is the vortex along the leading edge that is now described for the first time .
In 2003 professor Anders Hedenström investigated the aerodynamics of bird flight using this method for the first time .
In the spring of 2007 his lab presented results from flying bats for the first time .
A nectar - feeding bat species , Palla ’s long - tongued bat , was trained to visit a feeder in the wind tunnel .
By varying the speed between 0 m/s ( hovering ) to 7 m/s , different behaviors were studied .
" When we investigated the aerodynamics of our bats we discovered that the wings generated more lift than they should at the slowest speeds ( as dictated by classic wing theory ) , " says professor Hedenström .
" We recorded vortices shed in the wake , which we know well from our previous studies on birds .
Now , our new study show that a stable leading edge vortex ( LEV ) is developed on top of the wing , and this vortex adds significant amounts of lift .
Such vortices were previously known in insects , for example in bumblebees , and it was the discovery of leading edge vortices that finally resolved the bumblebee flight conundrum . "

How can the bats generate such high lift ?
One of the team members and lead author of the new study , Florian Muijres , explains :
" The high lift arises because the bats can actively change the shape ( curvature ) by their elongated fingers and by muscle fibers in their membranous wing .
A bumblebee cannot do this ; its wings are stiff .
This is compensated for by the wing - beat frequency .
Bats beat their wings up to 17 times per second while the bumblebee can approach 200 wing - beats per second . "

Marcus W. Brauchli will step down as the top- ranking editor of The Wall Street Journal after less than a year in the job , four people briefed on the matter said on Monday , just four months after Rupert Murdoch took control of the paper .
Mr. Brauchli , 46 , will announce his resignation soon , according to friends and current and former colleagues , all of whom requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter .
They differed as to whether he was being forced out as managing editor of The Journal , one of the most coveted posts in journalism , or leaving out of frustration .
The news of his pending resignation was first reported on Time magazine ’s Web site .
Since December , when Mr. Murdoch ’s News Corporation bought Dow Jones & Company , publisher of The Journal , he has immersed himself in the newspaper ’s daily operations and quickly made changes in its shape and style .
Friends and colleagues say that Mr. Brauchli has been frustrated with some changes , and with the sense that he did not have the control over the newspaper that he was promised .
On Monday night , both Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Brauchli attended a dinner of the Atlantic Council , a group promoting international cooperation , at which Mr. Murdoch was being honored .
Approached there , Mr. Murdoch declined to comment about any change in editors ; Mr. Brauchli said , “ I ca n’t talk . ”
Manchester United 's red strip could give them an advantage
Scientists at universities in Plymouth and Durham analysed data on all English league clubs since World War II and found home teams in red won more often .
Players in yellow or orange shirts had the worst record but performances away from home did not show any differences .
Researchers believe there could be a psychological boost in wearing red .
They said the crimson shade is often associated with male aggression and dominance .
Professor Robert Barton , from Durham University , said : " We see a couple of possible explanations .
" Firstly , over time supporters may have been subconsciously more attracted to a club wearing red , so the club has developed an increasing resource base within its community .
" Secondly , there may be a positive psychological boost from wearing red that is reflected on the field of play .
" Competing against a team in red could also impair performance . "
Must .
Stay .
Awake .
Yes , it 's the 3 o'clock mantra .
And who has n't mumbled it while fighting off midday yawns and drooping eyes ?
Meditating or working out in three - minute breaks can replenish you and give a much needed energy boost .
Fatigue and flagging energy seem to be epidemics , especially among women who burn the candle at both ends ( and who does n't ? ) .
Instead of moping , pump up your mojo with these 10 strategies from experts in sleep , fitness , nutrition , psychology , and alternative medicine .
1 . See the light
Get the right light , and you 'll have lots more energy .
But that can be a challenge , given the poorly lit offices we sit in and the scant doses of daily sunlight ( which contains brain - activating short - wavelength blue light ) we get .
" Our circadian rhythms are more sensitive to blue light than any other kind , " says Mariana Figueiro , assistant professor at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , New York .
To take advantage of that energizing blue boost , lift your shades the minute you get up or take a 30 - minute walk first thing in the morning .
And go outside as often as you can during the day ( especially right before you need to be extra-alert ) , says Scott Campbell , Ph.D. , director of the Human Chronobiology Laboratory at New York -- Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center in Westchester , New York .
To up your blue light at work , use lamps with " natural " lightbulbs -- try Sylvania 's Daylight Extra bulbs , an Ott - Lite , or a light box that uses blue - light technology .
2 . Get pumped with protein
Unless you plan to run a marathon , carbo - loading for energy is out .
Instead , eat protein to increase mental alertness and energy , says Debra Hollon , M.S. , R.D. , a clinical nutritionist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts .
Protein contains tyrosine , an amino acid that elevates the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine .
It increases satiety , too .
And when you feel fuller , you 're not apt to overdo the breads and sweets that induce rollercoaster highs and lows .
Eat plant - and animal - based protein throughout the day -- an egg or high - protein cereal for breakfast , 10 almonds midmorning , a cup of low - sugar yogurt in the afternoon -- and your stamina should stabilize .
Health.com :
Get pumped with protein -- reconsider the egg
3 . Lend a hand
Research shows that you get a " helper 's high , " a rush of endorphins that lasts for hours , when you volunteer , says Kimberly Kingsley , author of " The Energy Cure : How to Recharge Your Life 30 Seconds at a Time . "
You do n't have to look far to help out , she says .
" There may be a single mom in your family who needs a babysitter or a lonely neighbor who'd love to chat . "
Judith Orloff , M.D. , a Los Angeles - based psychiatrist and author of " Positive Energy : 10 Extraordinary Prescriptions for Transforming Fatigue , Stress , and Fear , " agrees , and she often folds anonymous good deeds into her day .
During her morning coffee run , she sometimes buys an extra cup of joe for a homeless person .
" When you make someone happy , you feel filled up again , " Orloff says .

4. Breathe hard -- more often
That post - workout rush of energy you feel is well - documented : Movement sends oxygen through the bloodstream to invigorate cells .
That 's why Gerald K. Endress , fitness director at the Duke University Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina , suggests that you break up your workouts to maximize your oxygen intake .
Health.com :
Best new ways to boost your metabolism
Lift weights , roll out the exercise ball , or do five minutes of yoga in the morning .
Climb a few flights of stairs at lunch and jog after dinner .
To add an extra kick to your workout , breathe deeply for your first one or two minutes of cardio , Endress says : I nhale from your belly ; then breathe out slowly , imagining you 're pulling your navel toward your spine .

5 . Bag a new brew
Boost your energy with white tea , which has a delicate flavor that requires little sweetening .
" Of all the teas , white tea goes through the least processing , " says Iman Hakim , M.D. , Ph.D. , a professor at the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health at the University of Arizona in Tucson and a leading researcher on the benefits of tea .
As a result , white tea has the highest concentration of L - theanine , an amino acid that , according to recent research , stimulates alpha brain waves to boost alertness while producing a calming effect .
And because a cup of white tea contains less caffeine ( 15 milligrams ) than other teas ( up to 50 mg ) and coffee ( 120 mg ) , it 's more hydrating , another key for sustaining energy .
6 . Tackle the blahs in bursts
Shake up your routine for 15 minutes at a time to get an energy boost .
Change your walking route , sample a new food , garden for a few minutes , or pick up a pencil and draw .
" It 's all about taking baby steps to replenish yourself , " Orloff says .
Start small ; tackling a really big new project may just pile on more stress .
And think of your mini-task as a chance to renew , not another thing on your to - do list .
7 . Get hands - on help
Could your energy be blocked ?
Hands - on therapies such as acupuncture and Reiki ( pronounced ray - key ) , a Japanese massage technique , may help , says Eva Selhub , M.D. , senior staff physician at the Benson - Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Chestnut Hill , Massachusetts .
" These therapies may remove the blocks that create emotional and physical problems in our bodies , " she says .
" When the resistance is gone , energy flows . "
In fact , a recent British study published in New Scientist says acupuncture can relieve fatigue in cancer patients .
Do n't have time for a 30 - plus - minute session ?
Try self - acupressure .
According to a recent finding by Richard E. Harris , Ph.D. , research assistant professor at the University of Michigan Medical Center 's Department of Internal Medicine in Ann Arbor , Michigan , there 's a positive correlation between acupressure and increased alertness .
His trick :
Rub the muscle between your thumb and your forefinger for three to five minutes ; you should feel a little ache there and then an overall sense of ahh .

8 . Take a tech - free break
Being at the mercy of electronic devices keeps us in " fight - or - flight mode , " Kingsley says .
You get an adrenaline zap every time the cell phone rings or an e-mail comes in .
Over time , living off adrenaline exhausts you .
Cell phones , in particular , put increased stress on women , research shows .
Even though both men and women say that their cell phones allow job worries to affect their home lives , only women experience the opposite effect -- the spillover of home concerns into work .
The solution : " Set boundaries at work and home , " Kingsley suggests , " so your attention is n't always divided . "
Give yourself at least an hour a day when you completely unplug from electronic devices .
That chance to check in and connect with yourself will re-energize you , she says .
9 . Meditate for a minute
Time - crunched ?
Great news :
You can reap the benefits of meditation -- a hike in alertness and attention -- in three - minute minibreaks .
" They 're like little tune - ups , " Orloff says .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
She recommends an a .m. session before you start your day and a noon meditation before that typical 3 o'clock crash hits .
Find a quiet place ( even if it's the bathroom ) and mentally focus on an image that brings you pleasure : the ocean , a flower , the sun , your cat ; continue to keep the image in your mind 's eye as you breathe deeply ( roughly 10 seconds for each inhale and exhale ) .
With a little practice , Orloff says , you 'll become more skilled at maintaining focus and can add more short meditations to your day , whenever you need revitalizing .
10 . Clean up your sleep
The buzzword in sleep science these days is " sleep hygiene , " and it 's about more than clean sheets -- it helps you create an atmosphere that 's restful , so you 'll sleep well and wake up energized without the need for sleeping pills , Campbell says .
Health.com : 3 secrets to a good night 's sleep
Sleep hygiene usually includes three areas : fully darkening your bedroom ( turn your alarm clock away from you if the display gives off too much light ) , regulating room temperature to a moderate coolness ( too hot or too cold , and you 'll wake up ) , and using white noise ( a fan or quiet music ) to help induce sleepiness .

Location of Frankfurt in dark blue .
Police reported on Monday , that a man in Frankfurt , Germany is recovering after he fell 25 feet down an elevator shaft early Sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. CEST ( UTC+2 ) , and survived .
According to authorities , the only reason why the man is alive is because he landed on top of a woman who had fallen down the same shaft just one day earlier .
27 - year - old Jens Wilhelms , who was not injured in the fall , was walking up a dark stairwell , passing by the elevator shaft which was undergoing repairs .
When he peeked inside the open doors to see what was going on , he slipped off the edge .
" I saw the door open and I just wanted to check whether somebody was finally working on the elevator .
I took a closer look inside the shaft as it was pitch black , and must have slipped off the edge somehow , " said Wilhelms to the media .
Approximately 24 hours prior to Wilhelms ' fall , an unidentified 57 - year - old woman fell down the same shaft and was laying unconscious on the shaft 's floor , bleeding internally .
Authorities say that although the woman sustained additional injuries from Wilhelms ' fall , he likely saved her life .
" When Wilhelms fell down on her his weight caused additional damage to her body , but without that she could have laid there for days .
The woman had been lying unconscious in the shaft for some time already , " said Manfred Vonhausen , a spokesman for the Frankfurt Police Department .
The woman remains in a hospital where she is in critical condition .

Going Under In A Lexus
The mortgage crisis is , again , a crisis of responsibility -- both on the part of the lenders , who gave loans to people who were n't likely to be able to pay , and , of course , on the part of the borrowers .
Here 's a borrower lady with some messed - up priorities -- from a Wall Street Journal story , " Citigroup Feels Heat To Modify Mortgages , " by Laurie P. Cohen :
In Granada Hills , Calif. , Natalie Brandon is fighting to keep the three - bedroom ranch house she bought in 1985 for $ 105,000 .
Mrs. Brandon , 51 , does medical billing for doctors ; her husband is a dispatcher for a local gas utility .
Last year , she got a $ 625,500 mortgage from Argent , now owned by Citigroup .
Her 7.99 % interest rate is n't set to rise until next June , but she already is behind on payments .
Over the past five years , she has refinanced her home five times , each time taking out cash and paying prepayment penalties .
Last year , all she had to do to refinance was state that she and her husband earned a combined $ 100,000 .
She says she used the proceeds to pay off $ 30,000 owed on her white Lexus .
This year , she says , their income fell after she suffered a short - term disability .
Mrs. Brandon figures if she sold her home today , she would n't get more than $ 450,000 -- what a nearby home sold for in foreclosure .
She has tried for months to get her loan modified , and missed her June and September payments .
Last month , Damien Gutierrez , a Citi Residential home - retention manager , offered to fix her interest rate at 6 % for 40 years , she says .
One week later , she says , he said he was authorized only to offer her a five - year fixed rate .
Earlier this month , Citigroup offered her a six - month trial at 6 % , saying it would extend the modification to three years if she keeps up with her payments , she says .
Mr. Gutierrez did n't return calls seeking comment .
Here are two letters about the story , aptly billed on the WSJ 's op - ed page under the header , " Who Is to Be Left Holding the Empty Bag ? " :
If I understand correctly , mortgage lenders , urged on by non-profits such as Acorn Housing Corp. , made loans to sub - prime borrowers who had inadequate income to meet their mortgage payments , either from the outset or after the expiration of low initial rates ( " Citigroup Feels Heat to Modify Mortgages , " page one , Nov. 26 ) .
These borrowers were really only qualified to have less pretentious homes or to rent rather own .
Now , after getting the loans and living in homes they were n't qualified to own in the first place , they and the non-profits who encouraged them to do so , assert that the mortgage owners or mortgage servicers , such as Citigroup , should accept a loss and enable these borrowers to live in homes that they cannot afford .
" You loaned me too much money and put me into too good a house ; therefore you should subsidize me so that I can continue living over my head . "
As a shareholder of Citigroup , I am supposed to take the fall ?
The logic and equity of this escape me .
Ebert Weidner
Chagrin Falls , Ohio
The efforts of Acorn amount to a massive redistribution of wealth from those who make sound economic decisions to those who do n't .
It 's difficult to have sympathy for Natalie Brandon , who bought her home in 1985 for $ 105,000 and has managed to borrow her way up to $ 625,000 .
Imagine , instead , if she would have kept her initial 1985 mortgage .
Her payments would be on the order of a few hundred dollars and her house would be nearly paid off .
However , this so - called victim has managed to increase her mortgage debt by a factor of six , and she seeks to force the rest of us to pay for her toys .
Surely her white Lexus had nothing to do with this largess , as the loan officer must have forced her to buy it .
John F. Sevic
Los Gatos , Calif .
Sure , some people fell on hard times , but I 'm mostly reminded of " Leslie , " the girl arguing that the Wirkkalas , with their $ 70,000 in income , their ocean - view , $ 535,000 home , and their THREE children , and the mother who chooses to home - school them rather than work , are " awesome parents " -- despite their failing to be able to cover their kids ' healthcare ( with a $ 450 / month family policy ) .
To me , anyway , the essence of being a parent is digging ditches if you have to -- whatever it takes to avoid burdening your kid with " Hey , kid , whatever you do , do n't fall of that skateboard -- we do n't have health insurance ! "
Likewise , somebody should tell the Granada Hills lady that a Lexus is supposed to be a luxury car ; meaning it's what you buy with all the extra money you have after you pay your mortgage and all the rest , and put away money for your retirement .

Maybe , not being a homeowner myself , I 'm missing something , but what exactly does she want that they have n't offered ?
They offered her a 40 - year fixed , and changed their mind a week later - why 'd she wait the week ?
Then they offered 5 - year fixed , then a 6 - month trial that could be extended for up to 3 years .
What is she holding out for ?
Posted by : jenl1625 at December 3 , 2007 3:48 AM
And what does her age have to do with it ?
I 'm 50 in a few months and have never owned .
I 'd love to buy a house and free myself of landlords forever but my credit 's bad , partly my fault ( stupid decisions when younger and dumber ) and partly bad luck .
If someone offered me a mortgage before I accepted I 'd make damned sure I knew and were prepared for my monthly payments both now and down the road .
One that also that has stopped me from even looking into getting one is knowing that I need to have some cash in the bank in case anything needs fixing in addition to down pays , closing fees , etc .
I have come to accept that I 'll always be a renter which I do n't like as I face retirement because there 's no way of knowing how high rents will climb but I am already investigating places I can move to with lower costs of living and accepting that I may not be able to retire as early as I hoped .
I am doing a lot of research into places with a lower cost of living that I might like .
( I love the internet which allows me to do this fairly easily ! )
Last week , I worked out just how much I have to have in the bank in order to retire before Social Security kicks in or if it goes kaput ( if it does I 'm screwed unless they device someway to return what I paid in which will exceed what I need ) .
I put this in a spread sheet which I can easily update and ties into tracking my actual expenditures on necessities .
( Also love Excel ! )
Frankly , it 's hard to feel sorry for her when she could have had the house all but paid for now if she had n't been greedy .
Lexus ?
Buy a bus pass .
No bus service by your house ?
Buy a Dodge .
And what the hell ?
You have two incomes and you can't make it .
Maybe you could if you did n't view a Lexus ( or two , no mention of what hubby drives ) as a necessity .
And why the hell did n't she take the six month offer ?
Could it be that she counted on the boo - hooing to get her a free ride .
I hate that these days , they wring their hands and cry about screwing themselves and as long as they say some corporation took advantage of them , they get a hand - out !?
Gimme a break .
Rent .
Take the bus .
In short , deal .

Repeat after me : Thirty Year Fixed .
If you cannot afford the payments on a mortgage that meets that description , you have no business buying that much house .
I have to say that it 's refreshing to see the blame being placed where ti really belongs , though - the race pimps and the banks they cowed into doing something colossally stupid : selling big houses to poor people .
There 's a sequence that works - grow up , get educated , rent , get money , buy a house you can afford , pay for it , retire and enjoy .
Now , people think they can skip everything except " get money " and " enjoy " .

I have a theory that the writers of stories must be trying not to create sympathy for the people who have gotten themselves into these problems .
It 's a lot like Dana point family .
The only reason these people can't make their payments is because they acted like fools .
Screw 'em .
Personally , I find these stories encouraging , and I 'm looking forward the housing market being relieved of some of the distortions these mortgages have created .
If this keeps up , it might even make sense to buy here in a year or so .

After I got out of the army I worked as a loan officer .
I wasnt very good , apperently people dont like being told thier plans for ttheir money were stupid .
Thatg being said I have thre comments 1 .
The government encouraged this behavior alon with the industry itself 2 .
That being said people are still responsiblr for their own actions , and most of the people losing their home deserve it
Seriously what kinda moronthinks its sound finacial planning to pay intrest only on a 500,000 dollar loan with a bollon payment at the end of the term 3 .
If lenders do indeed allow those in trouble to refinance in order to ' keep ' their homes they better offer the same deals to those responsible enough to keep their accounts current .
Otherwise they will still wind up out of business from all the lawsuits that will follow

It reminds me of the time when tech stocks were going wild .
I 'm no economist , but I could see there was no there there and stayed out of it .
It 's pretty simple : you do n't get something for nothing , and if you can't afford it , do n't buy it .
I suspect that many people think they can do anything they want because there 's always Social Security to bail them out .
I could be wrong , but that 's my suspicion ... same as having access to welfare dollars contributes to ongoing poverty .

I do wonder if anything can be done to soften the economic blow that is going to ensue when millions of people 's homes are foreclosed upon .
As concerned as I am about people being responsible for their actions , I am more concerned about how screwed I am going to be when I am out of a job because the economy is in the proverbial toilet .

Shinobi -
Anything that the government attempts to do to " soften the blow " will result in my taxes going even higher .
If they go up much further , I wo n't even be able to afford my modest mortgage , and I do n't even have a car payment , much less one on a Lexus .
You want an answer ?
How about taking some cash from the shakedown artist himself , Mr. Jesse Jackson , to cover some of the losses ?

On February 26 2004 , he said , " American consumers might benefit if lenders provide greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed rate mortgage .
To the degree that households are driven by fears of payment shocks but willing to manage their own interest - rate risks , the traditional fixed - rate mortgage may be an expensive method of financing a home . "
-----------------------------------------------
" Edward Gramlich , who was Fed governor from 1997 to 2005 , said he proposed to Mr Greenspan in or around 2000 , when predatory lending was a growing concern , that the Fed use its discretionary authority to send examiners into the offices of consumer - finance lenders that were units of Fed - regulated bank holding companies .
" I would have liked the Fed to be a leader " in cracking down on predatory lending , Mr Gramlich , now a scholar at the Urban Institute , said in an interview this past week .
Knowing it would be controversial with Mr Greenspan , whose deregulatory philosophy is well known , Mr Gramlich broached it to him personally rather than take it to the full board .
" He was opposed to it , so I did n't really pursue it " , says Mr Gramlich .
Still , Mr Greenspan 's views did color the regulatory environment , facilitating growing concentration in banking and a hands - off approach to derivatives and hedge funds .
That approach , broadly shared by both the Clinton and Bush administrations , is coming under increased scrutiny . "

When my wife and I bought a house ten years ago , we bought a small townhouse that we could afford with only one income in case something happened ( good thing , too , since something did happen ) .
Despite steadily increasing incomes , we resisted temptations to buy bigger houses in more posh areas of town , opting instead to incrementally improve our townhouse with upgrades .
I resent being told my tax dollars should go to bailing out people who bought too much house or spent their equity too quickly because they failed to plan ahead and think " what if .... "
I 've also worked in the mortgage industry , so I can tell you that the people buying too much house were not the only greedy ones in this train wreck .
Lenders loaned money based upon stated income ( no verification ) to get more loans in the portfolio .
Brokers encouraged applicants to lie ( or lied themselves ) so they could get a bigger commission .
Non-profits ( ACORN , etc. ) encouraged profligate lunacy in lending so they could over - emphasize their role in getting poor people into housing and get more political influence in local governments ( CRA , DAPs , Silent Seconds , etc. ) .
There is plenty of blame to go around , but the ones being asked to foot the bill in bailing everyone out appears to be the ones who did n't overextend , lie on applications , or phony up a housing crisis ... the rest of us .

> I could see there was no there
> there and stayed out Listen , I do n't want to harsh you on a commonsense point that can be good for people .
You protected yourself as I wish many friends had but did n't , and that 's no small thing when such base human feelings are in play .
But let 's try to kick this up just one level of abstraction higher , which is about half - a - level more than I 'm ready for anyway .
The truth is that nothing , whether it's a collar for your dog or a tech stock for your portfolio , is worth more , or less , that people will pay for it .
As long as the bubble was actually going on , all of those silly companies ( dogcollar.com etc. ) really were worth what people were paying for them .
I think you 're right that the underlying value was sketchy , and the market has validated your skepticism .
And seeing some of those investors become so harshly disappointed ( especially the technically illiterate people ) has been one of the most satisfying things of my life .
I rode the market up and down and came out a little bit ahead ( not a lot ) .
But let 's not pretend we knew what was going on .
In a sophisticated , modern bazaar , you can make money in a falling market as readily as in a growing one .
The trick is to always , always see what 's really going on .
Truly sophisticated people are always invested , one way or the other .
If you 'll forgive the presumption , they are neither me or thee .

This article really hit home .
Here we are in the richest country in the world and many folks , who have so much in their lives , do n't have health insurance for their own children .
And that is with our paychecks supposedly growing .
As we get older , our paychecks will dwindle .
But the sky high premiums do n't alter .
So what are we to do ?
The quality is lowering while the prices are rising .
AARP knows this and they have addressed the problem in the form of an informative website :
http://www.thisissoridiculous.com
where we can also sign a petition to have our voices heard .
I know about this because I am working for AARP on their behalf in this quest for quality health care .
Posted by : Shan at December 3 , 2007 1:40 PM
Is Shan a new name for Spam ?
AARP is not working for " quality healthcare " , they are working for entitlements for old farts who think that after working 30 - 40 years they should coast until they fall off this orb , and that someone else ought to subsidize it if necessary .
Maybe we ought not be retiring at 62 when we live to 102 .
Just a thought .
And people that do n't have health insurance for their children are n't making the proper life choices .
If I see someone driving a car newer than 10 years old complaining that they can't afford something necessary for their kids , well , I have no sympathy .
You are expected to sacrifice the trappings of wealth for yourself in order that you may provide the necessities for your offspring .
To do anything less is to be a failure as a parent .

Here we are in the richest country in the world and many folks , who have so much in their lives , do n't have health insurance for their own children .
Here Shan , let me make your work a little easier for you .
They do n't have health care , yet " have so much in their lives " ?
Tell them to have a little less in their lives , then they can afford healthcare .
Your kid's health comes before your need to watch American Idol on a giant TV the thickness of a sheet of typing paper .

PS I 'm amazed at how many people buy new crap all the time .
I only got a new cell phone because mine was deemed obsolete for Cingular / ATT 's upgraded networks .
It was five years old at the time , and I got a new one free , no contract .
Had it not become obsolete , I would have kept it probably for another three years .

is fighting to keep the three - bedroom ranch house she bought in 1985 for $ 105,000 .
Mrs. Brandon , 51 , does medical billing for doctors ; her husband is a dispatcher for a local gas utility .
Last year , she got a $ 625,500 mortgage from Argent , now owned by Citigroup .
Her 7.99 % interest rate is n't set to rise until next June , but she already is behind on payments .
Am I reading this right ?
A house she bought in 85 for $ 105 appreciated in a major way and rather than pay off her $ 105 loan ( we do n't know the terms , but say a 30 year , she was 20 years into it ) she CHOSE to take out a bunch of appreciated equity to buy crap ?
And now wants to crybaby she might loose her house ?

I am appalled that someone from the government did n't step in years ago to stop this woman from continually re-financing her home .
If Hillary were president , this would never happen , and she 'll " take things from you for your own good , " such as the ability to sign or loans you can't afford .
No one ever had any financial problems until Bush became President .
It 's all his fault .

It used to be that Americans thought of government as something to enable them to maximize their freedom to make choices .
Now we seem to think that government is something to protect us from the consequences of our choices .

What 's the old saying about gambling :
Bet with your head , not over it ?
When you borrow more money than you can possibly pay back , you are betting against the house ( literally , in this case ) .
And you 'll never beat those odds .
Unfortunately , the banks and federal government are probably going to have to offer these bad adders some relief or else their bad behavior will have disastrous effects on the economy for all of us .

Thank you for this , I am a regular Wall Street Journal reader and subscriber and I missed it ( Rule 605 for why to read blogs -- because by so doing you will see stuff you should have already noticed elsewhere ) .
The hard part about this crisis is what is the profile of the average " borrower . "
I think it varies considerably .
Not all are like this woman .
I also agree that the responsibility needs to be shared , as in this instance the borrower is clearly the main reason things have gone awry .
But somehow the industry has to do better too-- they have been around a long time and we have never had something quite like this .
See for example this video report where the lender , not the borrower , is the primary culprit : http://www.kendallharmon.net/t19/index.php/t19/article/8090/

I agree Amy .
I got a cellphone in 2001 and am still using it .
It cost $ 50 and today would probably qualify as ' ruggedized ' and cost $ 200 .
My TV is a 17 year old 19 " sears off brand .
My Car is a 1999 Honda .
I will say that now when I do buy something new I make sure it is high quality because I know that I will have it for many , many years .

I recently moved to Florida with my fiance to teach Middle School .
We are a two - income family so far , but on a teacher 's salary and an executive assistant - we ain't talking 6 figures .
I teach an evening course two times a week and have taken on an extra class during my planning to bring our student 's test numbers up .
We are planning a wedding , paying student loans , pairing down credit card debt , financing two cars and I am taking two courses for certification for the State and for a Gifted endorsement .
Between the two of us we can save about 1200 a month to sock away and pay for the above .
If we can deny ourselves simple luxuries , scrimp , save , and make wise decisions now , then getting a house and starting a family should be no problem .
All it takes is some realistic planning and some extra work .
I 'm no saint - we sometimes buy good cheese as opposed to kraft singles - but savings are out there .
The families and sob stories I am hearing about recently make me sick !
When did personal responsibility go out the window ?
When did consequences for actions leave the scene .
I smoked for 16 years until quitting recently - I know that those 16 years will cost me when I get life insurance .
That 's the price you pay .
I 'm sorry that they are in the jam they are - but they dug their own hole .
I promise I will fight tooth and nail to make sure that I and other like minded responsible people do not have to pay for it .

Well done !
In a country of half a billion you managed to find the most extreme example of financial folly .
Now you can perfectly justify throwing the poor out of their homes for your profit .
" Do n't you see ?
The poor are the selfish ones , they deserve to lose their homes !
In fact they are criminals for trying to steal my profits from me " .
Either that , or they deserve ruination because they are genetically inferior due to their IQ scores , or their inability to parse a predatory loan agreement .
Something like that .
Fortunately , the USA will remember she is built on Christian morality ( silly things like compassion and mercy , and not stomping on the underdog and treating us all like serfs ) , and not on the barbaric philosophies of your kind .
Posted by : Kip Watson at December 3 , 2007 3:13 PM
The truth is that nothing , whether it's a collar for your dog or a tech stock for your portfolio , is worth more , or less , that people will pay for it .
As long as the bubble was actually going on , all of those silly companies ( dogcollar.com etc. ) really were worth what people were paying for them .
I do n't agree with this .
Although " what something is worth " and " what people are willing to pay " are drawn from the same picture , the former is the time - average value ( a trend line ) , while the latter is an instantantaneous value ( which may lie above or below the trend line ) .
The former tells us what the productive value or equity is in something on the basis that time has proven that value to be stable .
The latter creates the former as time progresses , but for brief periods it can fluctuate wildly in response to less - rational impulses .
When the instantaneous value is very high compared to the time - average value , then yes , anybody owning " something " can get that high instantaneous price by selling it right now -- but they should have no expectation of getting more than the time - average price as a correction is likely in the future .
In fact , as the correction occurs , the value may be less than the average for a short time .
A bubble occurs when people either forget this entirely and start looking at the instantaneous value as the only metric of value ( tomorrow never arrives ) , or else know that a correction must occur eventually , but subscribe to the Greater Fool theory ( someone else will arrive before tomorrow ) .

Growing up , my mom taught me that the only good interest was interest I was getting .
My husband and I determined we would pay off the loan on our small two - bedroom home as quickly as possible , and sank every extra penny into paying of that mortgage ( 10 % interest at the time ) .
Any raise in income that we got went toward upping our payment , not our lifestyle .
We payed it off in 11 years .
Property values being what they are , the house is now worth ten times what we payed for it , and is a clear retirement asset .
After the payoff , when we could have moved on to a new mortgage at will , rather than choosing to upgrade to a more expensive home , we have taken the money that would be going to the bank were we still in debt , and added a master suite , and a lot of toys - all debt free thanks to all that interest we 're NOT paying a creditor every month .
When we started we had one job between the two of us , and it only earned my husband $ 9 an hour , and yes , we had to tighten our belts a good deal to get by some of the time .
There were some very difficult financial periods , but we believed that financial freedom was incredibly important .
Still do , now that we 've got it .
All this to say , barring extraordinary circumstances , if we did it , and did n't play the refinance - your - lifestyle game , so can most other Americans , if they 're willing .
It 's a question of priorities , not victimization .

Kip , while I generally disagree with your sentiment ( Christian morality means that people should not face the consequences of their greed ?
I 'm really curious where that comes from . ) , there 's a particular point that you have wrong .
Maybe where you live , people are n't greedy fools , or they 're just of below - average intelligence .
Where I live , however , educated people whose intelligence qualifies them for white collar jobs , did exactly what this " extreme " example did .
A LOT of them .
I wish this WAS a one - in - a - million case .
And no they DON'T deserve to have the government steal the money from the prudent and modest , and give it to them .
But really , since when have gluttony , greed , sloth , envy , and pride had anything to do with what are called " Christian virtues " ?!?
Posted by : Barry at December 3 , 2007 3:44 PM
If you have a $ 625,000 mortgage on a $ 450,000 house , walk away .
Only an idiot pays $ 625 k for something with a fair market value of $ 450 k .
Your credit rating takes a hit , but you can put a dollar value on that hit , and it ai n't $ 175,000 .

" In a country of half a billion you managed to find the most extreme example of financial folly . " .... Does this represent the extreme , or the mean ?
One can suppose that those whom perpetrate this kind of folly have , previously , perpetrated similar calamities .
Creatures of habit tend to maintain their habits .
" Now you can perfectly justify throwing the poor out of their homes for your profit " ... No one has suggested punishing the poor , just that the stupid , foolish , and greedy should n't be rewarded .
I 've no problem helping those whose fortunes are not advantagious , but , I 'm damned tired of supporting the won'ts .
Those whom wo n't do for themselves .
" Either that , or they deserve ruination because they are genetically inferior due to their IQ scores " .... you feel that the poor are stupid or genetically inferior ?
Rather presumptuous is n't that ?
I do n't know that anyone has suggested that the poor are stupid , but , blindly stumbling into any situation without advice or support is foolish .
What advice and / or support has been offered by Acorn etal , short of crying for " government help " , any aid of a monetary nature ?
Advice of a professional sort ?
" Fortunately , the USA will remember she is built on Christian morality ( silly things like compassion and mercy " ..... and personal responsibility , taking care of ones self , standing on ones own two feet , accepting the consequences of ones decisions and choices .
Instead of expecting a bailout by those whom have and do choose and live responsibly .
This topic is particularly irksome to me .
I recently paid off my mortgage , early after a refi .
Paid for with the efforts that I made , no handouts , no special renegotiations , no government bailout .
Paid for with my earnings while supporting my family and paying my way .
Is it so onerous , so unjust to expect that everyone else do the same ?
Is it unfair to believe that those whom borrow and sign contracts , abide by those documents and meet their obligations ?
Is that so uncharitable ?
I have no problem helping someone over a rough patch , and I do , I have no problem helping those in a tough situation .
But , most of those paraded in front of the cameras and in the media to illustrate the " dire situation " in the housing market , or those unable to afford healthcare seem to be victims not of unscrupulous lenders , or greedy insurance companies , but , of incredible stupidity and an unwillingness to take responsibility for themselves , their families , and their choices .
These people do n't need to be bailed out or aided , they need a good swift kick in the ass !!
I am tired of supporting the won'ts !!

Investors at Citicorp and Countrywide etc. hire a pack of fools to run their business .
Consequently , they 're going to take a bath .
But both institutions will likely survive , if only after Countrywide goes through a receivership .
The banks will foreclose and sell the distressed assets at fire sale prices .
Many renters , in the market for a cheaper home , will purchase the foreclosed properties , and will qualify due to the reduced prices in a distressed market .
The fools who signed up to buy homes they cannot afford will take over the apartments of the new homeowners .
The improvident investors and greedy homeowners will have had a learning experience , and probably wo n't repeat their bad decisions .
I do n't recall the Federal mandate , in the Constitution 's enumerated powers , allowing the Feds to bail out anybody .
They should stay out of it and let the lesson be learned .
If the investors choose to allow refinancing , good , but it should be because the terms will mitigate their loss .

Posted by : Kip Watson at December 3 , 2007 4:08 PM
Ms. Brandon ( the Lexus driving woman in the WSJ story ) is probably not a typical example .
And the plural of anecdote is NOT data .
The WSJ story is clearly trying to highlight a particular moral hazard in light of a possible bailout by using her as an example .
That 's okay as far as it goes .
However , there are other aspects to this story that also might be important : ( 1 ) Home - ownership is at an all time high .
The sub - prime market probably helped with that .
An ownership society ( where the vast majority own real assets such as stocks and homes ) potentially has many advantages such as stability .
( 2 ) Foreclosures happen all the time .
Generally , nobody really cares and nobody bails anybody out ( other than the fact that sometimes lenders are willing to renegotiate the terms a bit in order to save themselves the cost of foreclosing ) .
There 's really no reason to bail anybody out now either .
( 3 ) Financial crises do n't necessarily have to impact the economy very much .
The houses will remain standing whether or not they are foreclosed and whether or not there is a bailout .
( 4 ) The Fed cutting rates is NOT a bailout - they 're maintaining liquidity ( for other sectors ) like they 're supposed to .
Eventually , they 'll probably have to raise rates in order to compensate for the lowered rates now , but that 's okay .

@ Amy Alkon " I do wonder if anything can be done to soften the economic blow that is going to ensue when millions of people 's homes are foreclosed upon . "
I 'm waiting for it , I can't wait for it to happen .
There are plenty of people like me with a decent income but no opportunity to buy a house until this over - inflated price bubble breaks .
I did n't expect it to fully happen until the boomers start selling their homes and moving to retirement communities , but this is great news for those of us making $ 50 K per year and are renters .
I live in Portland , OR and watched the speculators and " home equity " morons like this drive home prices out of reach for the average wage earner here .
It 's high time for those prices with no real backing to come crashing down .

Yes , foreclosures happen all the time , but a record percent of mortgages are in default .
That 's what has everyone freaked .
Since Bush took office we have had a record number of personal bankruptcies set in multiple years , a record number of mortgages in default , a record number of credit cards in default .
I guess it 's OK for our government to rack up red ink hand over fist , but try doing it on your own .
Posted by : Jordan Lund at December 3 , 2007 4:51 PM
Amen to what jordanlund said .
I recently got my first apartment .
Even though the criteria was that the rent could amount to no more than 30 % of my gross income ( that 's before taxes ) I certainly did n't get an apartment anywhere near that number .
I figured what my net income was per year , divided by 12 , and took 30 percent of that number .
That is what I can afford , after taxes .
The escalation in housing prices was out - of - control .
Even in this area ( Chicago burbs ) , the house I grew up in , when my parents bought it in the 70s , they could afford it on just my dad 's income , which was slightly above entry level .
I 'm quite a bit above entry level income , and I could n't afford to buy the house I grew up in because of the inflated housing costs .
Posted by : Tony at December 3 , 2007 5:09 PM
Kip -
I think you had one too many bowls of ' Idiot Flakes ' for breakfast .
The vast majority of people who got these sub - prime mortgages are people who should not have been given them in the first place .
That they were unwilling or unable to handle that reality is not my problem .
It has nothing to do with what color or intellect they possess , simply that they thought that they could violate the rules of economics and win .
Jordan -
What happened right around the time that Bush took office ?
Oh , yeah - the Dot Bomb went off , and all those high - flying 22 - year - old millionaires were suddenly broke , and had no way to pay for the million dollar condo , the Ferrari , the hookers , and the cocaine .
Hence , bankruptcy .
The realtors seem to have figured that the Dot Bomb was such a hit that they should try it in real estate .
The results were just as predictable .
I called it three years ago .
It seems I got in to the market a few years early , as I was expecting the crash later than it happened .
Oh , well .
I bought a house I can afford .
You wo n't see me in the foreclosure statistics .

Posted by : Jeff at December 3 , 2007 5:20 PM
Jeff -
In case you missed the train - the government was pressuring the banks to make more loans to certain ' protected ' groups , at the urging of special interests like ACORN .
This is what happens when group identity politics runs into reality .
Reality wins every time .
If ACORN would focus on improving the creditworthiness of those they claim to represent , instead of demanding that government make businesses do things that violate the laws of economics , then we would n't have this problem .
But , if they did that , then they 'd all be out of jobs , because there would n't be any more victims for them to exploit .
Posted by : brian at December 3 , 2007 5:26 PM
Maybe I had an advantage growing up poor and hating debt .
We refinanced to put an addition on the house , and dropped down to a 15 - yr. fixed .
That way , we had only one more year of payments when our oldest child went to college .
We still do n't have a Lexus .
I can't imagine wanting one so badly as to court financial ruin .
On the other hand , our kids wo n't have student loans .
Posted by : Mitch at December 3 , 2007 5:34 PM
Kip , I did n't start agreeing today .
I 've been watching this unfold for a good number of years , and I have n't changed my opinion .
" Greedy serfs " who refinance their homes to buy dune buggies , boats , campers , luxury cars and jewelry is what I 've seen .
Surely , there are some people who just tried to get a home for their families .
However , like I said , if you believe that the example is " extreme " , you do n't live around here .
It does n't matter how strong your emotions are ; they do n't change the reality I 've watched for a good long time .

She 's not going to be able to ' walk away ' .
Certainly not with the lexus too .
Even if her house is foreclosed on , she will be sued for the difference .
Yes she could file for bankruptcy , but she 's still going to need to spend down some assets .
What did she BUY over those 5 years with the 625k ?
She could probably negotiate a short sale , but then maybe not .

I 'm just wondering where Kip got the idea that the family in the WSJ story was African American .
I read the article in the original print version , and I do n't recall a picture of her or any description of her ethnic background .
I believe Kip is projecting to a ) fit his picture of the " serfs , " and b ) to fit his picture of the " real- estate - banking - industrial - complex . "
Kip also probably believes that members of said class dress like the guy on the Monopoly box , with top hat , spats , etc .
Posted by : Percy Dovetonsils at December 3 , 2007 6:02 PM
BTW Kip , if you think I 'm at all wealthy , think again .
But while some were refinancing houses near me to buy toys they could n't really afford , and others were using these wacko new loans so they could " afford " a beach house , we bought a modest townhome because we could afford the payments on a 30 year fixed mortgage .
Hell , the interest rate was 5.5 % .
It was n't going to go any lower , but people still got ARM's .
Our incomes were the same as the rest .
We just chose differently , and I 'll be good and goddamned if I want to pay the price for their prodigal lifestyles .
That 's here in San Diego .
Again , it may be different in other places .
But if you think that the example above is some extreme case , you 're dead wrong .

That Lexus Lady re-fied last year and paid 7.99 % tells you she was already in trouble .
Thirty year fixed rate loans could be had for around 6 % if your credit was decent .
To pay two percent over that means hers was n't , and that 's nobody 's fault but hers .
She should never have bought the Lexus , or had the sense to sell it the first month she could n't pay for the roof over her head .
I drive a seven year old F150 I plan to keep til the wheels fall off and pay an extra $ 300 each month toward the principal on my mortgage .
My big splurge this year was to put a hardwood floor in the den , cost $ 750.00 for materials , oh , and a bottle of generic pain - killer since my knees are n't what they used to be .
I like it enough to be making plans to do the living and dinning rooms after Christmas .
If that sounds so financially responsible as to be utterly boring , I bought an iPhone when they came out in June , for no better reason than because I wanted one , but if I lost my job tomorrow I have enough in liquid assets to meet expenses for a year .
I blame my father for all this because he was self - employed when I was a kid and taught by example how to manage money .

The story says " In Granada Hills , Calif. , Natalie Brandon , " it does n't say , " Natalie Branden , who is a black lady . "
I do n't own my own home .
I live in Southern California , one of the priciest housing markets in the country .
Am I somehow a groovier person if , instead of renting , which is within my means , I get a loan with a rate that will skyrocket in a few years , driving me into bankruptcy ?
Oh yeah , and then , do n't forget this is a woman who does " medical billing for doctors . "
I 'm guessing this is a job that does n't exactly pay six figures .
Actually , just looked it up : http://www.total-medical-coding.com/

Speaking as a mortgage broker that deals with these people all the time , I can answer this question for you :
She is shopping around for another broker or lender that will also toss her a $ 25,000 cash - out snack so she can get her new plasma television and pay her boat docking fee for another year .
It 's just taking awhile to sink in that she 's drained the well dry , there are no more free goodies waiting for the poor , put - upon homeowner that was abused by the big bad mortgage broker .
Posted by : John at December 3 , 2007 6:57 PM
If she now has a mortgage for 650 k , even discounting for early payment penalties , it would mean that she has taken out around 400 k since 1985 in cash .
What stuff has she bought and what does she have left to show for it ?
This is the issue here .
Our culture believes in spending money before we earn it .
This may be an extreme example , but I see the same thing happening day after day .
I own a CPA firm and too many people do just what she did , although not to her extent .
Her parent 's generation did not have so many opportunities to waste money as do the baby boomers .
My view is that the boomers will go down as the worst financial group in history .
The only thing that most boomers have going for them is that eventually their parents will die .
Then they will have what Mom & Dad have saved .
The problem is for the next generation , there will be nothing left .

It 's not that I or the other readers here who are unhappy about the contemplation of bailing out distressed homeowners are heartless bastards who want them to suffer .
But as someone living in San Francisco , who 's looking at anything in the city limits costing 500 k +
( that 's for a 1 bed loft place or similar in an up - and - coming area ) , I 'm ready to to see this mess getting sorted out .
For that to happen , some folks have to lose their homes .
It sucks but it 's true .
I feel sorry for them , but they can rent - it wo n't kill them .
Meanwhile , a bailout screws over taxpayers or investors ( or both ) as well as people who want to purchase responsibly .

Own their homes ?
With 110 % LTV , option only ARMS , no income verification , the majority of these folks never owned a sliver of the house they inhabit .
Spend your first 15 working years living like a monk ( or nun ) , invest every dollar , drive only used cars , go out to dinner once / quarter , and you will find yourself with a very tidy down payment on a reasonable house .

There is room for special consideration for those who of low income who have been caught in this subprime situation .
However , the lady in question certianly could afford to continue living in her home had she elected not to borrow against the equity or , had she wisely invested the monies that she borrowed .
Her 's is not a case of having been bamboozled by unethical lenders .
Her 's is a case of greed .

Exactly , Walter .
I 've worn out two heavy duty shredders getting rid of new credit card offers , home equity line of credit offers , re-fi offers , etc .
I have credit cards , which I keep paid off .
My only foray into re-fi was another 30 - year fixed , for a lower rate , for only the remaining amount on the mortgage .
These people were looking to get something for nothing , with predictable results .

Oh , and Kipper ( what a red herring you are ) , I defy you to show me a single Bible verse that commands me to be charitable to fools who waste their substance .
Remember the parable of the talents ?
Those who were prudent with the money they oversaw and made more were the ones rewarded .

I used to live in San Jose in an 800 - square - foot apartment .
When we were in our early 30s , my wife and I decided to have kids , and there was no way we could afford the space we wanted --- unless we took out one of those new wicky - wacky loans .
We decided it was too risky and moved to a cheaper area : LA .
In LA , we bought a 50 - year - old fixer - upper in a marginal neighborhood on a 3 - year ARM .
Again , after a year or so we decided it was too risky and refinanced to a 30 - year fixed .
The refi cost us about ten grand to close .
It now looks like the move and the refi were unnecessary , because Uncle Sam would have bailed us out if we 'd defaulted .
Lesson :
The government will always make others pay for your bad decisions .
The next logical target will be credit card companies .
So I would recommend getting as many credit cards as you can , and charge all your necessities , like food , doctor bills and tuition to them .
That will leave plenty of spending money for the good things in life we all so richly deserve , like a Hummer with a couple of TVs in it .
Uncle Sucker will never let those mean old banks go after your assets , when you 've been so cruelly forced to charge Junior 's braces .

Remember , you can sleep in your car , but you can't drive your house .
As always , it 's the working stiffs who end up paying for the government 's largess .
Taxpayers should realize that politicians are only interested in holding on to power .
FDR learned in the 30's that the more dependent you make the people , the easier it is to hold on to power .
Try reforming Social Security and you have to tangle with the AARP and soon to be 80,000,000 retired baby boomers ( me included ) .
I wo n't join the AARP because they opposed Pres .
Bush 's Social Security reform and are likely to oppose any meaningful reform in the future .
So everyone can continue to get their $ 1,400 per month and " free " healthcare until the our country goes bankrupt .
Meaningful reform is too painful ( at the voting booth ) for any politician to propose .
It 's easier to continue to give away the pork and get re-elected .
If our parents were " The Greatest Generation " , then we are the " Worst Generation " .
We led the way to our nation 's decline with our hedonistic ways of the 60's and 70's , protested everything our parents wanted for us ( except material things ) extended our childhood until we were 30 , and took over the universities to teach the useless mantras being force fed to Generation Xers today , i.e. multiculturalism , global warming , and other worthless crap .
And if you think it 's bad now , wait until they swear in Hillary in January 2009 .

I 'm a fiscal conservative , and have the silly notion that you do n't spend money that you do n't have -- as a person or as a country .
By the way , neither party is the party of small government .
The Republicans just make more gestures in that direction .

This whole situation reminds me of the people who live in flood prone areas who do n't buy flood insurance ( N'Orleans , anyone ? ) and expect the government to bail out their folly after the flood .

We took out a subprime ARM just over two years ago .
We had to move for my husband 's job , and rents in the area were about the same as house payments .
The housing bubble had n't hit our area yet .
We had just gone into credit counseling as part of a long - term plan to get out of debt and improve our credit score to the point where we could afford a house in a few years , so we did n't qualify for a traditional mortgage .
But we knew ( because it was disclosed to us ) that the payment would be going up in 2 years , and so we had a plan .
We saved up money for closing costs despite a difficult pregnancy , spotty work for me , and some reversals in my home - based business , and we refinanced into a fixed - rate mortgage .
Our home had appreciated so much that we got some cash out to pay off what was left of our credit card debt , and even bought a new used car for my husband to commute to work in ( now he has a car with heat ! )
The subprime loan was a good decision for us , BUT it only worked because ( a ) we bought in an area where housing prices were not overinflated , ( b ) we had an exit strategy .
Nobody told us we needed an exit strategy , though ; perhaps there would be fewer subprime mortgages if the homeowners had been informed that they needed an exit strategy .

JordanLund , Portland is too expensive for you because of the local urban planners .
The building and zoning codes there ( called " anti- sprawl " rules ) make it impossible to build affordable housing for those who are not wealthy .
If you want to be out of an apartment , change the regional government .
Your problem is not Washington .

Alair is wearing a tight white tank top cut off above the hem to show her midriff .
Her black cargo pants graze the top of her combat boots , and her black leather belt is studded with metal chains that drape down at intervals across her hips .
She has long blonde curls that at various times have been dyed green , blue , red , purple , and orange .
( “ A mistake , ” she says .
“ Even if you mean to dye your hair orange , it ’s still a mistake . ” )
Despite the fact that she ’s fully clothed , she seems somehow exposed , her baby fat lingering in all the right places .
Walking down the sterile , white halls of Stuyvesant High School , she creates a wave of attention .
She ’s not the most popular girl in school , but she is well known .
“ People like me , ” she wrote in an instant message .
“ Well , most of them . ”
Alair is headed for the section of the second - floor hallway where her friends gather every day during their free tenth period for the “ cuddle puddle , ” as she calls it .
There are girls petting girls and girls petting guys and guys petting guys .
She dives into the undulating heap of backpacks and blue jeans and emerges between her two best friends , Jane and Elle , whose names have been changed at their request .
They are all 16 , juniors at Stuyvesant .
Alair slips into Jane ’s lap , and Elle reclines next to them , watching , cat -eyed .
All three have hooked up with each other .
All three have hooked up with boys — sometimes the same boys .
But it ’s not that they ’re gay or bisexual , not exactly .
Not always .
Their friend Nathan , a senior with John Lennon hair and glasses , is there with his guitar , strumming softly under the conversation .
“ So many of the girls here are lesbian or have experimented or are confused , ” he says .
Ilia , another senior boy , frowns at Nathan ’s use of labels .
“ It ’s not lesbian or bisexual .
It ’s just , whatever … ”
Since the school day is winding down , things in the hallway are starting to get rowdy .
Jane disappears for a while and comes back carrying a pint - size girl over her shoulder .
“ Now I take her off and we have gay sex ! ” she says gleefully , as she parades back and forth in front of the cuddle puddle .
“ And it ’s awesome ! ”
The hijacked girl hangs limply , a smile creeping to her lips .
Ilia has stuffed papers up the front of his shirt and prances around on tiptoe , batting his eyes and sticking out his chest .
Elle is watching , enthralled , as two boys lock lips across the hall .
“ Oh , my , ” she murmurs .
“ Homoerotica .
There ’s nothing more exciting than watching two men make out . ”
And everyone is talking to another girl in the puddle who just “ came out , ” meaning she announced that she ’s now open to sexual overtures from both boys and girls , which makes her a minor celebrity , for a little while .
When asked how many of her female friends have had same - sex experiences , Alair answers , “ All of them . ”
Then she stops to think about it .
“ All right , maybe 80 percent .
At least 80 percent of them have experimented .
And they still are .
It ’s either to please a man , or to try it out , or just to be fun , or ’ cause you ’re bored , or just ’ cause you like it … whatever . ”
With teenagers there is always a fair amount of posturing when it comes to sex , a tendency to exaggerate or trivialize , innocence mixed with swagger .
It ’s also true that the “ puddle ” is just one clique at Stuyvesant , and that Stuyvesant can hardly be considered a typical high school .
It attracts the brightest public - school students in New York , and that may be an environment conducive to fewer sexual inhibitions .
“ In our school , ” Elle says , “ people are getting a better education , so they ’re more open - minded . ”
That said , the Stuyvesant cuddle puddle is emblematic of the changing landscape of high - school sexuality across the country .
This past September , when the National Center for Health Statistics released its first survey in which teens were questioned about their sexual behavior , 11 percent of American girls polled in the 15 - to - 19 demographic claimed to have had same - sex encounters — the same percentage of all women ages 15 to 44 who reported same - sex experiences , even though the teenagers have much shorter sexual histories .
It does n’t take a Stuyvesant education to see what this means :
More girls are experimenting with each other , and they ’re starting younger .
And this is a conservative estimate , according to Ritch Savin - Williams , a professor of human development at Cornell who has been conducting research on same - sex - attracted adolescents for over twenty years .
Depending on how you phrase the questions and how you define sex between women , he believes that “ it ’s possible to get up to 20 percent of teenage girls . ”

Of course , what ca n’t be expressed in statistical terms is how teenagers think about their same - sex interactions .
Go to the schools , talk to the kids , and you ’ll see that somewhere along the line this generation has started to conceive of sexuality differently .
Ten years ago in the halls of Stuyvesant you might have found a few goth girls kissing goth girls , kids on the fringes defiantly bucking the system .
Now you find a group of vaguely progressive but generally mainstream kids for whom same - sex intimacy is standard operating procedure .
“ It ’s not like , Oh , I ’m going to hit on her now .
It ’s just kind of like , you come up to a friend , you grab their ass , ” Alair explains .
“ It ’s just , like , our way of saying hello . ”
These teenagers do n’t feel as though their sexuality has to define them , or that they have to define it , which has led some psychologists and child - development specialists to label them the “ post - gay ” generation .
But kids like Alair and her friends are in the process of working up their own language to describe their behavior .
Along with gay , straight , and bisexual , they ’ll drop in new words , some of which they ’ve coined themselves : polysexual , ambisexual , pansexual , pansensual , polyfide , bi-curious , bi-queer , fluid , metroflexible , heteroflexible , heterosexual with lesbian tendencies — or , as Alair puts it , “ just sexual . ”
The terms are designed less to achieve specificity than to leave all options open .
To some it may sound like a sexual Utopia , where labels have been banned and traditional gender roles surpassed , but it ’s a complicated place to be .
Anyone who has ever been a girl in high school knows the vicissitudes of female friendships .
Add to that a sexual component and , well , things get interesting .
Take Alair and her friend Jane , for example .
“ We ’ve been dancing around each other for , like , three years now , ” says Alair .
“ I ’d hop into bed with her in a second . ”
Jane is tall and curvy with green eyes and faint dimples .
She thinks Alair is “ amazing , ” but she ’s already had a female friendship ruined when it turned into a romantic relationship , so she ’s reluctant to let it happen again .
Still , they pet each other in the hall , flirt , kiss , but that ’s it , so far .
“ Alair , ” Jane explains , “ is literally in love with everyone and in love with no one . ”
Relationships are a bitch , dude . ”
Alair is having lunch with Jane , Elle , and their friend Nathan at a little Indian place near Jane ’s Upper West Side apartment .
Jane has been telling the story of her first lesbian relationship :
She fell for a girl who got arrested while protesting the Republican National Convention ( very cool ) , but the girl stopped calling after they spent the night together ( very uncool ) .
“ We should all be single for the rest of our lives , ” Alair continues .
“ And we should all have sugar daddies . ”
As the only child of divorced parents , Alair learned early that love does n’t always end in happily ever after and that sex does n’t always end in love .
Nathan looks across the table at her and nods knowingly .
He recently broke up with a girl he still ca n’t get off his mind , even though he was n’t entirely faithful when they were together .
“ I agree .
I wholeheartedly agree , ” he says .
“ I disagree , ” says Elle , alarmed .
She ’s the romantic of the group , a bit naïve , if you ask the others .
“ Well , ” says Nathan .
“ You ’re , like , the only one in a happy relationship right now , so … ”
Alair cracks up .
“ Happy ?
Her man is gayer than I am ! ” ( Jane , the sarcastic one , has a joke about this boy : “ He ’s got one finger left in the closet , and it ’s in Elle , depending on what time it is . ” )
“ But at least she ’s happy , ” argues Nathan .
“ When I ’m single , I say I ’m happy I ’m single , and when I ’m in a relationship I seem happy in the relationship .
Really , I ’m filled with angst ! ” says Elle .
Nathan rolls his eyes .
“ Anyone who says they ’re filled with angst is definitely not filled with angst . ”
He ’s got a point .
In her brand - new sneakers and her sparkly barrettes , Elle is hardly a poster child for teenage anxiety .
She makes A’s at Stuyvesant , babysits her cousins , and is engaging in a way that will go over well in college interviews .
Then again , none of them are bad kids .
Sure , they drink and smoke and party , but in a couple of years , they ’ll be drinking and smoking and partying at Princeton or MIT .
They had to be pretty serious students to even get into Stuyvesant , which accepts only about 3 percent of its applicants .
And when they ’re not studying , they ’re going to music lessons , SAT prep , debate practice , Japanese class , theater rehearsal , or some other résumé - building extracurricular activity .

Their sexual behavior is by no means the norm at their school ; Stuyvesant has some 3,000 students , and Alair ’s group numbers a couple dozen .
But they ’re also not the only kids at school who experiment with members of the same sex .
“ Other people do it , too , ” said a junior who ’s part of a more popular crowd .
“ They get drunk and want to be a sex object .
But that ’s different .
Those people are n’t bisexual . ”
Alair and her friends , on the other hand , are known as the “ bi clique . ”
In the social strata , they ’re closer to the cool kids than to the nerds .
The boys have shaggy hair and T - shirts emblazoned with the names of sixties rockers .
The girls are pretty and clever and extroverted .
Some kids think they ’re too promiscuous .
One student - union leader told me , “ It ’s weird .
It ’s just sort of incestuous . ”
But others admire them .
Alair in particular is seen as a kind of punk - rock queen bee .
“ She ’s good - looking , and she does what she wants , ” said a senior boy .
“ That ’s an attractive quality . ”
“ The interesting kids kind of gravitate towards each other , ” Elle had explained earlier .
“ A lot of them are heteroflexible or bisexual or gay .
And what happens is , like , we ’re all just really comfortable around each other . ”
Still , among her friends , Elle ’s ideas are the most traditional .
Her first kiss with a girl was at Hebrew school .
Since then , she ’s made out with girls frequently but dated only guys .
“ I ’ve always been the marrying type , ” she says to the table .
“ Not just ’ cause it ’s been forced on me , but ’ cause it ’s a good idea .
I really want to have kids when I grow up . ”
“ Have mine , ” offers Alair .
“ My mom ’s like , ‘ I do n’t understand you .
I want to be a parent to you , but I have no control at all . ’ ”
“ I will , ” Elle coos in her best sultry voice .
“ Anything for you , Alair . ”
Jane blinks quickly , something she has a habit of doing when she ’s gathering her thoughts .
“ They will probably have the technology by the time we grow up that you two could have a baby together . ”
“ But , like , if Alair does n’t want to birth her own child , I could . ”
“ I ’ll birth it , ” Alair says , sighing .
“ I just want you to raise it and pay for it and take care of it and never tell it that I ’m its parent .
’ Cause , I mean , that would scar a child for life .
Like , the child would start convulsing . ”
Everyone laughs .
“ You ’d be an awesome mom , I think , ” says Elle .
Her own mom puts a lot of pressure on her to date a nice Jewish boy .
Once , Elle asked her , “ ‘ Mom , what if I have these feelings for girls ? ’ and she said , ‘ Do you have feelings for boys too ? ’
I ’m like , ‘ Yeah . ’
And she ’s like , ‘ Then you have to ignore the ones you have for girls .
If you can be straight , you have to be straight . ’ ” Elle asked to go by a nickname because she has n’t told her mother that she ’s not ignoring those feelings .
Even as cultural acceptance of gay and bisexual teenagers grows , these kids are coming up against an uncomfortable generational divide .
In many of their families , the ‘ It ’s fine , as long as it ’s not my kid ’ attitude prevails .
Some of the parents take comfort in the belief that this is just a phase their daughters will grow out of .
Others take more drastic measures .
Earlier this year at Horace Mann , when one girl ’s parents found out that she was having a relationship with another girl , they searched her room , confiscated her love letters , and even had the phone company send them transcripts of all her text messages .
Then they informed her girlfriend ’s parents .
In the end , the girls were forbidden to see each other outside school .
Even Jane , whose parents know about her bisexuality and are particularly well suited to understanding it ( her mother teaches a college course in human sexuality ) , has run up against the limits of their liberal attitudes .
They requested that she go by her middle name in this story .
“ My mom thinks I ’m going to grow up and be ashamed of my sexuality , ” she says .
“ But I wo n’t . ”
To these kids , homophobia is as socially shunned as racism was to the generation before them .
They say it ’s practically the one thing that ’s not tolerated at their school .
One boy who made disparaging remarks about gay people has been ridiculed and taunted , his belongings hidden around the school .
“ We ’re a creative bunch when we hate someone , ” says Nathan .
Once the tormenters , now the tormented .
Alair is one of the lucky ones whose parents do n’t mind her bisexual tendencies .
Her dad is the president of a company that manages performance artists and her mom is a professional organizer .
“ My parents are awesome , ” she says .
“ I think they ’ve tried to raise me slightly quirky , like in a very hippie little way , and it totally backfired on them . ”
“ ’ Cause you ended up like a hippie ? ” Nathan asks .
“ No , ’cause I went further than I think they wanted me to go . ”
Despite the bravado , there ’s a sweetness to Alair .
She sings in the Trinity Children ’s Choir .
She does the dishes without being asked .
She ’s a daddy ’s girl and her mother ’s confidante , though she has n’t always managed to skirt trouble away from home .
She got kicked out of her middle school , Columbia Prep , after getting into an altercation with a girl who had been making her life miserable .
( “ I threw a bagel at her head , all right ?
I attacked her with a bagel . ” )
“ My mom ’s like , ‘ Alair , I do n’t understand you .
I want to be a parent to you but I have no control at all …
As a person you ’re awesome .
You ’re hilarious , you entertain me , you ’re so cool .
I would totally be your friend .
But as your mother , I ’m worried . ’ ”
“ I ca n’t say I was pleased , ” her mother tells me about first learning of Alair ’s bisexual experimentation .
“ But I ca n’t say I was upset either .
I like that she ’s forthright about what she wants , that she values her freedom , that she takes care of herself .
But I have all the trepidations a parent has when they learn their child is becoming sexually active . ”
Of course , none of these kids will have to deal with their parents quite this directly in another year or so — a fact of which they are all acutely aware .
College is already becoming a pressing issue .
Everyone thinks
Elle is going to get into Harvard .
“ If I fail physics , my average drops like a stone , ” she frets .
Alair and Nathan want to go to the same college , wherever that may be .
“ You do realize , ” Alair tells him , “ that , like , we ’re two of the most awesome people in the school . ”
“ We would room , ” Nathan says .
“ We would totally room . ”
“ Fuck yeah .
But I ’m gonna need a lock on my door for like , ‘ I ’m bringing these five girls home , Nathan .
What are you doing tonight ? ’ ” She mimics his voice , “ ‘ I ’m reading my book . ’ ”
“ Ouch ! ” Nathan scowls at her .
“ It ’s the Kama Sutra ! ”
“ Oh , right , right . ”
“ I ’ve actually read the Kama Sutra , ” Alair informs the table .
“ Some of that shit just is n’t gonna work . ”
“ I know ! ” says Jane .
“ We have three editions at my house . ”
“ Like , I ’ve tried it .
You need a man that ’s like ‘ Argh ! ’ ” Alair pumps her arms up above her head .
“ I ’ve got one of those guys , actually . ”
She ’s talking about Jason , the boy she was hanging out with last night , another frequenter of the cuddle puddle .
“ He ’s so built . ”
“ He ’s in love with you , ” Jane says drily .
“ No , he ’s not ! ”
“ Yes he is ! ”
Some girls hook up with other girls to please guys .
But , Jane says , “ boys make out with boys for our benefit as well . ”
“ How could he not be in love with Alair ? ” Nathan reasons .
Jane nods in Alair ’s direction .
“ He bought you gum . ”
“ He bought you gum . ”
This cinches it for Nathan .
“ Yeah , he loves you .
He wants you so in his underwear . ”
Alair looks at him blankly .
“ But he already has that .
We ’re friends . ”
There ’s no need to bring love into it .
But later , back at Jane ’s apartment , as the afternoon is turning to night , Alair has the look of , if not love , at least infatuation , as she waits in the hallway for the elevator to take her back down .
Only it ’s not Jason she ’s saying good - night to — it ’s Jane .
“ You make my knees weak , ” she says .
And then to cut the tension : “ I showered for you and everything . ”
She leans in and gives Jane a kiss .
It practically takes a diagram to plot all the various hookups and connections within the cuddle puddle .
Elle ’s kissed Jane and Jane ’s kissed Alair and Alair ’s kissed Elle .
And then from time to time Elle hooks up with Nathan , but really only at parties , and only when Bethany is n’t around , because Nathan really likes Bethany , who does n’t have a thing for girls but does n’t have a problem with girls who do , either .
Alair ’s hooking up with Jason ( who “ kind of ” went out with Jane once ) , even though she sort of also has a thing for Hector , who Jane likes , too — though Jane thinks it ’s totally boring when people date people of the same gender .
Ilia has a serious girlfriend , but girls were hooking up at his last party , which was awesome .
Molly has kissed Alair , and Jane ’s ex-girlfriend first decided she was bi while staying at Molly ’s beach house on Fire Island .
Sarah sometimes kisses Elle , although she has a boyfriend — he does n’t care if she hooks up with other girls , since she ’s straight anyway .
And so on .
Some of the boys hook up with each other , too , although in far fewer numbers than the girls .
One of Alair ’s male friends explained that this is because for guys , anything beyond same - sex kissing requires “ more of a physical commitment . ”
If a guy does hook up with other guys it certainly does n’t make the girls less likely to hook up with him ; and the converse is obviously true .
Of course , the definition of “ hooking up ” is as nebulous as the definition of “ heteroflexible . ”
A catchall phrase for anything from “ like , exchanging of saliva ” to intercourse , it ’s often a euphemism for oral sex .
But rules are hazy when you ’re talking about physical encounters between two girls .
As Alair puts it , “ How do you define female sex ?
It ’s difficult .
I do n’t know what the bases are .
Everyone keeps trying to explain the bases to me , but there ’s so many things that just do n’t fit into the base system .
I usually leave it up to the other girl . ”
Elle elaborates by using herself as an example .
At a recent party , she says , she “ kissed five people and , like , hooked up with two going beyond kissing .
One of them was a boy and one of them was a girl .
The reason I started hooking up with the guy is because he was making out with this other guy and he came back and was like , ‘ I have to prove that I ’m straight . ’
And I was standing right there .
That ’s how it all began . ”
The guy in question became her boyfriend that night ; even though the relationship is all of a week old , she calls it her second “ serious ” relationship .
“ At least I ’m intending for it to be serious . ” ( It lasted eleven days . )
The cuddle puddle may be where a flirtation begins , but parties , not surprisingly , are where most of the real action takes place .
In parentless apartments , the kids are free to “ make the rounds , ” as they call it , and move their more - than - kissing hookups with both genders behind locked bathroom doors or onto coat - laden beds .
Even for bisexual girls there is , admittedly , a Girls Gone Wild aspect to these evenings .
Some girls do hook up with other girls solely to please the guys who watch , and it can be difficult to distinguish between the behavior of someone who is legitimately sexually interested and someone who wants to impress the boy across the room .
Alair is quick to disparage this behavior —
“ It kinda grosses me out .
It ca n’t be like , this could be fun … is anyone watching my chest heave ? ” — but Jane sees it as empowering .
“ I take advantage of it because manipulating boys is fun as hell .
Boys make out with boys for our benefit as well .
So it ’s not just one way .
It ’s very fair . ”
She ’s not just making excuses .
These girls have obliterated the “ damned if you do , damned if you do n’t ” stranglehold that has traditionally plagued high - school females .
They set the sexual agenda for their group .
And they expect reciprocation .
“ I ’ve made it my own personal policy that if I ’m going to give oral sex , I ’m going to receive oral sex , ” says Jane .
“ Jane wears the pants in any relationship , ” Ilia says with a grin .
“ She wears the pants in my relationship , even though she ’s not part of it . ”
When the girls talk about other girls they sound like football players in a locker room ( “ The Boobie Goddesses of our grade are Natalie and Annette , ” or “ Have you seen the Asian girl who wears that tiny red dress and those high red sneakers ? , ” or “ Carol is so hot !
Why is she straight ?
I do n’t get it ” ) , but there ’s little gossip about same - sex hookups — partly because the novelty has by now worn off , and partly because , as Alair puts it , “ it ’s not assumed that a relationship will stem from it . ”
It seems that even with all the same - sex activity going on , it ’s still hard for the girls to find other girls to actually date .
Jane says this is because the girls who like girls generally like boys more , at least for dating .
“ A lot of girls are scared about trying to make a lesbian relationship work , ” she says .
“ There ’s this fear that there has to be the presence of a man or it wo n’t work . ”
But dating gay girls is n’t really an option either , because the cuddle - puddle kids are not considered part of the gay community .
“ One of the great things about bisexuality is that mainstream gay culture does n’t affect us as much , ” says Jane , “ so it ’s not like bi boys feel that they have to talk with a lisp and walk around all fairylike , and it ’s not like girls feel like they have to dress like boys . ”
The downside , she says , is that “ gays feel that bis will cheat on them in a straight manner . ”
In fact , there ’s a general impression of promiscuity that bisexual girls can’t seem to shake .
“ The image of people who are bi is that they are sluts , ” says Jane .
“ One of the reasons straight boys have this bi-girls fantasy is that they are under the impression that bisexual girls will sleep with anything that moves and that ’s why they like both genders , because they are so sex - obsessed .
Which is n’t true . ”
If you ask the girls why they think there ’s more teenage bisexual experimentation happening today , Alair is quick with an explanation .
“ I blame television , ” she says .
“ I blame the media . ”
She ’s partly joking , giving the stock answer .
But there ’s obviously some truth to it .
She ’s too young to remember a time when she could n’t turn on Showtime or even MTV and regularly see girls kissing girls .
It ’s not simply that they ’re imitating what they ’ve seen , it ’s that the stigma has been erased , maybe even transformed into cachet .
“ It ’s in the realm of possibilities now , ” as Ritch Savin - Williams puts it .
“ When you do n’t think of it as being a possibility , you do n’t do it .
But now that it ’s out there , it ’s like , ‘ Oh , yeah , that could be fun . ’ ” Of course , sexy TV shows would have no impact at all if they were n’t tapping into something more innate .
Perhaps , as research suggests , sexuality is more fluid for women than it is for men .
Perhaps natural female intimacy opens the door to sexual experimentation at an age when male partners can be particularly unsatisfying .
As one mother of a cuddle - puddle kid puts it , “ Emotionally it ’s safer — it ’s difficult in this age group to hold onto your body .
You ’re changing .
There ’s a safety factor in a girl being with a girl . ”
Then , laughing , she asked that her name be withheld .
“ My mother might read this . ”
It ’s true that girls have always experimented , but it ’s typically been furtive , kept quiet .
The difference now is how these girls are flaunting it .
It ’s become a form of exhibitionism , a way to get noticed at an age when getting noticed is what it ’s all about .
And as rebellions go , it ’s pretty safe .
Hooking up with girls wo n’t get them pregnant .
It wo n’t hurt their GPA .
It wo n’t keep them out of honor societies , social groups , the Ivy League .
In the end , the Stuyvesant cuddle puddle might just be a trickle - down version of the collegiate “ gay until graduation . ”
On the other hand , these girls are experimenting at an earlier age , when their identities and their ideas about what they want in a partner are still being formed .
Will it affect the way they choose to live their adult lives ?
Elle is determined to marry a man , but Alair and Jane are not so sure .
Maybe they wo n’t get married at all , they say , keep their options open .
“ I have no idea , ” says Alair .
“ I ’m just 16 . ”
Afew weeks later , the guys are hanging out in Nathan ’s room .
Jason is stretched out on the bed and Ilia is leaning back in a chair by the desk , and it ’s pretty clear that nothing much is happening this afternoon .
Just some guitar playing , some laying about .
Then the girls show up and things get more interesting .
Alair and Jane have brought a couple of friends , Molly and Nikki .
Molly does n’t know for sure if she ’s bisexual , but “ I have my suspicions , ” she says ; she ’s hooked up with Alair before .
Nikki is with her friend Jared , who she ’s sort of but not really dating .
He makes out with boys but considers Nikki his “ soul mate ” ; she ’s totally straight but kisses girls .
“ I kiss anything pretty , anything beautiful , anything worthwhile , ” she says .
Nikki runs her hands through Jane ’s hair .
“ You look awesome !
I love this shirt .
I love your hair . ”
Jane crosses the room to sit in Alair ’s lap , and Alair wraps her arms around her .
That reminds Nikki of something .
“ Wait !
Let me show you guys the next painting I ’m doing , ” she says , pulling from her backpack a photograph of Alair asleep on the beach in a striped bikini .
It ’s a sexy picture , and Nikki knows it .
Chinese food is ordered , guitars strummed , an ice cube is passed around and for no apparent reason everyone is required to put it down their pants .
It ’s just another afternoon of casual flirtation .
The boys showing off for the girls , the girls showing off for everyone .
No strings attached .
In theory , anyway .
Most of the kids say they hate relationships , that they do n’t want to be tied down , that they want to be open to different possibilities and different genders from minute to minute , but there is a natural tendency — as natural perhaps as the tendency to experiment — to try to find connection .
Like it or not , emotions get involved .
If you look closer , you can see the hint of longing , the momentary pouting , the tiny jealousies .
Jared ca n’t take his eyes off Nikki , but Nikki seems interested mainly in Alair .
Jason , too , is angling for Alair ’s attention , but Alair is once again focused on Jane .
And Jane , well , Jane might actually be in love .
She is in a particularly good mood today , quick to smile , and even more quick to drop into conversation the name of the boy she recently started dating , a tall , good - looking senior and one of the most popular kids at Stuyvesant .
Later , while rummaging for silverware , she casually mentions that they may start dating exclusively .
“ Ugh ! ” Alair exclaims , grabbing her by the hips and pulling her away from the drawer .
“ What about me ? ”
“ Let ’s put it this way , ” Jane counters , grinning and snatching up a fork .
“ I ’m not interested in any other guys . ”
Still , it ’s clear that Jane really likes this guy .
And Alair seems a little rattled .
Her fortune cookie reads , “ You are the master of every situation . ”
Except perhaps this one .
Later , after the lamps have been switched on and the takeout eaten , both girls are on a love seat in the living room , leaning into each other , boys and dirty dishes strewn about .
Jane starts showing off what she can do with her tongue , touching her nose with it , twisting it around , doing rolls .
Everyone is impressed .
“ My tongue gets a lot of practice , ” she says .
“ Why do n’t you practice on me ? ” Alair demands .
“ I ’ll hook up with you . ”
It ’s clear that she means more than kissing .
Jane blinks a few times .
“ I ’m scared I ’m going to be bad at it , ” she finally says .
She ’s being coy , just putting her off , but there ’s a bit of sincerity to her nervousness .
“ You wo n’t be bad at it , ” Alair reassures her .
She pulls Jane between her legs and starts giving her a massage , running her hands up and down her back , pushing her hair aside to rub her neck .
When the massage is over , Jason comes over to Alair , grabs her hand , kisses it .
For the rest of the evening , he stays close to her side , but she stays close to Jane .
The next day when I meet up with Alair on her way to choir practice , she tells me that nothing ever happened with Jane that night .
She ’s decided to give up on her .
Jane ’s with someone else , it ’s official , and there ’s no room in the relationship for her .
“ But you know what , ” she says , mustering a smile .
“ They ’re , like , monogamous together , and I ’m really happy for them .
And being their friend and seeing them so happy together totally beats a fling . ”
She pauses .
“ It really does . ”

Why are n't the terrorist pardons during the Clinton Administration garnering more attention from the MSM ?
Because I look at much of the news from a criminal justice perspective , I find the complaints that the MSM is biased against Senator Clinton to be somewhat comical given the " free pass " she has gotten on a lot of questionable criminal justice decisions made during the Clinton Administration .
The most obvious example of these realities comes from the attack on Senator Obama concerning connections to a member of the Weather Underground and toughness on terrorism .
If this is a serious campaign issue , the mainstream media ought to be closely re-examining at , and asking Senator Clinton hard questions about , the pardons given during the Clinton Administration to two Weather Underground members and to members of a group of Puerto Rican terrorists ( FALN ) .
Fortunately , some thoughtful bloggers are trying to make sure these pardon issues does not get lost in all the obsession over Senator Obama .
The blog Pardon Power , helpfully , has had an on - going series of effective posts on this front , including recently :
In addition , as detailed in these posts , a Mother Jones blog has been pursuing this story in recent days :
My sense from reading these posts ( combined with knowing a bit about a lot of ugly stories surrounding President Bill Clinton 's various pardon decisions ) leads me to think there might by a lot more to discover if the media we to do some serious investigative journalism about these pardons and Senator Clinton 's possible input .
Sadly , I do not get the sense , even with seemingly endless discussion of the Democratic race , that many in the MSM are seriously trying to develop new stories rather than just recycling the standard narratives .

Why are n't the terrorist pardons during the Clinton Administration garnering more attention from the MSM ?:
Comments
There is no consistent bias against either Clinton or Obama .
The MSM has only one interest in the democratic primary : for it to go on as long as possible ( i.e. ratings and money ) .
That 's why they were consistently favorable to Obama early on , and now consistently favorable to Clinton .
The reason why these pardons have not gotten more MSM attention is because it continues to be unlikely that Clinton will get the nomination , yet it is still possible .
Any story that would tilt it more towards " impossible " would run contrary to the MSM 's economic interests .

I do n't see why this is an " obsession " with Obama .
The fact that Obama feels comfortable in the company of unrepetant terrorists and haters of America , that 's kind of , you know , a big deal .
Posted by : federalist | Apr 24 , 2008 11:49:22 AM
Professor ,
You are just baiting political comments here .
So , here is my snark :
I feel comfortable around non-poor people that disagree with me , even though they hate America .
Posted by : S.cotus | Apr 24 , 2008 12:11:59 PM
Federalist , really ?
" Obama feels comfortable in the company of unrepentant terrorists " WHILE serving on a charity board .
So I guess Obama should have refused to serve on the charity board .
You make it sound like he and the " unrepentant terrorist " are best friends .
As for your reference to a " hater of America " I assume that is a reference to Rev. Wright .
I guess Wright was hating America when he served it for years as a Marine .
Pointing out flaws in your country does not equal hating America .
Nice try .
Sorry to turn this into a political discussion on a sentencing blog , but I could n't just let that comment go .
By the way , I agree with the first comment about why the MSM is n't hitting this issue .
They want the race to go on and on .
Posted by : Dorah | Apr 24 , 2008 1:17:01 PM
Pshaw .
Federalist 's political rhetoric , devoid of nuance or context is concise and therefore it is better than true .
And really , the phase " hate America " comes neatly off the tongue .
Therefore , the first person to use it has an advantage in the political battle for truth .
Finally , while Rev. Wright was a Marine , it does not matter .
Federalist said he hated American and therefore he did not serve .
Posted by : S.cotus | Apr 24 , 2008 1:19:57 PM
By the way , S.cotus , I proudly served in the Navy for five years so I do n't denigrate anyone 's honorable service , and I wo n't do so with Wright .
And no , I was not referring to Jeremiah Wright .
While I think that his comments are reprehensible , I was not talking about him .
I was talking about Ayers and Dohrn .
In any event , Dorah , Ayers does hate America , and Obama is comfortable with him as Obama 's own campaign manager said they were " friendly " .
Plus , if you look at Obama 's website , you 'll note that he provides quotes stating that Ayers was a respected member of Chicago society .
Whatever .
Ayers is not acceptable in polite company .
He is utter scum , along with Dohrn .
People who are on friendly terms with people like them are contemptible .
Posted by : federalist | Apr 24 , 2008 2:01:47 PM
If Clinton gets the Democrat nod then you will most likely hear about it .
Between Clinton and BO the issues is who can promise the most without having and fulfill the least .
Posted by : JWK | Apr 24 , 2008 2:45:53 PM
I do n't really follow your politics ( or care ) , so most of what you said is greek to me .
As a real American I have better things to do .
However , saying that someone " hates America , " as far as I can tell is acceptable discourse .
Posted by : S.cotus | Apr 24 , 2008 3:42:03 PM
The media has every interest in this thing playing out ; we 'll hear about this once the Ayers stuff plays out for a bit .
Maybe in time , for say , Oregon ?
That way Senator Obama 's win there can be explained , in part , by new Clinton scandals .
Posted by : Alec | Apr 24 , 2008 4:31:34 PM
Agree that Clinton has got a pass here .
Commutations ( my understanding is that the Weather folks got commutations , not pardons ) are a significant political act - far more significant that guilt by association .
On another topic , sad that trolls seem to have taken up fairly permanent residence under this bridge .
Posted by : barksdale | Apr 24 , 2008 5:06:24 PM
" On another topic , sad that trolls seem to have taken up fairly permanent residence under this bridge . "
Agreed .
I noted this in another thread a little while ago .
In response , the most prolific source of insults on this blog took umbrage that I had insulted the insulters .
Funniest thing I had seen here in a long time .
Posted by : Kent Scheidegger | Apr 24 , 2008 5:15:15 PM
Barksdale , I was about to point out that because pardons and commutations ARE political acts , they really do n't have much to do with sentencing .
Moreover , politically , I would even go so far as to say as it does n't matter who the president pardons , so long as they do n't reoffend .
Mr. Scheidegger ,
Do you agree or disagree with the above posters ?
If so , why ?

Serious is why the MSM is not grilling the candidates on why they have not committed to cutting back the military budget in order to guarantee the right to health care to American citizens .

That 's right DK , I hate America .
Real cute .
The reality is that the Weathermen did some pretty shitty things in their day , and Ayers and Dohrn are unrepentant Weathermen .
And Barack Obama is comfortable around them , and even defends them on his website as upstanding members of the Chicago community .
It may come as a newsflash to a twit like you , DK , but a lot of people care about that kind of thing .
And I am sure they 'd just love to be told by the likes of you that they are unserious .
As for your crack about the right to health care , just remember that when you talk about a right to such things , you are talking about the right to force others to pay for it .
And then you are talking about the power of the government to decide who gets it .
For a group of people who distrust the government to do a relatively simple thing like figure out who did a crime and punish him for it , you sure are trustful with respect to a very large part of economy in a field that is very very complex .
Oh that 's right , Obama 's gonna wave his magic wand and fix it for us -- he 's going to magically figure out how to provide good health care to us all .
When you figure out how Paris got its bread , then talk .
Until then you 're just a twerp who mistakes his naive utopianism for morality and deep thought .

I have not had time to read the comments so I can't determine who disagrees with me and therefore indisputably hates America .
However , most of you know how I think about things , so if you do disagree with me , consider yourself an America - hater .
Posted by : S.cotus | Apr 25 , 2008 8:30:00 AM
Federalist , apparently , you are not a Christian .
In case you do n't know , Christian are taught to forgive .
So if Obama want to forgive and give people a second chance , good for him .
As for myself , I do n't hate America , I just hate racists , hypocrites , and war mongers .
Unfortunately , these are the same people who control this country .
By the way I am not a Christian .
Posted by : | Apr 25 , 2008 12:10:27 PM
Usually it is better form to call yourself a Christian , and then say that you understand Christian theology , and Christian theology dicates that the other posters are evil .

Rosenberg was granted clemency , not a pardon .
When released , she had served 16 years of a 58 year sentence .
Her conviction was for unloading 740 pounds of dynamite and weapons .
After she was sentenced , Rudy Giuliani dismissed the Brinks case charges against .
She was never tried or convicted of it .
The evidence against her in that case in large part came from an former members of the underground group turned informants .
She always denied her involvement in it .
The reason for the commutation was that although eligible for parole and a model prisoner , the parole board said she would have to do another 15 years because of the Brinks case , even though she was never charged or convicted in it .
This was a valid exercise of President Clinton 's clemency powers .
Hillary had nothing to do with it and nothing to gain from it .
She had just been elected Senator when it happened .
New Yorkers were vocally opposed to it .
Schumer opposed it , as did Giuliani .
If she were looking to curry favor with constituents , she would have opposed it .
Margy Love at the time told the Providence Journal Bulletin ( 12/27/00 ) she thought Rosenberg was worthy of consideration :
" Margaret Love , a former pardon attorney for the U.S. Justice Department , said in an interview with The Journal that , when Rosenberg 's lawyers asked her to assist in Rosenberg 's clemency bid , she concluded that Rosenberg was worthy of consideration . "
Despite some misconduct in prison prior to 1988 , Rosenberg has renounced her commitment to revolutionary violence and become a model prisoner , assisting in the development of an HIV / AIDS curriculum that is now used throughout the prison system and helping newly incarcerated inmates adjust to life behind bars .
" Dr. ( Chip ) Gibson ( the prison psychiatrist at Danbury ) stated that in his 14 years in prison work , he has never regarded a prisoner as highly as he does this subject , " said Rob Haworth , a hearing examiner for the Parole Commission .
" Dr. Gibson believes this subject is a perfect example of one who has truly changed . "
Nevertheless , the Parole Commission , informed by a letter from federal prosecutors that the government still believes Rosenberg was a participant in the Brink 's robbery and other crimes , ruled in January 1998 that she would have to serve at least another 15 years in prison .
" You just sort of say , ' How long , oh , Lord , how long ?
And what are we trying to do here ? ' " Love said .
One last thing : I read that Rosenberg represented herself at the trial that resulted in her 58 year sentence .
Because of disruptions , she was banned for parts of it and had to watch from a tv monitor in jail .
So she was pro se , partially tried in absentia and got a 58 year sentence when no one was killed or injured .
And the parole board wanted her to do another 15 on top of the 15 she had already served .
Bill Clinton did nothing suspect in granting her clemency .
And neither did Hillary .

Rosenberg deserves to rot in hell .
I wish nothing but bad on that horrible person .

Ah , federalist .
The more you post ...
federalist wrote : " The reality is that the Weathermen did some pretty shitty things in their day , and Ayers and Dohrn are unrepentant Weathermen . "
Quick math : Compare the number of people George W. Bush murdered to the Weathermen .
If you can't divide by zero , do n't come looking to me .
federalist wrote : " And Barack Obama is comfortable around them , and even defends them on his website as upstanding members of the Chicago community . "
So Barack Obama defends people who have n't killed anybody and you defend George Bush , a mass murderer , and you question Barack Obama 's morality ?
I just want to make sure I understand your position .
federalist wrote : " It may come as a newsflash to a twit like you , DK , but a lot of people care about that kind of thing .

You are unserious .
Laughably so .
federalist wrote : " As for your crack about the right to health care , just remember that when you talk about a right to such things , you are talking about the right to force others to pay for it . "
Of course .
It 's called insurance .
federalist wrote : " And then you are talking about the power of the government to decide who gets it .
Everybody gets it .
No discretion .
federalist wrote : " For a group of people who distrust the government to do a relatively simple thing like figure out who did a crime and punish him for it , you sure are trustful with respect to a very large part of economy in a field that is very very complex .
I do n't want the government figuring out which citizens deserve to die .
That 's why ( 1 ) it should n't be killing people ; and ( 2 ) it should n't be determining who gets health care ( everybody does ) .
Simple enough for you ?
federalist wrote : " Oh that 's right , Obama 's gonna wave his magic wand and fix it for us -- he 's going to magically figure out how to provide good health care to us all . "
Sure .
It 's easy .
Slash the military budget , i.e. , corporate welfare .
federalist wrote : " When you figure out how Paris got its bread , then talk .
Until then you 're just a twerp who mistakes his naive utopianism for morality and deep thought . "
Ha .
Hitler was a naive utopian .
I 'm a realist .
You 're a sadist .

Hilary lies about " working for civil rights for 35 years " .
I defy anyone to come up with one single pleading in a civil right lawsuit that has her name on it .
She was a corporate lawyer taking care of piggish banks .
The best pardon story is that of Marc Rich , a wealthy guy represented by the now disbarred Scooter Libby .
Someone would serve their country well if they would simply publish the list of all those who contributed to the Clinton library and the amounts .
Another thing that seems strange .
Two guys grow up in Hope , Arkansas .
One talks like a hillbilly and the other one has a refined mid west accent .
One went to Yale and the other I know not where .
Both were Governors of Arkansas .
Why is it that the Yalie talks like a hillbilly ?
Is this fake ?
What accent does he put on when he takes those 3 a.m. calls from Monica ?

> Margy Love at the time told the Providence Journal Bulletin ( 12/27/00 ) she thought Rosenberg was worthy of consideration ...
TalkLeft , I think you have somehow missed the main point .
The point is n't whether or not the clemency was justified so much as it is this : Mrs. Clinton should think twice about considering any possible link - no matter how remote - to the Weather Underground a disqualification for the presidency .
I do n't know a single person who has claimed that Mrs. Clinton benefitted from the Weather Underground clemency decisions .
I do know that she has been asked about them and she has responded , " I did n't know anything . "
I also know that she has never once bothered to defend the use of the pardon power in those two instances ( Rosenberg and Evans ) like you have .
What does that say ?
She very rarely lets Obama tag her last in debates .
Why did she sit mute when he pointed out these cases ?
Why did n't she defend the pardon and the commutation ?

Swing sets engineered to stand the test of time and provide children with years of healthy and imaginative play !
Safety Commitment
We consider safety at every angle - literally .
Learn what makes our swing sets the safety play structure on the block .
See our safety measures
Let 's suppose
Yahoo holds its board meeting today , as TechCrunch is reporting – we would n't expect a definitive response to Microsoft 's hostile $ 44.6 billion bid immediately , especially not on a Friday afternoon .
Yahoo's standard party line is that its going to take its sweet time considering the offer .
And considering it 's only been one week since Microsoft submitted its bid , that has n't given Yahoo a whole lot of time to scare up an alternative offer .
But while Yahoo takes a leisurely approach to the deal – rumors are circulating that the company is still holding out for a higher offer – investors want the deal done already .
Yahoo shareholders do n't care if Steve Ballmer is the emperor of evil , nor do they care about the implications of the merger to Flickr .
The thing that matters most to shareholders is Yahoo's stock price , and that looked awfully ugly before Microsoft came in with its $ 31 per share offer .
" This is totally insane , " says Shareholder Value Management analyst Jeff Embersits .
" There 's no way Yahoo 's worth $ 44 billion .
Period .
[ Yahoo Management ] should fall on their knees , kiss the ground and go home and buy Porsches . "
Although technology industry shareholders tend to be a pretty litigious bunch – Yahoo is currently facing several securities lawsuits , according to its most recently quarterly report – if the company were to reject the Microsoft offer and pursue a deal with Google , it could pretty much expect an onslaught of shareholder suits .
" Every board member should expect to get sued every single day of his life if [ Yahoo does n't ] take the Microsoft offer , " says Laura Martin , an analyst with Soleil - Media Metrics .
" If they do a deal with Google , all they 're trying to do is save their jobs . "
While we do n't doubt shareholders would jump on a lawsuit in a heartbeat , the legal grounds of a claim could be shaky , according to experts .
" I do n't think there 's a case , " says Richard Sacks a securities arbitration expert with Investors Recovery Service .
" In order for there to be a case , you have to have damages .
And right now Yahoo shareholders have the opposite of damages .
They have profits .
If the stock goes down because the Yahoo board rejects the offer , and you held on to Yahoo shares , where are the damages ?
You made the decision to hold on to the stock . "
That may not stop shareholders from suing , though .
Given the pace of mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry , most major players have been subject to all sorts of securities lawsuits .
" For a company like Yahoo - given its size and industry – this would n't be uncommon , " says Kevin LaCroix , an attorney outside Cleveland , Ohio .
" Certainly all the big Silicon Valley companies – Sun , Apple , Oracle – they 've all had lots of securities litigation over the years .
It 's somewhat characteristic of the industry . "

Click to viewWhoa , the iPhone just got GPS .
Well , it 's actually using peer - collected GPS data linked to cellular tower , which Navizon describes as peer to peer location detection .
Either way &mdash it actually works .
This morning , the Navizon GPS app showed up in Installer .app .
After creating a username and login ( get this : email NOT required ) , the app started up , taking about 30 seconds to find my location accurate within a few hundred feet &mdash good enough to use as a starting point for driving directions .
Then it pushes your coordinates , by latitude and longitude , to many , many , many decimal places of degrees , to the map application .

Here 's how it works :
Some people with a GPS device collect the location information of cell towers and wifi access points .
Then they share it with the rest of the network and everyone else who does n't have a GPS device can then simulate a Virtual GPS thanks to the data collected by others .
This is why we call it Peer to Peer Positioning .

Kind of .
It 's off by a few hundred yards , but this is a lot better than the total lack of location awareness that the iPhone officially enjoys .
It also claims Wi -Fi positioning , which I do n't completely understand .
The app is free for the first 15 days .
After that , the software costs $ 24.99 .
A caveat :
It crashed Chen 's phone , but it worked great for me .
And this is only version 1.0 , but maybe the real question is why was n't this functionality built into the iPhone to begin with ?

C2i International states on its website that its team is " hand - picked from Special Operations at New Scotland Yard " .
It is run by self - proclaimed Special Forces Veteran Justin King and says it " delivers tailored advice and solutions to companies in a wide range of industries including Aerospace . "
It has come to light that Oxford - educated Toby Kendall , 24 , an employee of aerospace security consultants C2i International , infiltrated and spied on Heathrow campaign groups across London for a year .
According to people from Plane Stupid , he was " suspected " and following an investigation he was confronted and exposed .
Heathrow owner BAA has now admitted to the Times newspaper that it has been in contact with C2i , having previously claimed it had no involvement in the spying operation .
Piecing together evidence including photographs , reports from fellow students at Oxford and website profiles , Plane Stupid discovered the agent who was going by the name of ' Ken Tobias ' is in fact ' Toby Kendall ' who was captain of the athletics team at Wadham College , Oxford .
Kendall went undercover in London Plane Stupid following last year 's Climate Camp at Heathrow .
According to Plane Stupid he made " elementary errors " as his career as a secret agent faltered at the first hurdle : " Due to his poorly constructed back - story and appalling acting skills .
When Plane Stupid fed Kendall false information it was just 48 hours before sources in the aviation industry confirmed that the plans had been reported back to them " .
The day after he was confronted , Kendall emailed Plane Stupid saying he " came into the group with a pure heart wanting to make a difference .
I still of course hold my principles . "
Tamsin Omond , 23 , a Church of England parish administrator , said today : " The aviation industry brought its special brand of bumbling incompetence to the task of spying on us .
Their secret agent was more Austin Powers than James Bond though the question still remains , who paid the espionage agency ? "
Plane Stupid is publishing a full dossier of evidence , including web links , photographs and more at www.planestupid.com
Other Spies
This is n't the first case of a spy being uncovered by activists in the recent past .
The Campaign Against the Arms Trade ( CAAT ) was infiltrated by Martin Hogbin .
See the enemy within from CAAT and BAe Spy Martin Hogbin and Mark Thomas by Mark Thomas and the 2005 CAAT Steering Committee statement on spying .
In the run-up to the 2005 G8 summit in Scotland , an American woman , known as Anna , contacted anti-G8 medics and various IMC 's claiming she wanted to get involved with the protests .
She was later identified in the set - up of the Auburn Three trial and turned out to be an FBI informant / agent .
According to the FBI 's own affidavit , " Anna " had been involved in gathering information on 12 separate cases in the anarchist movement .
Other cases of spies being caught include the case of the Oakland Police Infiltrators taking control of an anti-war group and the case of the Terrorism Task Force operative infiltrating a peace group in Fresno ( see the IndyBay article : What Have Peace Fresno Members Learned Since the Infiltration )
Ward Churchill , author of The COINTELPRO Papers , ' Documents From the FBI 's Secret Wars Against Dissent in the United States ' has documented the history of state infiltration of activists movements in the 1960's and 1970's and several of his talks on this matter are available online : [ 1 ] | [ 2 ] | [ 3 ] .
Private spy contractors are a very big business .
According to the Christian Science Monitor , the US spent over $ 43 billion on spy services in 2007 .
" The bulk of money was spent on private contractors " and the figure does not include " billions of dollars spent by military services on intelligence " .

The tests came as Pyongyang warned that US demands over its nuclear programme could further delay its disabling of nuclear facilities as agreed last year .
A South Korean presidential spokesman said the missile tests seemed to be part of " ordinary military training " .
North Korea 's actions come a day after it expelled South Korean managers from a joint industrial park on the border .
The expulsions are being seen as a diplomatic protest against the Seoul government which has said it would link progress at the park with progress on the North 's denuclearisation effort , says the BBC's Kevin Kim in the South Korean capital .
The conservative government of newly - elected President Lee Myung - bak has made it clear that further economic co-operation with Pyongyang will only be possible if North Korea fully disables its nuclear facilities .
US nuclear suspicions
A government official told South Korea 's Yonhap news agency that North Korea launched several missiles at 1030 local time ( 0130 GMT ) .
The official said that the missiles were fired into the Yellow Sea .
In response , a South Korean presidential spokesman told Yonhap that " the government regards North Korea 's missile firing as merely a part of its ordinary military training " .
Analysts say such launches are often timed to make a political point .
Meanwhile , a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman warned the US not to pursue its suspicions that Pyongyang has hidden some of its nuclear programme .
Under a landmark disarmament - for - aid deal reached last year , North Korea has taken steps to shut down its main atomic facility at Yongbyon .
But the US wants North Korea to fully declare its nuclear weapons stockpile and answer US suspicions of nuclear proliferation and possession of a secret uranium enrichment programme .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court 's ruling that female inmates have a constitutional right to abortions off jail grounds .
The Supreme Court , without comment , let stand a lower court ruling on inmate abortions .
The case involved an Arizona woman who wanted a first - trimester abortion , but was refused transportation by corrections officials in Maricopa County , which includes Phoenix .
The county appealed a lower - court decision in favor of the woman .
The county 's policy banned off - site " elective medical procedures " without a court order .
County officials said they provided transportation only for procedures they deemed " medically necessary . "
A state court ruled that was an " exaggerated response " to the inmate 's request .
The Supreme Court justices without comment refused to decide if the county 's policy violated a woman 's due process rights .
The decision means changes ordered by a state court in 2005 giving women easier access to abortions off jail grounds must continue .
A similar case in Missouri is expected to reach the Supreme Court in coming months .
The inmate in the Arizona case , listed in court papers under the pseudonym " Jane Doe , " found out she was pregnant just after she had been sentenced in 2004 to four months in the county jail for driving while intoxicated .
Doe , then 19 , immediately requested an abortion , but corrections officers said they would drive her to a nearby clinic only if she had a court order .
It took seven weeks to obtain the order , and her lawyers complained Doe faced " repeated obstacles . "
After undergoing the abortion , Doe -- supported by the ACLU -- filed a lawsuit forcing the state to provide transportation for abortions .
State courts eventually found the county 's policy placed an " undue burden " on pregnant inmates seeking abortions .
The Supreme Court established that legal standard more than a quarter - century ago when when states were considering limiting women 's access to abortion .
A state appeals court noted certain prisoner rights could be curtailed in the name of safety and efficiency inside a corrections facility .
But the judges said that in this case , prison resources would not have been affected , since Doe had agreed to pay for the transportation and medical costs herself .
And taking prisoners off - campus is a routine procedure , the state court said .
" The county regularly transports inmates for court appearances , compassionate visits and non-emergency , medically necessary treatment , " the court said .
" Transportation for abortion services are a negligible fraction of the overall transportation the county performs each year . "
The ACLU applauded the high court 's action .
" Today 's announcement puts an end to Maricopa County prison officials ' blatant disregard of the law and failure to ensure that prisoners get the health care they need , " said Alessandra Soler Meetze , the group 's Arizona executive director .
" It 's the end of the road for Sheriff Arpaio 's campaign against reproductive freedom . "
Joseph Arpaio , the Maricopa County sheriff , is in charge of the county jail system .
The Supreme Court three years ago allowed a single inmate in Missouri to have the procedure at a state - contracted facility off penitentiary grounds .
The state was ordered to provide transportation .
After that case , a federal appeals court in St. Louis in January upheld the overall right of female inmates to be transported at state expense for elective abortions .
The Missouri appeal has not yet reached the high court , but is expected to be filed by the summer .
The case announced Monday is Arpaio v. Doe ( 07-839 ) .

BEIJING ( AP )  China may consider changing its one - child policy because it has succeeded in helping to slow population growth in the past three decades , a Chinese official said Sunday .
The policy , launched in the 1970s , has produced " very good results , " said Wu Jianmin spokesman for the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , an advisory body to parliament .
There would be an estimated 400 million more people in China without it , Wu said .
" The one - child policy was the only choice we had given the conditions when we initiated the policy , " Wu told reporters at a news conference the day before the CPPCC convened for its annual session .
However , he added , " when designing a policy we need to take into consideration the reality . "
" So as things develop , there might be some changes to the policy and relevant departments are considering this , " Wu said without giving a timeline or details on which departments would be involved .
Wu 's comments echo a position China 's communist government has been thinking about for some time .
On Thursday , a senior family planning official said changes were being considered but that family planning policies would not be scrapped altogether .
Under the current mandate , Beijing limits most urban couples to one child and rural couples to two to conserve scarce resources .
Critics say the policy has led to forced abortions , sterilizations and a dangerously imbalanced sex ratio due to a traditional preference for male heirs that has prompted countless families to abort female fetuses .
There are also concerns about China 's aging population , with those aged 60 or older expected to top 200 million by 2015 and 280 million by 2025 , according to the government .
The CPPCC includes representatives of China 's main business , religious and other non-communist groups .
The session will run through March 14 .
Wu said the hot topics this session include macroeconomic controls , government restructuring , employment rates , consumer price stability , climate change , and reform of the financial , educational and health care systems .

The disks were protected by a password , the government said , but were not encrypted .
They were sent by Her Majesty ’s Revenue and Customs , the country ’s tax collection agency , to the National Audit Office , which monitors government spending , via a parcel delivery company , TNT .
According to the chancellor of the Exchequer , Alistair Darling , who delivered a lengthy explanation to the House of Commons on Tuesday , a “ junior ” staff member sent the disks .
Three weeks later , the tax agency ’s managers were informed that the disks had not arrived .
Mr. Darling said he was told of the problem two days later , but first had law enforcement officials hunt for the disks and then alerted banks .
“ In making this statement today , ” he said , “ I have had to balance the imperative of informing the House and the public at the earliest opportunity , whilst at the same time ensuring that when I did so the appropriate safeguards were in place to protect the public , including in relation to bank accounts .
Indeed the banks were adamant that they wanted as much time as possible to prepare for this announcement . ”
But on Wednesday , a spokeswoman for the British Bankers Association , Lesley McLeod , said the group had been informed only on Friday , and that its security measures had been completed by Monday .
Mr. Darling noted two other instances in which the tax agency had sent delicate information to the National Audit Office that were not in keeping with security rules : first in March this year , and then a second time in October , when the audit office first told the tax agency that the two disks had not arrived .
Those , he said , were sent by registered mail , and did arrive .
Experts on security data said there were signs of systemic security problems .
“ It sort of beggars belief how anyone could have access to that data , ” Simon Zimmo , the commercial director for Europe , the Middle East and Africa at SecuriData , a data security specialist based in Scotland .
Experts said the information could allow crimes beyond identity theft .
Some people use the name of a child or part of an address as a password on a bank account , so the combination of these details could allow someone to break their code .
“ You can bet your bottom dollar that there will be people out there looking for those disks , and it ’s not just MI5 trying to get them back , ” said Mike Davis , an analyst with the Ovum technology consulting firm in London , referring to the British domestic security services .
New research from Vanderbilt University shows for the first time that the brain processes aggression as a reward – much like sex , food and drugs – offering insights into our propensity to fight and our fascination with violent sports like boxing and football .
The research will be published online the week of Jan. 14 by the journal Psychopharmacology .
“ Aggression occurs among virtually all vertebrates and is necessary to get and keep important resources such as mates , territory and food , ” Craig Kennedy , professor of special education and pediatrics , said .
“ We have found that the ‘ reward pathway ’ in the brain becomes engaged in response to an aggressive event and that dopamine is involved . ”
“ It is well known that dopamine is produced in response to rewarding stimuli such as food , sex and drugs of abuse , ” Maria Couppis , who conducted the study as her doctoral thesis at Vanderbilt , said .
“ What we have now found is that it also serves as positive reinforcement for aggression . ”
For the experiments , a pair of mice – one male , one female – was kept in one cage and five intruder ” mice were kept in a separate cage .
The female mouse was temporarily removed , and an intruder mouse was introduced in its place , triggering an aggressive response by the “ home ” male mouse .
Aggressive behavior included tail rattle , an aggressive sideways stance , boxing and biting .
The home mouse was then trained to poke a target with its nose to get the intruder to return , at which point it again behaved aggressively toward it .
The home mouse consistently poked the trigger , which was presented once a day , indicating it experienced the aggressive encounter with the intruder as a reward .
The same home mice were then treated with a drug that suppressed their dopamine receptors .
After this treatment , they decreased the frequency with which they instigated the intruder ’s entry .
In a separate experiment , the mice were treated with the dopamine receptor suppressors again and their movements in an open cage were observed .
They showed no significant changes in overall movement compared to times when they had not received the drugs .
This was done to demonstrate that their decreased aggression in the previous experiment was not caused by overall lethargy in response to the drug , a problem that had confounded previous experiments .
The Vanderbilt experiments are the first to demonstrate a link between behavior and the activity of dopamine receptors in response to an aggressive event .
“ We learned from these experiments that an individual will intentionally seek out an aggressive encounter solely because they experience a rewarding sensation from it , ” Kennedy said .
“ This shows for the first time that aggression , on its own , is motivating , and that the well - known positive reinforcer dopamine plays a critical role . ”

VIDEO UPDATE : U.S. Named One of ' Top Five ' Executioners with China , Iran , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia ; Bush Kids Around With Pope : ' All human life is sacred '
Brad Friedman Byon
4/16/2008 , 10:51 pm PT
Speaking of perverse discordance on the same day the Pope was serenaded with " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " at the White House ( where Bush told him he gave an " awesome speech ! " ) , the Supreme Court found that state - sponsored executions by lethal injection were just fine and dandy , as far as the U.S. Constitution was concerned .
The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the most common method of lethal injection used to execute condemned prisoners is constitutional , a decision sure to restart the nation 's dormant death chambers .
...
" Simply because an execution method may result in pain , either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death , does not establish the sort of ' objectively intolerable risk of harm ' that qualifies as cruel and unusual , " wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr .
Roberts , of course , is Catholic .
As are a total of 5 of the 9 justices now on the bench , 7 of whom gave the thumbs up to the continued use of a three - drug cocktail in order to kill citizens convicted of capital crimes .
That , despite plaintiffs arguments that " if the first drug does not work , the second induces a ' terrifying , conscious paralysis ' and the third causes an ' excruciating burning pain as it courses through the veins . ' "
Of course , the Catholic Church strongly opposes all such state - sponsored executions .
Yet all 5 of the Catholic justices joined the majority decision to end a temporary national moratorium on state - sponsored killing of criminals .
All on the very same day the Pope came to D.C .
You 'll forgive us then , if we see something --- yes --- perversely discordant in that .
Again .
UPDATE 4/17/08 : This morning , Democracy Now covered the Supremes ' end to the de facto Death Penality Moratorium , noting that " the decision came one day after Amnesty International named the United States one of the top five executioners in the world , along with China , Iran , Pakistan , and Saudi Arabia . "
Could n't be prouder to be in such fine company .
Good luck finding that AI stat --- reporting that of the 1200 people executed by governments last year , 88 % of them occurred in those five countries alone --- in the American corporate media today .
No doubt , George W. Bush feels equally proud , even if we 're not yet # 1 in that area .
And even though he said yesterday to the Pope , during the WH ceremony , as our own Alan Breslauer notes in the perversely discordant :38 second video at right : " In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded , we need your message that all human life is sacred . "
Bush was , of course , just kidding .
The Obama campaign said it was amassing a " grassroots army "
The campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has announced another sizeable haul of donations ahead of a key vote in Pennsylvania .
Mr Obama raised $ 40 m ( £ 20 m ) in March after taking a record $ 55 m in February .
The campaign of his Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton , admitted it had been outraised but said it had enough funds to compete .
Mrs Clinton is hoping to peg back Mr Obama 's lead when Pennsylvania holds its primary election on 22 April .
The latest count of pledged delegates to the National Convention in August , according to Associated Press , puts Mr Obama at 1,634 and Mrs Clinton at 1,500 .
A total of 2,024 is needed to win the Democratic nomination .
Senator John McCain has already sewn up the Republican nomination and will fight the presidential election in November .
Analysts say the presidential campaign is shaping up to become the first billion - dollar US election .
McCain task
The key upcoming votes for the Democrats are Pennsylvania , with 158 delegates up for grabs , and North Carolina and Indiana in May .
The Obama campaign says it is relying heavily on small donors , with 442,000 contributing in March .
BARACK OBAMA : 1,634 States won : 25
HILLARY CLINTON : 1,500 States won : 16
Delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,024
Source : Associated Press , as of 3 April Campaign manager David Plouffe said : " Many of our contributors are volunteering for the campaign , making our campaign the largest grassroots army in recent political history . "
Clinton campaign communications chief Howard Wolfson admitted Mr Obama had " outraised us over the last several months " .
But he said : " I would remind everyone that he outspent us over two to one on television in Ohio and Texas ... we were able to win despite being outspent . "
The Clinton campaign will not reveal its March donations take until the deadline of 20 April .
A new telephone opinion poll by Quinnipiac University suggested Mrs Clinton held a nine - point lead over Mr Obama in Pennsylvania , down from 12 points two weeks before .
Neither candidate can secure the 2,024 delegates needed by winning the remaining primaries alone , analysts say , and will need the votes of so - called super - delegates who are not bound by pledges .
Mr McCain meanwhile has said he is pressing on with his task of finding a vice - presidential running mate .
" I 'd like to get it done as early as possible .
I 'm aware of enhanced importance of this issue given my age , " the 71 - year - old Arizona senator said .

What are these ?
TOKYO , Dec 28 ( Reuters ) - Flexible concrete that becomes stronger after it cracks is being used in Japanese buildings to protect against earthquakes .
Developed by construction firm Kajima Corp , it contains polymer fibres the thickness of a human hair , commonly used in tyres , that hold it together and prevent cracks from spreading .
Instead , the concrete bends and can bear an even stronger load after it cracks , the company said , making buildings stronger if they are jolted by one of Japan ’s many quakes .
“ It will be totally fine even if a giant earthquake hits , ” said Tetsushi Kanda , a senior engineer at Kajima .
He said it stretches 100 times more than regular concrete .
Japan , which prides itself on its quake - resistant engineering standards , was traumatised by the destruction of concrete elevated highways and buildings in a magnitude 7.3 tremor in the western city of Kobe in 1995 that killed more than 6,400 people .
Kajima said in such an earthquake its bendable concrete would have no visible cracks and would retain its strength .
So far , two new high - rise buildings using it have been built in Japan and up to 100 buildings and infrastructures have been reinforced with it .
The product , which took over 10 years develop , was introduced around 2003 but holds only 0.1 percent of Japan ’s concrete market , Kanda said , partly because it costs 10 times more than regular concrete .
“ We ’re working to find a way to fully utilise the capability of this material while bringing down the price , ” Kanda said .
Japan , situated on the “ Ring of Fire ” arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches around the Pacific Ocean , accounts for about 20 percent of the world ’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater .

Just a few cents of every gallon goes to the gas station when you fill up - most goes to those that produce the oil .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Motorists may fume when forking over $ 3 a gallon at the local service station , but as it turns out , your local filling spot makes chump change from a gallon of gas .
So exactly who is getting rich ?
Oil traders :
While often blamed for pushing up prices , traders do n't necessarily benefit from the high price of crude or gasoline ; they profit from how much the price changes .
Traders can get rich - as long as they bet correctly on whether prices will rise or fall .
For example , an investment bank that makes a bet that the price of oil will rise makes money when oil prices go from $ 95 to $ 100 a barrel - or $ 100 to $ 95 if it bet the price will fall - not on the difference between production cost and trading price .
" If you wanna keep your job , you gotta be more right than wrong , " said John Kilduff , an energy analyst at the trading firm MF Global in New York , explaining how traders make their money .
Gas stations : A surprisingly small amount goes to the guy who runs the station .
Most service stations are independently owned and operated and take in between 7 and 10 cents for every gallon they sell , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
That 7 to 10 cents going to the gas station is n't even profit .
Out of that , station owners still have to pay leases , workers , and other expenses - leaving them with a profit of just a few cents .
For the service stations , most profit comes from selling coffee , cigarettes , food and other amenities .
These calculations are based off of EIA 's most recent numbers , when gas was $ 3.04 a gallon .
Gasoline hit another record nationwide average of $ 3.27 a gallon Thursday .
Taxes :
The government takes about 40 cents right off the top , with about 18 cents going to the feds .
State taxes vary widely , but the national average is about 22 cents a gallon .
Most of this money is used to build and maintain roads .
Transportation : Getting the gas from refineries to service stations via trucks or pipelines - and the cost of storing it in large tanks - eats up another 23 to 26 cents per gallon .
Refining : About 24 cents a gallon goes to refining companies like Valero ( VLO , Fortune 500 ) , Sunoco ( SUN , Fortune 500 ) or Frontier ( FTO , Fortune 500 ) that specialize in turning crude oil into gas .
Some companies like ExxonMobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) , Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP , Fortune 500 ) also have refining operations .
Profits for refiners have been squeezed lately because the price they pay for oil has risen so much faster than the price they can sell the gas for .
This helps explain why Big Oil companies - like Exxon , which actually buys more crude oil than it produces - have n't seen their profits rise as much as the price of oil .
Crude oil :
This is the most expensive part of a gallon of gas .
Of every gallon of gas $ 2.07 from every gallon of gas goes to producers of crude like Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , BP ( BP ) , and smaller outfits like Anadarko ( APC , Fortune 500 ) and Marathon ( MRO , Fortune 500 ) , or national oil companies controlled by countries like Saudi Arabia , Mexico or Venezuela .
Crude currently trades around $ 110 a barrel , but breaking down the money in that barrel of oil is tough .
Exploration and production costs , royalty payments - all a big part of $ 110 a barrel oil - vary widely country by country and project by project .
" It 's difficult to generalize ; there 's a whole spectrum of costs , " said Ron Planting , an economist with the American Petroleum Institute , an industry trade group .
They can range from $ 1 a barrel to produce crude in Saudi Arabia to over $ 70 a barrel to find , develop and pump oil in the deep water Gulf of Mexico or off the coast of Algeria , said Ann - Louise Hittle , an oil analyst with the energy consultants Wood Mackenzie .
EIA estimates it costs U.S. oil companies an average of about $ 24 a barrel to find , develop and produce oil worldwide , but that does n't include costs like transportation , administration , or income taxes - which can be substantial .
While Exxon made $ 40 billion in 2007 , a 60 % increase from 2004 , it paid $ 100 billion in taxes and royalties .
Nonetheless , $ 40 billion - or any of the record profits seen by most oil companies over the last few years - is certainly a lot of money , and it has put Big Oil in lawmaker 's cross hairs .
Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass. , has called the chief executives of the five biggest oil companies to testify on the industry 's record profits on April 1st .
Markey 's office swears it 's no April fool 's joke .

30 - year - mission crosses the boundary out of the solar system .
Voyager 2 has followed Voyager 1 through the termination shock boundary .
NASA
SAN FRANCISCO – Like a soft orange that fell just a bit too hard from its tree , the giant bubble that protects the solar system from interstellar space is squashed on one side , new data show .
On 30 August , NASA ’s Voyager 2 spacecraft — which has been sailing through space since 1977 — crossed the ‘ termination shock ’ , the boundary between the bubble in space dominated by the solar wind coming from the Sun and the transition region beyond that lies between Earth and interstellar space .
Voyager 2 ’s twin , Voyager 1 , crossed this same boundary in December 2004 .
But Voyager 2 did it while almost 1 billion miles closer to the Sun , suggesting that something — such as an interstellar magnetic field — is compressing the bubble of the solar wind on that side .
The twin Voyagers headed out of the solar system in different directions , with Voyager 1 taking a northern path and Voyager 2 a southern one .
“ Now both spacecraft are in the final frontier of the solar system , ” says project scientist Edward Stone , of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
“ We ’ve reached another major milestone in our 30 years of discovery . ”
He and other Voyager scientists presented their findings on Monday at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco .
More than one instrument aboard Voyager 2 captured its transition out of the solar wind bubble , across the termination shock .
In particular , key data came from an instrument that measures the velocity , temperature and density of the solar wind .
When Voyager 1 crossed the same boundary back in 2004 , its identical instrument was n’t working , leading to much confusion and several years of debate over when exactly it had made the crossing .
1,2
But because its instruments were functioning correctly this August , Voyager 2 actually captured the crossing at least five times , as the termination shock washed back and forth over the spacecraft like a wave on a beach .
Surprisingly , the charged particles on the other side were much cooler than thought , says John Richardson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Researchers had expected the particles to be on the order of 1 million degrees , but instead they were a mere 100,000 to 200,000 degrees , he says .
Some of that energy may have been dissipated by accelerating other speeding particles known as cosmic rays , he says .
Voyager scientists intend to keep taking data as long as NASA keeps funding the missions .
Stone says he expects that within a decade , both will move out of the transition region and into true interstellar space — becoming the first manmade objects to fully exit the solar system .
Radioactive generators aboard each spacecraft , powering their electrical systems , may allow them to transmit through the transition and beyond .
Voyager 1 is currently nearly 10 billion miles from the Sun , travelling nearly a million miles a day .
Voyager 2 is nearly 8 billion miles away , and moving just slightly slower .
ADVERTISEMENT
Next June , NASA plans to launch its orbiting Interstellar Boundary Explorer mission , which will study particles coming from the termination shock .
It would , says Stone , provide a three - dimensional picture of this region to help flesh out the two data points the Voyagers have provided so far .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Speaker of the House of Representatives on Thursday called on the White House to temporarily stop sending crude oil into the nation ’s emergency stockpile .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters she was calling on President George W. Bush to work with Democrats to find a way to “ temporarily suspend ” oil deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
The White House immediately rejected the plea .
“ We do n’t believe the fill rates have a meaningful impact on oil supplies , ” White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said .
“ We continue to fill the reserve to provide an added layer of protection to the American people in cases of severe supply disruption . ”
Pelosi said suspending deliveries would save drivers 5 cents to 24 cents per gallon at the pump .
As U.S. benchmark crude oil prices hit a record near $ 120 a barrel this week , the Bush administration insists that filling the reserve accounts for less than one - tenth of 1 percent of daily supply , and has no meaningful effect on prices .
The nearly 701 million barrels of crude oil stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas are meant as a supply buffer in case of major supply disruptions like the 2005 hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast oil patch .
It was created by Congress in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo .
Current shipments come to about 70,000 barrels per day , while the United States uses about 21 million bpd .
Democrats in the Senate are also pursuing legislation that would require the Energy Department to suspend shipments to the reserve if prices are too high .
Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said he would seek to attach an amendment to an upcoming supplemental appropriations bill that would forbid the government from sending oil to the SPR if oil prices are above $ 75 a barrel .
“ I believe I have the votes , ” Dorgan told reporters .
“ I think I ’m going to be able to get this dome . ”

Buying an iPhone is n't the same as buying a car or a toaster .
Your iPhone comes with a complicated list of rules about what you can and can't do with it .
You can't install unapproved third - party applications on it .
You can't unlock it and use it with the cellphone carrier of your choice .
And Apple is serious about these rules : A software update released in September 2007 erased unauthorized software and – in some cases – rendered unlocked phones unusable .
" Bricked " is the term , and Apple is n't the least bit apologetic about it .
Computer companies want more control over the products they sell you , and they 're resorting to increasingly draconian security measures to get that control .
The reasons are economic .
Control allows a company to limit competition for ancillary products .
With Mac computers , anyone can sell software that does anything .
But Apple gets to decide who can sell what on the iPhone .
It can foster competition when it wants , and reserve itself a monopoly position when it wants .
And it can dictate terms to any company that wants to sell iPhone software and accessories .
This increases Apple 's bottom line .
But the primary benefit of all this control for Apple is that it increases lock - in .
" Lock - in " is an economic term for the difficulty of switching to a competing product .
For some products – cola , for example – there 's no lock - in .
I can drink a Coke today and a Pepsi tomorrow : no big deal .
But for other products , it 's harder .
Switching word processors , for example , requires installing a new application , learning a new interface and a new set of commands , converting all the files ( which may not convert cleanly ) and custom software ( which will certainly require rewriting ) , and possibly even buying new hardware .
If Coke stops satisfying me for even a moment , I 'll switch : something Coke learned the hard way in 1985 when it changed the formula and started marketing New Coke .
But my word processor has to really piss me off for a good long time before I 'll even consider going through all that work and expense .
Lock - in is n't new .
It 's why all gaming - console manufacturers make sure that their game cartridges do n't work on any other console , and how they can price the consoles at a loss and make the profit up by selling games .
It 's why Microsoft never wants to open up its file formats so other applications can read them .
It 's why music purchased from Apple for your iPod wo n't work on other brands of music players .
It 's why every U.S. cellphone company fought against phone number portability .
It 's why Facebook sues any company that tries to scrape its data and put it on a competing website .
It explains airline frequent flyer programs , supermarket affinity cards and the new My Coke Rewards program .
With enough lock - in , a company can protect its market share even as it reduces customer service , raises prices , refuses to innovate and otherwise abuses its customer base .
It should be no surprise that this sounds like pretty much every experience you 've had with IT companies :
Once the industry discovered lock - in , everyone started figuring out how to get as much of it as they can .
Economists Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian even proved that the value of a software company is the total lock - in .
Here 's the logic : Assume , for example , that you have 100 people in a company using MS Office at a cost of $ 500 each .
If it cost the company less than $ 50,000 to switch to Open Office , they would .
If it cost the company more than $ 50,000 , Microsoft would increase its prices .
Mostly , companies increase their lock - in through security mechanisms .
Sometimes patents preserve lock - in , but more often it 's copy protection , digital rights management ( DRM ) , code signing or other security mechanisms .
These security features are n't what we normally think of as security :
They do n't protect us from some outside threat , they protect the companies from us .
Microsoft has been planning this sort of control - based security mechanism for years .
First called Palladium and now NGSCB ( Next - Generation Secure Computing Base ) , the idea is to build a control - based security system into the computing hardware .
The details are complicated , but the results range from only allowing a computer to boot from an authorized copy of the OS to prohibiting the user from accessing " unauthorized " files or running unauthorized software .
The competitive benefits to Microsoft are enormous ( .pdf ) .
Of course , that 's not how Microsoft advertises NGSCB .
The company has positioned it as a security measure , protecting users from worms , Trojans and other malware .
But control does not equal security ; and this sort of control - based security is very difficult to get right , and sometimes makes us more vulnerable to other threats .
Perhaps this is why Microsoft is quietly killing NGSCB – we 've gotten BitLocker , and we might get some other security features down the line – despite the huge investment hardware manufacturers made when incorporating special security hardware into their motherboards .
In my last column , I talked about the security - versus - privacy debate , and how it 's actually a debate about liberty versus control .
Here we see the same dynamic , but in a commercial setting .
By confusing control and security , companies are able to force control measures that work against our interests by convincing us they are doing it for our own safety .
As for Apple and the iPhone , I do n't know what they 're going to do .
On the one hand , there 's this analyst report that claims there are over a million unlocked iPhones , costing Apple between $ 300 million and $ 400 million in revenue .
On the other hand , Apple is planning to release a software development kit this month , reversing its earlier restriction and allowing third - party vendors to write iPhone applications .
Apple will attempt to keep control through a secret application key that will be required by all " official " third - party applications , but of course it 's already been leaked .
And the security arms race goes on ...

A Growing Epidemic of Internet Addiction
In the digital era , the Internet has made life convenient and a lot more hassle - free .
Beginning from online shopping , watching videos , listening to music to reading books and much more – the internet has become man ’s eternal companion .
However , our literal addiction to it is often cited as the root cause of fatal and chronic lifestyle diseases .
Problematic usage of computers is a growing social issue worldwide .
Internet Addiction Disorder , known as IAD , creates neurological complications such as loss in concentration and insomnia , various psychological disturbances and social problems like separation in marriages , shifting focus from work and much more .
Surveys in Europe and the United States have indicated occurrences of the same , the rates of which have ranged from 1.5 to 8 percent .
Most of these issues emerge owing to diminishing social lives , consequences of adversities in work or academics , anxiety and depression resulting because of family conflicts and mood swings .
Some medical conditions originating from such addictions are neurological vulnerabilities wherein there is an excessive release of dopamine in the brain .
This affects the receptors which are responsible for carrying information to and from the brain .
We are here to help
On this website , you will find a variety of blog posts on the perilous Internet addictions , their hazards , the psychological and physical behavioral changes that it results in and how one can overcome the same by certain digital detox programs .
Complete abstinence from Internet can never be the appropriate cure for an addict .
It is important for people around the concerned person to motivate and encourage them in a way such that they limit their Internet usage .

Palestinian and Egyptian officials have outlined the deal , which they say would include an extended period of calm , the lifting of the Israeli embargo on Gaza , and a possible prisoner exchange .
Mr. Olmert on Monday denied holding negotiations for a cease - fire , but said that if the militants stopped launching rockets and smuggling weapons into Gaza , Israel would have no reason to fight .
In a meeting with Jordanian newspaper editors , the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , of Fatah , criticized the use of rockets by Hamas , a rival , contending that they caused more harm to the Palestinians than to the Israelis .
In remarks published in the Jordanian papers on Tuesday , Mr. Abbas said : “ What resistance are we talking about ?
Are rockets and suicide attacks considered as resistance ? ”
In late February , Mr. Abbas recalled his own role in the early Palestinian resistance and raised questions about his future commitment to peaceful negotiations .
“ At this time , I object to the armed struggle , since we are unable to conduct it ; however , in future stages , things may change , ” he was quoted as saying in Al Dustour , a Jordanian daily newspaper , according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute , a nonprofit organization .
In Gaza City on Tuesday , a group of young Hamas supporters persuaded dozens of Palestinian livestock owners to take their animals to a demonstration outside the local offices of the United Nations .
They were seeking to draw attention to the blockade , in which Israel has for months allowed only essential goods , mostly supplied by relief organizations , into Gaza .
The livestock owners were paid 100 shekels each ( about $ 28 ) to attend the protest , as well as transportation costs .
Hundreds of animals  sheep , camels and donkeys  came from all over Gaza .
Fatah supporters refused to take part .
Ashraf Abu Amrah , 24 , who came with 16 donkeys , said he had to support more than 20 relatives on about $ 10 a day .
He used to make a lot of money with his donkey carts , transporting cement for construction projects , he said .
Now cement is in short supply and the price of hay has doubled because of the blockade , he said .
Another demonstrator , Muhammad Dagmush , 45 , said if he fed his horse as well as he wanted , “ I would n’t eat . ”

Whereas historians obsessively trace every event ’s causal lineage further and further into the past , nonhistorians tend toward the opposite extreme : they assume in effect that the world began immediately before the event they have in mind .
I call this unfortunate tendency “ truncating the antecedents . ”
Among the general public , it has given rise to mistaken interpretations of historical causation in cases too numerous to mention , and mistakes of this sort continue to occur frequently , in part because politicians and other conniving parties have an interest in propagating them .
I was recently struck by this tendency while reading comments at a group blog associated with the History News Network .
A commentator there had mentioned that the blame for World War II is not as cut and dried as Americans typically assume it to be , and hence some revisionism is long overdue .
In response , another discussant , whose previous contributions to the blog show that he is an intelligent man , expressed bafflement : “ Yes , obviously some revisionism regarding the ‘ great allied leaders ’ of WWII is called for .
But an attempt to be revisionist about the justness of a war where U.S. territory is attacked by one opponent and war is declared on the U.S. by the other opponent is sort of like justifying the War on Iraq on the basis of mythical WMD . ”
Like Americans in general , this man takes the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , and the German declaration of war on December 11 , 1941 , as dispositive evidence that Japan and Germany started the war that ensued between these nations and the United States , and therefore he concludes that they should be held responsible for it .
In a later post , he persists in this interpretation by saying : “ Nation X attacks Nation Y .
One or the other is right .
Either Nation Y is a victim or the attack was a ‘ justified pre-emptive attack . ’
Yes , the response may be disproportionate , etc. , but those really are n’t reasons to declare Nation Y ‘ wrong . ’
Or the two ‘ equally wrong . ' ”
This view represents a classic case of truncating the antecedents .
Many people are misled by formalities .
They assume , for example , that the United States went to war against Germany and Japan only after its declarations of war against these nations in December 1941 .
In truth , the United States had been at war for a long time before making these declarations .
Its warmaking took a variety of forms .
For example , the U.S. navy conducted “ shoot [ Germans ] on sight ” convoys , which might include British ships , in the North Atlantic along the greater part the shipping route from the United States to Great Britain , even though German U - boats had orders to refrain ( and did refrain ) from initiating attacks on American shipping .
The United States and Great Britain entered into arrangements to pool intelligence , combine weapons development , test military equipment jointly , and undertake other forms of war - related cooperation .
The U.S. military actively cooperated with the British military in combat operations against the Germans , for example , by alerting the British navy of aerial or marine sightings of German submarines , which the British then attacked .
The U.S. government undertook in countless ways to provide military and other supplies and assistance to the British , the French , and the Soviets , who were fighting the Germans .
The U.S. government provided military and other supplies and assistance , including warplanes and pilots , to the Chinese , who were at war with Japan .
The U.S. military actively engaged in planning with the British , the British Commonwealth countries , and the Dutch East Indies for future combined combat operations against Japan .
Most important , the U.S. government engaged in a series of increasingly stringent economic warfare measures that pushed the Japanese into a predicament that U.S. authorities well understood would probably provoke them to attack U.S. territories and forces in the Pacific region in a quest to secure essential raw materials that the Americans , British , and Dutch ( government in exile ) had embargoed .
Consider these summary statements by George Victor , by no means a Roosevelt basher , in his recently published , well - documented book The Pearl Harbor Myth : Rethinking the Unthinkable ( Dulles , Va. : Potomac Books , 2007 ) .
Roosevelt had already led the United States into war with Germany in the spring of 1941 — into a shooting war on a small scale .
From then on , he gradually increased U.S. military participation .
Japan ’s attack on December 7 enabled him to increase it further and to obtain a war declaration .
Pearl Harbor is more fully accounted for as the end of a long chain of events , with the U.S. contribution reflecting a strategy formulated after France fell .
. . .
In the eyes of Roosevelt and his advisers , the measures taken early in 1941 justified a German declaration of war on the United State — a declaration that did not come , to their disappointment .
. . .
Roosevelt told his ambassador to France , William Bullitt , that U.S. entry into war against Germany was certain but must wait for an “ incident , ” which he was “ confident that the Germans would give us . ” . . .
Establishing a record in which the enemy fired the first shot was a theme that ran through Roosevelt ’s tactics .
. . .
He seems [ eventually ] to have concluded — correctly as it turned out — that Japan would be easier to provoke into a major attack on the Unites States than Germany would be .
( pp. 179— 80 , 184 , 185 , emphasis added )
The claim that Japan attacked the United States without provocation was . . . typical rhetoric .
It worked because the public did not know that the administration had expected Japan to respond with war to anti-Japanese measures it had taken in July 1941 .
. . .
Expecting to lose a war with the United States — and lose it disastrously — Japan ’s leaders had tried with growing desperation to negotiate .
On this point , most historians have long agreed .
Meanwhile , evidence has come out that Roosevelt and Hull persistently refused to negotiate .
. . . Japan . . . offered compromises and concessions , which the United States countered with increasing demands .
. . .
It was after learning of Japan ’s decision to go to war with the United States if the talks “ break down ” that Roosevelt decided to break them off .
. . .
According to Attorney General Francis Biddle , Roosevelt said he hoped for an “ incident ” in the Pacific to bring the United States into the European war .
( pp. 15 , 202 , 240 )
These facts and numerous others that point in the same direction are for the most part anything but new ; many of them have been available to the public since the 1940s .
As early as 1953 , anyone might have read a collection of heavily documented essays on various aspects of U.S. foreign policy in the late 1930s and early 1940s that showed the various ways in which the U.S. government bore responsibility for the country ’s eventual engagement in World War II — showed , in short , that the Roosevelt administration wanted to get the country into the war and worked craftily along various avenues to ensure that , sooner or later , it would get in , preferably in a way that would unite public opinion behind the war by making the United States appear to have been the victim of an aggressor ’s unprovoked attack .
( See Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace : A Critical Examination of the Foreign Policy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Its Aftermath , edited by Harry Elmer Barnes [ Caldwell , Id. : Caxton Printers , 1953 ] . )
As Secretary of War Henry Stimson testified after the war , “ we needed the Japanese to commit the first overt act ” ( qtd. in Victor , Pearl Harbor Myth , p. 105 ) .
At present , however , sixty - seven or more years after these events , probably not one American in 1,000 — nay , not one in 10,000 — has an inkling of any of this history .
So effective has been the pro-Roosevelt , pro-American , pro-World War II faction that in this country it has utterly dominated teaching and popular writing about U.S. engagement in the “ Good War . ”
Only a few years ago , when an essay of mine was included in a collection being considered for publication by the University of Chicago Press , the press ’s expert outside reader expressed shock that I had mentioned in passing Roosevelt ’s pre-Pearl Harbor maneuvers to bring the country into the war , and he declared that crackpot statements of this sort would discredit the entire volume .
( In deference to the editor and to discourage the volume ’s rejection by the press , I removed the single obnoxious sentence , which was not central to my purposes in the essay in any event , and eventually the book was published , notwithstanding this “ expert ’s ” negative appraisal of my own contributions to it . )
Observations such the foregoing ones tend to elicit angry accusations of “ Holocaust denial ” and “ moral equivalence , ” among many others .
For the record , then , let me avow that I do not deny the Holocaust , nor do I regard the Roosevelt administration as morally equivalent to Hitler ’s regime .
While I am making my innocence plain , let me also avow that I do not regard the Roosevelt administration as morally equivalent to Stalin ’s regime .
This latter comparison comes up surprisingly seldom , however , given that the two regimes were close allies in the war , and , most important , that the major outcome of the war was to leave Stalin and his puppet regimes astride the greater part of the European continent in an area that stretches from the Urals to Bohemia and from Estonia to Azerbaijan .
In short , if anyone deserves to be recognized as the war ’s “ winner , ” that person is Stalin .
Somehow this fact has never seemed to me to fit comfortably into a characterization of this horrible conflict as the “ Good War . ”
Perhaps I ’m just unduly squeamish .
The fate of the European Jews also requires mention , inasmuch as after the war many people professed to believe that saving the Jews was the war ’s prime justification .
Aside from the fact that none of the Allied leaders held that view — Roosevelt himself was a genteel anti-Semite of the sort typical in his time , place , and class — the undeniable truth is that the Jews were not saved : approximately 80 percent of them had perished by the end of the war .
Little wonder , too , because U.S. and British war plans did not give high priority to saving them ; as a rule , those plans completely disregarded the urgent need to rescue the surviving Jews .
Few Americans have ever entertained the idea that their country ought not to have entered World War II .
They persist in believing that they — the ordinary people of the country , as distinct from its political leaders and their foreign legionnaires — were genuinely threatened by the Japanese and the Germans and therefore that the war “ had to be fought . ”
Even George Victor , from whose honest and useful book The Pearl Harbor Myth I quoted earlier , has brought himself to believe that Roosevelt had excellent motives for his persistent provocation of Germany and Japan .
Thus , he writes : “ As Germany began to prepare for conquest , genocide , and destruction of civilization , the leader of only one major nation saw what was coming and made plans to stop it .
As a result of Roosevelt ’s leadership , a planned sequence of events carried out in the Atlantic and more decisively in the Pacific brought the United States into one of the world ’s greatest cataclysms .
The American contribution helped turn the war ’s tide and saved the world from a destructive tyranny unparalleled in modern history ” ( p. 16 ) .
Unparalleled ?
What about Stalin ’s tyranny or Mao’s ?
Regardless of one ’s answer to this question , however , another question remains — whether Nazi Germany , as evil as it certainly was , had the ability to defeat the United States , much less to “ destroy civilization . ”
Americans love to speculate about German acquisition of atomic weapons , intercontinental ballistic missiles , and other military capabilities the Nazis , in fact , never came close to acquiring .
As things actually stood , Germany lacked the capability to invade and conquer even Great Britain .
Conquering the United States , thousands of miles across the Atlantic , was realistically inconceivable .
Whatever else one may take U.S. leaders ’ motives for war to have been in the early 1940 ’s , national self - preservation could not have been among them , unless they were shockingly ill - advised as to the economic , logistical , and technological constraints on the German war machine .
In reality , that machine had its hands more than full in dealing with the Soviets on the eastern front , not to mention the British and others who were pestering it on other fronts .
Thirty - six years ago , Bruce M. Russett ’s little book No Clear and Present Danger : A Skeptical View of the U.S. Entry into World War II ( New York : Harper & Row , 1972 ) was published .
Russett noted at the outset that “ [ p] articipation in the war against Hitler remains almost wholly sacrosanct , nearly in the realm of theology ” ( p. 12 ) .
In this regard , nothing has changed since 1972 .
Yet Russett argued forcefully , with logic and evidence , that this orthodoxy rests on shaky grounds .
He concluded that World War II “ may well have been an unnecessary war that did little for us and that we need not have fought ” ( p. 20 ) .
Nor did he concede that although the war may have been imprudent on instrumental grounds , it was well justified on moral grounds : “ it is precisely moral considerations that demand a reexamination of our World War II myths , ” he insisted ( p. 21 ) .
Although much has been added to the corpus of World War II scholarship since the publication of Russett ’s book , this little volume remains unjustly neglected , and its argument deserves serious consideration even now .
Of course , many other great events in American history might be examined as I have suggested U.S. participation in World War II ought to be examined — by taking the relevant antecedents fully into account .
For historians , this advice should be unnecessary ; if they know anything , they know that history did not begin yesterday .
The American people at large , however , remain extremely vulnerable to misleading descriptions of the government ’s actions , especially its plunges into foreign wars — accounts of which generally disregard many relevant antecedents , particularly those that cast blame on the United States for stirring up enmities abroad .
Yet , any honest account of U.S. foreign policy reveals that this country ’s government has engaged again and again in foreign interventions whose official justifications cannot withstand critical scrutiny .
Many of these interventions amounted to little more than armed errand - running for privileged American business interests seeking to beat foreigners into line and , not coincidentally , to line their own pockets .
This aspect of U.S. foreign policy famously led General Smedley Butler to declare that war is a racket .
Time , some wit has said , is God ’s way of keeping everything from happening at once .
Taking this idea to heart , we may remind ourselves and others that whenever the U.S. government launches a new war abroad , we would be well advised to look into what happened in that part of the world previously , perhaps over the course of several decades .
We may well discover that the locals have legitimate grievances against our government or some of its corporate cronies .
Or we may simply discover that the situation is more complicated than it has been made out to be .
We know one thing for certain at the outset , however : we can not rely on the government to tell us the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
Unvarnished truth is to our rulers as holy water is to vampires .

Shenanigans keeps hearing from anonymous friends that former FNC ’er and WH ’er Tony Snow is headed over to CNN .
It ’s an interesting move considering the ever - popular Snow ’s ties to Fox News Channel – he hosted " Fox News Sunday " from 1996 - 2003 when Chris Wallace took over and he still co-hosts a radio show on Fox News with Bill O’Reilly , " The Radio Factor . "
Interestingly , CNN apparently has decided to debut Snow during the Philadelphia Tuesday coverage tomorrow night – quite similar to FNC debuting their new addition , Karl Rove , on Super Tuesday night .
An email was just sent out to the CNN newsroom with a more formal announcement due out later today .
UPDATE : " It 's true , " says CNN 's political director Sam Feist .

A stock tip from two university professors :
If a company ’s chief executive lives in a home the size of a shopping mall , consider dumping its stock .
That ’s right , lavish digs for the company ’s top boss could mean lousy returns for stockholders , say finance Professors Crocker Liu of Arizona State University and David Yermack of New York University .
In a study titled “ Where are the shareholders ’ mansions ?
CEOs ’ home purchases , stock sales and subsequent company performance , ” the two found that for CEOs whose homes were larger than 10,000 square feet or sitting on 10 acres or more , their companies ’ stock price fell an average of 1.7 percent in the year following their home purchase .
For CEOs with more normal - size homes – for CEOs , that ’s close to 5,700 square feet – the company had an average stock - price increase of about 6 percent .
The study , released last month , was based on CEOs of 488 of the companies in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .
Valley executives
In an interview Wednesday , Liu cited a few Silicon Valley CEOs and their home - buying and companies ’ stock performance , although none of the local CEOs ’ homes were larger than 10,000 square feet or sat on a lot that was at least 10 acres .
The examples ranged from dismal to sublime , from a shareholder perspective .
Symantec stock fell 32 percent in the 12 months after CEO John Thompson ’s home purchase in Woodside , Liu said , while Apple ’s stock rose 123 percent after Steve Jobs bought his home , also in Woodside .
Liu did n’t provide any further details of those sales .
And if a CEO sells company stock and then buys a house ?
Beware of that , too .
The authors argue that when a CEO sells shares of his or her company and then buys a home , it ’s a signal of the leader ’s “ entrenchment ” in the company .
The study hypothesized that when some CEOs sold shares , then purchased a home , their companies ’ stock performance was likely to suffer .
But , Liu said , plenty of insider - trading studies show stock sales by CEOs are indicators of future stock declines – regardless of whether a home is purchased .
Some CEOs may be using their imminent home purchase as a pretext for selling shares , he said .
As he and Yermack noted in their paper , such selling is sometimes discouraged by the board of directors , and “ disfavored ” by investors .
` Skin in the game ’
“ The CEOs should put enough skin in the game , ” Liu said .
“ If they are putting in their own money and taking a loan like everybody else , their stock tends to be doing OK . ”
Forty - four percent of CEOs in the study bought homes using a mortgage .
About one - third of CEOs sold company stock in the 12 months before buying a home .
Liu and Yermack studied the home purchases and financing methods of those who were company CEOs as of Dec. 31 , 2004 .
Their assumptions about the value of executives ’ homes were based on valuations on public Web sites Zillow.com and Reply.com in 2006 .
In a sign of how secretive some company executives are , it took Liu and Yermack three years to figure out where 488 of the S&P 500 CEOs lived .
In compiling their property database , the professors culled some little - known tidbits about the homes of the country ’s top bosses , such as :
Median number of bathrooms in a CEO home : 4.5
Median square feet : 5,664
Median value , 2006 : $ 2.7 million
Median distance a CEO lives from the office : 12.5 miles
Percentage of CEOs who live on a golf course : 8.5
Liu and Yermack are in the process of doing further research on the relationships between executives ’ real estate holdings and their companies ’ performance on Wall Street .
Next up : chief executives ’ vacation playgrounds .
“ Some of these CEOs , their vacation homes are even more expensive than their primary residences , ” Liu said .
A couple years ago , this got written up in forbes , alongside the 1KW power generator that Kamen invented which can be run off of burning cow dung ( sterling engine , as I recall it ) .
I think the thought is that the generator and purifier can be run together , or the purifier run off of waste heat from the generator .
Honestly , he 's partnered up with the guy who started the gremayne bank in Bangladesh , so I 'd not brush this off so lightly .
It does n't matter where you are , this device would seem to have some value .
However one might want to knock Kamen , he 's got a lot of smarts and a very idealistic streak to his personality without being a Henry Ford style dictator .
Between his wheelchair , the DARPA arm , the generator and this thing , I 'd say he 's okay by me .
The Twelve Man / Thirteen Man Problem
If you enjoy Sam Loyd , you may also want to check out my post Sam Loyd 's Trick Mules .
- MB
Every few years the " twelve man / thirteen man " puzzle makes its way around the Internet .
And every time I see it I am baffled .
If you do n't know what I 'm talking about , click here .
That 's an animated gif , so keep watching until things move .
When the image first appears , count how many men there are .
Then , after the top halves swap , count them again .
The first time you should count twelve ; the second , thirteen .
I 've long suspected that I could figure out the trick if I really applied myself but , slacker that I am , consistently given up after a minute or so .
Well , I came across the " twelve man / thirteen man " illusion yet again today .
But this time there was an accompanying image by Matthew Sturges , one that colors the men and shows both their start and end positions .
I took his image , added numbers , and finally think I can see what 's going on here .
There 's two reasons this is so hard to wrap your mind around , I 've concluded .
The first is that the drawings look unrefined , which both disguises the fact that the solution is very subtle , and gives the viewer few key features to use as reference .
About the only clearly identifiable body parts are heads , torsos , arms , legs , crotches , and feet .
Note that their hands are all hidden behind their backs -- crafty , that .
The second reason this illusion tends to defy analysis , I think , is because there is no " smoking gun " solution to it , something you can point to and say " Aha !
Here 's where the 13th man comes from . "
That 's because the thirteenth man comes from all twelve of the others .
Look at the start configuration and note that there are twelve of each body part : twelve heads , twelve torsos , twelves pairs of legs , etc .
Now look at the end configuration and note that there are thirteen of each body part .
That makes it seem as if a thirteenth person has somehow materialized .
But now narrow your focus .
Instead of looking at the whole pictures , just pick a single body part .
Pick a man in the first picture , look to see where your chosen body part is , and then look to see where it ends up in the end configuration .
Now repeat this for all twelve of the men .
In all cases -- and this is the key point , kids -- one of the twelve instances of a body part in the first picture is bisected and used twice in the second .
For example , let 's look at faces .
Man # 1 's face in the first picture is below the divider , so it remains with man # 1 in the second picture ; man # 2 's face ( along with the rest of his head ) goes to man # 9 ; man # 3 's face goes to man # 10 .
So far so good .
Now look at man # 4 .
His face is split in half , with the top half going to man # 11 , and the bottom remaining with man # 4 .
In other words , the single face owned by man # 4 in the start configuration is now two faces in the end configuration ; in other other words , where there were twelve faces there are now thirteen .
Pick another body part , do it again , and again you 'll see that one of the body parts in the first picture is split and used as two in the second .
Here 's the breakdown :
Hair : # 1 -> both # 1 & # 8
Face : # 4 -> both # 4 & # 11
Arms : # 2 -> both # 2 & # 9
Torso : # 9 -> both # 5 & # 9
Crotch ( i.e. , point where legs meet torso ) : # 5 -> both # 5 & # 12
Legs : # 12 -> both # 7 & # 12
Feet : # 10 -> both # 6 & # 13
So in the second picture we get a new head of hair , a new face , a new pair of arms , a new torso , a new crotch , a new pair of legs , and a new pair of feet -- all of which adds up to an entire new person .
But these parts are distributed amongst thirteen different composites .
Thus , you can't point to any one person in the second images and say " he 's the new one . "
[ There used to be a few more paragraphs here describing which men in the first picture contributed what to whom in the second , but Jon 's illustration , in the update below , neatly summarizes everything . ]
If you 're still not getting it , take a look at this simplified version of the illusion , where I magically turn five lines into six :
The " twelve man / thirteen man problem " operates on exactly the same principle , although it 's cleverly convoluted to make it seem like there 's more going on .
Notice , for instance , that , on the average , the men in the second picture are shorter than the men in the first , as is the case with the lines above .
Incidentally , this is a variation on Sam Loyd 's famous " Get Off The Earth " puzzle , which you can read more about here .
Update : Good gravy , I can't believe I 'm got to spill yet more virtual ink on this .
But I did say I wanted this to be the definitive page on the subject , so here we go .
Some folks in the comments and claiming that the 12 - 13 Man Problem is waaaaay more straightforward than I am making it out to be .
" Look , " they say , " you have 12 men in the first picture .
You split them into 24 halves and recombine 22 of those halves into 11 people .
Then -- and this is the entire trick -- you point to the remaining two halves and claim they are full people .
11 + 2 = 13 men .
In the final configuration , the two ' half men ' are # 1 and # 13 , each of which gives up a half and does n't get one back . "
They people making this argument are absolutely right : that 's how the trick works in principle , and I said as much in giving the illustration of lines .
But they are ignoring the key element that makes the 12 - 13 Man Problem different from the line example .
If you bisect a line you can truthfully call each of the resultant halves a " line , " but if you cut a person in half you can't claim that you have n't really done anything because each of the two halves is a person itself .
( Believe me , when I used this line the police were not impressed ...)
The 12 - 13 Man Problem is so baffling because each of the final thirteen men looks like a full person , even the two " half - men . "
And it 's not just # 1 and # 13 that are involved : if you were to take the missing half of # 1 and the missing half of # 13 and put them together , one of your men in the final configuration would consist of nothing more than a scalp on a pair of feet .
No , all the men are altered .
And luckily for me , Jon over at Corporate Superhero has created an image that shows how :
In his words : " Basically , the puzzle works by cutting each person in two , taking a small slice of them ( 1/12 of their height ) and passes it over to the right until after 12 people you end up with a whole extra person .
Then the creator mixed up the order of the people so that you could n't see what he did . "
Thank you , Jon -- your picture is worth several thousand of my words .
1. Crude prototypes of the T - shirt were introduced as an undergarment during World War I , when they were worn by European soldiers during the hot summers .
They were the envy of American troops forced to wear wool uniforms .
2. 91 % of Americans admit to having a " favorite T - shirt . " 34 % of those say white is the color of their favorite T - shirt , with almost twice as many votes received as the second most popular color , blue .
3 . The origin of the name " T - Shirt " is unclear .
Many consider the shape of the shirt as a " T " , while it could also refer to the army 's use of these pieces as " training shirts " .
It is also a possibility that the name " tee " comes from the word amputee , an allusion to the arm 's shortened length .
4 . In December of 2007 , Aaron Waltke , 22 , a recent graduate of Indiana University in Bloomington set the Guinness Book World Record for most T - shirts worn by a man at one time : 160 .

If , like me , you are a mortal human being living at this point in history , you face an important decision : science or religion ?
This is perhaps the most fundamental choice of modern life , affecting every aspect of your daily existence , from the smell of your house to whether you would ever buy a book with Chicken Soup in the title .
And yet , few people have looked at this decision from a practical angle .
Most prefer instead to focus on such ephemera as evidence versus faith , or the likelihood of everlasting life .

When you 're looking to buy a car stereo – a device beloved of religious folk and rationalists alike – do you get into long musings on the nature of stereoness , or consider whether you 'll be able to plug your iPod into it after you 're dead ?
No , of course you do not .
You turn to the most powerful epistemological tool available : the checklist .
Here , then , is a checklist to help you decide between the warm embrace of heartfelt faith or the cool reassurance of the scientific method .
Food
Religion has brought us the Easter ham and the Passover brisket .
When religious people gather , they bring Pyrex dishes full of handmade dishes invented back when the term fat - free did n't exist and the closest equivalent word was bland .
Sure , many of these dishes rely a little too heavily on canned green beans and Coca - Cola as ingredients , but their power as comfort food can not be denied .
When scientific people get together at staff meetings and symposia , they get cold sandwiches catered by companies with a strange and dispirited definition of French roll .
Advantage : religion .
Music
Religion gave us Bach , gospel and rock ' n ' roll .
( Hey , Satan is part of religion . )
Science gave us Switched - On Bach , Kraftwerk and house music .
Clearly religion is fastest out of the gate here .
However , religion 's recent contributions to music have been much more dubious , and most can be characterized as sitting comfortably in a Venn diagram hammock between treacle and tripe .
Plus , science provided the technology that allows you to actually listen to music without having to dress up nice first .
Tie .
Sex
Science , taken as a whole , is remarkably silent on the question of whom you should sleep with , when you should sleep with them and how guilty you should feel afterward .
I 've heard it said that the best sex comes from abstaining completely until you commit to doing it with just one person until you die and probably after that too .
How do they know ?
On the other hand , how do I know ?
It seems to me it 's like saying , " Spaghetti is the best food in the universe , provided you eat nothing but spaghetti . "
At any rate , science has no problem with awkward wedding - night ignorance if that 's what you 're into .
Just stick it on the pile with the rest of the fetishes .
Advantage : science .
Stuff
Clearly , if you like owning things other than dirt clods and intestinal parasites , science is ready to step up and give it to you , and stick an iPod dock on it to boot .
However , I 've heard claims that religion can make you not want stuff .
I have to admit , that 's a pretty enticing proposition .
What if I could get the same thrill I get from unboxing a new videogame console just by , I do n't know , seeing a smile on an infant 's face or something stupid like that ?
Think of all the closet space I 'd have !
I sometimes wonder , where are all these people who do n't want material possessions ?
But then I realize they probably do n't have broadband , so I 'd never hear about them even if they did exist .
Tie .
So far , neither science nor religion comes out ahead .
There must be an ultimate winner , however .
Clearly , the only way to decide is through a long and impassioned argument in the comments .
Whoever gives up first loses !

A Yale University student 's bizarre claim to have repeatedly impregnated herself and induced abortions that she videotaped for use in a senior art project is a work of " creative fiction , " the university said yesterday .
Aliza Shvarts 's senior project , set to go on display next week , included video of her bleeding in her bathtub , as well as plastic sheeting layered with a mixture of Vaseline and post- abortion blood , the Yale Daily News reported yesterday .
" Ms. Shvarts is engaged in performance art .
She stated to three senior Yale University officials today , including two deans , that she did not impregnate herself and that she did not induce any miscarriages , " a Yale spokeswoman , Helaine Klasky , said in a statement sent by e-mail to reporters .
" The entire project is an art piece , a creative fiction designed to draw attention to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a woman 's body . "
Ms. Klasky suggested that Yale would not have permitted a project of the sort described in the student newspaper .
" Had these acts been real , they would have violated basic ethical standards and raised serious mental and physical health concerns , " she said .
The newspaper story , which made no suggestion that the artwork might be fiction , spread like wildfire on the Internet yesterday .
Traffic was so heavy that , for a time , the newspaper 's Web site was knocked offline .
The paper 's editor , Andrew Mangino , did not return calls seeking comment last night .
Ms. Shvarts 's project was so provocative that it repulsed even jaded art majors at a Yale forum where she discussed her work last week , according to the Yale paper .
Neither the artist nor the Yale lecturer advising her on the project , Pia Lindman , responded to e-mail messages seeking comment for this article .
Before Yale 's announcement yesterday , a professor of molecular biology at Princeton , Lee Silver , told The New York Sun that he was dubious about Ms. Shvarts 's claims .
" I wonder if the so - called blood may just be menstruation , " he said .
He noted that the article did not indicate if she had ever taken a pregnancy test and said she performed an unspecified number of abortions over nine months using herbal compounds .
" It 's hard to believe she depended on herbal medicine , " the professor said .
" She 's being a little wishy - washy about the details . "
A science student of Mr. Silver 's once proposed impregnating herself with chimpanzee sperm .
Mr. Silver convinced her it was a " horrible thing for her to do , " but his fictionalized account of the event became a book and a play .
Mr. Silver said a science project of the sort Ms. Shvarts described would require approval from an ethics panel , which would never permit it .
The Yale spokeswoman , Ms. Klasky , said she did not know whether the planned exhibit contained real blood or whether sperm had actually been solicited from donors , as the artist claimed .
An environmental health official at Yale , Peter Reinhardt , sounded alarmed when told of Ms. Shvarts 's plan to put a mix of her own blood and Vaseline on display in a public building .
" I will look into this immediately , " he said .
" Normally , that would be out of the bounds of what we would allow a student to do . "
Ms. Shvarts has long displayed a keen interest in issues relating to human reproduction .
Her account of her first menstruation , " The Ming Period , " appears on a Web site devoted to such stories , My1stPeriod.com .
In 2006 , a Yale journal published a photograph of one of her creations , " Disarticulation . "
The sculpture , said to be made from plaster , Vaseline , towels , rubber bands , and latex gloves , resembles male and female reproductive organs .
Ms. Shvarts outlined some of her personal philosophy as she took part in a performance art event Ms. Lindman organized earlier this month at Federal Hall in Manhattan , where members of the public were invited to stand on a soapbox and speak their piece .
" We have this huge fing institution telling us : ' That 's what power looks like .
That 's what empowerment looks like . '
It 's these patriarchal , heteronormative trappings of a voice , of a right to speak , but really I think we should think more about it , " the Yale student said , according to a video posted on YouTube but removed last night .
" We need to stop being sheep . "
Ms. Shvarts also railed against those who take a narrow view of what constitutes art .
" People have to stop being so dismissive about what art is .
It has to stop hanging on the wall .
It has to be something lived , breathed every day , " she said .
The Federal Hall event was sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council with the " generous support of the September 11 Fund , " according to the video .

When Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone at Mac World back in January 2007 , he told the Apple faithful that his portable status symbol was backed by 200 patents .
And the Apple faithful cheered .
But that has n't prevented an onslaught of iPhone - happy lawsuits .
After all , this is America .
Other patent holders have already sued Steve Jobs and company over the iPhone 's touch screen , its virtual keyboard , and its so - called visual voicemail .
And now an inventor named Romek Figa has gone after the handheld 's caller ID feature , insisting it infringes a patent he bagged back in 1990 .
Figa 's patent , describes an " an automatic incoming telephone call number display system for detecting an incoming call and identifying the party associated with the incoming call number " .
Like the iPhone , the system " includes a directory of telephone numbers and parties associated with those numbers , " and it 's equipped with " circuitry that detects the origin telephone number of an incoming telephone call and compares that number with numbers in the directory for identifying the calling party . "
This patented system also includes a display that " permits the user to view the incoming call number and party associated with that number . "
It 's worth noting , however , that this display differs from the iPhone 's display :
Not an iPhone
Nonetheless , Figa 's suit insists that " Apple has made or is making , has used or is using , has offered or is offering to sell , and / or has sold and is selling telephones which infringe " on his patent .
In July , according to the suit , Figa asked Apple if they 'd like to license the patent , but they said no . ®
Finding the largest tables on a MySQL instance is a no brainer in MySQL 5.0 + thanks to Information Schema , but I still wanted to post a little query I use for the purpose so I can easily find it later .

I do some converting and rounding to see number of rows in millions and data and index size in GB so I can save on counting zeros .
The last column shows how much the index takes compared to the data which is mainly for informational purposes , but for MyISAM can also help you to size your key buffer compared to operating system cache .
I also use it to see which tables may be worth to review in terms of indexes .
Large index size compared to data size often indicates there is a lot of indexes ( so it is well possible there are some duplicates , redundant or simply unused indexes among them ) or maybe there is a long primary key with Innodb tables .
Of course , it also could be a perfectly fine table , but it is worth to look .
Changing the query a bit you can look for different sorting order or extra data , such as average row length , you can learn quite a lot about your schema this way .
It is also worth to note queries on information_schema can be rather slow if you have a lot of large tables .
On this instance , it took 2.5 minutes to run for 450 tables .
UPDATE : To make things easier I ’ve added INFORMATION_SCHEMA to the query so it works whatever database you have active .
It does not work with MySQL before 5.0 still , of course 🙂
AN AUSTRALIAN man who was a former high - ranking member of the Church of Scientology is calling for the religion to be " totally dismantled " because of the human rights abuses he says it inflicts on its followers .
David Graham has gone public after years of keeping quiet when he feared retribution from the church .
He says members are encouraged to cut ties with non-Scientologists .
And they are threatened with being ostracised from members , including family and friends , if they try to leave the church - an act known as " disconnection " .
So the king is dead , the game over .
Bobby Fischer - perhaps the greatest player in the history of chess , certainly the most charismatic and controversial - has died of kidney failure in his adoptive home , Iceland .
Fischer the chess genius died more than 30 years ago .
He had n't played top - level chess since he sensationally beat Boris Spassky in their world championship match in the Icelandic capital , Reykjavik , in 1972 .
This was not just the highest profile chess event ever , but the only time the game has made primetime TV .
Fischer was always headline news .
Tragically , after 1972 , Fischer became a recluse , rootless , increasingly deranged , popping up occasionally on unlikely radio stations ( especially in the Philippines ) to rail against the US and the Jews , and - the final straw for his native America which had once adored him - to applaud the attacks of September 11 .
" This is all wonderful news .
I want to see the US wiped out , " he declared to a Philippines radio station in the high - pitched Brooklyn accent he never lost despite three decades being blown around the world , the Flying Dutchman of chess .
The former British chess champion Bill Hartston once said : " Chess does n't drive people mad , it keeps mad people sane . "
Fischer embodied the truth of his remark .
While he was playing chess as a teenage prodigy in New York , then as a twentysomething single - handedly taking on the might of the Soviet Union , he inhabited a world he understood ; the 64 squares were his home , fulfilling and comforting ; the rules were comprehensible , the goal easily understood .
" Chess is better than sex , " he was once reported to have said .
When Fischer found refuge in Iceland in 2005 - he had been in prison in Japan awaiting extradition to the US - I went to Reykjavik to join the welcoming committee .
The Icelanders still revered him ; he , after all , had put them on the map .
Chess made a change from cod .
During my stay in Reykjavik I met Gudmundur Thorarinsson , the organiser of the 1972 world title match .
He had originally met Fischer when the prodigy visited Iceland as a teenager .
" I pointed out Alaska Road to him , " Thorarinsson told me .
" ' Gee ' , Fischer had said .
' I always wondered where Alaska was . ' "
The naivety and unworldliness summed up Fischer .
While he had chess and was feted as the west 's great hope of unlocking the Soviet stranglehold , he was OK - a young man in a sharp suit whose brilliance overwhelmed opponents .
Without chess , once he had voluntarily abandoned the world title in 1975 , he was anchorless and raged against a world , at times coming close to madness .
I witnessed this at first hand on that trip to Iceland .
He gave a press conference the day after he arrived to a small group of journalists .
They were mostly polite Icelanders , asking the great man whether he liked herring , but the US sports channel ESPN had sent along a young journalist called Jeremy Schaap , whose father had been a friend of the up - and - coming Fischer in New York in the 1950s .
When Schaap asked a question and mentioned his father , Fischer , a big , burly man with a buzz - saw voice , suddenly turned .
" I hate to rap people personally , but his father many years ago befriended me , took me to see Knicks games , acted kind of like a father figure , and then later , like a typical Jewish snake , he had the most vicious things to say about me . "
The room froze , Fischer pressed on , his mania growing .
He had talked sensibly , even at times wittily , for half an hour , but suddenly it was nothing but paranoia and the Jewish conspiracy .
" It 's all on the internet , " he kept saying .
" Why do n't you look it up ? "
The obsessionalism that had made him a great chess player made him an impossible human being .
Fischer was born in Chicago in 1943 - how appropriate that the master of the 64 squares should die at 64 - to a German father and a mother of Jewish extraction ( though there are suggestions that his biological father was a Hungarian - Jewish physicist with whom his mother had had an affair ) .
He was thus half - Jewish and possibly fully Jewish , making his tirades against Jews a bizarre form of self - hatred .
His parents divorced while he was an infant and his mother , an immensely strong - willed woman , moved to Brooklyn with her son and daughter Joan , who was five years older than Bobby and bought him his first chess set .
The young Bobby buried himself in the game he first learned at six .
By 13 he became the youngest player to win the US junior championship .
A year later , he was US chess champion , and by the age of 15 was the youngest person ever to hold the title of grandmaster - at a time when it was much harder than now to gain the title .
He climbed steadily up the world chess ladder in the 1960s , but in 1967 dropped out of a tournament halfway through after an argument with the organiser .
He played little chess for the next two years , and was already exhibiting signs of the paranoia and reclusiveness that would eventually engulf him .
In 1970 , however , he roared back , becoming the number one player in the first ever official Fide ratings and winning 20 games in a row against the best grandmasters in the world - one of the great winning streaks not just in chess but in all sporting history .
It would be unthinkable today , when three - quarters of grandmaster games end in draws .
It shows the supremacy Fischer had established and his sheer will to win .
Easy draws were spurned ; opponents were ground into the dust .
To beat the Soviet machine , he had turned himself into a machine .
Fischer played before the age of the computer .
Grandmasters now use computer programs in their opening theory and to analyse games .
Fischer had to work it out for himself , plot his own path .
Nonetheless , his games have a computer - like clarity : he played deeply logical moves that make sense to the novice , yet overwhelmed his grandmaster opponents .
His chess had a glorious certainty that he could never find in life .
It was the 1972 match in Reykjavik that sealed Fischer 's fame .
Initially , he did n't want to play , complaining about everything - the hall , the board , the chairs , the chess pieces , the audience , the cameras , the noise .
The match was so important to the US that Henry Kissinger , the secretary of state , phoned Fischer to beg him to play .
US honour was at stake against the commies , who had held the chess world title since the second world war .
Fischer eventually agreed to play .
He lost the first game to the suave Spassky , who many thought would defeat the eccentric and volatile Fischer , and forfeited the second .
Surely , most people thought , it was all over .
He only agreed to play the third game if it was away from the gaze of the audience .
It was played behind a curtain in a small room at the side of the sports hall in which the event was being held .
Fischer triumphed brilliantly , the first game he had ever won against Spassky .
He dominated the next few games , establishing a healthy lead , but seemed to waver as the finishing post loomed .
Nevertheless , the winning margin , 12.5 to 8.5 , was comfortable enough .
The boy from Brooklyn had beaten the might of the Soviet Union , in the process sparking a chess boom across the western world and inspiring a generation of players , not least in the UK , which was to enjoy two golden decades in the wake of Fischer 's heroics .
It should have been the beginning of a wonderful reign .
In fact , it was the end .
Fischer did n't play in any of the great tournaments after 1972 ; promoters wanted him to play exhibitions , but he demanded exorbitant fees and they never took place ; and then , due to defend his world title against the new Soviet hero , Anatoly Karpov , in 1975 , he made even more outrageous demands , wanting an open - ended match in which the winner would have win 10 games , with draws not counting - a match that would have taken many months to complete .
Fide tried to accommodate him , but negotiations broke down and Fischer forfeited his crown .
Thorarinsson has a theory .
" Fischer was scared of losing , " he told me .
" Chess and the world title meant so much to him that he could n't bear the prospect of being beaten . "
He had come close to perfection , to finding the objective truth for which chess players strive , and feared a falling off , a loss of certainty .
Chess players rarely get better after their 20s ; perhaps he realised the peak had been climbed and the only way was down .
After 1972 , Fischer 's wanderings became ever more self - defeating .
He moved to the west coast and had a spell with a Californian religious cult , which , as so often with Fischer , ended in acrimony .
The US sued him for unpaid taxes and impounded some of his belongings .
He was even falsely accused of taking part in a bank robbery and questioned by police - an episode that prompted his brilliantly titled philippic " I Was Tortured in a Pasadena Jailhouse . "
He returned to the board in 1992 to play an exhibition match against his old foe , Spassky , in Yugoslavia .
This at the height of the civil war in the Balkans .
The US added sanctions - busting to tax evasion .
The first game in that 1992 match was reckoned a brilliant one - Fischer , after a 20 - year absence , could clearly still play .
But , thereafter , he and Spassky played uneven chess ( by grandmaster standards , of course ) : like two old , flabby boxers trading blows , this was strictly for money ( the purse was said to amount to $ 5 m ) .
After this match , he knew he was in danger of being arrested if he returned to the US and never went back .
He spent much of the 1990s in Budapest , a shambling , bushy - bearded figure spotted from time to time at public baths .
He was said to be besotted with a 17 - year - old Hungarian chess player ; she eventually married someone else .
He moved to the Philippines , where in 2000 he married and had a daughter with a young Filipino woman , but the relationship foundered .
Then came 2001 , when Fischer noisily sided with al - Qaida and the charge sheet was complete .
Tax evasion and sanctions - busting may have been the official reasons the US wanted its prodigal son back , but revenge was now the true motive .
The home - grown monster had to be tamed .
He was held in prison in Japan , which claimed his passport was invalid , and there was a strong chance he would have to return to the US to face trial .
But Iceland intervened with an offer of instant citizenship and he fled to safety in March 2005 , receiving something close to a state reception when his private aircraft touched down close to midnight in driving rain .
He was to end his life among well - wishers , worshippers even , but he remained a recluse and was reluctant to play chess .
At the press conference I attended in Reykjavik , he admitted to having played against a Burmese guard while he was in prison in Japan .
The young man had even managed a draw in one game .
Might this unknown be the last person to have played chess against Fischer ?
Ever the iconoclast , he had invented his own form of chess , Fischerandom , in which at the beginning of the game the pieces are randomly distributed .
Conventional chess , Fischer said , was played out - killed by computers and over - analysis .
Psychologically , he had to believe that chess died with him , the last , undefeated champion .
In a way , perhaps it did .

Toilet business can bring staggering profit of 900 percent
Researchers from the UN University found out which business can bring a lot of profit to an investor .
It is a construction business , although it does not go about the construction of large shopping malls or grocery stores .
It goes about the construction of toilets .
Every dollar invested in this business can bring the staggering 900 - percent profit .
For example , if an entrepreneur builds a 100 - dollar bathroom , he or she may have the return of $ 900 in a certain period of time .
Toilet business can bring staggering profit of 900 percent
Experts studied statistics on the issue and conducted their own research before they came to such a surprising conclusion .
The results of their work showed that a huge number of people , about one - third of the entire population – 2.6 billion people , including 980 million children – do not have access to normal bathrooms .
Each of those people spend about 30 minutes a day to find a more or less decent toilet to relieve themselves .
It is an open secret that a simple calculation shows that a human being loses about 15 hours of precious time a month .
A year of such searches steals a whole week .
About $ 38 billion needs to be spent before 2015 to halve the number of the “ sufferers . ”
This amount makes up less than one percent of the amount spent on defense needs .
Investments in the construction of toilets can bring more than $ 300 billion of net profit .
In addition , people ’s health in many regions of the world will improve and the death rate will decline .

Water crisis to hit Earth by 2025
The issue is quite serious .
The lack of decent toilets leads to the distribution of diarrhea , which annually kills over 1.8 million people , of whom 90 percent are children under five years of age .
Hundreds of millions of others catch infectious and parasitic diseases .
As a result , up to 12 percent of medical budgets are spent on the diarrhea treatment .
The lack of toilets in the world has another significant consequence – the sewage utilization .
Over 200 million tons of faeces and hundreds of millions of tons of dirty water remain do not pass through any cleansing at sewage disposal plants .
This enormous amount of biological dirt pollutes the environment and distributes dangerous infections .
Experts are certain that 88 percent of all illnesses are connected with the shortage of safe drinking water and the low sanitary level .
The problem does not touch upon African and Asian countries alone .
In Europe , millions of people have to live in homes without water supplies .
About 16 percent of population of Eastern Europe does not have water and sewage systems in their homes .

Dan Calabrese ’s new column on Hillary Clinton ’s past may bring the curtain down on her political future .
Calabrese interviewed Jerry Zeifman , the man who served as chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate hearings , has tried to tell the story of his former staffer ’s behavior during those proceedings for years .
Zeifman claims he fired Hillary for unethical behavior and that she conspired to deny Richard Nixon counsel during the hearings :
As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper fire in Bosnia , one question that arose was whether she has engaged in a pattern of lying .
The now - retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee , who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation , says Hillary ’s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther – and goes much deeper – than anyone realizes .
Jerry Zeifman , a lifelong Democrat , supervised the work of 27 - year - old Hillary Rodham on the committee .
Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor , Burke Marshall , who was also Sen .
Ted Kennedy ’s chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair .
When the investigation was over , Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation – one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman ’s 17 - year career .
Why ?
“ Because she was a liar , ” Zeifman said in an interview last week .
“ She was an unethical , dishonest lawyer .
She conspired to violate the Constitution , the rules of the House , the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality . ”
This is n’t exactly news .
When her lachrymose performance arguably won her New Hampshire , Zeifman tried to tell people about Hillary ’s duplicity .
Patterico noticed the effort , but few others picked it up .
Zeifman wrote at his website :
After hiring Hillary , Doar assigned her to confer with me regarding rules of procedure for the impeachment inquiry .
At my first meeting with her I told her that Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino , House Speaker Carl Albert , Majority Leader “ Tip ” O’Neill , Parliamentarian Lou Deschler and I had previously all agreed that we should rely only on the then existing House Rules , and not advocate any changes .
I also quoted Tip O’Neill ’s statement that : “ To try to change the rules now would be politically divisive .
It would be like trying to change the traditional rules of baseball before a World Series . ”
Hillary assured me that she had not drafted , and would not advocate , any such rules changes .
However , as documented in my personal diary , I soon learned that she had lied .
She had already drafted changes , and continued to advocate them .
In one written legal memorandum , she advocated denying President Nixon
representation by counsel .
In so doing she simply ignored the fact that in the committee ’s then most recent prior impeachment proceeding , the committee had afforded the right to counsel to Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas .
I had also informed Hillary that the Douglas impeachment files were available for public inspection in the committee offices .
She later removed the Douglas files without my permission and carried them to the offices of the impeachment inquiry staff — where they were no longer accessible to the public .
Hillary had also made other ethical flawed procedural recommendations , arguing that the Judiciary Committee should : not hold any hearings with – or take depositions of — any live witnesses ; not conduct any original investigation of Watergate , bribery , tax evasion , or any other possible impeachable offense of President Nixon ; and should rely solely on documentary evidence compiled by other committees and by the Justice Departments special Watergate prosecutor .
The right to counsel is considered one of the inviolable tenets of our justice system .
It does n’t speak well of ambitious attorneys working on a highly - charged political investigation that she wanted to deny someone the right to an attorney .
Small wonder Zeifman questioned her ethics .
If all she did was to propose that as a tactic , that would not make it terribly concerning — but she did much more than just spitball ideas .
When informed that public evidence showed a precedent for the right to counsel , she absconded with the files to eliminate the evidence .
Does that remind anyone of later incidents in the Clinton narrative , such as the billing records for the Rose Law offices and the 900 + raw FBI files on political opponents of the Clintons ?
Hillary ’s advocates could accuse Zeifman of conjuring up these stories in order to draw attention to himself in the middle of a presidential campaign .
However , Calabrese reports that Zeifman kept diaries during this period , urged on by friends mindful of the historical nature of the Watergate investigation .
No one would have known at the time that this 27 - year - old barracuda would have any sort of national significance — which makes Zeifman ’s testimony all the more compelling .
We know that the Tuzla Dash covered for something much more significant in Hillary ’s character .
Zeifman shows that all of this forms a pattern of lies , obfuscations , deceit , and treachery .
Do n’t miss a word on either site .
Update : Not Senate , but the House .
I changed the title to Congressional , but Zeifman worked for the House Judiciary Committee .
Among the many reasons given for the recent surge in gas prices is China ’s soaring demand for petroleum .
Because the Chinese are running around the world buying up every available barrel of oil , the argument goes , we Americans have to pay that much more to outbid them for the leftover pools of crude .
And the fact that the Chinese yuan has been growing stronger while the American dollar is shrinking in value has only exacerbated the problem .
Unquestionably , there ’s some truth to this .
China ’s consumption of oil rose from about 4.2 million barrels a day in 1997 to 7.8 million barrels in 2007 , an increase of 86 % , the U.S. Department of Energy reported earlier this year .
More to the point , the percentage of this oil that had to be imported grew even more .
In 1997 , China supplied all but 1 million barrels of the oil it consumed each day from domestic fields ; by 2007 , the shortfall between domestic output and consumption had jumped to 4 million barrels , all of which had to be imported .
To obtain these additional barrels , the Chinese have , in fact , been shopping in some of the same foreign oil bazaars as the United States -- and , with more demand chasing a finite supply , prices naturally tend to rise .
But let ’s put this in perspective .
In 2007 , according to Energy Department figures , the United States consumed about 21 million barrels of oil a day , nearly three times as much as China .
Even more significant , we imported 13 million barrels every day , a vastly greater amount than China ’s import tally .
So , although it is indeed true that Chinese and American consumers are competing for access to overseas supplies , thereby edging up prices , American consumption still sets the pace in international oil markets .

The reality is that as far as the current run-up in gasoline prices is concerned , other factors are more to blame : shrinking oil output from such key producers as Mexico , Russia and Venezuela ; internal violence in Iraq and Nigeria ; refinery inadequacies in the U.S. and elsewhere ; speculative stockpiling by global oil brokers , and so on .
These conditions are likely to persist for the foreseeable future , so prices will remain high .
Peer into the future , however , and the China factor starts looming much larger .
With its roaring economy and millions of newly affluent consumers -- many of whom are now buying their first automobiles -- China is rapidly catching up with the United States in its net oil intake .
According to the most recent projections , Chinese petroleum consumption is expected to jump from 8 million barrels a day in 2008 to an estimated 12 million in 2020 and to 16 million in 2030 .
American consumption will also climb , but not as much , reaching an estimated 27 million barrels a day in 2030 .
In terms of oil imports , moreover , the gap will grow even smaller .
Chinese imports are projected to hit 10.8 million barrels a day in 2030 , compared with 16.4 million for the United States .
Clearly , the Sino - American competition for foreign oil supplies will grow ever more intense with every passing year .
How , then , should we respond to this challenge ?
One answer , favored by many in Washington , is to step up American political , economic and military involvement in Africa , the Middle East and Asia so as to enhance America ’s competitive advantage in the struggle for access to the world ’s remaining untapped supplies of crude oil .
Advertisement
This , in fact , has been the approach adopted by the Bush administration over the last seven years .
It has involved repeated visits to such key oil suppliers as Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Nigeria by top U.S. officials , including President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , along with promises of economic aid and , on occasion , increased levels of military assistance .
China , sad to say , has responded in kind , inflaming regional tensions and sparking a series of local arms races .
This competitive approach may give American companies a slight advantage in a few oil - producing areas , but it is unlikely to alter the big picture or reduce the cost of gasoline to American consumers .
At the same time , it is sure to boost U.S. military expenditures and produce a greater risk of American involvement in overseas energy conflicts .
A far wiser course , I believe , would be to promote energy cooperation with China , rather than competition .
Given that the United States and China are the world ’s two biggest users of petroleum -- a fuel whose worldwide availability is likely to peak at 100 million barrels or so per day in the next five years or so and then commence an irreversible decline -- it makes great sense for us to collaborate in the development of oil alternatives and energy - saving technologies .
Such collaboration could take the form of joint ventures to develop advanced biofuels ( not derived from food crops ) and transportation fuels extracted from coal ( without releasing heat - trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ) .
It could also include the development of super - light vehicles , advanced hybrid engines and other energy - saving systems .
Such endeavors have been discussed on a preliminary basis by U.S. and Chinese officials , so it is hardly utopian to envision a more elaborate and constructive undertaking of this sort .
Advertisement
Make no mistake : Intensified competition between the United States and China for access to the world ’s remaining supplies of oil ( and other sources of energy ) will inevitably add to the forces pushing gasoline prices skyward and will generate an increased risk of regional instability .
Trying to fight China over oil is the wrong approach ; we ’d both be better off by cooperating in the search for petroleum alternatives .
Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble got the green light from the country 's 16 top state security officials to start a European Union initiative for the acceptance of Iraqi Christians as refugees .
Schaeuble will make the proposal at a meeting of EU interior ministers in Luxembourg on Friday , April 18 .
He said an improvement to the situation of Iraqi Christians was " desperately necessary . "
No details of Schaeuble 's plans were made public , nor was it clear how many refugees Germany would accept .
The interior minister of Baden - Wuerttemberg , Heribert Rech , said financial issues still had to be resolved as did the possibility that such a regulation could make Germany a magnet for refugees .
Berlin Interior Minister Erhart Koerting cautioned against focusing exclusively on Christians and suggested adopting a broader approach .
" I would link it to religious persecution , " he said .
Too many foreigners , school kids say
The results of a new report which showed that xenophobia is widespread among German school kids were also brought up at the ministers ' meeting in Bad Saarow , in the state of Brandenburg .
Young Germans said there were too many foreigners in Germany
In the study , carried out by a national working group on youth violence , every third German school child said they agreed " entirely " that there were too many foreigners in Germany .
Another third said they pretty much agreed .
One in thirteen admitted they had committed a crime attributable to the far right , such as scrawling swastikas and damaging the property of foreigners .
The initial results of the study , based on a survey of 30,000 school children of all ages by the Interior Ministry and the Crime Research Institute of Lower Saxony , were published on Thursday in the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper .
Far - right ban
The ministers also discussed the possibility of launching a new attempt to ban the far - right NPD party , which has been mooted by Social Democrats .
The officials agreed that the party was hostile to the constitution , Brandenburg 's Interior Minister Joerg Schoenbohm said .
But the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) among them rejected the initiative for fear that the case would not be strong enough to succeed at the Constitutional Court .
" It would be the greatest propaganda success the NPD could achieve , " Schoenbohm , a Christian Democrat , said .
The SPD first attempted to push through an NPD ban in 2003 , but Germany 's high court threw the case out because prosecution witnesses had worked as informants for intelligence agencies .
Losing steam
The NPD benefits from public money
The CDU ministers have instead proposed that the NPD be combated by changing legislation to prevent it from receiving government subsidies .
The NPD has about 7,000 members and has seats in two regional state parliaments , both in the former communist East .
As a legitimate political party , it gets over 1 million euros ( $ 1.6 million ) in public funding per year .
Interior Minister Schaeuble had called for an end to the debate on Wednesday .
But Berlin's Koerting , a Social Democrat , said the federal government coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats should address it .
" I have no doubt that the material is sufficient to prove the NPD is hostile to the constitution , also at the Constitutional Court , " he said .
The makers of Enzyte have been convicted of conspiracy and fraud .
From :
http://cincinnati.fbi.gov/doj/pressrel/2008/ci022608.htm
“ The company 's scheme involved false advertising which included
made - up claims about size increases , fake customer satisfaction
ratings , and fictitious doctors who the ads falsely claimed
collaborated for 13 years to develop Enzyte , the company 's
leading male enhancement product .
The false ads also contained
representations about money - back guarantees that the company
as a matter of practice would not honor .
As part of the scheme ,
the conspirators placed many consumers who responded to
free - trial solicitations on an automatic shipment program
without the customer 's authorization , knowledge , or consent .
Berkeley would then send the product to the consumer and bill
the consumer 's credit card regularly .
When customers
called to cancel , the conspirators employed various means to
delay or hinder any returns or cancellations from occurring .
The trial included testimony from 22 customers from across
the country , witnesses from the Better Business Bureau ,
law enforcement agencies , and copies of internal documents
including emails outlining the scheme . “
What is enzyte ?
USA today ran an article that included a list of ingredients .
http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-04-18-enzyte.htm
They include some quotes from real doctors that state
that the claims made make no sense .
Their site is still up
they still answer the phone and offer to sell you their product .
Gary Warner also covered this in his cybercrime blog .

BBC News , Washington
A BBC World Service poll suggests a slightly more positive view of the US around the world .
It is only an improvement of four percentage points - with 35 % of people saying the US is a positive influence , rather than 31 % - but it has been welcomed by American officials and people alike .
A boost in US popularity could mean fewer anti-American protests " I think that 's a huge deal , I 'm so glad to hear that , " said Kirsten Young , a stay - at - home mother from Minnesota .
Julie Moss , a retired teacher from New York , said she was surprised but pleased by the news .
" People in foreign countries , especially Europe and the Middle East , get so hostile when they hear you 're American , me and my husband sometimes pretend we 're Canadian when we travel , " she said .
At the US state department , principal deputy assistant secretary of state Kurt Volker said in a BBC interview that " everyone wants to be loved " .
But , he added : " We are a superpower , we have tremendous responsibility , a large economy , large diplomatic reach and military reach , so naturally the world looks at the US with much greater attention than any other country in the world . "
' Working together ' Steven Kull , one of the pollsters and director of the Maryland - based Program on International Policy Attitudes , said the poll results showed that while there had not been a sudden " flip " , a corner had been turned .
Anger over the Guantanamo Bay prison has not helped the US image Perceptions of the US had been on a downward trend since 2005 in the aftermath of the Iraq war , which caused smouldering trans -Atlantic tension , he said .
The conduct of the war and the violence that followed , the scandal of the abuses that took place inside the US - run prison of Abu Ghraib in Iraq and the controversy surrounding the US detention facility in Guantanamo Bay , all added to the perception that the US was having a negative influence in the world .
Mr Volker said he and his colleagues had noticed the change as well , " very much so , going back a couple of years " .
He went on : " I would say public opinion is a lagging indicator of what we are doing , working together with European governments and other elites . "
He said he felt that the negative perceptions in 2003 and 2004 were an " anomaly " because of the war in Iraq , but he emphasised throughout the interview that " it is important to work with others " .
" We have made clear our commitment to working with our European allies and partners to deal with a global agenda , and the Europeans have made the same commitment ; they want to work with the US to work on those challenges and not be at odds at each other . "
Middle East efforts
The state department traditionally stays out of partisan politics , but even from a department official the emphasis on co-operation suggests that the Bush administration has softened its attitude to some extent .
There has been a rapprochement between the US and France
It is all a far cry from the days preceding the war , when President George W Bush said that " if we need to act , we will act , and we really do n't need the United Nations ' approval to do so " .
Mr Kull said changes in the US approach to foreign policy had indeed contributed to a more positive world view .
From pushing for Middle East peace to saying more firmly that global warming was a problem , as well as the apparent relative success of the US troop surge in Iraq and the election of US - friendly Nicolas Sarkozy in France - all these elements were helping to make the problems seem less salient .
People look at the US and the electoral process here and are reminded that this is a major transparent democracy , a vibrant and diverse country
Kurt Volker
US state department But both Mr Kull and Mr Volker also attributed the change in perceptions to the impact of the current electoral campaign excitement , although with a difference in interpretation .
" We often get defined by the problems that we 're trying to deal with like Iraq or climate change and it's important that we show what we are as a country , " said Mr Volker .
" Now people look at the US and the electoral process here and are reminded that this is a major transparent democracy , a vibrant and diverse country , and that reflects really well on the image of the US . "
' Other voices '
But Mr Kull said it went beyond simple excitement about a campaign .
While the Bush administration had indeed been trying to work with others , there was also a feeling of anticipation that foreign policy could be less unilateral , more co-operative under a new president .
Whoever wins the White House will bring their own foreign policy ideas " It may be that as the US approaches a new presidential election , views of the US are being mitigated by hope that a new administration will move away from the foreign policies that have been so unpopular in the world , " he said .
The conclusion , Mr Kull said , was not based on direct data but the interpretation of polls and focus groups .
But it is something average Americans seem to have picked up on as well .
" If we have got more respect , I think it 's got to do with the other voices , other than the president , who have been making comments about what we should be doing , people like Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and members of Congress who disagree with the actions of our president , " said one man in Washington DC .
Asked whether he felt that his country was viewed more positively because people were looking forward to the departure of the current administration , Mr Volker said it would be unfortunate if that was how people saw things .
And , he added , while any of the three remaining presidential hopefuls would bring a new face , there would also be continuity in US foreign policy .

About this series
This is a series for beginners wanting to learn about routing in Rails 2.0 .
This first post is aimed at exploring the behaviour of routing in Rails .
It examines what happens when the routing system is given a certain URL .
Future posts will examine the ‘ hows ’ and ‘ whys ’ of this behaviour .
The plan is to start with the basics and move towards the advanced topics .
There is only a brief mention of RESTful routing in this post .
I plan to delve deeper into that topic at a later stage .
Introduction
The routing subsystem is at the heart of a Rails application .
By looking at the following image , we can see the role of the routing system .
The diagram is a modified version of a diagram found in Flexible Rails .
As the picture depicts , in a Rails application the process begins with a request from the browser .
This request is passed into the Rails routing system .
The routing system examines the request and is able to determine the following information :
Which controller to instantiate
Which action ( method ) to invoke on that controller
The parameters , if any , to pass into the action
When receiving a correctly formatted request URL the routing system will instantiate the specified controller , call the appropriate action and pass in the supplied method parameters , if required .
The controller will then perform the necessary action and Rails will render the relevant view .
This will result in the browser receiving a response and the round trip is complete .
This is oversimplified , but it does show the importance of the routing system .
If the request is not in the correct format the routing system may not be able to infer the correct action to take .
Therefore it is important that the format is correct .
We are in luck as the Rails routing system also helps us to generate requests in the correct format .
In short , the routing system has two main functions :
Interpreting a request URL
Generating a request URL
The routing system performs these functions by using routing rules , defined in Ruby code as opposed to XML .
The rules can be found in the config / routes.rb Ruby file .
Each rule is used to both interpret and to generate a related request URL .
I could go into more theory here but , as with many things , the best way to get to grips with routing is to do it !
The Practical Part…at last
When I wrote this post , I was using Instant Rails as per my suggestion in a previous post .
Preparation
Issue the create command to create a rails application :
C:\InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps>rails -d mysql music_store
Rails does its thing …
Then we create the database …
C:\InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps>cd music_store C:\InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps\music_store >rake db:create:all ( in C:/ InstantRails-2.0-win/rails_apps/music_store )
Do a quick test to make sure things are in order .
C:\InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps\music_store>ruby script\server =>
Booting Mongrel ( use ' script / server webrick ' to force WEBrick ) =>
Rails application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000 =>
Call with -d to detach ... output ... ** Mongrel 1.1.2 available at 0.0.0.0:3000 ** Use CTRL -C to stop .
Start a browser and navigate to : http://localhost:3000/
Make sure you expand the ‘ About your application ’s environment ’
You should see the standard welcome screen :
If you are experiencing problems , make sure your proxy is turned off .
Perform some scaffolding to create an ‘ Album ’ .
ruby script \generate scaffold Album title : string review : text
Rails goes again …
In the last line of the output we see :
route map.resources :albums
Rails has actually created a route for us , it happens to be a RESTful route !
We will get to that later .
We are just noting it for now , Rails has jumped the gun .
RESTful routes are what we want in our application , but first we want to have a good understanding of routes .
The best way to understand routes is to experiment with them .
Later we will remove that RESTful route , which rails created , and play around with customised routes .
We will then explore named routes and move back to using RESTful routing .
Before doing all of that , lets get our Albums section up and running .
Run the rake migrate task
C:\InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps\music_store >rake db:migrate
Browse to this URL : http://localhost:3000/albums
You should see :
Let ’s use our shiny new Rails application to add a few albums .
Create three albums and do not delete these first three .
Later on we will assume that you have three albums having database IDs of 1 , 2 and 3 .
Create and delete a forth one if you like , but do n’t delete the first three Albums .
You can enter any data , try to show more taste than I did …
We are not going to use any CSS or partials at this point , that is not the point of this tutorial .
OK , let ’s get back to routing !
Experimenting 1 – View the generated routes
The objective of this experiment is to view the generated Ruby code which defines the generated routes .
We then explore the behaviour of these routes .
This will help us gain some insight into how the routing works .
We will use the IRB to perform these actions .
Open up the config\routes.rb file to see the actual code that defines the routes .
You should see code as depicted below , with additional comments .
You may want to leave the comments so that you can read them as we move on .
ActionController :: Routing :: Routes.draw do |map| map.resources :albums map.connect ':controller/:action /:id ' map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.: format '
end
Rails has generated three routes for us , these are the routes our application is currently using .
Let ’s examine the behaviour of these routes .
A good way to do this is by using the IRB .
C:\InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps\music_store>ruby script / console Loading development environment ( Rails 2.0.2 ) >> rts = ActionController :: Routing :: Routes
Expect a console output splat !
Let ’s get some output in a nice format .
>> puts rts.routes 1 GET / albums / {:action= >" index " , : controller= > " albums " } 2 GET / albums.: format/ {:action= >" index " , : controller= >" albums " } 3 POST / albums / {:action= >" create " , : controller= > " albums " }
4 POST / albums.: format/ {:action= >" create " , : controller= >" albums " } 5 GET / albums / new / {:action= >" new " , : controller= > " albums " }
6 GET / albums / new.:format/ {:action= >" new " , : controller= >" albums " }
7 GET / albums /:id/edit/ {:action= >" edit " , : controller= >" albums " }
8 GET / albums /:id/edit.:format/ {:action= >" edit " , : controller= >" albums " } 9 GET / albums /:id/ {:action= >" show " , : controller= > " albums " } 10 GET / albums /:id.: format/ {:action= >" show " , : controller= >" albums " } 11 PUT / albums /:id/ {:action= >" update " , : controller= > " albums " } 12 PUT / albums /:id.: format/ {:action=>" update " , : controller= >" albums " } 13 DELETE / albums /:id/ {:action= >" destroy " , : controller= > " albums " }
14 DELETE / albums /:id.: format/ {:action= >" destroy " , : controller= >" albums " }
15 ANY /:controller/:action/:id/ {} 16 ANY /:controller/:action/:id.: format/ {}
The middle column is commonly referred to as the path ( also called the relative path ) .
On our local development machine the fully qualified URL of / albums / is localhost : 3000 / albums .
Line 1 shows us that if we do a GET using / albums / the action index will be called on the albums controller .
Try it in your browser , use http://localhost:3000/albums/.
Line 7 , here the routing system will behave in a similar way as before .
To invoke this rule we use a URL replacing the : ID symbol with an existing album ID from the database e.g. / albums/2/edit /.
This will result in the edit action being called on the albums controller .
The 2 will be made available to the album controllers edit action through the params hash .
We can see this if we open the albums controller and look at the edit method :
# GET / albums / 1/edit def edit @album = Album.find ( params [ :id ] ) end end
Using : id is a convention .
We could use another symbol but then we would have to remember to use that in the controller .
As you know , it is always better to stick to convention when working with Rails – DHH knows best .
You may have noticed some paths ending with format .
This can be used to pass a format though to a controller in the params hash , this is similar to the id field .
Do not change this symbol , it is a special symbol and must be called : format .
One example of using : format would be if we wanted to retrieve XML .
Using http://localhost:3000/albums.xml will render xml in the browser , try it .
Looking at the albums controller we can see the params [ : format ] parameter being used .
# GET / albums # GET / albums.xml def index @albums = Album.find ( : all ) respond_to do |format| format.html # index.html.erb format.xml { render : xml => @albums } end end
As can be seen in the code above , it is the respond_to method that uses the format value to determine the format of the response .
At this stage you should be gaining some sort of intuition for Rails routing , right ?
Now it is time to break our application …
Experimenting 2 – Removing all routes
Open up the config\routes.rb file and delete ( or comment out ) all the code .
Now you should have removed the RESTful route as well as the default route .
I will explain the default route ( as well as RESTful routes ) in future posts .
As for now , we are left with an empty file .
Behold the naked routes.rb !
ActionController :: Routing :: Routes.draw do |map| end
Run your application through the browser and you will find that our application is completely broken !
It should show the error below .
You can aslo use the IRB to check the status of the routes .
I did have some problems seeing the updated routes within the IRB .
I found that I needed to exit the IRB , then do the ‘ load and instantiate ’ dance again …
>> exitC : \InstantRails-2.0-win\rails_apps\music_store >ruby script \console
Loading development environment ( Rails 2.0.2 ) >> rts = ActionController :: Routing :: Routes => #< ActionController :: Routing :: RouteSet:0x3ed12e8 ... more output ... >> puts rts.routes => nil
Perfect , no routes as we expected …
If someone can help with this issue of needing to exit the IRB , I am all ears ?
If needing to exit the IRB unavoidable , a small script may be handy …
At this stage we have a broken Rails application .
In the next post we will set about fixing the music_store application , while doing that we will learn different aspects of routing in Rails .
I realise this is poor to leave you with a broken application , I will attempt to make up for it in the next post …
The End ( of part 1 )
Well , that is it for the first post .
Please let me know if you found this useful .
As I said before , I will only continue with this series if there is a demand .
Please suggest topics you would like me to cover .
I have a general plan , future posts will cover :
The anatomy of routing rules
The default route
Static routes
Wild card \Receptors
RESTful routing
If people are finding this pace too slow , I might skip directly yo RESTful routing , but this all depends on your feeback .
Thanks , I hope this was useful to you …
Part 2
Lance Armstrong : Boston Marathon Time 2:50:58 ( Photos )
finished his first Boston Marathon with an impressive time of 2:50:58 .
This was good enough for 496th place among a field of 25,000 competitors .
He was 477 among men and 368 among his age group .
He has run two other marathon 's prior to trying his hand at BM .
He finished the New York City Marathon in 2:46:43 last year .
Armstrong admits that he does n't train properly but does enjoy the challenge .
Prior to the race he provided the following insight :
If I broke 3 hours I 'd be happy .
I 'm not in perfect shape , but the point is to get out here and enjoy it and really be part of the atmosphere and the ambiance of this great marathon . "
Armstrong won the 1993 World Cycling Championship before being diagnosed with an aggressive form of testicular cancer in 1996 .
Though the cancer spread to his lungs and brain , Armstrong recovered to win seven straight Tour de France titles from 1999 to 2005 .
Armstrong 's foundation has 50 runners in the race .
They hope to raise $ 250,000 .

Abstract
This specification defines the 5th major revision of the core language of the World Wide Web , HTML .
In this version , new features are introduced to help Web application authors , new elements are introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices , and special attention has been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability .

All feedback is welcome .
Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable .
Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways .
Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage should join the aforementioned mailing lists and take part in the discussions .
The publication of this document by the W3C as a W3C Working Draft does not imply that all of the participants in the W3C HTML working group endorse the contents of the specification .
Indeed , for any section of the specification , one can usually find many members of the working group or of the W3C as a whole who object strongly to the current text , the existence of the section at all , or the idea that the working group should even spend time discussing the concept of that section .
The W3C HTML Working Group is the W3C working group responsible for this specification 's progress along the W3C Recommendation track .
This specification is the 22 January 2008 First Public Working Draft .
This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy .
W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group ; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent .
An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim (s ) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy .
Stability
Different parts of this specification are at different levels of maturity .
Some of the more major known issues are marked like this .
There are many other issues that have been raised as well ; the issues given in this document are not the only known issues !
There are also some spec - wide issues that have not yet been addressed : case - sensitivity is a very poorly handled topic right now , and the firing of events needs to be unified ( right now some bubble , some do n't , they all use different text to fire events , etc ) .
It would also be nice to unify the rules on downloading content when attributes change ( e.g. src attributes ) - should they initiate downloads when the element immediately , is inserted in the document , when active scripts end , etc .
This matters e.g. if an attribute is set twice in a row ( does it hit the network twice ) .
Table of contents
1. Introduction
This section is non-normative .
The World Wide Web 's markup language has always been HTML .
HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents , although its general design and adaptations over the years has enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents .
The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as Web Applications .
This specification attempts to rectify this , while at the same time updating the HTML specifications to address issues raised in the past few years .
1.1 . Scope
This section is non-normative .
This specification is limited to providing a semantic - level markup language and associated semantic - level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents to dynamic applications .
The scope of this specification does not include addressing presentation concerns ( although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at the end of this specification ) .
The scope of this specification does not include documenting every HTML or DOM feature supported by Web browsers .
Browsers support many features that are considered to be very bad for accessibility or that are otherwise inappropriate .
For example , the blink element is clearly presentational and authors wishing to cause text to blink should instead use CSS .
The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system .
In particular , hardware configuration software , image manipulation tools , and applications that users would be expected to use with high - end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope .
In terms of applications , this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by users on an occasional basis , or regularly but from disparate locations , with low CPU requirements .
For instance online purchasing systems , searching systems , games ( especially multiplayer online games ) , public telephone books or address books , communications software ( e- mail clients , instant messaging clients , discussion software ) , document editing software , etc .
For sophisticated cross-platform applications , there already exist several proprietary solutions ( such as Mozilla 's XUL , Adobe 's Flash , or Microsoft 's Silverlight ) .
These solutions are evolving faster than any standards process could follow , and the requirements are evolving even faster .
These systems are also significantly more complicated to specify , and are orders of magnitude more difficult to achieve interoperability with , than the solutions described in this document .
Platform - specific solutions for such sophisticated applications ( for example the MacOS X Core APIs ) are even further ahead .
1.1.1 . Relationship to HTML 4.01 , XHTML 1.1 , DOM2 HTML
This section is non-normative .
This specification represents a new version of HTML4 and XHTML1 , along with a new version of the associated DOM2 HTML API .
Migration from HTML4 or XHTML1 to the format and APIs described in this specification should in most cases be straightforward , as care has been taken to ensure that backwards - compatibility is retained .
This specification will eventually supplant Web Forms 2.0 as well . [ WF2 ]
1.1.2 . Relationship to XHTML2
This section is non-normative .
XHTML2 [ XHTML2 ] defines a new HTML vocabulary with better features for hyperlinks , multimedia content , annotating document edits , rich metadata , declarative interactive forms , and describing the semantics of human literary works such as poems and scientific papers .
However , it lacks elements to express the semantics of many of the non-document types of content often seen on the Web .
For instance , forum sites , auction sites , search engines , online shops , and the like , do not fit the document metaphor well , and are not covered by XHTML2 .
This specification aims to extend HTML so that it is also suitable in these contexts .
XHTML2 and this specification use different namespaces and therefore can both be implemented in the same XML processor .
1.1.3 . Relationship to XUL , Flash , Silverlight , and other proprietary UI languages
This section is non-normative .
This specification is independent of the various proprietary UI languages that various vendors provide .
As an open , vender - neutral language , HTML provides for a solution to the same problems without the risk of vendor lock - in .
1.2 . Structure of this specification
This section is non-normative .
This specification is divided into the following important sections :
The DOM The DOM , or Document Object Model , provides a base for the rest of the specification .
The Semantics Documents are built from elements .
These elements form a tree using the DOM .
Each element also has a predefined meaning , which is explained in this section .
User agent requirements for how to handle each element are also given , along with rules for authors on how to use the element .
Browsing Contexts HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum — this section defines many of the features that affect environments that deal with multiple pages , links between pages , and running scripts .
APIs The Editing APIs : HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to modify content , which are described in this section .
The Communication APIs : Applications written in HTML often require mechanisms to communicate with remote servers , as well as communicating with other applications from different domains running on the same client .
Repetition Templates : A mechanism to support repeating sections in forms .
The Language Syntax
All of these features would be for naught if they could n't be represented in a serialised form and sent to other people , and so this section defines the syntax of HTML , along with rules for how to parse HTML .
There are also a couple of appendices , defining shims for WYSIWYG editors , rendering rules for Web browsers , and listing areas that are out of scope for this specification .
1.2.1 . How to read this specification
This specification should be read like all other specifications .
First , it should be read cover - to - cover , multiple times .
Then , it should be read backwards at least once .
Then it should be read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references .
1.3 . Conformance requirements
All diagrams , examples , and notes in this specification are non-normative , as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative .
Everything else in this specification is normative .
The key words " MUST " , " MUST NOT " , " REQUIRED " , " SHALL " , " SHALL NOT " , " SHOULD " , " SHOULD NOT " , " RECOMMENDED " , " MAY " , and " OPTIONAL " in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 .
For readability , these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification .
[ RFC2119 ]
Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms ( such as " strip any leading space characters " or " return false and abort these steps " ) are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ( " must " , " should " , " may " , etc ) used in introducing the algorithm .
This specification describes the conformance criteria for user agents ( relevant to implementors ) and documents ( relevant to authors and authoring tool implementors ) .
There is no implied relationship between document conformance requirements and implementation conformance requirements .
User agents are not free to handle non-conformant documents as they please ; the processing model described in this specification applies to implementations regardless of the conformity of the input documents .
User agents fall into several ( overlapping ) categories with different conformance requirements .
Web browsers and other interactive user agents
Web browsers that support XHTML must process elements and attributes from the HTML namespace found in XML documents as described in this specification , so that users can interact with them , unless the semantics of those elements have been overridden by other specifications .
A conforming XHTML processor would , upon finding an XHTML script element in an XML document , execute the script contained in that element .
However , if the element is found within an XSLT transformation sheet ( assuming the UA also supports XSLT ) , then the processor would instead treat the script element as an opaque element that forms part of the transform .
Web browsers that support HTML must process documents labelled as text / html as described in this specification , so that users can interact with them .
Non-interactive presentation user agents
User agents that process HTML and XHTML documents purely to render non-interactive versions of them must comply to the same conformance criteria as Web browsers , except that they are exempt from requirements regarding user interaction .
Typical examples of non-interactive presentation user agents are printers ( static UAs ) and overhead displays ( dynamic UAs ) .
It is expected that most static non-interactive presentation user agents will also opt to lack scripting support .
A non-interactive but dynamic presentation UA would still execute scripts , allowing forms to be dynamically submitted , and so forth .
However , since the concept of " focus " is irrelevant when the user cannot interact with the document , the UA would not need to support any of the focus - related DOM APIs .
User agents with no scripting support Implementations that do not support scripting ( or which have their scripting features disabled ) are exempt from supporting the events and DOM interfaces mentioned in this specification .
For the parts of this specification that are defined in terms of an events model or in terms of the DOM , such user agents must still act as if events and the DOM were supported .
Scripting can form an integral part of an application .
Web browsers that do not support scripting , or that have scripting disabled , might be unable to fully convey the author 's intent .
Conformance checkers Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to the applicable conformance criteria described in this specification .
Conformance checkers are exempt from detecting errors that require interpretation of the author 's intent ( for example , while a document is non-conforming if the content of a blockquote element is not a quote , conformance checkers do not have to check that blockquote elements only contain quoted material ) .
Conformance checkers must check that the input document conforms when scripting is disabled , and should also check that the input document conforms when scripting is enabled .
( This is only a " SHOULD " and not a " MUST " requirement because it has been proven to be impossible .
[ HALTINGPROBLEM ])
The term " HTML5 validator " can be used to refer to a conformance checker that itself conforms to the applicable requirements of this specification .
XML DTDs cannot express all the conformance requirements of this specification .
Therefore , a validating XML processor and a DTD cannot constitute a conformance checker .
Also , since neither of the two authoring formats defined in this specification are applications of SGML , a validating SGML system cannot constitute a conformance checker either .
To put it another way , there are three types of conformance criteria : Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD .
Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD , but can still be checked by a machine .
Criteria that can only be checked by a human .
A conformance checker must check for the first two .
A simple DTD - based validator only checks for the first class of errors and is therefore not a conforming conformance checker according to this specification .
Data mining tools Applications and tools that process HTML and XHTML documents for reasons other than to either render the documents or check them for conformance should act in accordance to the semantics of the documents that they process .
A tool that generates document outlines but increases the nesting level for each paragraph and does not increase the nesting level for each section would not be conforming .
Authoring tools and markup generators Authoring tools and markup generators must generate conforming documents .
Conformance criteria that apply to authors also apply to authoring tools , where appropriate .
Authoring tools are exempt from the strict requirements of using elements only for their specified purpose , but only to the extent that authoring tools are not yet able to determine author intent .
For example , it is not conforming to use an address element for arbitrary contact information ; that element can only be used for marking up contact information for the author of the document or section .
However , since an authoring tools is likely unable to determine the difference , an authoring tool is exempt from that requirement .
In terms of conformance checking , an editor is therefore required to output documents that conform to the same extent that a conformance checker will verify .
When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming document , it may preserve the conformance errors in sections of the document that were not edited during the editing session ( i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round - trip errorneous content ) .
However , an authoring tool must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved .
Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties : tools that work from structure or semantic data , and tools that work on a What - You - See - Is - What - You - Get media - specific editing basis ( WYSIWYG ) .
The former is the preferred mechanism for tools that author HTML , since the structure in the source information can be used to make informed choices regarding which HTML elements and attributes are most appropriate .
However , WYSIWYG tools are legitimate , and this specification makes certain concessions to WYSIWYG editors .
All authoring tools , whether WYSIWYG or not , should make a best effort attempt at enabling users to create well - structured , semantically rich , media - independent content .
Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on elements , attributes , methods or objects .
Such requirements fall into two categories ; those describing content model restrictions , and those describing implementation behaviour .
The former category of requirements are requirements on documents and authoring tools .
The second category are requirements on user agents .
Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner , so long as the end result is equivalent .
( In particular , the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow , and not intended to be performant . )
User agents may impose implementation - specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs , e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks , to guard against running out of memory , or to work around platform - specific limitations .
For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications , this specification describes two authoring formats : one based on XML ( referred to as XHTML5 ) , and one using a custom format inspired by SGML ( referred to as HTML5 ) .
Implementations may support only one of these two formats , although supporting both is encouraged .
XHTML documents ( XML documents using elements from the HTML namespace ) that use the new features described in this specification and that are served over the wire ( e.g. by HTTP ) must be sent using an XML MIME type such as application / xml or application / xhtml+xml and must not be served as text / html .
[ RFC3023 ]
Such XML documents may contain a DOCTYPE if desired , but this is not required to conform to this specification .
According to the XML specification , XML processors are not guaranteed to process the external DTD subset referenced in the DOCTYPE .
This means , for example , that using entities for characters in XHTML documents is unsafe ( except for < , > , & , " and ' ) .
For interoperability , authors are advised to avoid optional features of XML .
HTML documents , if they are served over the wire ( e.g. by HTTP ) must be labelled with the text / html MIME type .
The language in this specification assumes that the user agent expands all entity references , and therefore does not include entity reference nodes in the DOM .
If user agents do include entity reference nodes in the DOM , then user agents must handle them as if they were fully expanded when implementing this specification .
For example , if a requirement talks about an element 's child text nodes , then any text nodes that are children of an entity reference that is a child of that element would be used as well .
1.3.1 . Common conformance requirements for APIs exposed to JavaScript
A lot of arrays / lists / collections in this spec assume zero - based indexes but use the term " index th " liberally .
We should define those to be zero - based and be clearer about this .
Unless other specified , if a DOM attribute that is a floating point number type ( float ) is assigned an Infinity or Not - a - Number value , a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR exception must be raised .
Unless other specified , if a DOM attribute that is a signed numeric type is assigned a negative value , a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR exception must be raised .
Unless other specified , if a method with an argument that is a floating point number type ( float ) is passed an Infinity or Not - a - Number value , a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR exception must be raised .
Unless other specified , if a method is passed fewer arguments than is defined for that method in its IDL definition , a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR exception must be raised .
Unless other specified , if a method is passed more arguments than is defined for that method in its IDL definition , the excess arguments must be ignored .
Unless other specified , if a method is expecting , as one of its arguments , as defined by its IDL definition , an object implementing a particular interface X , and the argument passed is an object whose [ [ Class ] ] property is neither that interface X , nor the name of an interface Y where this specification requires that all objects implementing interface Y also implement interface X , nor the name of an interface that inherits from the expected interface X , then a TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR exception must be raised .
Anything else ?
Passing the wrong type of object , maybe ?
Implied conversions to int / float ?
1.3.2 . Dependencies
This specification relies on several other underlying specifications .
XML Implementations that support XHTML5 must support some version of XML , as well as its corresponding namespaces specification , because XHTML5 uses an XML serialisation with namespaces .
[ XML ] [ XMLNAMES ] XML Base User agents must follow the rules given by XML Base to resolve relative URIs in HTML and XHTML fragments .
That is the mechanism used in this specification for resolving relative URIs in DOM trees .
[ XMLBASE ]
It is possible for xml : base attributes to be present even in HTML fragments , as such attributes can be added dynamically using script .
DOM Implementations must support some version of DOM Core and DOM Events , because this specification is defined in terms of the DOM , and some of the features are defined as extensions to the DOM Core interfaces .
[ DOM3CORE ] [ DOM3EVENTS ] ECMAScript
Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings for DOM Specifications specification , as this specification uses that specification 's terminology .
[ EBFD ]
This specification does not require support of any particular network transport protocols , style sheet language , scripting language , or any of the DOM and WebAPI specifications beyond those described above .
However , the language described by this specification is biased towards CSS as the styling language , ECMAScript as the scripting language , and HTTP as the network protocol , and several features assume that those languages and protocols are in use .
This specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings , image formats , audio formats , and video formats in the respective sections .
1.3.3 . Features defined in other specifications
Some elements are defined in terms of their DOM textContent attribute .
This is an attribute defined on the Node interface in DOM3 Core . [ DOM3CORE ]
Should textContent be defined differently for dir= " " and < bdo > ?
Should we come up with an alternative to textContent that handles those and other things , like alt= " " ?
The interface is defined in DOM3 Core . [ DOM3CORE ]
The term activation behavior is used as defined in the DOM3 Events specification .
[ DOM3EVENTS ]
At the time of writing , DOM3 Events had n't yet been updated to define that phrase .
The rules for handling alternative style sheets are defined in the CSS object model specification .
[ CSSOM ]
See http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/csswg/cssom/Overview.html?rev=1.35&content-type=text/html;%20charset=utf-8
Certain features are defined in terms of CSS < color > values .
When the CSS value currentColor is specified in this context , the " computed value of the ' color ' property " for the purposes of determining the computed value of the currentColor keyword is the computed value of the ' color ' property on the element in question .
[ CSS3COLOR ]
If a canvas gradient 's addColorStop ( ) method is called with the currentColor keyword as the color , then the computed value of the ' color ' property on the canvas element is the one that is used .
1.4 . Terminology
This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and DOM attributes , often in the same context .
When it is not clear which is being referred to , they are referred to as content attributes for HTML and XML attributes , and DOM attributes for those from the DOM .
Similarly , the term " properties " is used for both ECMAScript object properties and CSS properties .
When these are ambiguous they are qualified as object properties and CSS properties respectively .
To ease migration from HTML to XHTML , UAs conforming to this specification will place elements in HTML in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace , at least for the purposes of the DOM and CSS .
The term " elements in the HTML namespace " , or " HTML elements " for short , when used in this specification , thus refers to both HTML and XHTML elements .
Unless otherwise stated , all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace , and all attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no namespace ( they are in the per-element partition ) .
The term HTML documents is sometimes used in contrast with XML documents to mean specifically documents that were parsed using an HTML parser ( as opposed to using an XML parser or created purely through the DOM ) .
Generally , when the specification states that a feature applies to HTML or XHTML , it also includes the other .
When a feature specifically only applies to one of the two languages , it is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the other format , as in " for HTML , ... ( this does not apply to XHTML ) " .
This specification uses the term document to refer to any use of HTML , ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia , as well as to fully - fledged interactive applications .
For readability , the term URI is used to refer to both ASCII URIs and Unicode IRIs , as those terms are defined by RFC 3986 and RFC 3987 respectively .
On the rare occasions where IRIs are not allowed but ASCII URIs are , this is called out explicitly .
[ RFC3986 ] [ RFC3987 ]
The term root element , when not qualified to explicitly refer to the document 's root element , means the furthest ancestor element node of whatever node is being discussed , or the node itself is there is none .
When the node is a part of the document , then that is indeed the document 's root element .
However , if the node is not currently part of the document tree , the root element will be an orphaned node .
An element is said to have been inserted into a document when its root element changes and is now the document 's root element .
The term tree order means a pre-order , depth - first traversal of DOM nodes involved ( through the parentNode / childNodes relationship ) .
When it is stated that some element or attribute is ignored , or treated as some other value , or handled as if it was something else , this refers only to the processing of the node after it is in the DOM .
A user agent must not mutate the DOM in such situations .
When an XML name , such as an attribute or element name , is referred to in the form prefix : localName , as in xml : id or svg:rect , it refers to a name with the local name localName and the namespace given by the prefix , as defined by the following table :
xml http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace html http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml svg http://www.w3.org/2000/svg
For simplicity , terms such as shown , displayed , and visible might sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is rendered to the user .
These terms are not meant to imply a visual medium ; they must be considered to apply to other media in equivalent ways .
Various DOM interfaces are defined in this specification using pseudo - IDL .
This looks like OMG IDL but is n't .
For instance , method overloading is used , and types from the W3C DOM specifications are used without qualification .
Language - specific bindings for these abstract interface definitions must be derived in the way consistent with W3C DOM specifications .
Some interface - specific binding information for ECMAScript is included in this specification .
The current situation with IDL blocks is pitiful .
IDL is totally inadequate to properly represent what objects have to look like in JS ; IDL can't say if a member is enumerable , what the indexing behaviour is , what the stringification behaviour is , what behaviour setting a member whose type is a particular interface should be ( e.g. setting of document.location or element.className ) , what constructor an object implementing an interface should claim to have , how overloads work , etc .
I think we should make the IDL blocks non-normative , and / or replace them with something else that is better for JS while still being clear on how it applies to other languages .
However , we do need to have something that says what types the methods take as arguments , since we have to raise exceptions if they are wrong .
The construction " a Foo object " , where Foo is actually an interface , is sometimes used instead of the more accurate " an object implementing the interface Foo " .
A DOM attribute is said to be getting when its value is being retrieved ( e.g. by author script ) , and is said to be setting when a new value is assigned to it .
If a DOM object is said to be live , then that means that any attributes returning that object must always return the same object ( not a new object each time ) , and the attributes and methods on that object must operate on the actual underlying data , not a snapshot of the data .
The terms fire and dispatch are used interchangeably in the context of events , as in the DOM Events specifications .
[ DOM3EVENTS ]
The term text node refers to any Text node , including CDATASection nodes ( any Node with node type 3 or 4 ) .
Some of the algorithms in this specification , for historical reasons , require the user agent to pause until some condition has been met .
While a user agent is paused , it must ensure that no scripts execute ( e.g. no event handlers , no timers , etc ) .
User agents should remain responsive to user input while paused , however .
1.4.1 . HTML vs XHTML
This section is non-normative .
This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications , and some APIs for interacting with in - memory representations of resources that use this language .
The in -memory representation is known as " DOM5 HTML " , or " the DOM " for short .
There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this abstract language , two of which are defined in this specification .
The first such concrete syntax is " HTML5 " .
This is the format recommended for most authors .
It is compatible with all legacy Web browsers .
If a document is transmitted with the MIME type text / html , then it will be processed as an " HTML5 " document by Web browsers .
The second concrete syntax uses XML , and is known as " XHTML5 " .
When a document is transmitted with an XML MIME type , such as application / xhtml+xml , then it is processed by an XML processor by Web browsers , and treated as an " XHTML5 " document .
Authors are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML differs ; in particular , even minor syntax errors will prevent an XML document from being rendered fully , whereas they would be ignored in the " HTML5 " syntax .
The " DOM5 HTML " , " HTML5 " , and " XHTML5 " representations cannot all represent the same content .
For example , namespaces cannot be represented using " HTML5 " , but they are supported in " DOM5 HTML " and " XHTML5 " .
Similarly , documents that use the noscript feature can be represented using " HTML5 " , but cannot be represented with " XHTML5 " and " DOM5 HTML " .
Comments that contain the string " --> " can be represented in " DOM5 HTML " but not in " HTML5 " and " XHTML5 " .
And so forth .
2. The Document Object Model
The Document Object Model ( DOM ) is a representation — a model — of a document and its content .
[ DOM3CORE ]
The DOM is not just an API ; the conformance criteria of HTML implementations are defined , in this specification , in terms of operations on the DOM .
This specification defines the language represented in the DOM by features together called DOM5 HTML .
DOM5 HTML consists of DOM Core Document nodes and DOM Core Element nodes , along with text nodes and other content .
Elements in the DOM represent things ; that is , they have intrinsic meaning , also known as semantics .
For example , an ol element represents an ordered list .
In addition , documents and elements in the DOM host APIs that extend the DOM Core APIs , providing new features to application developers using DOM5 HTML .
2.1 . Documents
Every XML and HTML document in an HTML UA is represented by a Document object .
[ DOM3CORE ]
Document objects are assumed to be XML documents unless they are flagged as being HTML documents when they are created .
Whether a document is an HTML document or an XML document affects the behaviour of certain APIs , as well as a few CSS rendering rules .
[ CSS21 ]
A Document object created by the createDocument ( ) API on the DOMImplementation object is initially an XML document , but can be made into an HTML document by calling document.open ( ) on it .
All Document objects ( in user agents implementing this specification ) must also implement the HTMLDocument interface , available using binding - specific methods .
( This is the case whether or not the document in question is an HTML document or indeed whether it contains any HTML elements at all . )
Document objects must also implement the document - level interface of any other namespaces found in the document that the UA supports .
For example , if an HTML implementation also supports SVG , then the Document object must implement HTMLDocument and SVGDocument .
Because the HTMLDocument interface is now obtained using binding - specific casting methods instead of simply being the primary interface of the document object , it is no longer defined as inheriting from Document .
Since the HTMLDocument interface holds methods and attributes related to a number of disparate features , the members of this interface are described in various different sections .
2.1.1 . Security
User agents must raise a security exception whenever any of the members of an HTMLDocument object are accessed by scripts whose origin is not the same as the Document 's origin .
2.1.2 . Resource metadata management
The URL attribute must return the document 's address .
The domain attribute must be initialised to the document 's domain , if it has one , and null otherwise .
On getting , the attribute must return its current value .
On setting , if the new value is an allowed value ( as defined below ) , the attribute 's value must be changed to the new value .
If the new value is not an allowed value , then a security exception must be raised instead .
A new value is an allowed value for the document .
domain attribute if it is equal to the attribute 's current value , or if the new value , prefixed by a U+002E FULL STOP ( " . " ) , exactly matches the end of the current value .
If the current value is null , new values other than null will never be allowed .
If the Document object 's address is hierarchical and uses a server - based naming authority , then its domain is the < host > /< ihost > part of that address .
Otherwise , it has no domain .
The domain attribute is used to enable pages on different hosts of a domain to access each others '
DOMs , though this is not yet defined by this specification .
we should handle IP addresses here
The referrer attribute must return either the URI of the page which navigated the browsing context to the current document ( if any ) , or the empty string if there is no such originating page , or if the UA has been configured not to report referrers , or if the navigation was initiated for a hyperlink with a noreferrer keyword .
In the case of HTTP , the referrer DOM attribute will match the Referer ( sic ) header that was sent when fetching the current page .
The cookie attribute must , on getting , return the same string as the value of the Cookie HTTP header it would include if fetching the resource indicated by the document 's address over HTTP , as per RFC 2109 section 4.3.4 . [ RFC2109 ]
On setting , the cookie attribute must cause the user agent to act as it would when processing cookies if it had just attempted to fetch the document 's address over HTTP , and had received a response with a Set - Cookie header whose value was the specified value , as per RFC 2109 sections 4.3.1 , 4.3.2 , and 4.3.3 . [ RFC2109 ]
Since the cookie attribute is accessible across frames , the path restrictions on cookies are only a tool to help manage which cookies are sent to which parts of the site , and are not in any way a security feature .
The lastModified attribute , on getting , must return the date and time of the Document 's source file 's last modification , in the user 's local timezone , in the following format :
The month component of the date .
A U+002F SOLIDUS character ( ' /' ) .
The day component of the date .
A U+002F SOLIDUS character ( ' /' ) .
The year component of the date .
A U+0020 SPACE character .
The hours component of the time .
A U+003A COLON character ( ' :' ) .
The minutes component of the time .
A U+003A COLON character ( ' :' ) .
The seconds component of the time .
All the numeric components above , other than the year , must be given as two digits in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE representing the number in base ten , zero - padded if necessary .
The Document 's source file 's last modification date and time must be derived from relevant features of the networking protocols used , e.g. from the value of the HTTP Last - Modified header of the document , or from metadata in the filesystem for local files .
If the last modification date and time are not known , the attribute must return the string
01/01/1970 00:00:00 .
The compatMode DOM attribute must return the literal string " CSS1 Compat " unless the document has been set to quirks mode by the HTML parser , in which case it must instead return the literal string " BackCompat " .
The document can also be set to limited quirks mode ( also known as " almost standards " mode ) .
By default , the document is set to no quirks mode ( also known as " standards mode " ) .
As far as parsing goes , the quirks I know of are : Comment parsing is different .
p can contain table
can contain Safari and IE have special parsing rules for <% ... %>
( even in standards mode , though clearly this should be quirks - only ) .
2.2 . Elements
The nodes representing HTML elements in the DOM must implement , and expose to scripts , the interfaces listed for them in the relevant sections of this specification .
This includes XHTML elements in XML documents , even when those documents are in another context ( e.g. inside an XSLT transform ) .
The basic interface , from which all the HTML elements ' interfaces inherit , and which must be used by elements that have no additional requirements , is the HTMLElement interface .
As with the HTMLDocument interface , the HTMLElement interface holds methods and attributes related to a number of disparate features , and the members of this interface are therefore described in various different sections of this specification .
2.2.1 . Reflecting content attributes in DOM attributes
Some DOM attributes are defined to reflect a particular content attribute .
This means that on getting , the DOM attribute returns the current value of the content attribute , and on setting , the DOM attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the given value .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a DOMString attribute whose content attribute is defined to contain a URI , then on getting , the DOM attribute must return the value of the content attribute , resolved to an absolute URI , and on setting , must set the content attribute to the specified literal value .
If the content attribute is absent , the DOM attribute must return the default value , if the content attribute has one , or else the empty string .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a DOMString attribute whose content attribute is defined to contain one or more URIs , then on getting , the DOM attribute must split the content attribute on spaces and return the concatenation of each token URI , resolved to an absolute URI , with a single U+0020 SPACE character between each URI ; and on setting , must set the content attribute to the specified literal value .
If the content attribute is absent , the DOM attribute must return the default value , if the content attribute has one , or else the empty string .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a DOMString whose content attribute is an enumerated attribute , and the DOM attribute is limited to only known values , then , on getting , the DOM attribute must return the value associated with the state the attribute is in ( in its canonical case ) , or the empty string if the attribute is in a state that has no associated keyword value ; and on setting , if the new value case - insensitively matches one of the keywords given for that attribute , then the content attribute must be set to that value , otherwise , if the new value is the empty string , then the content attribute must be removed , otherwise , the setter must raise a SYNTAX_ERR exception .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a DOMString but does n't fall into any of the above categories , then the getting and setting must be done in a transparent , case - preserving manner .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a boolean attribute , then the DOM attribute must return true if the attribute is set , and false if it is absent .
On setting , the content attribute must be removed if the DOM attribute is set to false , and must be set to have the same value as its name if the DOM attribute is set to true .
( This corresponds to the rules for boolean content attributes . )
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a signed integer type ( long ) then the content attribute must be parsed according to the rules for parsing signed integers first .
If that fails , or if the attribute is absent , the default value must be returned instead , or 0 if there is no default value .
On setting , the given value must be converted to a string representing the number as a valid integer in base ten and then that string must be used as the new content attribute value .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is an unsigned integer type ( unsigned long ) then the content attribute must be parsed according to the rules for parsing unsigned integers first .
If that fails , or if the attribute is absent , the default value must be returned instead , or 0 if there is no default value .
On setting , the given value must be converted to a string representing the number as a valid non-negative integer in base ten and then that string must be used as the new content attribute value .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is an unsigned integer type ( unsigned long ) that is limited to only positive non-zero numbers , then the behavior is similar to the previous case , but zero is not allowed .
On getting , the content attribute must first be parsed according to the rules for parsing unsigned integers , and if that fails , or if the attribute is absent , the default value must be returned instead , or 1 if there is no default value .
On setting , if the value is zero , the user agent must fire an INDEX_SIZE_ERR exception .
Otherwise , the given value must be converted to a string representing the number as a valid non-negative integer in base ten and then that string must be used as the new content attribute value .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is a floating point number type ( float ) and the content attribute is defined to contain a time offset , then the content attribute must be parsed according to the rules for parsing time ofsets first .
If that fails , or if the attribute is absent , the default value must be returned instead , or the not - a - number value ( NaN ) if there is no default value .
On setting , the given value must be converted to a string using the time offset serialisation rules , and that string must be used as the new content attribute value .
If a reflecting DOM attribute is of the type DOMTokenList , then on getting it must return a DOMTokenList object whose underlying string is the element 's corresponding content attribute .
When the DOMTokenList object mutates its underlying string , the attribute must itself be immediately mutated .
When the attribute is absent , then the string represented by the DOMTokenList object is the empty string ; when the object mutates this empty string , the user agent must first add the corresponding content attribute , and then mutate that attribute instead .
DOMTokenList attributes are always read - only .
The same DOMTokenList object must be returned every time for each attribute .
If a reflecting DOM attribute has the type HTMLElement , or an interface that descends from HTMLElement , then , on getting , it must run the following algorithm ( stopping at the first point where a value is returned ) :
If the corresponding content attribute is absent , then the DOM attribute must return null .
Let candidate be the element that the document.getElementById ( ) method would find if it was passed as its argument the current value of the corresponding content attribute .
If candidate is null , or if it is not type - compatible with the DOM attribute , then the DOM attribute must return null .
Otherwise , it must return candidate .
On setting , if the given element has an id attribute , then the content attribute must be set to the value of that id attribute .
Otherwise , the DOM attribute must be set to the empty string .
2.3 . Common DOM interfaces
2.3.1 . Collections
The HTMLCollection , HTMLFormControlsCollection , and HTMLOptionsCollection interfaces represent various lists of DOM nodes .
Collectively , objects implementing these interfaces are called collections .
When a collection is created , a filter and a root are associated with the collection .
For example , when the HTMLCollection object for the document .images attribute is created , it is associated with a filter that selects only img elements , and rooted at the root of the document .
The collection then represents a live view of the subtree rooted at the collection 's root , containing only nodes that match the given filter .
The view is linear .
In the absence of specific requirements to the contrary , the nodes within the collection must be sorted in tree order .
The rows list is not in tree order .
An attribute that returns a collection must return the same object every time it is retrieved .
2.3.1.1. HTMLCollection
The HTMLCollection interface represents a generic collection of elements .
interface HTMLCollection { readonly attribute unsigned long length ; Element item ( in unsigned long index ) ; Element namedItem ( in DOMString name ) ; } ;
The length attribute must return the number of nodes represented by the collection .
The item ( index ) method must return the index th node in the collection .
If there is no index th node in the collection , then the method must return null .
The named Item ( key ) method must return the first node in the collection that matches the following requirements :
It is an a , applet , area , form , img , or object element with a name attribute equal to key , or ,
, , , , , or element with a attribute equal to , or , It is an HTML element of any kind with an id attribute equal to key .
( Non-HTML elements , even if they have IDs , are not searched for the purposes of named Item ( ) . )
If no such elements are found , then the method must return null .
In ECMAScript implementations , objects that implement the HTMLCollection interface must also have a [ [ Get ] ] method that , when invoked with a property name that is a number , acts like the item ( ) method would when invoked with that argument , and when invoked with a property name that is a string , acts like the named Item ( ) method would when invoked with that argument .
2.3.1.2. HTMLFormControlsCollection
The HTMLFormControlsCollection interface represents a collection of form controls .
interface HTMLFormControlsCollection { readonly attribute unsigned long length ; HTMLElement item ( in unsigned long index ) ; Object namedItem ( in DOMString name ) ; } ;
The length attribute must return the number of nodes represented by the collection .
The item ( index ) method must return the index th node in the collection .
If there is no index th node in the collection , then the method must return null .
The named Item ( key ) method must act according to the following algorithm :
If , at the time the method is called , there is exactly one node in the collection that has either an id attribute or a name attribute equal to key , then return that node and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , if there are no nodes in the collection that have either an id attribute or a name attribute equal to key , then return null and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , create a NodeList object representing a live view of the HTMLFormControlsCollection object , further filtered so that the only nodes in the NodeList object are those that have either an id attribute or a name attribute equal to key .
The nodes in the NodeList object must be sorted in tree order .
Return that NodeList object .
In the ECMAScript DOM binding , objects implementing the HTMLFormControlsCollection interface must support being dereferenced using the square bracket notation , such that dereferencing with an integer index is equivalent to invoking the item ( ) method with that index , and such that dereferencing with a string index is equivalent to invoking the named Item ( ) method with that index .
2.3.1.3 . HTMLOptionsCollection
The HTMLOptionsCollection interface represents a list of option elements .
interface HTMLOptionsCollection { attribute unsigned long length ; HTMLOptionElement item ( in unsigned long index ) ; Object namedItem ( in DOMString name ) ; } ;
On getting , the length attribute must return the number of nodes represented by the collection .
On setting , the behaviour depends on whether the new value is equal to , greater than , or less than the number of nodes represented by the collection at that time .
If the number is the same , then setting the attribute must do nothing .
If the new value is greater , then n new option elements with no attributes and no child nodes must be appended to the select element on which the HTMLOptionsCollection is rooted , where n is the difference between the two numbers ( new value minus old value ) .
If the new value is lower , then the last n nodes in the collection must be removed from their parent nodes , where n is the difference between the two numbers ( old value minus new value ) .
Setting length never removes or adds any optgroup elements , and never adds new children to existing optgroup elements ( though it can remove children from them ) .
The item ( index ) method must return the index th node in the collection .
If there is no index th node in the collection , then the method must return null .
The named Item ( key ) method must act according to the following algorithm :
If , at the time the method is called , there is exactly one node in the collection that has either an id attribute or a name attribute equal to key , then return that node and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , if there are no nodes in the collection that have either an id attribute or a name attribute equal to key , then return null and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , create a NodeList object representing a live view of the HTMLOptionsCollection object , further filtered so that the only nodes in the NodeList object are those that have either an id attribute or a name attribute equal to key .
The nodes in the NodeList object must be sorted in tree order .
Return that NodeList object .
In the ECMAScript DOM binding , objects implementing the HTMLOptionsCollection interface must support being dereferenced using the square bracket notation , such that dereferencing with an integer index is equivalent to invoking the item ( ) method with that index , and such that dereferencing with a string index is equivalent to invoking the named Item ( ) method with that index .
We may want to add add ( ) and remove ( ) methods here too because IE implements HTMLSelectElement and HTMLOptionsCollection on the same object , and so people use them almost interchangeably in the wild .
2.3.2 . DOMTokenList
The DOMTokenList interface represents an interface to an underlying string that consists of an unordered set of unique space - separated tokens .
Which string underlies a particular DOMTokenList object is defined when the object is created .
It might be a content attribute ( e.g. the string that underlies the classList object is the class attribute ) , or it might be an anonymous string ( e.g. when a DOMTokenList object is passed to an author - implemented callback in the datagrid APIs ) .
interface DOMTokenList { readonly attribute unsigned long length ; DOMString item ( in unsigned long index ) ; boolean has ( in DOMString token ) ; void add ( in DOMString token ) ; void remove ( in DOMString token ) ; boolean toggle ( in DOMString token ) ; } ;
The length attribute must return the number of unique tokens that result from splitting the underlying string on spaces .
The item ( index ) method must split the underlying string on spaces , sort the resulting list of tokens by Unicode codepoint , remove exact duplicates , and then return the index th item in this list .
If index is equal to or greater than the number of tokens , then the method must return null .
In ECMAScript implementations , objects that implement the DOMTokenList interface must also have a [ [ Get ] ] method that , when invoked with a property name that is a number , acts like the item ( ) method would when invoked with that argument .
The has ( token ) method must run the following algorithm :
If the token argument contains any spaces , then raise an INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , split the underlying string on spaces to get the list of tokens in the object 's underlying string .
If the token indicated by token is one of the tokens in the object 's underlying string then return true and stop this algorithm .
Otherwise , return false .
The add ( token ) method must run the following algorithm :
If the token argument contains any spaces , then raise an INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , split the underlying string on spaces to get the list of tokens in the object 's underlying string .
If the given token is already one of the tokens in the DOMTokenList object 's underlying string then stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , if the last character of the DOMTokenList object 's underlying string is not a space character , then append a U+0020 SPACE character to the end of that string .
Append the value of token to the end of the DOMTokenList object 's underlying string .
The remove ( token ) method must run the following algorithm :
If the token argument contains any spaces , then raise an INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , remove the given token from the underlying string .
The toggle ( token ) method must run the following algorithm :
If the token argument contains any spaces , then raise an INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception and stop the algorithm .
Otherwise , split the underlying string on spaces to get the list of tokens in the object 's underlying string .
If the given token is already one of the tokens in the DOMTokenList object 's underlying string then remove the given token from the underlying string , and stop the algorithm , returning false .
Otherwise , if the last character of the DOMTokenList object 's underlying string is not a space character , then append a U+0020 SPACE character to the end of that string .
Append the value of token to the end of the DOMTokenList object 's underlying string .
Return true .
In the ECMAScript DOM binding , objects implementing the DOMTokenList interface must stringify to the object 's underlying string representation .
2.3.3 . DOM feature strings
DOM3
Core defines mechanisms for checking for interface support , and for obtaining implementations of interfaces , using feature strings .
[ DOM3CORE ]
A DOM application can use the hasFeature ( feature , version ) method of the DOMImplementation interface with parameter values " HTML " and " 5.0 " ( respectively ) to determine whether or not this module is supported by the implementation .
In addition to the feature string " HTML " , the feature string " XHTML " ( with version string " 5.0 " ) can be used to check if the implementation supports XHTML .
User agents should respond with a true value when the has Feature method is queried with these values .
Authors are cautioned , however , that UAs returning true might not be perfectly compliant , and that UAs returning false might well have support for features in this specification ; in general , therefore , use of this method is discouraged .
The values " HTML " and " XHTML " ( both with version " 5.0 " ) should also be supported in the context of the getFeature ( ) and isSupported ( ) methods , as defined by DOM3 Core .
The interfaces defined in this specification are not always supersets of the interfaces defined in DOM2 HTML ; some features that were formerly deprecated , poorly supported , rarely used or considered unnecessary have been removed .
Therefore it is not guarenteed that an implementation that supports " HTML " " 5.0 " also supports " HTML " " 2.0 " .
2.4 . DOM tree accessors
The html element of a document is the document 's root element , if there is one and it's an html element , or null otherwise .
The head element of a document is the first head element that is a child of the html element , if there is one , or null otherwise .
The title element of a document is the first title element that is a child of the head element , if there is one , or null otherwise .
The title attribute must , on getting , run the following algorithm :
If the root element is an svg element in the " http://www.w3.org/2000/svg " namespace , and the user agent supports SVG , then the getter must return the value that would have been returned by the DOM attribute of the same name on the SVGDocument interface .
Otherwise , it must return a concatenation of the data of all the child text nodes of the title element , in tree order , or the empty string if the title element is null .
On setting , the following algorithm must be run :
If the root element is an svg element in the " http://www.w3.org/2000/svg " namespace , and the user agent supports SVG , then the setter must defer to the setter for the DOM attribute of the same name on the SVGDocument interface .
Stop the algorithm here .
If the head element is null , then the attribute must do nothing .
Stop the algorithm here .
If the title element is null , then a new title element must be created and appended to the head element .
The children of the title element ( if any ) must all be removed .
A single Text node whose data is the new value being assigned must be appended to the title element .
The title attribute on the HTMLDocument interface should shadow the attribute of the same name on the SVGDocument interface when the user agent supports both HTML and SVG .
The body element of a document is the first child of the html element that is either a body element or a frameset element .
If there is no such element , it is null .
If the body element is null , then when the specification requires that events be fired at " the body element " , they must instead be fired at the Document object .
The body attribute , on getting , must return the body element of the document ( either a body element , a frameset element , or null ) .
On setting , the following algorithm must be run :
If the new value is not a body or frameset element , then raise a HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR exception and abort these steps .
Otherwise , if the new value is the same as the body element , do nothing .
Abort these steps .
Otherwise , if the body element is not null , then replace that element with the new value in the DOM , as if the root element 's replaceChild ( ) method had been called with the new value and the incumbent body element as its two arguments respectively , then abort these steps .
Otherwise , the the body element is null .
Append the new value to the root element .
The images attribute must return an HTMLCollection rooted at the Document node , whose filter matches only img elements .
The attribute must return an HTMLCollection rooted at the Document node , whose filter matches only a elements with href attributes and area elements with href attributes .
The forms attribute must return an HTMLCollection rooted at the Document node , whose filter matches only form elements .
The anchors attribute must return an HTMLCollection rooted at the Document node , whose filter matches only a elements with name attributes .
The getElementsByName ( name ) method a string name , and must return a live NodeList containing all the a , applet , button , form , iframe , img , input , map , meta , object , select , and textarea elements in that document that have a name attribute whose value is equal to the name argument .
The getElementsByClassName ( classNames ) method takes a string that contains an unordered set of unique space - separated tokens representing classes .
When called , the method must return a live NodeList object containing all the elements in the document that have all the classes specified in that argument , having obtained the classes by splitting a string on spaces .
If there are no tokens specified in the argument , then the method must return an empty NodeList .
The getElementsByClassName ( ) method on the HTMLElement interface must return a live NodeList with the nodes that the HTMLDocument getElements ByClassName ( ) method would return when passed the same argument ( s ) , excluding any elements that are not descendants of the HTMLElement object on which the method was invoked .
HTML , SVG , and MathML elements define which classes they are in by having an attribute in the per-element partition with the name class containing a space - separated list of classes to which the element belongs .
Other specifications may also allow elements in their namespaces to be labelled as being in specific classes .
UAs must not assume that all attributes of the name class for elements in any namespace work in this way , however , and must not assume that such attributes , when used as global attributes , label other elements as being in specific classes .
Given the following XHTML fragment : < div id =" example " > < p id = " p1 " class = " aaa bbb " /> < p id = " p2 " class= " aaa ccc " /> < p id = " p3 " class= " bbb ccc " / > </div> A call to document.getElementById(' example ').getElementsByClassName('aaa ' ) would return a NodeList with the two paragraphs p1 and p2 in it .
A call to getElements ByClassName ( 'ccc bbb ' ) would only return one node , however , namely p3 .
A call to document.getElementById(' example ').getElementsByClassName(' bbb ccc ') would return the same thing .
A call to getElements ByClassName ( ' aaa , bbb ' ) would return no nodes ; none of the elements above are in the " aaa , bbb " class .
The dir attribute on the HTMLDocument interface is defined along with the dir content attribute .
2.5 . Dynamic markup insertion
The document . write ( ) family of methods and the innerHTML family of DOM attributes enable script authors to dynamically insert markup into the document .
bz argues that innerHTML should be called something else on XML documents and XML elements .
Is the sanity worth the migration pain ?
Because these APIs interact with the parser , their behaviour varies depending on whether they are used with HTML documents ( and the HTML parser ) or XHTML in XML documents ( and the XML parser ) .
The following table cross-references the various versions of these APIs .
Regardless of the parsing mode , the document . writeln ( ... ) method must call the document .
write ( ) method with the same argument ( s ) , and then call the document .
write ( ) method with , as its argument , a string consisting of a single line feed character ( U+000A ) .
2.5.1 . Controlling the input stream
The open ( ) method comes in several variants with different numbers of arguments .
When called with two or fewer arguments , the method must act as follows :
Let type be the value of the first argument , if there is one , or " text / html " otherwise .
Let replace be true if there is a second argument and it has the value " replace " , and false otherwise .
If the document has an active parser that is n't a script - created parser , and the insertion point associated with that parser 's input stream is not undefined ( that is , it does point to somewhere in the input stream ) , then the method does nothing .
Abort these steps and return the Document object on which the method was invoked .
This basically causes document.open ( ) to be ignored when it 's called in an inline script found during the parsing of data sent over the network , while still letting it have an effect when called asynchronously or on a document that is itself being spoon - fed using these APIs .
onbeforeunload , onunload
If the document has an active parser , then stop that parser , and throw away any pending content in the input stream .
what about if it does n't , because it 's either like a text / plain , or Atom , or PDF , or XHTML , or image document , or something ?
Remove all child nodes of the document .
Create a new HTML parser and associate it with the document .
This is a script - created parser ( meaning that it can be closed by the document.open ( ) and document.close ( ) methods , and that the tokeniser will wait for an explicit call to document.
close ( ) before emitting an end - of - file token ) .
Mark the document as being an HTML document ( it might already be so - marked ) .
If type does not have the value " text / html " , then act as if the tokeniser had emitted a pre element start tag , then set the HTML parser 's tokenisation stage 's content model flag to PLAINTEXT .
If replace is false , then : Remove all the entries in the browsing context 's session history after the current entry in its Document 's History object Remove any earlier entries that share the same Document
Add a new entry just before the last entry that is associated with the text that was parsed by the previous parser associated with the Document object , as well as the state of the document at the start of these steps .
( This allows the user to step backwards in the session history to see the page before it was blown away by the document.open ( ) call . )
Finally , set the insertion point to point at just before the end of the input stream ( which at this point will be empty ) .
Return the Document on which the method was invoked .
We should n't hard - code text / plain there .
We should do it some other way , e.g. hand off to the section on content - sniffing and handling of incoming data streams , the part that defines how this all works when stuff comes over the network .
When called with three or more arguments , the open ( ) method on the HTMLDocument object must call the open ( ) method on the Window interface of the object returned by the defaultView attribute of the DocumentView interface of the HTMLDocument object , with the same arguments as the original call to the open ( ) method , and return whatever that method returned .
If the defaultView attribute of the DocumentView interface of the HTMLDocument object is null , then the method must raise an INVALID_ACCESS_ERR exception .
The close ( ) method must do nothing if there is no script - created parser associated with the document .
If there is such a parser , then , when the method is called , the user agent must insert an explicit " EOF " character at the insertion point of the parser 's input stream .
2.5.2 . Dynamic markup insertion in HTML
In HTML , the document . write ( ... ) method must act as follows :
In HTML , the innerHTML DOM attribute of all HTMLElement and HTMLDocument nodes returns a serialisation of the node 's children using the HTML syntax .
On setting , it replaces the node 's children with new nodes that result from parsing the given value .
The formal definitions follow .
On getting , the innerHTML DOM attribute must return the result of running the HTML fragment serialisation algorithm on the node .
On setting , if the node is a document , the innerHTML DOM attribute must run the following algorithm :
If the document has an active parser , then stop that parser , and throw away any pending content in the input stream .
what about if it does n't , because it 's either like a text / plain , or Atom , or PDF , or XHTML , or image document , or something ?
Remove the children nodes of the Document whose innerHTML attribute is being set .
Create a new HTML parser , in its initial state , and associate it with the Document node .
Place into the input stream for the HTML parser just created the string being assigned into the innerHTML attribute .
Start the parser and let it run until it has consumed all the characters just inserted into the input stream .
( The Document node will have been populated with elements and a load event will have fired on its body element . )
Otherwise , if the node is an element , then setting the innerHTML DOM attribute must cause the following algorithm to run instead :
Invoke the HTML fragment parsing algorithm , with the element whose innerHTML attribute is being set as the context and the string being assigned into the innerHTML attribute as the input .
Let new children be the result of this algorithm .
Remove the children of the element whose innerHTML attribute is being set .
Let target document be the ownerDocument of the Element node whose innerHTML attribute is being set .
Set the ownerDocument of all the nodes in new children to the target document .
Append all the new children nodes to the node whose innerHTML attribute is being set , preserving their order .
script elements inserted using innerHTML do not execute when they are inserted .
2.5.3 . Dynamic markup insertion in XML
In an XML context , the document . write ( ) method must raise an INVALID_ACCESS_ERR exception .
On the other hand , however , the innerHTML attribute is indeed usable in an XML context .
In an XML context , the innerHTML DOM attribute on HTMLElement s and HTMLDocument s , on getting , must return a string in the form of an internal general parsed entity that is XML namespace - well - formed , the string being an isomorphic serialisation of all of that node 's child nodes , in document order .
User agents may adjust prefixes and namespace declarations in the serialisation ( and indeed might be forced to do so in some cases to obtain namespace - well - formed XML ) . [ XML ] [ XMLNS ]
If any of the following cases are found in the DOM being serialised , the user agent must raise an INVALID_STATE_ERR exception :
A DocumentType node that has an external subset public identifier or an external subset system identifier that contains both a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ( ' " ' ) and a U+0027 APOSTROPHE ( " ' " ) .
node that has an external subset public identifier or an external subset system identifier that contains both a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ( ' " ' ) and a U+0027 APOSTROPHE ( " ' " ) .
A node with a prefix or local name containing a U+003A COLON ( " : " ) .
A Text node whose data contains characters that are not matched by the XML Char production . [ XML ]
node whose data contains characters that are not matched by the XML production .
[ XML ]
A CDATASection node whose data contains the string " ] ] > " .
node whose data contains the string " " .
A Comment node whose data contains two adjacent U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS ( -) characters or ends with such a character .
node whose data contains two adjacent U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS ( -) characters or ends with such a character .
A ProcessingInstruction node whose target name is the string " xml " ( case insensitively ) .
node whose target name is the string " " ( case insensitively ) .
A ProcessingInstruction node whose target name contains a U+003A COLON ( " : " ) .
node whose target name contains a U+003A COLON ( " : " ) .
A ProcessingInstruction node whose data contains the string " ? > " .
These are the only ways to make a DOM unserialisable .
The DOM enforces all the other XML constraints ; for example , trying to set an attribute with a name that contains an equals sign ( = ) will raised an INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception .
On setting , in an XML context , the innerHTML DOM attribute on HTMLElement s and HTMLDocument s must run the following algorithm :
The user agent must create a new XML parser .
If the innerHTML attribute is being set on an element , the user agent must feed the parser just created the string corresponding to the start tag of that element , declaring all the namespace prefixes that are in scope on that element in the DOM , as well as declaring the default namespace ( if any ) that is in scope on that element in the DOM .
The user agent must feed the parser just created the string being assigned into the innerHTML attribute .
If the innerHTML attribute is being set on an element , the user agent must feed the parser the string corresponding to the end tag of that element .
If the parser found a well - formedness error , the attribute 's setter must raise a SYNTAX_ERR exception and abort these steps .
The user agent must remove the children nodes of the node whose innerHTML attribute is being set .
If the attribute is being set on a Document node , let new children be the children of the document , preserving their order .
Otherwise , the attribute is being set on an Element node ; let new children be the children of the the document 's root element , preserving their order .
If the attribute is being set on a Document node , let target document be that Document node .
Otherwise , the attribute is being set on an Element node ; let target document be the ownerDocument of that Element .
Set the ownerDocument of all the nodes in new children to the target document .
Append all the new children nodes to the node whose innerHTML attribute is being set , preserving their order .
script elements inserted using innerHTML do not execute when they are inserted .
2.6 . APIs in HTML documents
For HTML documents , and for HTML elements in HTML documents , certain APIs defined in DOM3
Core become case - insensitive or case - changing , as sometimes defined in DOM3 Core , and as summarised or required below .
[ DOM3CORE ] .
This does not apply to XML documents or to elements that are not in the HTML namespace despite being in HTML documents .
Element.tagName , Node.nodeName , and Node.localName
These attributes return tag names in all uppercase and attribute names in all lowercase , regardless of the case with which they were created .
Document.createElement ()
The canonical form of HTML markup is all - lowercase ; thus , this method will lowercase the argument before creating the requisite element .
Also , the element created must be in the HTML namespace .
This does n't apply to Document.createElementNS ( ) .
Thus , it is possible , by passing this last method a tag name in the wrong case , to create an element that claims to have the tag name of an element defined in this specification , but does n't support its interfaces , because it really has another tag name not accessible from the DOM APIs .
Element.setAttributeNode ()
When an Attr node is set on an HTML element , it must have its name lowercased before the element is affected .
This does n't apply to Document.setAttributeNodeNS ( ) . Element.setAttribute ()
When an attribute is set on an HTML element , the name argument must be lowercased before the element is affected .
This does n't apply to Document.setAttributeNS ( ) . Document.getElementsByTagName( ) and Element.getElementsByTagName ( )
These methods ( but not their namespaced counterparts ) must compare the given argument case - insensitively when looking at HTML elements , and case - sensitively otherwise .
Thus , in an HTML document with nodes in multiple namespaces , these methods will be both case - sensitive and case - insensitive at the same time .
Document.renameNode ( )
If the new namespace is the HTML namespace , then the new qualified name must be lowercased before the rename takes place .
3. Semantics and structure of HTML elements
3.1 . Introduction
This section is non-normative .
An introduction to marking up a document .
3.2 . Common microsyntaxes
There are various places in HTML that accept particular data types , such as dates or numbers .
This section describes what the conformance criteria for content in those formats is , and how to parse them .
Need to go through the whole spec and make sure all the attribute values are clearly defined either in terms of microsyntaxes or in terms of other specs , or as " Text " or some such .
3.2.1 . Common parser idioms
The space characters , for the purposes of this specification , are U+0020 SPACE , U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION ( tab ) , U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) , U+000B LINE TABULATION , U+000C FORM FEED ( FF ) , and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) .
Some of the micro-parsers described below follow the pattern of having an input variable that holds the string being parsed , and having a position variable pointing at the next character to parse in input .
For parsers based on this pattern , a step that requires the user agent to collect a sequence of characters means that the following algorithm must be run , with characters being the set of characters that can be collected :
Let input and position be the same variables as those of the same name in the algorithm that invoked these steps .
Let result be the empty string .
While position does n't point past the end of input and the character at position is one of the characters , append that character to the end of result and advance position to the next character in input .
Return result .
The step skip whitespace means that the user agent must collect a sequence of characters that are space characters .
The step skip
Zs characters means that the user agent must collect a sequence of characters that are in the Unicode character class Zs .
In both cases , the collected characters are not used .
[ UNICODE ]
3.2.2 . Boolean attributes
A number of attributes in HTML5 are boolean attributes .
The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value , and the absence of the attribute represents the false value .
If the attribute is present , its value must either be the empty string or the attribute 's canonical name , exactly , with no leading or trailing whitespace , and in lowercase .
3.2.3 . Numbers
3.2.3.1 . Unsigned integers
A string is a valid non-negative integer if it consists of one of more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) .
The rules for parsing non-negative integers are as given in the following algorithm .
When invoked , the steps must be followed in the order given , aborting at the first step that returns a value .
This algorithm will either return zero , a positive integer , or an error .
Leading spaces are ignored .
Trailing spaces and indeed any trailing garbage characters are ignored .
Let input be the string being parsed .
Let position be a pointer into input , initially pointing at the start of the string .
Let value have the value 0 .
Skip whitespace .
If position is past the end of input , return an error .
If the next character is not one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) .. U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) , then return an error .
If the next character is one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) ..
U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) : Multiply value by ten .
Add the value of the current character ( 0..9 ) to value .
Advance position to the next character .
If position is not past the end of input , return to the top of step 7 in the overall algorithm ( that 's the step within which these substeps find themselves ) .
Return value .
3.2.3.2 . Signed integers
A string is a valid integer if it consists of one of more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) , optionally prefixed with a U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS ( " - " ) character .
The rules for parsing integers are similar to the rules for non-negative integers , and are as given in the following algorithm .
When invoked , the steps must be followed in the order given , aborting at the first step that returns a value .
This algorithm will either return an integer or an error .
Leading spaces are ignored .
Trailing spaces and trailing garbage characters are ignored .
Let input be the string being parsed .
Let position be a pointer into input , initially pointing at the start of the string .
Let value have the value 0 .
Let sign have the value " positive " .
Skip whitespace .
If position is past the end of input , return an error .
If the character indicated by position ( the first character ) is a U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS ( " - " ) character :
Let sign be " negative " .
Advance position to the next character .
If position is past the end of input , return an error .
If the next character is not one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) .. U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) , then return an error .
If the next character is one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) ..
U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) : Multiply value by ten .
Add the value of the current character ( 0..9 ) to value .
Advance position to the next character .
If position is not past the end of input , return to the top of step 9 in the overall algorithm ( that 's the step within which these substeps find themselves ) .
If sign is " positive " , return value , otherwise return 0 - value .
3.2.3.3 . Real numbers
A string is a valid floating point number if it consists of one of more characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) , optionally with a single U+002E FULL STOP ( " . " ) character somewhere ( either before these numbers , in between two numbers , or after the numbers ) , all optionally prefixed with a U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS ( " - " ) character .
The rules for parsing floating point number values are as given in the following algorithm .
As with the previous algorithms , when this one is invoked , the steps must be followed in the order given , aborting at the first step that returns a value .
This algorithm will either return a number or an error .
Leading spaces are ignored .
Trailing spaces and garbage characters are ignored .
Let input be the string being parsed .
Let position be a pointer into input , initially pointing at the start of the string .
Let value have the value 0 .
Let sign have the value " positive " .
Skip whitespace .
If position is past the end of input , return an error .
If the character indicated by position ( the first character ) is a U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS ( " - " ) character :
Let sign be " negative " .
Advance position to the next character .
If position is past the end of input , return an error .
If the next character is not one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) .. U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) or U+002E FULL STOP ( " . " ) , then return an error .
If the next character is U+002E FULL STOP ( " . " ) , but either that is the last character or the character after that one is not one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) .. U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) , then return an error .
If the next character is one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) ..
U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) : Multiply value by ten .
Add the value of the current character ( 0..9 ) to value .
Advance position to the next character .
If position is past the end of input , then if sign is " positive " , return value , otherwise return 0 - value .
Otherwise return to the top of step 10 in the overall algorithm ( that 's the step within which these substeps find themselves ) .
Otherwise , if the next character is not a U+002E FULL STOP ( " . " ) , then if sign is " positive " , return value , otherwise return 0 - value .
The next character is a U+002E FULL STOP ( " . " ) .
Advance position to the character after that .
Let divisor be 1 .
If the next character is one of U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) ..
U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) : Multiply divisor by ten .
Add the value of the current character ( 0..9 ) divided by divisor , to value .
Advance position to the next character .
If position is past the end of input , then if sign is " positive " , return value , otherwise return 0 - value .
Otherwise return to the top of step 14 in the overall algorithm ( that 's the step within which these substeps find themselves ) .
Otherwise , if sign is " positive " , return value , otherwise return 0 - value .
3.2.3.4 . Ratios
The algorithms described in this section are used by the progress and meter elements .
A valid denominator punctuation character is one of the characters from the table below .
There is a value associated with each denominator punctuation character , as shown in the table below .
Denominator Punctuation Character Value U+0025 PERCENT SIGN % 100 U+066A ARABIC PERCENT SIGN ٪ 100 U+FE6A SMALL PERCENT SIGN ﹪ 100 U+FF05 FULLWIDTH PERCENT SIGN ％ 100 U+2030 PER MILLE SIGN ‰ 1000 U+2031 PER TEN THOUSAND SIGN ‱ 10000
The steps for finding one or two numbers of a ratio in a string are as follows :
If the string is empty , then return nothing and abort these steps .
Find a number in the string according to the algorithm below , starting at the start of the string .
If the sub - algorithm in step 2 returned nothing or returned an error condition , return nothing and abort these steps .
Set number1 to the number returned by the sub - algorithm in step 2 .
Starting with the character immediately after the last one examined by the sub - algorithm in step 2 , skip any characters in the string that are in the Unicode character class Zs ( this might match zero characters ) .
[ UNICODE ]
If there are still further characters in the string , and the next character in the string is a valid denominator punctuation character , set denominator to that character .
If the string contains any other characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE , but denominator was given a value in the step 6 , return nothing and abort these steps .
Otherwise , if denominator was given a value in step 6 , return number1 and denominator and abort these steps .
Find a number in the string again , starting immediately after the last character that was examined by the sub - algorithm in step 2 .
If the sub - algorithm in step 9 returned nothing or an error condition , return nothing and abort these steps .
Set number2 to the number returned by the sub - algorithm in step 9 .
If there are still further characters in the string , and the next character in the string is a valid denominator punctuation character , return nothing and abort these steps .
If the string contains any other characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE , return nothing and abort these steps .
Otherwise , return number1 and number2 .
The algorithm to find a number is as follows .
It is given a string and a starting position , and returns either nothing , a number , or an error condition .
Starting at the given starting position , ignore all characters in the given string until the first character that is either a U+002E FULL STOP or one of the ten characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE .
If there are no such characters , return nothing and abort these steps .
Starting with the character matched in step 1 , collect all the consecutive characters that are either a U+002E FULL STOP or one of the ten characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE , and assign this string of one or more characters to string .
If string contains more than one U+002E FULL STOP character then return an error condition and abort these steps .
Parse string according to the rules for parsing floating point number values , to obtain number .
This step cannot fail ( string is guarenteed to be a valid floating point number ) .
Return number .
3.2.3.5 . Percentages and dimensions
valid positive non-zero integers rules for parsing dimension values ( only used by height / width on img , embed , object — lengths in css pixels or percentages )
3.2.3.6 . Lists of integers
A valid list of integers is a number of valid integers separated by U+002C COMMA characters , with no other characters ( e.g. no space characters ) .
In addition , there might be restrictions on the number of integers that can be given , or on the range of values allowed .
The rules for parsing a list of integers are as follows :
Let input be the string being parsed .
Let position be a pointer into input , initially pointing at the start of the string .
Let numbers be an initially empty list of integers .
This list will be the result of this algorithm .
If there is a character in the string input at position position , and it is either U+002C COMMA character or a U+0020 SPACE character , then advance position to the next character in input , or to beyond the end of the string if there are no more characters .
If position points to beyond the end of input , return numbers and abort .
If the character in the string input at position position is a U+002C COMMA character or a U+0020 SPACE character , return to step 4 .
Let negated be false .
Let value be 0 .
Let multiple be 1 .
Let started be false .
Let finished be false .
Let bogus be false .
Parser :
If the character in the string input at position position is : A U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS character Follow these substeps :
If finished is true , skip to the next step in the overall set of steps .
If started is true or if bogus is true , let negated be false .
Otherwise , if started is false and if bogus is false , let negated be true .
Let started be true .
A character in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ..
U+0039 DIGIT NINE
Follow these substeps :
If finished is true , skip to the next step in the overall set of steps .
Let n be the value of the digit , interpreted in base ten , multiplied by multiple .
Add n to value .
If value is greater than zero , multiply multiple by ten .
Let started be true .
A U+002C COMMA character A U+0020 SPACE character Follow these substeps :
If started is false , return the numbers list and abort .
If negated is true , then negate value .
Append value to the numbers list .
Jump to step 4 in the overall set of steps .
A U+002E FULL STOP character Follow these substeps : Let finished be true .
Any other character Follow these substeps :
If finished is true , skip to the next step in the overall set of steps .
Let negated be false .
Let bogus be true .
If started is true , then return the numbers list , and abort .
( The value in value is not appended to the list first ; it is dropped . )
Advance position to the next character in input , or to beyond the end of the string if there are no more characters .
If position points to a character ( and not to beyond the end of input ) , jump to the big Parser step above .
If negated is true , then negate value .
If started is true , then append value to the numbers list , return that list , and abort .
Return the numbers list and abort .
In the algorithms below , the number of days in month month of year year is : 31 if month is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , or 12 ; 30 if month is 4 , 6 , 9 , or 11 ; 29 if month is 2 and year is a number divisible by 400 , or if year is a number divisible by 4 but not by 100 ; and 28 otherwise .
This takes into account leap years in the Gregorian calendar .
[ GREGORIAN ]
3.2.4.1 . Specific moments in time
A string is a valid datetime if it has four digits ( representing the year ) , a literal hyphen , two digits ( representing the month ) , a literal hyphen , two digits ( representing the day ) , optionally some spaces , either a literal T or a space , optionally some more spaces , two digits ( for the hour ) , a colon , two digits ( the minutes ) , optionally the seconds ( which , if included , must consist of another colon , two digits ( the integer part of the seconds ) , and optionally a decimal point followed by one or more digits ( for the fractional part of the seconds ) ) , optionally some spaces , and finally either a literal Z ( indicating the time zone is UTC ) , or , a plus sign or a minus sign followed by two digits , a colon , and two digits ( for the sign , the hours and minutes of the timezone offset respectively ) ; with the month - day combination being a valid date in the given year according to the Gregorian calendar , the hour values ( h ) being in the range 0 ≤ h ≤ 23 , the minute values ( m ) in the range 0 ≤ m ≤ 59 , and the second value ( s ) being in the range 0 ≤ h < 60 .
[ GREGORIAN ]
The digits must be characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO ( 0 ) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE ( 9 ) , the hyphens must be a U+002D HYPHEN - MINUS characters , the T must be a U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T , the colons must be U+003A COLON characters , the decimal point must be a U+002E FULL STOP , the Z must be a U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z , the plus sign must be a U+002B PLUS SIGN , and the minus U+002D ( same as the hyphen ) .
The following are some examples of dates written as valid datetimes .
" 0037-12-13 00:00 Z " Midnight UTC on the birthday of Nero ( the Roman Emperor ) . " 1979-10-14T12:00:00.001-04:00 " One millisecond after noon on October 14th 1979 , in the time zone in use on the east coast of North America during daylight saving time .
" 8592-01-01 T 02:09 +02:09 " Midnight UTC on the 1st of January , 8592 .
The time zone associated with that time is two hours and nine minutes ahead of UTC .
Several things are notable about these dates :
Years with fewer than four digits have to be zero - padded .
The date " 37 - 12 - 13 " would not be a valid date .
To unambiguously identify a moment in time prior to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar , the date has to be first converted to the Gregorian calendar from the calendar in use at the time ( e.g. from the Julian calendar ) .
The date of Nero 's birth is the 15th of December 37 , in the Julian Calendar , which is the 13th of December 37 in the Gregorian Calendar .
The time and timezone components are not optional .
Dates before the year 0 or after the year 9999 can't be represented as a datetime in this version of HTML .
Time zones differ based on daylight savings time .
Conformance checkers can use the algorithm below to determine if a datetime is a valid datetime or not .
To , a user agent must apply the following algorithm to the string .
This will either return a time in UTC , with associated timezone information for round tripping or display purposes , or nothing , indicating the value is not a valid datetime .
If at any point the algorithm says that it " fails " , this means that it returns nothing .
Let input be the string being parsed .

W here is agriculture headed ?
Can we feed a growing population and meet the demand for biofuels in the Industrialized North ?
Supporters of biofuel agriculture , ( grain and chemical companies , Wall St. investors , politicians and most University researchers ) avoid mentioning the cost of inputs , the fossil fuels , the environmental damage , the physical toll on animals and humans , and the growing problem of hunger that will accompany the switch from food to energy crop production .
They want us to believe the switch to energy crops will be so easy and so practical .
Iowa Senator Charles Grassley tells us that " BioFuels " will give agriculture new importance as a producer of energy as well as food and fiber .
It will be a win , win , win , situation , good for America 's energy independence , economic prosperity and for the environment .
Will bioenergy production save American agriculture , end our dependence on oil , save the environment and keep food on everyones table ?
Perhaps not .
Biofuels are not the " cash cow " farmers were promised .
As an energy source they are less efficient and no " greener " than oil .
Growing them will cause food prices to rise and as a result , the poor will be at an even greater risk of hunger .
Rain forests will be destroyed and become cropland , peasants around the world will continue to loose their land , their food sovereignty , all to feed the worlds appetite for fuel .
Can biofuels replace a significant amount of fossil fuel ?
Perhaps not .
If , in 2006 , we had dedicated the entire US corn crop to ethanol production we would have replaced only 12 % of the gasoline we used .
If we had planted every acre of cropland in the nation to corn we would have replaced only 80 % of the gasoline we used .
If the U.S. Energy Information Administration is correct in its estimates , and by 2030 the US is capable of producing 700,000 barrels of ethanol per day , we will have succeeded in offsetting roughly 6 percent of our transportation fuel needs .
Is ethanol really a renewable fuel ?
Perhaps not .
An article in Science magazine in 2006 showed that , based on the work of researchers at UC Berkeley , only 5 to 26 % of the energy in ethanol is " renewable " .
The fossil fuel needed to grow and process the ethanol actually negated the majority of its energy value .
Are biofuels really better for the environment ?
Perhaps not .
Data from the University of Edinburgh shows that biofuels produce high levels of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than CO2 .
In total they can produce 70 % more greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels .
Will we be able to produce significant levels of energy crops without impacting world food supplies and prices ?
Perhaps not .
Biofuel production could push food prices up as much as 20 - 40 % according to The International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington .
The production of biofuels depends on billions of dollars in government subsidies in the form of loan guarantees for the construction of biofuel plants , tax exemptions on biofuels and direct payments to farmers .
A 2006 study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development showed an annual subsidy cost of $ 1.05 - $ 1.38 per gallon of ethanol produced , a total of $ 7 billion .
How much are we willing to spend and for what ?
Biofuels are a greenwash scam , a feel good solution for the end of cheap oil .
When one considers the industrial agricultural system that is necessary for their production , biofuels are anything but sustainable .
Costly inputs of fuel , fertilizer and biotech seed will challenge the profitability of Northern farmers while peasant farmers will continue to be evicted to make room for monocultures of corn , soy , sugarcane and oil palms .
Food prices will climb , hunger and poverty will increase and we will be no closer to energy independence or truly renewable fuels .
Now that the President and Congress have , through the Farm and Energy Bills , locked us into large scale production of energy crops and the belief we can continue to live our lives as usual with no pain , what do we do ?
We need energy solutions that will work ; tough vehicle fuel standards , new public transportation systems , real renewable fuels like solar and wind and mandated commitments to conservation and recycling , now , not a 2030 " pie in the sky " .
So , when we drive to the supermarket and complain about the high prices , then proceed to load up our flex - fuel SUV , will we think about the 50 % of the worlds population that lives on less than $ 2 a day ?
Will we even consider that when we bought into the biofuel scam we also took away their food sovereignty and may have handed them a death sentence ?

A Zionist Conspiracy to Wreck Wikipedia
The ultra-Zionist group CAMERA , which specialists in witchhunting academics on US campuses who support the Palestinians , has been caught with their pants down trying to infiltrate 50 editors into Wikipedia with the aim of destroying and vandalising articles supporting the Palestinians and in particular articles on the Nakba and Deir Yassin .
Electronic Intifada
But as Joseph Heller remarked , just because you 're paranoid it does n't mean that people are n't out to get you .
There are of course very real conspiracies e.g. the fitting up of innocent people by the State such as the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti , who were executed in 1927 or the attempted execution of Black journalist Mumia Abu Jamal , framed for killing a cop in Philadelphia in 1981 or indeed the decision to invade Iraq .
One such conspiracy has just been uncovered by the Electronic Intifada .
It involves a particularly nasty group called Camera , dedicated to suppressing all freedom of speech in the USA where Palestine is concerned .
Although they lazily suggest that critics of what they are trying to do will alleged that it is a " ' Zionist ' cabal ( the same one that controls the banks and Hollywood ? ) the evidence is quite clear .
They do n't control any banks but they are trying to control and prevent free discourse and debate over Palestine and in particular to erase from Wikipedia any reference to massacres and expulsion of Palestinians .
All this is to be done , not openly by stating where they are coming from , but by recourse to the Neutral Point of View rules of procedure of Wikipedia .
( ring a few bells ?
well that is what was done by the supporters of Gilad Atzmon on Indymedia not too long ago who used ' procedure ' and ' rules ' rather than arguing their case honestly .
It is clear that this attempted infiltration by Zionist activists of the editors ' group , aided and abetted by an exiting Wiki editor ' Zeq ' , if it had succeeded , would have meant that Wikipedia would have become merely another arm of Israeli propaganda .
The contempt by the Zionist movement for any modicum of freedom of speech and discourse should be no surprise .
In Palestine they shoot people who speak out of turn , in the USA they merely demonise them and burn their books or the net equivalent .

Pro-Israel group 's plan to rewrite history on Wikipedia Report ,
The Electronic Intifada 21 April 2008
A pro-Israel pressure group is orchestrating a secret , Long - term campaign to infiltrate the popular online Encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history , Pass off crude propaganda as fact , and take over Wikipedia Administrative structures to ensure these changes go Either undetected or unchallenged .
A series of emails by members and associates of the Pro-Israel group CAMERA ( Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ) , provided to The Electronic Intifada ( EI ) , indicate the group is engaged in what one Activist termed a " war " on Wikipedia .
A 13 March action alert signed by Gilead Ini , a " Senior Research Analyst " at CAMERA , calls for " volunteers who can Work as ' editors ' to ensure " that Israel - related articles On Wikipedia are " free of bias and error , and include Necessary facts and context . "
However , subsequent Communications indicate that the group not only wanted to Keep the effort secret from the media , the public , and Wikipedia administrators , but that the material they Intended to introduce included discredited claims that Could smear Palestinians and Muslims and conceal Israel 's True history .
With over two million articles in English on every topic Imaginable , Wikipedia has become a primary reference Source for Internet users around the world and a model for Collaboratively produced projects .
Openness and good faith
Are among Wikipedia 's core principles .
Any person in the World can write or edit articles , but Wikipedia has strict Guidelines and procedures for accountability intended to Ensure quality control and prevent vandalism , plagiarism Or distortion .
It is because of these safeguards that Articles on key elements of the Palestine - Israel conflict Have generally remained well - referenced , useful and Objective .
The CAMERA plan detailed in the e-mails Obtained by EI appears intended to circumvent these Controls .
In the past , CAMERA has gained notoriety for its tactic of Accusing virtually anyone who does not toe a right - wing Pro -Israel line of bias .
The group has even accused Editors and reporters of the Israeli daily Haaretz of
Being " extreme " and participating in " radical anti-Israel Activity . "
Jeffrey Dvorkin , the former ombudsman of National Public Radio ( NPR ) , frequently criticized by CAMERA for an alleged pro-Palestinian bias , wrote on the Web publication Salon in February 2008 that " as a Consequence of its campaign against NPR , CAMERA acted as The enabler for some seriously disturbed people , " citing Persistent telephone threats he received in the wake of CAMERA campaigns .
Need for stealth and secrecy
Throughout the documents EI obtained , CAMERA operatives Stress the need for stealth and secrecy .
In his initial Action alert , Ini requests that recipients " not forward it To members of the news media . "
In a 17 March follow - up Email sent to volunteers , Ini explains that he wants to Make the orchestrated effort appear to be the work of Unaffiliated individuals .
Thus he advises that " There is No need to advertise the fact that we have these group Discussions . "
Anticipating possible objections to CAMERA 's scheme , Ini Conjectures that " Anti-Israel editors will seize on Anything to try to discredit people who attempt to Challenge their problematic assertions , and will be all Too happy to pretend , and announce , that a ' Zionist ' cabal ( the same one that controls the banks and Hollywood ? ) is Trying to hijack Wikipedia . "
But stealth and misrepresentation are presented as the Keys to success .
Ini suggests that after volunteers sign Up as editors for Wikipedia they should " avoid editing Israel - related articles for a short period of time . "
This Strategy is intended to " avoid the appearance of being One- topic editors , " thus attracting unwanted attention .
Ini counsels that volunteers " might also want to avoid , For obvious reasons , picking a user name that marks you as Pro -Israel , or that lets people know your real name . "
To Further conceal the identity of CAMERA - organized editors , Ini warns , " do n't forget to always log in before making [ edits ] .
If you make changes while not logged in , Wikipedia will record your computer 's IP address " -- a Number that allows identification of the location of a Computer connected to the Internet .
A veteran Wikipedia editor , known as " Zeq , " who according To the emails is colluding with CAMERA , also provided Advice to CAMERA volunteers on how they could disguise
Their agenda .
In a 20 March email often in misspelled English , Zeq writes , " You do n't want to be precived [ sic ]
As a ' CAMERA ' defender ' on wikipedia [ sic ] that is for Sure . "
One strategy to avoid that is to " edit articles at Random , make friends not enemies -- we will need them Later on .
This is a marathon not a sprint . "
Zeq also identifies , in a 25 March email , another Wikipedia editor , " Jayjg , " whom he views as an effective and independent pro-Israel advocate .
Zeq instructs CAMERA operatives to work with and learn from Jayjg , but not to reveal the existence of their group even to him fearing " it would place him in a bind " since " [ h]e is very loyal to the wikipedia [ sic ] system " and might object to CAMERA 's underhanded tactics .
" Uninvolved administrators "
The emphasis on secrecy is apparently not only to aid the undetected editing of articles , but also to facilitate CAMERA 's takeover of key administrator positions in Wikipedia .
For Zeq a key goal is to have CAMERA operatives elected as administrators -- senior editors who can override the decisions of others when controversies arise .
When disputes arise about hotly contested topics , such as Israel and Palestine , often only an " uninvolved administrator " -- one who is considered neutral because he or she has not edited or written articles on the topic -- can arbitrate .
Hence , Zeq advises in a 21 March email that " One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted [ sic ] articles for one month until they [ sic ] interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia [ sic ] editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator . "
Once these CAMERA operatives have successfully infiltrated as " neutral " editors , they could then exercise their privileges to assert their own political agenda .
In addition , Zeq suggests making deliberately provocative edits to Palestine - related articles .
He hopes that editors he assumes are Palestinian will delete these changes , and then CAMERA operatives could report them to administrators so they could be sanctioned and have their editing privileges suspended .
Passing propaganda as fact
Gilead Ini's 17 March email provides specific advice on how to pass off pro-Israel propaganda or opinion as fact meeting Wikipedia 's strict guidelines :
" So , for example , imagine that you get rid of or modify a problematic sentence in an article alleging that ' Palestinian [ sic ] become suicide bombers to respond to Israel 's oppressive policies . '
You should , in parallel leave a comment on that article 's discussion page ( either after or before making the change ) .
Avoid defending the edit by arguing that ' Israel 's policies are n't ' oppression , ' they are defensive .
And anyway Palestinians obviously become suicide bombers for other reasons for example hate education !'
Instead , describe how this sentence violates Wikipedia 's policies and guidelines .
One of the core principles is that assertions should adhere to a Neutral Point of View , usually abbreviated NPOV .
( The opposite of NPOV is POV , or Point of View , which is basically another way of saying subjective statement , or opinion . )
So it would be best to note on the discussion page that ' This sentence violates Wikipedia 's NPOV policy , since the description of Israel 's policies as ' oppressive ' is an opinion .
In addition , it is often noted by Middle East experts that one of the reasons Palestinians decide to become suicide bombers is hate education and glorification of martyrdom in Palestinian society ... ' "
In fact , there have been numerous studies debunking claims about Palestinian " hate education , " or " glorification of martyrdom " causing suicide bombings ( such as Dying to Win by University of Chicago political scientist Robert Pape ) though this claim remains a favorite canard of pro-Israel activists seeking to distract attention from the effects of Israel 's occupation and other well - documented and systematic human rights abuses in fueling violence .
Zeq specifically names articles targeted for this kind of treatment including those on the 1948 Palestinian Exodus , Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus , Hamas , Hizballah , Arab citizens of Israel , anti-Zionism , al - Nakba , the Palestinian people , and the Palestinian right of return .
Interestingly the CAMERA editors also target the article on the early Islamic period concept of Dhimmi , a protected status for non-Muslims which historically allowed Jews to thrive in Muslim - ruled lands while other Jews were being persecuted in Christian Europe .
Pro-Israel activists have often tried to portray the concept of Dhimmi as akin to the Nuremberg laws in order to denigrate Muslim culture and justify ahistorical Zionist claims that Jews could never live safely in majority Muslim countries .
Also among the emails is a discussion about how to alter the article on the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the village of Deir Yassin by Zionist militiamen on 9 April 1948 .
Unable to debunk the facts of the massacre outright , the CAMERA activists hunt for quotes from " reputable historians " who can cast doubt on it .
Their strategy is not dissimilar from those who attempt to present evolution , or global climate change as " controversial " regardless of the weight of the scientific evidence , simply because the facts do not accord with their belief system .
Zeq has already made extensive edits to the Wikipedia article on Rachel Corrie , the American peace activist murdered by an Israeli soldier in the occupied Gaza Strip on 16 March 2003 .
As a result of these and other edits Zeq has himself been a controversial figure among Wikipedia editors , suggesting his own stealth tactics may not be working .
" We will go to war "
Zeq , however , counsels CAMERA operatives to be patient and lie low until they build up their strength .
" We will go to war after we have build our army , equiped it trained [ sic ] , " he wrote on 9 April .
" So please if you want to win this war help us build ou[r ] army .
let 's not just rush in and achieve nothing , or abit more than nothing [ sic ] . "

CAMERA Seeks 10 Volunteers to Submit Info to Wikipedia

Help us grow our team !
Please forward this alert to people con1mitted to fair and factual reporting about Israel and the Middle East .
Do not forward it to members of the news Inedia .
Please use this alert as background for your own unique e-mails , letters and calls .
Shalom CAMERA E-Mail Team :
What if you could ensure accuracy and fairness directly in one of the Internet 's most visited Web sites , without relying on reporters , editors or publishers ?
In fact , you can .
Wikipedia , the hugely popular online encyclopedia site , can be edited by anyone .
The idea behind Wikipedia is that if thousands of well - meaning and informed volunteers collaborate on an online encyclopedia , the result would be more accurate , up - to - date and inclusive than any print encyclopedia could possibly be .
The bad news is this allows anti-Israel " editors " to introduce all kinds of bias and error into the many Israel - related articles , even the entry on CAMERA .
The good news is , individual volunteers can work as " editors " to ensure that these articles are free of bias and error , and include necessary facts and context .
Assuring accuracy and impartiality in Wikipedia is extremely important .
If someone searches for " Israel " on the Google search engine , for example , the top result returned by Google would be the Wtkjpediapag~emQn Israel .
CAMERA seeks 10 volunteers to help us keep Israel - related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors .
All it takes to be an effective volunteer is a basic comfort level with computers .
Call or email me , and I will train you on how to become a volunteer Wikipedia editor .
With thanks ,

Shalom Wikipedia Editors and CAMERA E - Mail Team ,
Page 1 of3
Thank you all for responding to the latest alert about editing Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia .
We know that your time is valuable , and very much appreciate your willingness to spend some of it in the quest for fairness and accuracy on Wikipedia .
And considering the truly impressive quantity and quality of volunteers , 11 m extremely hopeful that we can and will meet this goal .
Let me begin by addressing a couple of questions that some of you asked .
* First , while our alert noted that we are seeking ten volunteers , what we really meant was that we want at least ten .
I 'm happy to say that we currently have about five times that many !
* Another common question was :
How much time do I need to devote to this project ?
The easy answer is :
As much as you decide to devote .
There is no minimum amount of time required to edit Wikipedia .
Some of you will only be able to participate periodically , and others will be able to weave this into their daily routine .
Whatever amount of time you can spare to learn about and edit Wikipedia will be extremely valuable .
Every little bit helps .
That said , I 'll also point out that improving articlesYYiJJ sometimes require patience and persistence .
Fortunately , patience and persistence between 40 people is a good bit easier than patience and persistence by one person .
Because Wikipedia articles often change , and are never finalized , we do hope that this will be a long term project .
This is a marathon , not a sprint .
* The final common query was : Okay , so what do I do ?
How does Wikipedia editing work ?
A few of you already have experience editing Wikipedia .
For all the others , I 'll address the technical aspect of editing Wikipedia a little bit later .
But first , 11 11 touch on a few broader , non-technical ideas that are based on my experience with Wikipedia , and on the advice passed onto me by some of the more experienced Wiki editors on this list .
Why are we even concerned with Wikipedia ?
Because Wikipedia is extremely popular , influential , and depends on the participation of fair - minded members of the community in order to work well .
What is the problem ?
It 's influential and popular , but it is n't always accurate .
Wikipedia has a series of policies and gUidelines meant to ensure that the encyclopedia develops in a fair , accurate and reasonable manner .
Unfortunately , these gUidelines are often ignored by editors ( even while these same editors loudly and speciously cite these guidelines in order to defend their unfair edits ) .
And as we all know , " controversial " topics like the Arab - Israeli conflict tend to attract an especially large number of partisans hoping to warp the public 's understanding of the Middle East .
This is happening with many Wikipedia articles , ranging from the article about CAMERA , to the article about Nablu5 , to 4/11/2008 various articles about anti-Israel activists , and beyond .
Who are we ?
It 's best to think of ourselves as a collection of individuals and individual Wikipedia editors interested in discussion about Wikipedia .
This encyclopedia is intended to be written and edited by individuals –not by groups -- and that 's what we 'll do .
At the same time , by having discussions within our group , we can learn about , discuss , and figure out how to overcome the challenges we each encounter as Wikipedia editors .
There is no reason to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions .
Anti-Israel editors will seize on anything to try to discredit people who attempt to challenge their problematic assertions , and will be all too happy to pretend , and announce , that a ' Zionist ' cabal ( the same one that controls the banks and Hollywood ? ) is trying to hijack Wikipedia .
The Wikipedia community
We also should keep in mind that we are part of a larger , well - established , Wikipedia community .
And while there are loud and aggressive groups of anti-Israel editors , most of the Wikipedia community is made up of well - meaning people who often do n't know much about the Arab - Israeli conflict .
It is important that these people -- our potential allies -- understand that we , too , are concerned with thoughtfully contributing to , and improving , Wikipedia .
First and foremost , that means having a history of working within the Wikipedia guidelines .
( Note that anyone on Wikipedia can view your editing history . )
These guidelines are explained on the Wikipedia website , but I will also discuss some of them a bit later .
Obviously , it 's also important to remain civil when arguing ideas on the Wikipedia discussion pages –even when people inevitably try to provoke you into an online shouting match .
It 's helpful , if possible , to build relationships .
( Fortunately , we now have in this group a built in network of relationships .
Nonetheless , it 's still helpful to make relationships with established editors , and with super - editors know as ' administrators . ')
It 's important , after making changes on a Wikipedia article page , to explain these edits on Wikipedia 's discussion pages .
( I 'll address the technical details on how exactly to do this later .
For now , let 's stick with conceptual issues . )
It 's very important to avoid framing our arguments in terms of the Mideast conflict , but rather to frame them in terms of Wikipedia 's gUidelines .
So , for example , imagine that you get rid of or modify a problematic sentence in an article alleging that " Palestinian become suicide bombers to respond to Israel 's oppressive policies .
It You should , in parallel , leave a comment on that article 's discussion page ( either after or before making the change ) .
Avoid defending the edit by arguing that " Israel 's policies are n't ' oppression , ' they are defensive .
And anyway Palestinians obviously become suicide bombers for other reasons , for example hate education ! "
Instead , describe how this sentence violates Wikipedia 's policies and gUidelines .
One of the core policies is that assertions should adhere to a Neutral Point of View , usually abbreviated NPOV .
( The opposite of NPOV is POV , or Point of View , which is basically another way of saying subjective statement , or opinion . )
So it would be best to note on the discussion page that " This sentence violates Wikipedia 's NPOV policy , since the description of Israel 's policies as ' oppressive 'is an opinion .
In addition , it is often noted by Middle East experts that one of the reasons Palestinians decide to become suicide bombers is hate education and glorification of martyrdom in Palestinian society .
I will add ( or have added ) a sentence to that effect , and cite it with a footnote pointing to one or more of these experts ' articles .
If ( Or something along those lines . )
A veteran Wikipedia editor on this list has suggested that , after setting up your account , avoid editing Israel - related articles for a short period of time ; or in the very least , try to edit articles unrelated to Israel more than articles related to Israel .
This is n't a bad idea , not only to avoid the appearance of being one - topic editors , but also because it would be easier to practice editing , and to learn about Wikipedia , far from the Mideast hornet 's nest .
You might practice by visiting and editing articles about other topics that interest you .
Editing could mean simply fixing typos and grammar , or it could mean adding ( footnoted ) sentences to these topics .
This way , you can gain experience without having antiIsrael partisans jumping down your throat .
When signing up for a Wikipedia account , you might also want to avoid , for obvious reasons , picking a user name that marks you as pro-Israel , or that lets people know your real name .
Anonymity is an accepted part of Wikipedia .
Also , for the sake of greater anonymity , do n't forget to always log in before making changes .
If you make changes while not logged in , Wikipedia will record your computer 's IP address .
What now ?
Now that we 've considered some thoughts on Wikipedia , we 're almost ready to act !
You will soon get via email an invitation to join a Google Group entitled Isra-pedia .
Itis there that we 'll discuss problematic Wikipedia pages , and how to improve them .
You 'll also find there a copy of this welcome email , a tutorial on how to sign up for and edit Wikipeida ( i.e. those technical details that I avoided discussion in this email ) , and an Action Items page .
Those of you who already have a Wikipedia account and are familiar with the editing process can ignore the tutorial and focus on the action items and the discussion section of our Google Groups page .
I look forward to working with all of you .

1 . I strohgly suggest people will start with non israel related articles .
2 . With all due respect it does not make anay sense to have wikipedia fights in articles about CAMERA .
Think who uses wikipedia and for what ?
the high school student or the person looking for general information about evenst , people , locations , terminlogy ( such as " Right of Return " or II Summer rain operation " ) .
You do n't want to be precived as a " CAMERA defender " on wikipedia that is for sure - since they would think you were sent by CAMERA to " repair " the CAMERA entry .
You also do n't want to apear as only focus and one sided about israel .
So edit articles at random , make friends not enemies - we will need them later on .

I need perhaps to interduce myself .
I have been working in wikipedia alone for nearly 3 years and learned a lot in the process .
All of you will be more succefullif you would apear Neutral as possible .
Look we will not be able to fix everything there and there are real importent articles .
Nothing will harm your creadability more that if your edits will identify you as tied to or " representative of " a specific organization .
I will not get into discussion about how important is the CAMERA article in wikipedia - my view is that CAMERA itself is a very important organization but that the article about in wikipedia is near meanigless ( people do not shape their view of CAMERA by reading about it in wikipedia )
Since people here have strong views and strong ties with CAMERA my advice is : Stay away from this article for at least 6 month - work on other articles , slowly go into Israel realted articles , in these articles present a view that has to do with Accuracy and for keeping Wikipedia policies in order to make the Wikipedia project BETTER .
If you deal with the CAMERA article now you will burn yourself and let them know what you are and your views - which is bad and would prevent you from making friends in wikipedia - friends we will all need in the long run so that one of us ( or more ) will become administrators .
Why it is important
There is in wikipedia the ability by an administrator to set significant limits on other editor .
in 90 % of the cases sanction placed b one administrator are not chalanged at all .
they stick .
In the issue of Israeli - palestine articles there is now additional restrictions that can be placed by an administrator AS LONG AS HE IS AN " uninvolved administrator " .
One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted articles for month until they interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator .
This is not the only reason but just an example why you should take the marthon view and not rush in for a fight about a not so important article ( about a very important orgnization ) rememebr we are not dealing here with convincing the exterme antisemite and anti-israel activists ( those on discussion boards )
We are not dealing with convincing people who share our views either .
We are targeting those who look up a term in google and it sends them to Wikipedia or those who look for general explnation about issues .
Here is a list of articles I consider highly important - but for now stay away from them also and build your relationship with the wikipedia comunity WIKIPEDIA is a comunity - always keep this in mind .
you want to make friends there not enemies .
It is not a discussion board in which you will lIconvince " the other side .

I have spent a fascinating evening reading about Deir Yassin and Uri Millstein .
In the Wikipedia article on Millstein , near the end , it says of Millstein , " In his last book , " Blood Libel at Deir Yassin -- The Black Book , ' he claims that a key incident in the development of Palestinian national consciousness , the massacre at Deir Yassin , was a myth created by the Israeli Left ... " for political purposes .

I 'm looking at History of Israel 's War of Independence , Vol. IV , Translated and Edited by Alan Sacks ( 1998 ) .
The title is a bit different than that cited in the footnote , and perhaps more importantly , the translation is by a different person .
So the page numbers are different .
On page 376 of this version , Milstein does make something very close to the assertion you describe .
Here , he is translated arguing that " it can not be denied , " as opposed to " nobody denies .
N
So the cite is more or less correct .
The next question , then , is whether this assertion is disputed by other reputable historians .
If so , this statement of fact in the lede of the article is extremely problematic .
That is , if there is significant controversy about the truth of this statement , Milstein 's claim can and should be relayed in the article , but not on its own , as an indisputed fact , in the lede .
It would have to be relayed along with opposing points of view .
Unfortunately , this is not something I can get to today .
If anyone else has reliable resources that they can consult before I have a chance to look into it , please do post your findings here .

Jayjg is a fine example how to work in the most due process way .
The other side is not doing this and take advantage of their large numbers .
we should learn from all of them .
We all know about the conspiracy merchants who believe that Israel masterminded 9/11 whilst ensuring that its own citizens were not in the building at the time .
In Britain we have had a not dissimilar version in the death of Princess Diana .
Conspiracy theorists tend to be on the Right , and the far - Right , because it is easier to explain social phenomenon by referring to a hidden conspiracy of a few chosen individuals ( usually with the same ethnic make - up ) than to lay the blame where it is due , namely in the kind of society we live in .
But as Joseph Heller remarked , just because you 're paranoid it does n't mean that people are n't out to get you .
There are of course very real conspiracies e.g. the fitting up of innocent people by the State such as the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti , who were executed in 1927 or the attempted execution of Black journalist Mumia Abu Jamal , framed for killing a cop in Philadelphia in 1981 or indeed the decision to invade Iraq .
One such conspiracy has just been uncovered by the Electronic Intifada .
It involves a particularly nasty group called Camera , dedicated to suppressing all freedom of speech in the USA where Palestine is concerned .
Although they lazily suggest that critics of what they are trying to do will alleged that it is a " ' Zionist ' cabal ( the same one that controls the banks and Hollywood ? ) the evidence is quite clear .
They do n't control any banks but they are trying to control and prevent free discourse and debate over Palestine and in particular to erase from Wikipedia any reference to massacres and expulsion of Palestinians .
All this is to be done , not openly by stating where they are coming from , but by recourse to the Neutral Point of View rules of procedure of Wikipedia .
( ring a few bells ?
well that is what was done by the supporters of Gilad Atzmon on Indymedia not too long ago who used ' procedure ' and ' rules ' rather than arguing their case honestly .
It is clear that this attempted infiltration by Zionist activists of the editors ' group , aided and abetted by an exiting Wiki editor ' Zeq ' , if it had succeeded , would have meant that Wikipedia would have become merely another arm of Israeli propaganda .
The contempt by the Zionist movement for any modicum of freedom of speech and discourse should be no surprise .
In Palestine they shoot people who speak out of turn , in the USA they merely demonise them and burn their books or the net equivalent .
Tony GreensteinPro-Israel group 's plan to rewrite history on Wikipedia Report , The Electronic Intifada 21 April 2008A pro-Israel pressure group is orchestrating a secret , Long - term campaign to infiltrate the popular online Encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history , Pass off crude propaganda as fact , and take over Wikipedia Administrative structures to ensure these changes go Either undetected or unchallenged .
A series of emails by members and associates of the Pro -Israel group CAMERA ( Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ) , provided to The Electronic Intifada ( EI ) , indicate the group is engaged in what one Activist termed a " war " on Wikipedia .
A 13 March action alert signed by Gilead Ini , a " Senior Research Analyst " at CAMERA , calls for " volunteers who can Work as ' editors ' to ensure " that Israel - related articles On Wikipedia are " free of bias and error , and include Necessary facts and context . "
However , subsequent Communications indicate that the group not only wanted to Keep the effort secret from the media , the public , and Wikipedia administrators , but that the material they Intended to introduce included discredited claims that Could smear Palestinians and Muslims and conceal Israel 's True history .
With over two million articles in English on every topic Imaginable , Wikipedia has become a primary reference Source for Internet users around the world and a model for Collaboratively produced projects .
Openness and good faith
Are among Wikipedia 's core principles .
Any person in the World can write or edit articles , but Wikipedia has strict Guidelines and procedures for accountability intended to Ensure quality control and prevent vandalism , plagiarism Or distortion .
It is because of these safeguards that Articles on key elements of the Palestine - Israel conflict Have generally remained well - referenced , useful and Objective .
The CAMERA plan detailed in the e-mails Obtained by EI appears intended to circumvent these Controls .
In the past , CAMERA has gained notoriety for its tactic of Accusing virtually anyone who does not toe a right - wing Pro -Israel line of bias .
The group has even accused Editors and reporters of the Israeli daily Haaretz ofBeing " extreme " and participating in " radical anti-Israel Activity . "
Jeffrey Dvorkin , the former ombudsman of National Public Radio ( NPR ) , frequently criticized by CAMERA for an alleged pro-Palestinian bias , wrote on the Web publication Salon in February 2008 that " as a Consequence of its campaign against NPR , CAMERA acted as The enabler for some seriously disturbed people , " citing Persistent telephone threats he received in the wake of CAMERA campaigns .
Need for stealth and secrecy Throughout the documents EI obtained , CAMERA operatives Stress the need for stealth and secrecy .
In his initial Action alert , Ini requests that recipients " not forward it To members of the news media . "
In a 17 March follow - up Email sent to volunteers , Ini explains that he wants to Make the orchestrated effort appear to be the work of Unaffiliated individuals .
Thus he advises that " There is No need to advertise the fact that we have these group Discussions .
" Anticipating possible objections to CAMERA 's scheme , Ini Conjectures that " Anti-Israel editors will seize on Anything to try to discredit people who attempt to Challenge their problematic assertions , and will be all Too happy to pretend , and announce , that a ' Zionist ' cabal ( the same one that controls the banks and Hollywood ? ) is Trying to hijack Wikipedia .
" But stealth and misrepresentation are presented as the Keys to success .
Ini suggests that after volunteers sign Up as editors for Wikipedia they should " avoid editing Israel - related articles for a short period of time . "
This Strategy is intended to " avoid the appearance of being One- topic editors , " thus attracting unwanted attention .
Ini counsels that volunteers " might also want to avoid , For obvious reasons , picking a user name that marks you as Pro -Israel , or that lets people know your real name . "
To Further conceal the identity of CAMERA - organized editors , Ini warns , " do n't forget to always log in before making [ edits ] .
If you make changes while not logged in , Wikipedia will record your computer 's IP address " -- a Number that allows identification of the location of a Computer connected to the Internet .
A veteran Wikipedia editor , known as " Zeq , " who according To the emails is colluding with CAMERA , also provided Advice to CAMERA volunteers on how they could disguise
Their agenda .
In a 20 March email often in misspelled English , Zeq writes , " You do n't want to be precived [ sic ]
As a ' CAMERA ' defender ' on wikipedia [ sic ] that is for Sure . "
One strategy to avoid that is to " edit articles at Random , make friends not enemies -- we will need them Later on .
This is a marathon not a sprint .
" Zeq also identifies , in a 25 March email , another Wikipedia editor , " Jayjg , " whom he views as an effective and independent pro-Israel advocate .
Zeq instructs CAMERA operatives to work with and learn from Jayjg , but not to reveal the existence of their group even to him fearing " it would place him in a bind " since " [ h]e is very loyal to the wikipedia [ sic ] system " and might object to CAMERA 's underhanded tactics .
" Uninvolved administrators " The emphasis on secrecy is apparently not only to aid the undetected editing of articles , but also to facilitate CAMERA 's takeover of key administrator positions in Wikipedia .
For Zeq a key goal is to have CAMERA operatives elected as administrators -- senior editors who can override the decisions of others when controversies arise .
When disputes arise about hotly contested topics , such as Israel and Palestine , often only an " uninvolved administrator " -- one who is considered neutral because he or she has not edited or written articles on the topic -- can arbitrate .
Hence , Zeq advises in a 21 March email that " One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted [ sic ] articles for one month until they [ sic ] interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia [ sic ] editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator .
"
Once these CAMERA operatives have successfully infiltrated as " neutral " editors , they could then exercise their privileges to assert their own political agenda .
In addition , Zeq suggests making deliberately provocative edits to Palestine - related articles .
He hopes that editors he assumes are Palestinian will delete these changes , and then CAMERA operatives could report them to administrators so they could be sanctioned and have their editing privileges suspended .
Passing propaganda as factGilead Ini's 17 March email provides specific advice on how to pass off pro-Israel propaganda or opinion as fact meeting Wikipedia 's strict guidelines :
" So , for example , imagine that you get rid of or modify a problematic sentence in an article alleging that ' Palestinian [ sic ] become suicide bombers to respond to Israel 's oppressive policies . '
You should , in parallel leave a comment on that article 's discussion page ( either after or before making the change ) .
Avoid defending the edit by arguing that ' Israel 's policies are n't ' oppression , ' they are defensive .
And anyway Palestinians obviously become suicide bombers for other reasons for example hate education !'
Instead , describe how this sentence violates Wikipedia 's policies and guidelines .
One of the core principles is that assertions should adhere to a Neutral Point of View , usually abbreviated NPOV .
( The opposite of NPOV is POV , or Point of View , which is basically another way of saying subjective statement , or opinion . )
So it would be best to note on the discussion page that ' This sentence violates Wikipedia 's NPOV policy , since the description of Israel 's policies as ' oppressive ' is an opinion .
In addition , it is often noted by Middle East experts that one of the reasons Palestinians decide to become suicide bombers is hate education and glorification of martyrdom in Palestinian society ... '" In fact , there have been numerous studies debunking claims about Palestinian " hate education , " or " glorification of martyrdom " causing suicide bombings ( such as Dying to Win by University of Chicago political scientist Robert Pape ) though this claim remains a favorite canard of pro-Israel activists seeking to distract attention from the effects of Israel 's occupation and other well - documented and systematic human rights abuses in fueling violence .
Zeq specifically names articles targeted for this kind of treatment including those on the 1948 Palestinian Exodus , Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus , Hamas , Hizballah , Arab citizens of Israel , anti-Zionism , al - Nakba , the Palestinian people , and the Palestinian right of return .
Interestingly the CAMERA editors also target the article on the early Islamic period concept of Dhimmi , a protected status for non-Muslims which historically allowed Jews to thrive in Muslim - ruled lands while other Jews were being persecuted in Christian Europe .
Pro-Israel activists have often tried to portray the concept of Dhimmi as akin to the Nuremberg laws in order to denigrate Muslim culture and justify ahistorical Zionist claims that Jews could never live safely in majority Muslim countries .
Also among the emails is a discussion about how to alter the article on the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the village of Deir Yassin by Zionist militiamen on 9 April 1948 .
Unable to debunk the facts of the massacre outright , the CAMERA activists hunt for quotes from " reputable historians " who can cast doubt on it .
Their strategy is not dissimilar from those who attempt to present evolution , or global climate change as " controversial " regardless of the weight of the scientific evidence , simply because the facts do not accord with their belief system .
Zeq has already made extensive edits to the Wikipedia article on Rachel Corrie , the American peace activist murdered by an Israeli soldier in the occupied Gaza Strip on 16 March 2003 .
As a result of these and other edits Zeq has himself been a controversial figure among Wikipedia editors , suggesting his own stealth tactics may not be working .
" We will go to war " Zeq , however , counsels CAMERA operatives to be patient and lie low until they build up their strength .
" We will go to war after we have build our army , equiped it trained [ sic ] , " he wrote on 9 April .
" So please if you want to win this war help us build ou[r ] army .
let 's not just rush in and achieve nothing , or abit more than nothing [ sic ] .

Help us grow our team !
Please forward this alert to people con1mitted to fair and factual reporting about Israel and the Middle East .
Do not forward it to members of the news Inedia .
Please use this alert as background for your own unique e-mails , letters and calls .
Shalom CAMERA E-Mail Team : What if you could ensure accuracy and fairness directly in one of the Internet 's most visited Web sites , without relying on reporters , editors or publishers ?
In fact , you can .
Wikipedia , the hugely popular online encyclopedia site , can be edited by anyone .
The idea behind Wikipedia is that if thousands of well - meaning and informed volunteers collaborate on an online encyclopedia , the result would be more accurate , up - to - date and inclusive than any print encyclopedia could possibly be .
The bad news is this allows anti-Israel " editors " to introduce all kinds of bias and error into the many Israel - related articles , even the entry on CAMERA .
The good news is , individual volunteers can work as " editors " to ensure that these articles are free of bias and error , and include necessary facts and context .
Assuring accuracy and impartiality in Wikipedia is extremely important .
If someone searches for " Israel " on the Google search engine , for example , the top result returned by Google would be the Wtkjpediapag~emQn Israel .
CAMERA seeks 10 volunteers to help us keep Israel - related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors .
All it takes to be an effective volunteer is a basic comfort level with computers .
Call or email me , and I will train you on how to become a volunteer Wikipedia editor .

To : Gilead Ini ( Shalom Wikipedia Editors and CAMERA E - Mail Team , Page 1 of3 Thank you all for responding to the latest alert about editing Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia .
We know that your time is valuable , and very much appreciate your willingness to spend some of it in the quest for fairness and accuracy on Wikipedia .
And considering the truly impressive quantity and quality of volunteers , 11 m extremely hopeful that we can and will meet this goal .
Let me begin by addressing a couple of questions that some of you asked . *
First , while our alert noted that we are seeking ten volunteers , what we really meant was that we want at least ten .
I 'm happy to say that we currently have about five times that many !*
Another common question was :
How much time do I need to devote to this project ?
The easy answer is :
As much as you decide to devote .
There is no minimum amount of time required to edit Wikipedia .
Some of you will only be able to participate periodically , and others will be able to weave this into their daily routine .
Whatever amount of time you can spare to learn about and edit Wikipedia will be extremely valuable .
Every little bit helps .
That said , I 'll also point out that improving articlesYYiJJ sometimes require patience and persistence .
Fortunately , patience and persistence between 40 people is a good bit easier than patience and persistence by one person .
Because Wikipedia articles often change , and are never finalized , we do hope that this will be a long term project .
This is a marathon , not a sprint . *
The final common query was : Okay , so what do I do ?
How does Wikipedia editing work ?
A few of you already have experience editing Wikipedia .
For all the others , I 'll address the technical aspect of editing Wikipedia a little bit later .
But first , 11 11 touch on a few broader , non-technical ideas that are based on my experience with Wikipedia , and on the advice passed onto me by some of the more experienced Wiki editors on this list .
Why are we even concerned with Wikipedia ?
Because Wikipedia is extremely popular , influential , and depends on the participation of fair - minded members of the community in order to work well .
What is the problem ?
It 's influential and popular , but it is n't always accurate .
Wikipedia has a series of policies and gUidelines meant to ensure that the encyclopedia develops in a fair , accurate and reasonable manner .
Unfortunately , these gUidelines are often ignored by editors ( even while these same editors loudly and speciously cite these guidelines in order to defend their unfair edits ) .
And as we all know , " controversial " topics like the Arab - Israeli conflict tend to attract an especially large number of partisans hoping to warp the public 's understanding of the Middle East .
This is happening with many Wikipedia articles , ranging from the article about CAMERA , to the article about Nablu5 , to 4/11/2008 various articles about anti-Israel activists , and beyond .
Who are we ?
It 's best to think of ourselves as a collection of individuals and individual Wikipedia editors interested in discussion about Wikipedia .
This encyclopedia is intended to be written and edited by individuals –not by groups -- and that 's what we 'll do .
At the same time , by having discussions within our group , we can learn about , discuss , and figure out how to overcome the challenges we each encounter as Wikipedia editors .
There is no reason to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions .
Anti-Israel editors will seize on anything to try to discredit people who attempt to challenge their problematic assertions , and will be all too happy to pretend , and announce , that a ' Zionist ' cabal ( the same one that controls the banks and Hollywood ? ) is trying to hijack Wikipedia .
The Wikipedia communityWe also should keep in mind that we are part of a larger , well - established , Wikipedia community .
And while there are loud and aggressive groups of anti-Israel editors , most of the Wikipedia community is made up of well - meaning people who often do n't know much about the Arab - Israeli conflict .
It is important that these people -- our potential allies -- understand that we , too , are concerned with thoughtfully contributing to , and improving , Wikipedia .
First and foremost , that means having a history of working within the Wikipedia guidelines .
( Note that anyone on Wikipedia can view your editing history . )
These guidelines are explained on the Wikipedia website , but I will also discuss some of them a bit later .
Obviously , it 's also important to remain civil when arguing ideas on the Wikipedia discussion pages –even when people inevitably try to provoke you into an online shouting match .
It 's helpful , if possible , to build relationships .
( Fortunately , we now have in this group a built in network of relationships .
Nonetheless , it 's still helpful to make relationships with established editors , and with super - editors know as ' administrators . ')
It 's important , after making changes on a Wikipedia article page , to explain these edits on Wikipedia 's discussion pages .
( I 'll address the technical details on how exactly to do this later .
For now , let 's stick with conceptual issues . )
It 's very important to avoid framing our arguments in terms of the Mideast conflict , but rather to frame them in terms of Wikipedia 's gUidelines .
So , for example , imagine that you get rid of or modify a problematic sentence in an article alleging that " Palestinian become suicide bombers to respond to Israel 's oppressive policies .
It You should , in parallel , leave a comment on that article 's discussion page ( either after or before making the change ) .
Avoid defending the edit by arguing that " Israel 's policies are n't ' oppression , ' they are defensive .
And anyway Palestinians obviously become suicide bombers for other reasons , for example hate education ! "
Instead , describe how this sentence violates Wikipedia 's policies and gUidelines .
One of the core policies is that assertions should adhere to a Neutral Point of View , usually abbreviated NPOV .
( The opposite of NPOV is POV , or Point of View , which is basically another way of saying subjective statement , or opinion . )
So it would be best to note on the discussion page that " This sentence violates Wikipedia 's NPOV policy , since the description of Israel 's policies as ' oppressive 'is an opinion .
In addition , it is often noted by Middle East experts that one of the reasons Palestinians decide to become suicide bombers is hate education and glorification of martyrdom in Palestinian society .
I will add ( or have added ) a sentence to that effect , and cite it with a footnote pointing to one or more of these experts ' articles .
If ( Or something along those lines . ) A veteran Wikipedia editor on this list has suggested that , after setting up your account , avoid editing Israel - related articles for a short period of time ; or in the very least , try to edit articles unrelated to Israel more than articles related to Israel .
This is n't a bad idea , not only to avoid the appearance of being one - topic editors , but also because it would be easier to practice editing , and to learn about Wikipedia , far from the Mideast hornet 's nest .
You might practice by visiting and editing articles about other topics that interest you .
Editing could mean simply fixing typos and grammar , or it could mean adding ( footnoted ) sentences to these topics .
This way , you can gain experience without having antiIsrael partisans jumping down your throat .
When signing up for a Wikipedia account , you might also want to avoid , for obvious reasons , picking a user name that marks you as pro-Israel , or that lets people know your real name .
Anonymity is an accepted part of Wikipedia .
Also , for the sake of greater anonymity , do n't forget to always log in before making changes .
If you make changes while not logged in , Wikipedia will record your computer 's IP address .
What now ?
Now that we 've considered some thoughts on Wikipedia , we 're almost ready to act !
You will soon get via email an invitation to join a Google Group entitled Isra-pedia .
Itis there that we 'll discuss problematic Wikipedia pages , and how to improve them .
You 'll also find there a copy of this welcome email , a tutorial on how to sign up for and edit Wikipeida ( i.e. those technical details that I avoided discussion in this email ) , and an Action Items page .

I have been working in wikipedia alone for nearly 3 years and learned a lot in the process .
All of you will be more succefullif you would apear Neutral as possible .
Look we will not be able to fix everything there and there are real importent articles .
Nothing will harm your creadability more that if your edits will identify you as tied to or " representative of " a specific organization .
I will not get into discussion about how important is the CAMERA article in wikipedia - my view is that CAMERA itself is a very important organization but that the article about in wikipedia is near meanigless ( people do not shape their view of CAMERA by reading about it in wikipedia )
Since people here have strong views and strong ties with CAMERA my advice is : Stay away from this article for at least 6 month - work on other articles , slowly go into Israel realted articles , in these articles present a view that has to do with Accuracy and for keeping Wikipedia policies in order to make the Wikipedia project BETTER .
If you deal with the CAMERA article now you will burn yourself and let them know what you are and your views - which is bad and would prevent you from making friends in wikipedia - friends we will all need in the long run so that one of us ( or more ) will become administrators .
Why it is important
There is in wikipedia the ability by an administrator to set significant limits on other editor .
in 90 % of the cases sanction placed b one administrator are not chalanged at all .
they stick .
In the issue of Israeli - palestine articles there is now additional restrictions that can be placed by an administrator AS LONG AS HE IS AN " uninvolved administrator " .
One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted articles for month until they interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator .
This is not the only reason but just an example why you should take the marthon view and not rush in for a fight about a not so important article ( about a very important orgnization ) rememebr we are not dealing here with convincing the exterme antisemite and anti-israel activists ( those on discussion boards )

[ Isra - pedia ] Re : Wikipedia article : Deir YassinFrom : Niki Nymark ( Sent : Fri 4/11/08 12:20 AM
To : I have spent a fascinating evening reading about Deir Yassin and Uri Millstein .
In the Wikipedia article on Millstein , near the end , it says of Millstein , " In his last book , " Blood Libel at Deir Yassin -- The Black Book , ' he claims that a key incident in the development of Palestinian national consciousness , the massacre at Deir Yassin , was a myth created by the Israeli Left ... " for political purposes .
NikiGilead wrote : This thread is a continuation of the discussion started in the " Use each other as a resource " thread .
Someone there wrote the following .
My reply follows :
For example wiki says about Deir Yassin : " The Deir Yassin massacre took place on April 9 , 1948 when between 107 and 120 [ 1J Palestinian Arabs , predominantly old men , women and children [ 2J living in the village of Deir Yassin ( transliterated Hebrew : Dirat HaYasmin ) near Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine were murdered by Jewish Irgun - Lehi force . " note [ 2J is given : 1 ) the reference -- further below -- and the footnote do n't quite seem to jive in relation to the Lib Cong report2 )
I have reason to believe that the quote is in fact wrong or doctored .
Another writer ( Francisco Gil - White : http://www.hirhome.com/israel/deir-yassin.htm ) claims that Milstein does not hold that Deir Yassin was a massacre .
So maybe we could put a query out when necessary , and if someone has the book article they will check it out for us ?
Anyone have a copy of Uri Milstein 's War of Independence Vol IV p 273 -- to check if that quote is indeed accurate or if it is taken out of context ?
Otherwise I have to go through interlibrary loan -- which takes forever .4/11/2008 Reply : I'm looking at History of Israel 's War of Independence , Vol. IV , Translated and Edited by Alan Sacks ( 1998 ) .
The title is a bit different than that cited in the footnote , and perhaps more importantly , the translation is by a different person .
So the page numbers are different .
On page 376 of this version , Milstein does make something very close to the assertion you describe .
Here , he is translated arguing that " it can not be denied , " as opposed to " nobody denies .
NSo the cite is more or less correct .
The next question , then , is whether this assertion is disputed by other reputable historians .
If so , this statement of fact in the lede of the article is extremely problematic .
That is , if there is significant controversy about the truth of this statement , Milstein 's claim can and should be relayed in the article , but not on its own , as an indisputed fact , in the lede .
It would have to be relayed along with opposing points of view .
Unfortunately , this is not something I can get to today .
If anyone else has reliable resources that they can consult before I have a chance to look into it , please do post your findings here .

With P2P file - swapping still proceeding almost unchecked and CD sales swirling down the toilet , music labels have shown an increased willingness to consider new business models over the last couple of years , even going so far as to drop their once - ubiquitous DRM .
One intriguing idea that has been bandied about is levies : pay your ISP , say , five bucks a month , and you can legally listen to all the music you can find .
Though such an arrangement raises plenty of questions ( should the levy be compulsory , or can people opt out of it ? ) , stakeholders across North America are at least open to the idea .
Two pieces out this week illustrate that fact quite nicely .
Wired has a piece up today on Jim Griffin , a proponent of the $ 5 ISP model , who will appear on a panel tomorrow at SXSW in Austin to continue flogging his idea in public .
P2P would suddenly become legal ( for those who paid , anyway ) , with the cash doled out to labels and artists based on the number of times each artists ' work was traded each month .
Such a system sounds wide open to gaming , of course , but if that problem could be solved , the music industry at least has a good chance at converting millions of file - swappers into paying customers .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist , who has covered such issues for years , notes that other levy plans are also gaining traction in Canada .
We 've already covered the proposal from the Songwriters Association of Canada that would also bring a $ 5 fee to Internet connections in return for the right to use P2P services to get music .
Download services like iTunes could still charge whatever they like .
Barenaked Ladies frontman Steven Page told
Ars last year that he supported such a plan .
" Not everyone 's an artist , " Page said , " but people can now express themselves like artists do , by sharing something that means something to them .
If we had a system of compulsory licenses , they do n't have to worry about going and getting a license to do it , or circumventing the system . "
Nokia has launched its own Comes With Music initiative , where selected products will feature unlimited access to the Universal music catalog ( though for a limited amount of time ) , with the cost of the service built into the price of the device .
France 's Vivendi has also launched ZaOza , a service that provides unlimited downloads of music , video clips , and games for a $ 7 monthly fee .
Subscription services like Napster and Rhapsody continue to offer all - you - can music plans , though the tracks from each service come with DRM and have n't worked with the iPod .
Not everyone likes the compulsory license model ( the head of the US Copyright Office told Ars last year , " I hope we do n't go to a system of compulsory licenses .
I do n't see how any creator benefits from a compulsory license . " ) but the music business does appear increasingly open to offering all - you - can - eat music , as opposed to its decades - long practice of attempting to move individual albums .
That access could turn out to be free , as well , at least for users who do n't need to carry music with them .
Last.fm and iMeem are currently offered ad - supported streaming of music , while P2P service Qtrax claims to have a legal , ad - supported P2P service in the works ( once it can get its licenses in place ) .
For those who want to pay a couple bucks a month in return for owning unrestricted copies of their music , well , that day may come , but it wo n't come without contention .
When Ars Editor in Chief Ken Fisher moderated a panel at this year 's CES , several of the panelists agreed that compulsory music licensing might happen ... but they could n't agree how to split up the revenue pie .
In a compulsory licensing arrangement , that decision is removed from market control and becomes a political issue , so expect to see even more lobbying in DC should such solutions come to pass .
And of course , if $ 5 on your ISP bill gets you access to music , can the day be far off when another fee appears for movies ?
For e-books ?
For cross - stitch patterns ?
So long as these plans are voluntary for consumers , they could be a great option for many people .
If they become mandatory , though , we could easily see a race for the trough as content owners scramble to grab a government - backed revenue stream .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden threatened the European Union with grave punishment on Wednesday for publication of cartoons mocking Islam ’s Prophet Mohammad .
In an audio recording posted on the Internet coinciding with the birthday of Islam ’s founder , bin Laden said the drawings , considered offensive by Muslims , were part of a “ new crusade ” in which Pope Benedict was involved .
“ Your publications of these drawings -- part of a new crusade in which the Pope of the Vatican had a significant role -- is a confirmation from you that the war continues , ” said the Saudi - born militant leader , addressing “ those who are wise at the European Union ” .
You are “ testing Muslims ... the answer will be what you shall see and not what you hear . ”
It was bin Laden ’s first message since November 29 when he urged Europe to end participation with U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
The message , produced by al Qaeda media arm As - Sahab in the lunar month which ended on March 8 , carried an animation of a spear piercing through a red map of Europe with blood splashing as its tip penetrated the surface .
It also carried what appeared to be an old picture of bin Laden firing an assault rifle .
The message also coincides with the fifth anniversary of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
Michael Scheuer , a former CIA bin Laden tracker , said : “ It ’s not a coincidence that it was released on the day that is observed in the Muslim world as the Prophet ’s birthday . ”
He added : “ It ’s only ominous when he says ‘ do n’t listen to our words , watch for our actions ’ ... that means they clearly are intending to attack in Europe . ”
THREAT AGAINST EUROPE
The U.S. - based IntelCenter , a terrorism monitoring firm , said the message was “ a clear threat against EU member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . ”
Bin Laden said the publication of the cartoons was a graver offence than the “ bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women children ” , in reference to U.S. - led invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan with European participation .
“ This is the bigger catastrophe ... for which the punishment is graver . ”
“ Animosity among people is very old but wise people ... have always been keen on maintaining the manners of disagreement and the ethics of fighting ... but you have abandoned many of these ethics although you use them as slogans , ” he said .
Bin Laden said Europe was intentionally targeting Muslim women and children at the behest of their “ unjust ally who is close to departing the White house ” .
He said “ brutality ” had not defeated Muslims and made them determined to “ avenge our folk and eject the invaders from out countries . ”
A U.S. counterterrorism official said the authenticity of the recording was under examination but added it was in line with “ al Qaeda ’s ongoing propaganda effort . ”
The cartoons were first published by the Danish daily Jyllands - Posten in September 2005 but a furor erupted only after other newspapers reprinted them in 2006 .

CARTOONS
On February 13 several Danish newspapers published one of the cartoons in solidarity with the cartoonist after three men were arrested on suspicion of plans to kill him .
One of the cartoons shows a man described as Islam ’s prophet wearing a turban with a bomb in its folds .
At least 50 people were killed in the protests against the cartoons , which Muslims say are an affront to Islam .
Newspapers which printed them say they are defending media freedom .
Sajjan Gohel of the Asia - Pacific Foundation , a London - based security think - tank , said the message did not necessarily signal an imminent attack in Europe but was a “ statement of intent ” .
“ A bin Laden message does n’t necessitate countries in Europe increasing their threat levels .
The reason why they would do that is based on actual intelligence , ” he said .
“ But when Osama bin Laden talks , people listen -- his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action ...
Europe has become the battleground for al Qaeda . ”
European countries singled out by al Qaeda in the past include Britain , Spain , Italy and Denmark .
The new message is likely to cause particular concern to Denmark .
Bin Laden ’s attempt to stoke Christian - Muslim tensions , by evoking the crusades , also comes as the Netherlands braces for the expected release on March 28 of a film about Islam by a right - wing politician who has called the Koran a “ fascist ” book .
Tensions over the film prompted the Dutch to raise their terrorism threat level earlier this month .
Bin Laden , the man behind the September 11 attacks on U.S. cities , issued several messages late in 2007 after a hiatus of well over a year raised speculation that he might be dead .
Bin Laden , believed to be in remote areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan , often marks significant events with messages .
On September 7 bin Laden appeared in a video marking the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and said the United States remained vulnerable despite its economic and military power .
If you were a kid at any time during the 80s and 90s and had cable television , chances are that you 're pretty familiar with Clarissa Darling and the Bar None Dude Ranch .
Although a shocking ( … or not ) number of these child actors seemed to call it quits on their television careers not long after their stint on Nickelodeon , some of them went on to bigger and better things .
Like what ?
You know you 're dying to know .
Salute Your Shorts
photo from sydlexia.com
Salute Your Shorts was about kids at a summer camp called Camp Anawanna .
It 's relatively obscure , considering it only aired two seasons .
But some surprising talent participated in those two seasons , including Blake Sennett ( then going by Blake Soper ) who is now better known for being the lead guitarist in Rilo Kiley ( and possibly dating Winona Ryder ) .
Coincidentally ( or not ) the Rilo Kiley 's lead singer is Jenny Lewis , who was also a former child star .
There 's a hidden song on the Rilo Kiley album " Take Offs and Landings " called " Salute My Shorts " in reference to Blake 's brief stint as Ronnie Pinsky .
Also notable is Christine Cavanaugh ( Mona the Mail Lady ) , who later became the voice of Chuckie Finster on Rugrats , Babe the pig and Dexter of Dexter 's Laboratory .
This is pretty much the only fan page I could find for Salute Your Shorts and I 'm proud to say it 's from Iowa State University .
Maybe we 're the only weirdos who liked this show .
Are You Afraid of the Dark
photo from fewl.net
This was the era of R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike , so I was of course a huge fan of Are You Afraid of the Dark .
It was the highlight of my SNICK ( Saturday Night Nickelodeon , of course ) lineup .
I was particularly haunted by the clown doll in the opening credits .
Anyway , Dark was about a group of kids ( The Midnight Society ) who ( presumably ) snuck out of their houses late at night to meet around a campfire and tell spooky stories .
The episode always began with the storyteller saying , " Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society , I call this story – " , followed by the title of the story and a dramatic flourish of powder which caused the fire to flare up .
I 'm sad to report that most of the 15 kids involved in the show over its seven - year run do n't seem to be doing much now , with a few exceptions :
Elisha Cuthbert is arguably the best - known of the Midnight Society .
Who knew that innocent young Megan would end up starring in House of Wax with Paris Hilton ?
I kid , I kid .
Elisha is notable for her role as Kim Bauer on 24 , which she says she will be reprising in the movie version .
Rachel Blanchard ( Kristen ) played Cher on the T.V. version of Clueless and you 've also seen her in Snakes on a Plane , Without a Paddle , 7th Heaven and Road Trip .
Rivaling her somewhat celebrity status is …
… Joanna Garcia .
She used her role as Samantha on AYAOTD to propel her to bigger and better things , such as Vicki on the much - mourned cult hit Freaks and Geeks and air - headed Cheyenne on the CW 's Reba .
Clarissa Explains
It All
photo from www.thur.de
Before Melissa Joan Hart was Sabrina Spellman , she was Clarissa Darling .
She battled horrors like her brother Ferguson ( Ferg - wad ) , zits and surviving before getting her driver 's license .
It was an interesting show because it broke the barrier between viewer and character by having Clarissa address the viewer Ferris Bueller - style .
I have to admit I was mildly in love with Clarissa 's best friend Sam , but unfortunately it does n't look like he 's done much acting since .
It might surprise you to know that Elizabeth Hess , who played Clarissa 's mom , is now teaching acting at NYU 's Tisch School of the Arts .
At least , I was surprised .
Irritating genius Ferg - wad ended up going to Notre Dame in real life .
Hey Dude
photo from Amazon.com
As far as I can tell , Hey Dude was Christine Taylor 's big start .
It was the story of a city slicker , who , sick of stressful life in New York , bought a dude ranch in Arizona .
He was n't quite as talented at running a ranch as crunching numbers , though , so we are constantly entertained by his bumbling ways and how his teenage staff is constantly coming to his rescue .
The series was filmed on location at Tanque Verde Guest Ranch near Tucson and apparently some of it is still standing ( although in bad shape ) .
We all know Christine Taylor was Marcia , Marcia , Marcia , and married Ben Stiller , but what about the rest of them ?
Well , Jonathan Galkin , who played Mr. Ernst 's nephew , Jake , is the co-founder of DFA Records .
DFA has produced and remixed artists such as Nine Inch Nails , Gorillaz , The Chemical Brothers and Le Tigre .
Who know cousin Jake would turn out to be so cool ??
So , tell me – am I the only one who watched these shows ?
Did I miss one of your favorites ?
Do tell .
Here we go again .
Another idiot is taking on net neutrality .
Too bad he does n't even know what it is .
It looks as if we 're about to go another round with yet another idiot taking on net neutrality .
Much of the debate will be triggered by an antinet neutrality screed by Andy Kessler that 's running as an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal .
This piece highlights the illogicality of the antinet neutrality folks , with crackpot assertions and general apologies for the state of affairs in the U.S .
Let 's first look at one of the fabulous arguments by Kessler ( and I suppose parroted by others on this bandwagon ) : " With net neutrality , there will be no new competition and no incentives for build - outs .
Bandwidth speeds will stagnate , and new services will wither from bandwidth starvation . "
This is funny , since until just a while ago , we had been operating under a de facto net neutrality .
Using Kessler 's logic , we should still be using 300 - baud modems since there 's no incentive to do anything different .
How does heor anyone else , for that matter explain the progress from 300 - baud modems to fiber to the home during this period of genuine net neutrality ?
It 's only recently that the phone and cable companies have decided to futz with bandwidth , with packet sniffing , bandwidth shaping , and ceiling limitations .
It took them this long to figure out how to do this sort of skimping and cheating of the customer .
Someone took notice and said there should be a law to " maintain " net neutrality .
Net neutrality is nothing new .
It 's the way it has always been .
How does codifying it into a law change anything , except to foil the scheming of the phone and cable companies that have -- during the era of net neutrality and genuine deregulation -- competed very well .
They 've competed so well , in fact , that they bought up most of the connectivity .
Now they have exactly what they need in order to cheat the customer because , after all , this is what monopolies do .
Lock out the competition .
That 's the idea .
That will make for progress .
Kessler 's crazy logic seems to smash into itself with its loony diatribe .
He says that Comcast needs the leeway to jack down the bandwidth to protect its cable TV business .
After all , we can't have movies delivered off the Net , can we ?
But wait , how does that encourage progress ?
Hey , Andy , how does this attitude foster the " innovation " you 're so concerned about ?
You can't have it both ways .
When you boil it all down , net neutrality is kind of wimpy .
We should have out - and - out government regulation .
Personally , I 'm sick of these deregulation absolutists who throw out specious arguments that do not make any sense .
For example , Kessler says , " The Internet will only expand based on competitive principles , not socialist diktat . "
I love the way these guys throw in the ugly term " socialist " when they want to trigger a 1950 's - style knee - jerk reaction from the American public .
And in case you did n't notice , he also throws in a Communist term " diktat " so you dummies will be totally repulsed and imagine Stalin lurking . 
Screw that cheap and tawdry writing trick .
Let 's look at the logic .
We have no socialist diktat going on , and we are falling behind other countries like crazy in broadband speeds and connectivity .
Countries that mandated universal high - speed connectivity ( aka socialist diktat ) have all zoomed ahead of us .
We are in 16th or 17th place and falling fast .
This tells me that we are doing something wrong .
We 're kowtowing to the wishes of the big telcos mega corporations that have no real interest in progress , just profits .
I can hear folks saying , " Let 's do what they say ; they know what 's best for us . "
These are the bean counters who have done a cost analysis on " slamming " to determine whether the fines for this illegal practice are greater than the profits .
They 're not interested in the customer and have to be watched like a hawk .
Or has n't anyone noticed ?
General telco policies and roughshod practices alone make me question these people 's take on net neutrality .
Without knowing anything about them , I have to assume that what they want is always going to be bad for the customer and bad for the nation .
There is no evidence to the contrary .
If there is , show me .
Thus , I 'm suspicious of op - eds talking up the horrors of net neutrality , especially when the facts are never made clear .
Instead , we have an out - and - out attempt to befuddle the public and confuse the reader .
Kessler tells us in one paragraph that we have " an overabundance of bandwidth pulsing throughout the U.S. "
Two paragraphs later he tells us how Comcast has to do its trickery to preserve its " precious bandwidth . "
Well , which is itoverabundance or shortage ?
What ?
Cripes .
Net neutrality does not keep the ISPs from selling me a 10 - megabit - per - second connection at a higher price than a 1 - Mbps connection .
It does not kill competition .
What it does is allow me to get what I want at the speed that I paid for rather than have some socialists née corporate apparatchiks ( I can pull the socialist stunt , too ) back at the Kremlin / HQ deciding that I will get a Google feed at half the speed of a Microsoft Live feed when I do a search .
In fact , maybe they 'll cut the Google feed altogether .
They can do the same to Ford Motor Co. or anyone on the Net .
That 's where this is headed .
Exactly how this sort of screw job fosters innovation and competition is certainly not explained by Kessler or others of his ilk .
We 're looking for a law saying they cannot pull this stunt .
How is this a bad thing ?
Kessler and the other naysayers cloaked in the grim black robes of free market absolutism should all be ashamed of themselves for these bogus presentations .
How Memories are Distorted and Invented : Misattribution
“ Most people , probably , are in doubt about certain matters ascribed to their past .
They may have seen them , may have said them , done them , or they may only have dreamed or imagined they did so . ”
– William James
One evening in 1975 an unsuspecting Australian psychologist , Donald M. Thomson , walked into a television studio to discuss the psychology of eyewitness testimony .
Little did he know that at the very moment he was discussing how people can best remember the faces of criminals , there was someone encoding his own face as a rapist .
The day after the television broadcast Thomson was picked up by local police .
He was told that last night a woman was raped and left unconscious in her apartment .
She had named Thomson as her attacker .
Thomson was shocked , but had a watertight alibi .
He had been on television at the time of the attack and in the presence of the assistant commissioner of police .
It seemed that the victim had been watching Thomson on television just prior to being attacked .
She had then confused his face with that of her attacker .
That a psychologist talking about identifying the faces of criminals should be the subject of just such a gross memory failure – and at the very moment he was publicly explaining it – is an irony hard to ignore .
Donald Thompson was completely exonerated but many others have not been so lucky .
Gary Wells at Iowa State University and colleagues have identified 40 different US miscarriages of justice that have relied on eye - witness testimony ( Wells et al. , 1998 ) .
Many of these falsely convicted people served many years in prison , some even facing death sentences .
Donald Thomson ’s ordeal , though , is a perfect example of Harvard psychologist Daniel L. Schacter ’s fourth sin of memory ( Schacter , 1999 ) .
Unlike the first three sins , which all involve being unable to access memories , this is the first sin that involves the creation of memories that are false in some way .
When a memory is ‘ misattributed ’ some original true aspect of a memory becomes distorted through time , space or circumstances .
Daily misattributions
While misattributions can have disastrous consequences , most are not so dramatic in everyday circumstances .
Like the other sins of memory , misattributions are probably a daily occurrence for most people .
Some examples that have been studied in the lab are :
Misattributing the source of memories .
People regularly say they read something in the newspaper , when actually a friend told them or they saw it in an advert .
In one study participants with ‘ normal ’ memories regularly made the mistake of thinking they had acquired a trivial fact from a newspaper , when actually the experimenters had supplied it ( Schacter , Harbluk , & McLachlan , 1984 ) .

Misattributing a face to the wrong context .
This is exactly what happened to Donald Thomson .
Studies have shown that memories can become blended together , so that faces and circumstances are merged .
.

Studies have shown that memories can become blended together , so that faces and circumstances are merged .
Misattributing an imagined event to reality .
A neat experiment by Goff and Roediger ( 1998 ) demonstrates how easily our memory can transform fantasy into reality .
Participants were asked either to imagine performing an action or actually asked to perform it , e.g. breaking a toothpick .
Sometime later they went through the same process again .
Then , later still they were asked whether they had performed that action or just imagined it .
Those who imagined the actions more frequently the second time were more likely to think they ’d actually performed the actions the first time .
Unintentional plagiarism
So far we ’ve seen how easily people move around the events , faces and sources of their memories .
Each of these are situations where people are retrieving a real memory , but mistaking one or more of its aspects .
Schacter ( 1999 ) , however , points to another common type of misattribution : when we attribute an idea or memory to ourselves that really belongs to someone else .
Unintentional plagiarism has been examined in a number of studies .
In one straightforward early study people were asked to generate examples of particular categories of items , like species of birds .
It was found that people , without realising , plagiarised each other about 4 % of the time ( Brown & Murphy , 1989 ) .
Subsequent studies using more naturalistic procedures have found much higher rates using different types of tasks – sometimes as much as 27 % .
That ’s a very high rate and probably helps to explain why we see so much unintentional repetition across many different areas of human culture .
Musicians , writers and artists of all stripes have to work extremely hard to avoid unintentionally plagiarising each other .
If a song that has been unintentionally plagiarised becomes a hit , it can easily end up making the lawyers a lot of money .
When George Harrison was sued for ( unintentionally ) plagiarising a Chiffons ’ hit “ He ’s So Fine ” , a claim that started in 1971 dragged on until the 1990s !
All made up
Although memories often have some basis in reality , whether we ’ve mixed up some details or even the memory ’s source , sometimes they are just completely false .
During the 1960s and 70s psychologists discovered a way of reproducing this false memory effect in the lab .
In the classic study conducted by James Deese at Johns Hopkins University , participants are given lists of semantically related words ( Deese , 1959 ) .
For example : red , green , brown and blue .
Later they have to try and recall them , at which point they often recall related words that were not actually presented , like purple or black .
Later studies have replicated this finding using more complicated procedures that help to counteract some of the problems with this early study .
Nevertheless there is still the question of whether these laboratory - based tasks really do tell us anything about how we behave in the real world .
Are we really this prone to completely false memories in real life ?
New evidence suggests we may well be .
Brown and Marsh ( 2008 ) found that some people could be induced to think they had visited an unfamiliar place simply by being shown photos of that location .
Memory and the self
These sorts of studies on the misattributions of memories can be existentially disturbing .
This is because each of us is effectively the accumulation of our experiences , our memories .
Who we are is – at least partly – what has happened to us .
Discovering the scientific evidence for how easily memories become confused , distorted or just plain break through from fantasy to reality is like discovering that part of ourselves is fabricated , false in some way .
As psychologist William James points out in the opening quote , memories can be carved from both reality and our dreams .
Away from the existential crisis and back to practicalities , Daniel Schacter suggests that misattributions may actually be useful to us ( Schacter , 1999 ) .
The ability to extract , abstract and generalise our experience enables us to apply lessons we ’ve learnt in one domain to another .
And , a lot of the time , we simply do n’t need to know the exact details of an experience : we may not remember the exact score , but we know our team won .
We get the gist .
Similarly , when we actually do need to know the details , we can take steps to encode the memory securely so we do n’t make misattributions .
But there ’s no doubting that in some circumstances misattributions can have frightening consequences – just ask anyone falsely convicted by eyewitness testimony .
Just ask Donald Thomson .

Microsoft and Yahoo are both struggling to compete with Google
The offer , contained in a letter to Yahoo 's board , is 62 % above Yahoo 's closing share price on Thursday .
Yahoo cut its revenue forecasts earlier this week and said it would have to spend an additional $ 300 m this year trying to revive the company .
It has been struggling in recent years to compete with Google , which has also been a competitor to Microsoft .
In a conference call , Microsoft 's Kevin Johnson said that the combination of the two companies would create an entity that could better compete with Google .
It is a shotgun marriage , but the person holding the shotgun is Google
Tim Weber , business editor , BBC News website
What 's at stake , who will win ?
" Today the market [ for online search and advertising ] is increasingly dominated by one player , " he said .
Chairman quit
Yahoo confirmed that it has received an unsolicited offer and said that its board would evaluate the proposal , " carefully and promptly in the context of Yahoo 's strategic plans and pursue the best course of action to maximize long - term value for shareholders . "
If Yahoo accepted the offer , competition authorities both in the US and the European Union would be likely to investigate the tie-up .
Yahoo chief executive , Jerry Yang , announced on Tuesday that he intended to lay off 1,000 staff as part of a restructuring plan .
Terry Semel , who stepped down as chief executive last June , also quit as non-executive chairman on Thursday .
Microsoft said that Yahoo shareholders could choose to receive either cash or shares .
YAHOO'S FALLING PROFITS Oct to Dec 2007 down 23 % July to Sept 2007 down 5 % April to June 2007 down 2 % Jan to March 2007 down 11 %
Yahoo share price Microsoft share price Google share price
Yahoo shares have fallen 46 % since reaching a year - high of $ 34.08 in October .
On Friday they closed almost 48 % higher .
Microsoft closed 6.6 % lower while Google shares fell 8.6 % .
" Ultimately this corporate marriage was forced by the rise of Google , which has grown into a serious competitor for both Microsoft as a software company and Yahoo as an internet portal , " said Tim Weber , business editor of the BBC News website .
" It is a shotgun marriage , but the person holding the shotgun is Google . "
' Exorbitant premium '
According to its letter to Yahoo , Microsoft attempted to enter talks about a deal a year ago , but was rebuffed because Yahoo was confident about the " potential upside " presented by the reorganisation and operational activities that were being put in place at the time .
" A year has gone by , and the competitive situation has not improved , " Microsoft 's letter said .
But there has been some concern about the price that Microsoft is offering .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This smacks of desperation from Microsoft who have consistently failed to achieve a meaningful online presence Matt , UK
" To me , the premium seems exorbitant , for what is a dwindling business , " said Tim Smalls from the brokerage firm Execution LLC .
" I personally do n't see how the synergies of Microsoft - Yahoo is going to take on Google . "
Other analysts were more enthusiastic about the offer .
" It is a fantastic offer .
It is game on , " said Colin Gillis from Canaccord Adams .
" This consolidates the marketplace down to Google versus Microsoft .
These two companies will be going head to head . "
OFFICIALS in Tampa , Florida , got a surprise recently when a local firm building the state 's first ethanol - production factory put in a request for 400,000 gallons ( 1.5 m litres ) a day of city water .
The request by US Envirofuels would make the facility one of the city 's top ten water consumers overnight , and the company plans to double its size .
Florida is suffering from a prolonged drought .
Rivers and lakes are at record lows and residents wonder where the extra water will come from .
They are not alone .
A backlash against the federally financed biofuels boom is growing around the country , and “ water could be the Achilles heel ” of ethanol , said a report by the Minneapolis - based Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy .
The number of ethanol factories has almost tripled in the past eight years from 50 to about 140 .
A further 60 or so are under construction .
In 2007 President George Bush signed legislation requiring a fivefold increase in biofuels production , to 36 billion gallons by 2022 .
This is controversial for several reasons .
There are doubts about how green ethanol really is ( some say the production process uses almost as much energy as it produces ) .
Some argue that using farmland for ethanol pushes up food prices internationally ( world wheat prices rose 25 % this week alone , perhaps as a side - effect of America 's ethanol programme ) .
But one of the least - known but biggest worries is ethanol 's extravagant use of water .
A typical ethanol factory producing 50 m gallons of biofuels a year needs about 500 gallons of water a minute .
Most of that goes into the boiling and cooling process , which is similar to making beer .
Some water is lost through evaporation in the cooling tower and in waste discharge .
All this is putting a heavy burden on aquifers in some corn-growing areas .
Residents went to court in Missouri to halt a $ 165 m facility being built by Gulfstream Bioflex Energy LLC which was projected to draw 1.3 m gallons of water every day from the Ozark aquifer .
Projects are being challenged in Minnesota , Iowa , Nebraska , Kansas and in central Illinois , where eight ethanol facilities are situated over the Mahomet aquifer .
Demand for corn is such that more land is also being ploughed up in drier regions of the Great Plains states to the west of the corn belt , where irrigation in required , increasing water demand further .
The good news is that ethanol plants are becoming more efficient .
They now use about half as much water per gallon of ethanol as they did a decade ago .
New technology might be able to halve the amount of water again , says Mike Fatigati , vice president of Delta - T Corp , a Virginia company which has designed a system that does not discharge any waste water .
But others are sceptical .
“ There are things you can close loop [ ie , recycle efficiently ] and things you can't , ” says Paul Greene , a senior director for biofuels with Siemens Water Technologies , designers of the water - purification technology used in ethanol factories .
Perhaps ethanol just is n't as bio- friendly as it looks .
Last month in Senegal , one of Africa ’s oldest and most stable democracies , police in riot gear beat and used tear gas against people protesting high food prices and later raided a television station that broadcast images of the event .
Many Senegalese have expressed anger at President Abdoulaye Wade for spending lavishly on roads and five - star hotels for an Islamic summit meeting last month while many people are unable to afford rice or fish .
“ Why are these riots happening ? ” asked Arif Husain , senior food security analyst at the World Food Program , which has issued urgent appeals for donations .
“ The human instinct is to survive , and people are going to do no matter what to survive .
And if you ’re hungry you get angry quicker . ”
Leaders who ignore the rage do so at their own risk .
President René Préval of Haiti appeared to taunt the populace as the chorus of complaints about la vie chère  the expensive life  grew .
He said if Haitians could afford cellphones , which many do carry , they should be able to feed their families .
“ If there is a protest against the rising prices , ” he said , “ come get me at the palace and I will demonstrate with you . ”

When they came , filled with rage and by the thousands , he huddled inside and his presidential guards , with United Nations peacekeeping troops , rebuffed them .
Within days , opposition lawmakers had voted out Mr. Préval ’s prime minister , Jacques - Édouard Alexis , forcing him to reconstitute his government .
Fragile in even the best of times , Haiti ’s population and politics are now both simmering .
“ Why were we surprised ? ” asked Patrick Élie , a Haitian political activist who followed the food riots in Africa earlier in the year and feared they might come to Haiti .
“ When something is coming your way all the way from Burkina Faso you should see it coming .
What we had was like a can of gasoline that the government left for someone to light a match to it . ”
Dwindling Menus
The rising prices are altering menus , and not for the better .
In India , people are scrimping on milk for their children .
Daily bowls of dal are getting thinner , as a bag of lentils is stretched across a few more meals .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Sandwiched between two nondescript commercial buildings in a vacant lot squats what looks like a long , plastic - shrouded greenhouse .
Hanging nearby is a cluster of five - foot - long plastic sacks bulging with green slime that resemble intravenous drip bags for the Jolly Green Giant .
It does n't look like groundbreaking technology , but these scum bags in Cambridge , Mass . , just might help save the planet .
That , at any rate , is what Isaac Berzin , founder and chief science advisor at GreenFuel Technologies , wants to do .
The curious setup is an experimental bioreactor that takes the stuff of pond scum - algae - grows it like mad , and turns it into " biomass " that can be processed into fuel for cars and trucks .
Even better , the GreenFuel system could help to clean up coal too .
The idea is that a coal plant 's CO2 emissions , rich food for algae , could be piped into the GreenFuel system , inducing the algae to grow .
Since the algae are essentially eating the coal emissions , there would be no need to capture and store the CO2 .
The process answers the " trillion - dollar question that led to the founding of GreenFuel , " says acting CEO Robert Metcalfe .
To wit : " Why expensively sequester CO2 when it can be profitably recycled ? "
That 's a leading question , of course , and it glosses over major challenges .
Capturing all of a coal - fired power plant 's CO2 emissions would require a series of GreenFuel bioreactors covering hundreds , or even thousands , of acres .
In densely populated areas , that could be a killer .
And the process has n't yet been proven technically feasible on a large scale , much less profitable .
Still , Metcalfe 's question captures why scum is getting love in energy circles these days .
Unlike other biofuels , algae can grow in arid places using polluted or salty water - no need to use up scarce arable land and fresh water .
A 2004 analysis at the University of New Hampshire concluded that all the transportation fuels in the United States could be supplied by algae grown on less than 30 million acres of desert - an area equal to about 3 % of the U.S. land devoted to farming crops and grazing for animals .
Because algae can grow so fast , such farms are expected to yield much more energy per acre than other biofuels .
" If algae are shown to be a cost - effective way " to reduce carbon footprints , notes Berzin , " the power industry will become a gorilla pushing algae forward . "
That 's not likely : GreenFuel 's main research collaborators so far are electric utilities .
Existing biofuels are primarily made from food crops , such as corn and soybeans .
U.S. production of corn ethanol , buoyed by federal subsidies , has soared from 1.6 billion gallons in 2000 to 6.5 billion last year .
Its explosive growth has demonstrated biofuels ' gusher potential .
Of course , given recent oil prices , they may well be the locus of the next bubble , and there is clearly a backlash brewing .
But biofuels that are not derived from food crops , such as cellulosic ethanol made from switchgrass , could be a major new source of transportation fuel .
Think , said a McKinsey analyst last year , of its reaching Saudi - oilfield proportions by 2020 .
Algae - energy research
In a move that galvanized biofuels entrepreneurs , the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) in November launched a major research program to enable the cost - competitive production of military jet fuel from both cellulosic and algal feedstocks .
The director of the program , Douglas Kirkpatrick , says he thinks major questions about algal fuels ' technical feasibility will be answered in " the next three to five years . "
That sounds about right : Algae - energy research is bubbling with new ideas and talent and is beginning to get backing from venture capital .
" In the past the money in this area went only to academics , " says Matt Caspari , CEO of Aurora BioFuels in Alameda , Calif .
" Now it 's reaching entrepreneurs who are applying technologies that did n't exist ten or 15 years ago . "
Two - year - old Aurora is developing biodiesel from oil - rich algae cultivated in labs at the University of California at Berkeley .
Solazyme , a South San Francisco biotech , is working to develop algae that produce more gallons of biodiesel per acre .
And several players , including Kent SeaTech ( San Diego ) , A2BE Carbon Capture ( Boulder ) , and LiveFuels ( Menlo Park , Calif . ) , plan to combine aquaculture with algae farms .
MOST politicians lie .
Most people over 50 , as I know all too well , misremember things .
So here is the one compelling mystery still unresolved about Hillary Clinton ’s Bosnia fairy tale :
Why did she keep repeating this whopper for nearly three months , well after it had been publicly debunked by journalists and eyewitnesses ?
In January , after Senator Clinton first inserted the threat of “ sniper fire ” into her stump speech , Elizabeth Sullivan of The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote that the story could n’t be true because by the time of the first lady ’s visit in March 1996 , “ the war was over . ”
Meredith Vieira asked Mrs. Clinton on the “ Today ” show why , if she was on the front lines , she took along a U.S.O. performer like Sinbad .
Earlier this month , a week before Mrs. Clinton fatefully rearmed those snipers one time too many , Sinbad himself spoke up to The Washington Post : “ I think the only ‘ red phone ’ moment was :
Do we eat here or at the next place ? ”
Yet Mrs. Clinton was undeterred .
She dismissed Sinbad as a “ comedian ” and recycled her fiction once more on St. Patrick ’s Day .
When Michael Dobbs fact - checked it for The Post last weekend and proclaimed it worthy of “ four Pinocchios , ” her campaign pushed back .
The Clinton camp enforcer Howard Wolfson phoned in to “ Morning Joe ” on MSNBC Monday and truculently quoted a sheaf of news stories that he said supported her account .
Only later that day , a full week after her speech , did he start to retreat , suggesting it was “ possible ” she “ misspoke ” in the “ most recent instance ” of her retelling of her excellent Bosnia adventure .
Since Mrs. Clinton had told a similar story in previous instances , this was misleading at best .
It was also dishonest to characterize what she had done as misspeaking  or as a result of sleep deprivation , as the candidate herself would soon assert .
The Bosnia anecdote was part of her prepared remarks , scripted and vetted with her staff .
Not that it mattered anymore .
The self - inflicted damage had been done .
The debate about Barack Obama ’s relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright was almost smothered in the rubble of Mrs. Clinton ’s Bosnian bridge too far .
Nice work , folks !
All the best to the vendors in their quest to pass the test .
For a quick glimpse , I just Flickr ’d a few screenshots of FF 2.0.12 , Opera 9.26 and Safari 3.04 taking the test .
Wow , is it really three years since Acid2 was released ?
Well I guess quite a lot has happened since then so it is plausible …
An interesting and optimistic note : the latest version of Webkit ( r30707 ) receives an 87/100 .
Pity iCab wo n’t be first to the finish this time , but never mind .
Dave Hyatt : any chance of a series of blog posts explaining the fixes that go into Webkit ( à la Acid2 ) ?
Mozilla Firefox nightly build 3.0 b4 pre gets a decent 67/100 over here ( all gray scale ) .
Hope they ’ll pass this one by the release of 3.0 final .
So what browser are you guys using to get a 100 % score ?
Maury , the 100 % score is a reference rendering , not an actual browser result ( yet ) .
alex :
There ’s absolutely no chance of Firefox 3 passing Acid3 .
Gecko 1.9 is effectively feature frozen , and major architectural changes will undoubtedly be necessary to complete certain of the missing parts of Acid3 , which just wo n’t be accepted at this late stage .
( Though part of the current high score of Firefox is due to it picking up a semi-risky change at a late stage to enable dynamically updating selectors , which was needed for a blocking bug , but also made a difference for Acid3 . )
Moreover , the Mozilla backend is due for a major revision ( much larger than usual between releases ) , namely Mozilla 2 .
Those architectural changes will undoubtedly go into the same Mozilla 2 work .
However , due to the nature of the work happening there , it would n’t surprise me at all if a Firefox release to benefit from this work would n’t be ready for another 2 + years .
( There could very well be a Firefox 3.1 ( or 3.5 or even 4 ) release in between , but that would be a Firefox release from the same Gecko 1.9 code , which is guaranteed not to pick up the necessary architectural changes . )
Opera ( and Safari ? ) nightlies are having scores comparable to current Firefox 3 betas , too , so really , which browser is the first to pass the test will mostly depend on fortuitous release schedules .
( I very much suspect it ’s way too late in the game for Opera 9.5 as well , so there it ’d be Opera 10 ; do n’t know what things are like for Safari … )
Maury : no browser currently exists which gets a 100 % score , obviously .
However , the specifications are precise enough ( and Ian Hickson who created the Acid3 test is knowledgeable enough ) that it can be deduced how the test should render .
( Although there ’s always a tiny chance that a flaw in the test is found at some stage and that it will need to be updated ; this happened at some point in Acid2 , too , iirc . )
I see , thanks for the clarification .
I have been authoring the Acid3 page on Wikipedia , together with a few others .
Now that the test is final , we should update the images of how it renders in current stable browsers .
If anyone could help submit some , with Creative Commons License , it would be appreciated .
In the article we have references to the tracking bugs for Gecko , Webkit and KHTML , if anyone wishes to follow the progress .
Even though Webkit especially has thrown themselves with abandonment into fixing Acid3 related bugs , I predict it will take a while for them to get 100 % .
They need to add SMIL , which today is a non-existent feature .
As for Mozilla , they are focusing more on ECMAScript 4 and Tamarin , so although they may be in a lead of sorts scripting - technology wise , I predict that both Safari and Opera will pass Acid3 ahead of Firefox .
Let us also remember that Acid3 is not the final word on standards compliance .
Seeing Webkit go from worst in class when it comes to the DOM and ECMAScript , to having a really good scripting engine is good news of course ( no MSIE is not worst in class – it is not in the class at all … )
Even if firefox doesent pass first it renders stuff accepable .
Imagine how long it ’ll take for IE to pass LOL
Konqueror seems to pass the Acid2 test , but crashes horribly when attempting Acid3 .
I ca n’t wait for a Konqueror with Webkit …
Webkit r30790 is already at 90/100 .
It looks like they ’re working fast on this …
Steve , you beat me to it .
Is this Steve Jobs ?
jk Webkit will have this by mid-April I think .
Lars , where would you like the submissions of images showing rendering ?
Directly on the Wikipedia entry , the talk page or elsewhere ?
FireFox Minfield for 3/13 is now getting 70/100 so even just after the beta 4 release they are still moving along as well :)
Firefox 3 Minefield for 3/17 has 71/100 !
Hopefully they pass Acid 3 by the FF3 release .
The WebKit now gets a steady 93 on the Acid 3 test .
I ca n’t wait for the final standard .
Maybe someday all browsers will adhere to standards so everyone could have an equal experiences on all web pages .
Safari 3.1 is getting a steady 74 … highest score for a production browser , I think .
Opera 9.50
Windows 9841 build
18 . March 2008 77pts .
Firefox 3.0 beta 4 steady 68 pts .
Safari Version 3.1 ( 4525.13 ) Mac OS X 10.4 75/100 , but still link test failed
WebKit as of March 22nd 2008 nightly build is at 95/100 now !
Looking great and WebKit has by many magnitudes a faster javascript , dom and svg implementation versus Gecko and IE .
Go WebKit !
M$ does n’t care much about acid3 but IE 8 beta is passing
Reposting : OS X.4.11 Webkit Nightly Build ( r31307 ) ( with Safari 3.1 installed , but not used ) now gets 96/100
They ’ve also just introduced an optimization into Webkit nightlies for pageloading that is very sweet on script heavy pages .
http://webkit.org/blog/166/optimizing-page-loading-in-web-browser/
“ The latest WebKit nightlies contain some new optimizations to reduce the impact of network latency .
When script loading halts the main parser , we start up a side parser that goes through the rest of the HTML source to find more resources to load .
We also prioritize resources so that scripts and stylesheets load before images .
The overall effect is that we are now able to load more resources in parallel with scripts , including other scripts . ”
Looks like Opera is officially the first to pass the test ;)
http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2008/03/26/opera-and-the-acid3-test
Apple ’s current nightly WebKit build is now at 98/100 on the Acid3 test .
Opera Rocks !!!!
THE FIRST ONE THAT PASSES THE ACID3 TEST
http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2008/03/26/opera-and-the-acid3-test
Congrats to Opera !
Webkit also just made 100/100 , and there is a stable , public release .
http://webkit.org/blog/173/webkit-achieves-acid3-100100-in-public-build/
Congrats to the Webkit crew !
Firefox3 beta5 comes out soon !
I ca n’t wait to see what it scores …
Here ’s hoping for a firefox 3.0 release that passes acid3 completely !
Firefox 3 Beta 5 scores 71/100 on ACID3 , which is better than Beta 4 , which was 67 if memory serves me .
I was hoping to see the various squares turn different colors , rather than shades of gray .
I hope this will be fixed in time for the official release .
There are also a few artifacts ( 2 small red squares , white X against a magenta background ) .
I ’m glad to see improvements being made .
It ’s only a matter of time .
I ’m not convinced that Mozilla will get a 100/100 score in the next couple of years .
While the Gecko - Engine improves from version to version , the ACID3 test checks , among others , the correct implementation of “ CSS2 ( @font - face ) ” .
This includes the support of the “ src ” parameter to specify a dynamically loadable font - file .
You did note that this is a CSS2 feature , did you ?
A specification that dates back to 1998 .
As Netscape released the Source of the browser back in 1998 , the community had to remove the support for dynamically loaded fonts due to copyright - issues .
It ’s a long lasting and unresolved bug ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52746, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70132) with no hint of progress in the mean time .
The licenses of the font vendors obviously require a “ closed source ” implementation and the Mozilla license obviously prohibits just that – the utilisation of a closed source library .
A classical deadlock .
We had the 10th aniversary of this unfortune happening lately .
Maybe the OpenType specification and a set of public domain fonts can solve this issue one day .
I like this post .
Hopefully they pass Acid 3 by the FF3 release .
In 1993 the 103rd Congress unanimously signed into Public Law the Apology Bill .
America publicly admitted to illegally overthrowing its ally and trading partner the Sovereign Kingdom of Hawaii and falsely imprisoning the beloved Queen Liliuokalani .
Since then , America , has done everything it can to avoid the consequences of this Bill .
The inevitable result will be the restoration of a sovereign Hawaii .
Feburary 22 , 1998 , Majesty Akahi Nui , grandnephew of Queen Liliuokalani was coronated King of the Hawaiian Nation at the Iolani Palace .
He holds the Kingdom of Hawaii Diplomatic Passport , is recognized internationally and has signed treaties with other nations .
Impeach or Else Rally
Monday , March 17th , 2008
3pm
St Paul Capitol Building
It is now undeniable that the Federal Government has failed us completely .
We have asked our representatives to hold the Bush Administration accountable .
Instead , they have blocked the Impeachment movement all over our country .
As we approach the anniversary of the illegal Iraq invasion , we have not given up on the idea of holding the criminals in the Bush Administration or those who enable them accountable .
There is something that you can do .
It is now time for Plan B .
Impeach for Peace researched a method for impeaching the President or Vice President using a little known and rarely used part of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives ( “ Jefferson ’s Manual ” ) .
This document actually empowers individual states to initiate the impeachment process .
All that ’s required is that the MN House and Senate pass an impeachment resolution .
So spread the word , tell your friends , your family , your coworkers , your allies .
We will hold a rally Monday , March 17th , on the steps of the Capitol Building in St Paul .
When we are finished with the rally , we will storm the Capitol Building .
We shall demand that the Minnesota House and Senate immediately pass a resolution calling for the Impeachment of George W Bush and Dick Cheney ( Contact them yourself Now and demand Impeachment ! ) .
Our message will be clear to those inside .
If you , as a representative do not support this and treat it with all the urgency it deserves , then you will face opposition in the next election cycle .
The message that you will face will be simple , direct and clear .
It will be that you refused to honor your Oath to Protect and Defend the Constitution from All Enemies , Foreign and Domestic .
That instead you , by your refusal to start impeachment actually defend the criminals in the Bush Administration and continue the illegal occupation in Iraq .
We will actively work against your reelection to the MN State Legislature , regardless of your party affiliation .
We will make this very personal .
This is how we will ensure that you listen to the demands of We the People , instead of the lobbyists who fund your campaigns .
Oh and before you try and give us excuses , we have done our homework .
We already know that according to the Constitution , an impeachment resolution is virtually the only thing that the Governor is unable to veto .
We can do this , we must do this .
The future of our children and our democratic republic depends on it .
What we need is YOU showing up and demanding accountability .
Let us know if you ’re planning on coming .

By some measures , 2007 was a great year to be a venture capitalist .
VCs raised $ 35 billion in new funds , invested nearly $ 30 billion , and best of all cashed in a tidy $ 53 billion .
Those are good numbers , but they hide the fact that when it comes to the Internet , venture capitalists are facing the toughest investing environment in recent history .
As companies become cheaper to launch , fewer entrepreneurs need the kind of cash infusions that VCs provide .
And angel investors are encroaching on VCs ' turf by throwing more money at early - stage companies ; in 2006 , angels pumped a total of $ 26 billion into 51,000 startups , up from $ 18 billion in 2003 .
At the same time , large companies are snapping up Web businesses before these startups ever see a second or third round of funding .
" Right now , honestly ?
This time sucks for us , " says Paul Kedrosky , a partner with Ventures West .
" It 's a bad time . "
Savvy VCs are finding ways to compete .
One gambit : doling out perks to entrepreneurs .
San Francisco - based Founders Fund , started by ex-PayPal CEO Peter
Thiel , lets entrepreneurs trade some of their equity for cash , something they usually can't do until their companies are purchased or go public .
Other VCs are competing with angels by investing like them — with small amounts and at early stages .
In 2007 , the average VC - led seed round was less than $ 1 million .
" Half of the deals we do are either seed or A round , " says Roger Lee , a general partner at Battery Ventures .
" The companies VCs are putting $ 500,000 into this year we might have been putting $ 20 million into in 2000 . "
Meanwhile , the grim economy is an unlikely source of solace .
Venture firms usually have 10 years to invest the money they raise , making them better prepared than angels to weather market dips .
And as the bad economy starts to cut into startups ' growth , entrepreneurs will need to raise more funding at lower valuations .
Best of all for VCs , a coming wave of tech layoffs may yield more investing opportunities than ever : " Economic slowdowns tend to coincide with bright people leaving big companies to do their own thing , " says Stu Phillips , managing partner of Ridgelift Ventures .
" For early - stage investors , a recession can be a great time . "

Variety quotes a studio insider saying “ Star Trek has the potential to gross more in May than in December . ”
UPDATE : Trek move part of larger reshuffling at Paramount
Apparently this is all part of a larger plan on the part of Paramount and the decision was likely made by new Film Division Head John Lesher .
Here is more from Variety ’s Blog .
John Lesher is starting to make his imprint felt at Paramount .
( And make no mistake , he ’s still overseeing Vantage too . )
Paramount is changing a number of release dates on their 2008 and 2009 skeds , moving J.J. Abrams ’ Star Trek from Christmas , 2008 to May 8 , 2009 .
David Fincher ’s Brad Pitt - starrer
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button will move from November 26 to December 19 , 2008 .
DreamWorks Pictures ’ comedy Tropic
Thunder , originally scheduled for July 11 , will now be released on August 15 by DreamWorks - Paramount .
And Sam Mendes ’ Revolutionary Road , starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet , originally announced as a DreamWorks - Paramount release , will now be distributed by Paramount Vantage .
Which makes perfect sense ; who better to handle it as an Oscar contender ?
UPDATE 2 : Nothing to do with script
The Hollywood Reporter also notes that Paramount ’s reshuffling of six films was due to a rethink after the strike and that in the case of Trek it was not related to the script .
Dramatically underscoring the need for movie - side execs to review slates following the long writers strike , Paramount on Wednesday bounced six films to new dates and moved two unslotted films to next year ’s calendar .
Other distributors were scrambling to complete similar reviews of their upcoming productions to determine what can or ca n’t be delivered on scheduled dates .
In some cases , films will move because of talent issues , but many film projects have been frozen in time when script rewrites were n’t completed before the 100 - day scribe walkout .
“ Star Trek ” arguably was the biggest film moved , with the intended Christmas Day release now set for the first prime date in the following summer boxoffice season : May 8 , 2009 .
But “ Trek ” appears something of an exception in the mix of itinerant pics , with its shift unrelated to script or cast considerations .
” ‘ Star Trek ’ is moving to summer because its has so much boxoffice potential , ” Par spokesman Michael Vollman said .
“ It does not need any script tweaks .
They ’re two - thirds of the way through shooting , and we would have delivered a great movie at Christmas . ”
Summer a better move ?
Although winter release films can make a lot of money ( like the recent Lord of the Rings films and last years Bond film ) , the biggest film ’s tend to come out in the Summer .
Due to the writer ’s strike , the summer of 2009 will be a bit lighter than 2007 and 2008 .
Right now there are no movies slated for the 8th of May 2009 , although the week before is X - Men Origins : Wolverine and the week after is Angels and Demons ( ironically this sequel to The Da Vinci Code was originally slated to come out the weekend before Star Trek in December 2008 ) .
Of course , there is no guarantee those films will stay in those slots .
As for Christmas this year , Star Trek was one of three films being released that day ( although the other two were likely more aimed at different markets ) .
The move could be to help fill Paramount Dreamworks 2009 line - up after 2008 which already has a number of strong entries ( Spiderwick , Iron Man , Indy 4 , Madagascar 2 , The Love Guru , Benjamin Button , etc. ) .
The only other big films currently slated for Summer 2009 are Transformers 2 on June 29th and G.I. Joe in August .
As more details emerge , TrekMovie.com will report them .
My take
Obviously my first feeling is disappointment .
No one saw this coming and all reports from the production and Paramount are that things are looking great .
Looking at the landscape I think it is likely that Paramount feel their 2008 lineup is already strong and their 2009 is looking a little thin .
Plus 2009 has less competition and more summer movie goers .
Of course it should also ensure a better film as all that time can be spent on more polishing and more post - production .
So in the end we can get a better movie that appeals to a larger audience ( translating into more strength for the franchise ) which is all good .
But it still means waiting twenty more weeks for the film and that is not fun .
The Grumpy Editor encounters the Hardy Heron

Your editor is not always known for making life easy for himself .
Perhaps one of the most clear examples of masochistic behavior would be a certain preference for running development distributions on mission - critical systems .
That said , your editor has stuck with a stable distribution on his laptop through a round of intensive travel earlier this year .
But that was too easy , so , shortly before heading off to the Linux Foundation 's Collaboration Summit , the laptop got moved to the Ubuntu " Hardy Heron " distribution .
Needless to say , there have been some interesting ups and downs ( literally ) since then .
There is always a certain thrill that comes with upgrading a system and finding that important features no longer work .
In this case , the problem was suspend and resume , which your editor uses heavily .
In fact , the system would suspend just fine - as long as one failed to notice that , behind the cleverly darkened screen , the laptop 's backlight had been left on .
Needless to say , this new behavior is not helpful if one 's goal is to save power while the system is suspended , but it gets worse than that .
Your editor discovered this nice surprise after carrying the computer in a backpack for a few hours ; by the time it came out , it was almost too hot to hold .
Happily , no permanent damage appears to have been done .
Or , perhaps , unhappily .
Your editor has been looking for an excuse to get a new laptop for a while .
The problem turned out to be a HAL configuration error combined with a strange internal model number which makes your editor 's Thinkpad X31 different from , seemingly , every other X31 on the planet .
Once your editor found the bug report and attached a " me too " comment , the solution was quick in coming .
On the net , one can find complaints that Ubuntu is unresponsive to bug reports , but that was certainly not the experience here .
As an aside , it seems worth noting that life seems to have gotten more complicated , with a lot more code wrapped around the kernel than there once was .
The problematic configuration file was /usr / share / hal / fdi/ information/10 freedesktop/20-video-quirk-pm-ibm.fdi - not a place where your editor , who is not a HAL expert , would have thought to look .
That , it seems , is the price of more capable hardware and software , but sometimes your editor pines for the days when it seemed possible to carry a full understanding of the system within a single brain .
GNOME developers are ( perhaps unjustly in recent years ) known for taking a minimal approach to configuration options .
That can be irritating , but just as annoying is their tendency to reset the options they do provide over major updates .
Once suspend and resume work , your editor demands something else of a laptop when traveling : absolute silence .
So the return of beeps to gnome - terminal was not appreciated .
Those were easily silenced , but the GNOME developers also saw fit to bring back the blinking cursor - and they took away the configuration option which abolishes that intolerable feature .
Your editor first ran into the unstoppable blink with Rawhide ; a query to the developers there turned up a quick answer .
It seems that the GNOME developers have decided to create a single , system - wide parameter to control blinking cursors .
Now , your editor approves of the concept of being able to turn off that behavior everywhere with a single switch - but only as long as that switch is n't hidden where nobody will ever find it .
In this case , the GNOME developers have taken this feature , wrapped it in old newspapers , and stashed it behind the furnace in the basement ; then they put a trunk on top of it .
It is a rare user who will find it unassisted .
In the hopes that it may save one or two readers from some time spent with search engine , your editor will now divulge the top - secret incantation which turns blinking cursors off :
gconftool - 2 -- type bool -- set /desktop/gnome/interface/cursor_blink false
Naturally , a terminal window is required to run this command .
It would have been nice if the developers who packaged this code for Hardy Heron had found a way to smooth over this change , but no such luck ; as far as your editor can tell , no distributor has made that effort .
Another bit of fun is that your editor is no longer able to set the desktop background ; the relevant configuration windows are ineffective .
In this case , it would appear that the task of implementing the user 's background choices have been moved to nautilus - just the place your editor would have thought to look for it .
As it happens , your editor has no use for file managers and does not run nautilus - and is punished with an immutable Ubuntu - brown background for that sin .
Happily , your editor still knows how to run xsetroot .
All of the above is a set of relatively minor grumbles , all of which are rectified in relatively short order .
Once those details have been taken care of , the Hardy Heron release works quite well .
One of the biggest aggravations from previous upgrades - having OpenOffice.org reformat the slides in all of your editor 's presentations - was not present this time around .
Hopefully we are moving into an era where " it did n't mangle my documents " is not something considered worthy of mention .
There was one very nice surprise as well .
Your editor 's laptop previously required almost 12 watts of power when running unplugged .
This laptop is not at the bleeding edge of current technology , so the amount of time it was able to run without a recharge has been dropping for a while .
With the Hardy release , steady - state power consumption has dropped to just over 9 watts - a big improvement .
The credit for this change belongs to developers at all levels : kernel , applications , distributors , etc .
The end result is a system which runs much more efficiently , and that is a good thing .
All told , your editor is reasonably content ; this distribution looks like one which might just be worth keeping around .
That 's a good thing , since Ubuntu plans to maintain it as a " long - term support " release .
Not that your editor intends to make much use of that long - term support ; there should be a new development series starting soon , after all .
One of the nice things about development distributions is that support never ends as long as one stays on the treadmill and the project itself remains alive .
Here at TED , I met a man named Steve Varon .
He 's a warm and gregarious man who runs a successful children 's underwear company on the East Coast .
For the last year or so , he 's been working very hard to make his dream possible : to see the Dalai Lama carry the torch in the Chinese Olympics .
He made a short video about it , which he submitted to Pangea Day , but you can see it now on YouTube .
I wish him luck in his quest .
John
Yoo , the former Bush Administration lawyer who now teaches at UC Berkeley 's law school , authored the torture memo that cleared the way for the U.S. military to begin torturing suspected Al Qaeda members in Guantanamo and black site prisons , as well as Iraqis in Abu Ghraib .
Perhaps less well known is that Yoo also wrote a legal opinion blessing the president 's targeting of American citizens for wiretapping , a memo that even members of Congress have not seen .
There have been clues before in the administration 's defense of its wiretapping program .
For instance , the Justice Department said ( .pdf ) the Authorization to Use Military Force and the president 's war making powers in the Constitution .
But in the Yoo torture memo ( .pdf ) which was just released and declassified yesterday , Yoo himself seems to clue us in :
Citing cases that prevented companies from suing the U.S. government for losses they sustained overseas during wartime , You writes " These cases and the untenable consequences for the President 's conduct of a war that would result from the application of the Due Process Cluse demonstrate its inapplicability during wartime –whether to the conduct of interrogations or the detention of enemy aliens . "
Lest it not be clear enough that Yoo is arguing the President is King in wartime , thanks to the Constitution 's Article II powers , two footnotes surrounding the former sentence make it clear .
In footnote 10 , Yoo writes " our Office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations . "
Remember that Bush said the wiretapping program was part of his war on terrorism .
And there it is .
In the war on terrorism , the bill of rights does not apply .
Footnote 11 adds to it : " We conclude that the restrictions outlined in the Fifth Amendment simply do not address actions the Executive takes in conducting a military campaign against the Nation 's enemies . "
Congress still has n't seen this memo , and yet they are prepared to hand over more wiretapping powers to this Administration .
And John Yoo teaches at UC - Berkeley .
Meanwhile not a single Congressional committee will let AT&T whistle blower Mark Klein testify .
As violence spirals and calls for peace talks grow , extremists say they will build a new West Bank settlement for each of the eight students killed
Israel 's far - right settler movement has set itself on a renewed collision course with the government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , declaring that last week 's massacre in a Jewish religious school had targeted them directly and vowing to build a new illegal outpost in the West Bank for every one of the killed students .
Amid a sense of spiralling crisis in Israeli and the Occupied Territories - which has stemmed from the impression that both Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are rudderless amid the climbing violence - Abbas performed yet another policy U - turn , calling for new talks with Israel after having earlier appeared to back away from peace talks .
The latest moves follow the killing on Thursday by a Palestinian gunmen of eight Jewish seminary students , the bloodiest attack in Israel in two years .
Hamas , which had vowed to avenge the more than 125 Palestinians killed in a recent Gaza offensive by Israel , at first claimed responsibility , then backtracked .
Hamas 's claim came as the spokesman for Israel 's right - wing settlement movement said that he believed the attack on the religious college was aimed at his movement .
Dani Dayan , the chairman of the Yesha Council , said yesterday that the attacker deliberately targeted Mercaz Herav yeshiva , known for its messianic , national religious Zionism .
' Of course it was n't a coincidence or by chance , ' Dayan said .
Israel has been under increasing pressure from the United States , its main ally , to stop building settlements in the occupied West Bank but the government has struggled to curtail the expansion because the settlers wield considerable electoral power .
Olmert needs the religious right in his governing coalition to maintain his fragile grip on power .
The religious right opposes the US - backed Annapolis peace talks and this latest attack will further undermine Olmert 's authority .
Dayan said the peace talks were ' leading nowhere ' .
' They have raised expectations that everyone knows can't be fulfilled by Olmert or Abbas , ' Dayan said .
' In this part of the world , when your raise expectations and can't fulfil them , you get violence . '
But even secular Israelis have been angered by the attack .
Professor Ephraim Yaar at the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research , who conducts a monthly peace poll , said : ' There certainly will be a very adverse , strong effect . '
However , Yaar said the anger among secular Israelis would recede within a month , assuming there are no more similar attacks .
Despite confusion about who carried out the attack , there is speculation that Hamas and Hizbollah colluded to avenge the alleged Israeli assassination of a senior Hizbollah commander in Damascus last month and Israel 's incursion into Gaza last week which killed more than 100 , many of them civilians .
The conflict between Hamas and Israel intensified after Hamas ousted its main political rival , Fatah , from the Gaza Strip in the middle of last year .
Abbas , who leads Fatah , condemned the attack on the seminary and insisted that the Annapolis peace process was the only way to settle the 60 - year conflict .
' Despite all the circumstances we are living through and all the attacks we are experiencing we insist on peace , ' Abbas said .
While Olmert is also expected to continue peace negotiations , his government will come under intensified pressure to retaliate with a strong military response in Gaza .
But last Tuesday , two days before the Jerusalem shooting , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was forced to step in and prop up the shaky talks after Abbas suspended contact in the wake of Israeli 's military operation in Gaza .

Brain activity can be decoded using magnetic resonance imaging .
What are you looking at ?
Your brain activity should reveal whether you 're looking at the cat or the bowl of fruit .
Scientists have developed a way of ‘ decoding ’ someone ’s brain activity to determine what they are looking at .
“ The problem is analogous to the classic ‘ pick a card , any card ’ magic trick , ” says Jack Gallant , a neuroscientist at the University of California in Berkeley , who led the study .
But while a magician uses a ploy to pretend to ‘ read the mind ’ of the subject staring at a card , now researchers can do it for real using brain - scanning instruments .
“ When the deck of cards , or photographs , has about 120 images , we can do better than 90 % correct , ” says Gallant .
The technique is a step towards being able to see the contents of someone ’s visual experiences .
“ You can imagine using this for dream analysis , or psychotherapy , ” says Gallant .
Already the results are helping to provide neuroscientists with a more accurate model of how the human visual system works .
If the work can be broadened to developing more general models of how the brain responds to things beyond visual stimuli , such brain scans could help to diagnose disease or monitor the effects of therapy .
Predicting responses
There have been previous efforts at brain - reading using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , but these have been quite limited .
In most such attempts , volunteers ’ brain responses were first monitored when looking at a discrete selection of pictures ; these brain scans could then be used to determine which picture from this set a person is looking at .
This only works when there is a limited number of simple pictures , and when a subject ’s response to those pictures is already known .
In the new report , Gallant and his team instead fMRI to model a subject ’s brain responses to various types of pictures , and used this to predict responses to novel images1 .
“ It ’s definitely a leap forward , ” says John - Dylan Haynes of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig , Germany , who also works on decoding the brain ’s activity .
“ Now you can use a more abstract way of decoding the images that people are seeing . ”
In the experiment , the brain activity of two subjects ( two of Gallant ’s team members , Kendrick Kay and Thomas Naselaris ) was monitored while they were shown 1,750 different pictures .
The team then selected 120 novel images that the subjects had n’t seen before , and used the previous results to predict their brain responses .
When the test subjects were shown one of the images , the team could match the actual brain response to their predictions to accurately pick out which of the pictures they had been shown .
With one of the participants they were correct 72 % of the time , and with the other 92 % of the time ; on chance alone they would have been right only 0.8 % of the time .
Complex response
The next step is to interpret what a person is seeing without having to select from a set of known images .
“ That is in principle a much harder problem , ” says Gallant .
You ’d need a very good model of the brain , a better measure of brain activity than fMRI , and a better understanding of how the brain processes things like shapes and colours seen in complex everyday images , he says .
“ And we do n’t really have any of those three things at this time . ”
Previous attempts have simply modelled the brain ’s response to simple geometric shapes , says Gallant .
It ’s much harder to understand the brain ’s response to more complex , realistic images .

A decoding device that can read out the brain ’s activity could be used in medicine to assess the results of a stroke or the effect of a particular drug treatment , or to help diagnose conditions such as dementia , by seeing how the function of the brain changes as a result of illness or intervention .
Creating a model of how the brain responds to various stimuli might also be useful in other types of neural processing .
“ It ’s interesting to see how this could extend , ” says Haynes , who showed last year that it is possible to predict which of two sums a person was computing in their head2 .
But it will be a long time yet before it applies to his own work , he says , because “ we do n’t have a good enough model for intentions " .
 DOOMSDAY  LEGISLATION
Handful of Congressmen Could Rule America in Event of Catastrophe
By Greg Szymanski
No longer do Capitol Hill legislators need a quorum to do the peoples business .
Now under a piece of hotly contested legislation passed without media attention on Jan. 5 , only a few members of Congress are needed to do official business in the event of a catastrophe instead of the usual 218 .
Critics claim H. Res. 5 paves the way for tyranny , allowing only a few to decide for so many . 
The provision states :  If the House should be without a quorum due to catastrophic circumstances , then . . . until there appear in the House a sufficient number of representatives to constitute a quorum among the whole number of the House , a quorum in the House shall be determined based upon the provisional number of the House ; and . . . the provisional number of the House , as of the close of the call of the House . . . shall be the number of representatives responding to that call of the House . 
Supporters claim the bill , passed under the cover of congressional darkness ,  is intended to allow the government to continue operating  in the event of a catastrophic emergency or terrorist attack .
However , constitutional experts say the law is blatantly unconstitutional and ripe for challenge .
Normally , 218 lawmakers out of the 435 members are needed to declare war , pass laws and validly conduct the peoples business .
But under the new rule a majority is no longer needed when circumstances arise , including natural disaster , attack , contagion or terrorist attacks rendering representatives incapable of attending House proceedings .
 It s another measure brought up by lawmakers that shows their callous disregard for democracy ,  said one California attorney who preferred to remain anonymous .
GOP
House leaders pushed the controversial doomsday legislation  through for passage as a part of a hefty and voluminous rules package .
It drew little attention and was probably not even discovered by many who voted on it since the rules package centered on recent ethics violations .
 I think the new rule is disgusting , terrible and unconstitutional ,  said Norm Ornstein , of an independent , bipartisan panel called the Continuity of Government Commission which is studying the issue .
 The way it was passed was deceitful and the intent behind the legislation was very foolish . 
Rep. Brian Baird , ( D - Wash . ) agrees , arguing that the rule change violates the Constitution , which specifically states : a majority of each Chamber shall constitute a quorum to do business . 
 Allowing for as few as 12 lawmakers to make vital decisions and to possibly declare war on another nation is not what this country is all about . 
We 've done posts on Don Siegelman before .
The former Alabama governor was convicted of corruption on shaky grounds and imprisoned and kept from speaking out or appealing the verdict in an unbelievable story of Republican cronyism and amoral partisanship .
Now it looks like the strong arming continues ... all the way to the corporate offices of CBS .
After all , it worked so well with Dan Rather ...
at Largely :
Well folks , seems that 60 Minutes is postponing ( read " killing " ) its Siegelman story .
The excuse I am told for this lapse in ethics is that the network needs more time to vet the whistle - blower , Dana Jill Simpson .
You see , the reason the network suddenly needs more time to vet Simpson is that the White House has launched a direct campaign inside CBS to discredit her and just to make sure the dirt sticks , they have called in some favors too .
I am told that Senator Jeff Sessions has been instructed to help the White House discredit Simpson as part of his " Senatorial " duties .
Nice system of government we have here , eh ?
So , two things are going to happen now .
The first is , we will be including what 60 Minutes did not report as part of the Raw Story series on the case .
Instead of 5 installments , we will now have 6 .
Second , all of you as citizens of this nation must voice your concerns about this situation to CBS .
You want a free press ?
Then fight for it !

From subterranean Martians to female hysteria , people have been known to believe some pretty bizarre things .
What does it take to make a believable scientific hypothesis out of a strange idea like Hollow Earth theory , what suspension of believe is needed to agree with the Intelligent Design nutjobs ?
Apparently , not much .
Here are five of the strangest examples and who knows what people will find hilariously untrue from our era in 50 years ?
Everyone will no doubt have other ideas for what the world ’s weirdest theories are so give it a shot in the comments below !
1. Trepanation
Ouch .
In one of the oldest known medical interventions , a hole is drilled in the skull of a patient who is suffering from defects such as seizures or migraine headaches .
The idea was to relieve pressure in the head which was believed to be causing the ailment .
Today , trepanation is used on a very limited basis as a mechanism to access the brain for necessary surgery .
Some people practice recreational or spiritual trepanation , presumably because they need modern medicine like they need a hole in the head .
2. Female hysteria
Women in the Victorian age were said to be suffering from female hysteria when they were moody or a little more “ difficult ” than usual .
Fortunately for them , the treatment was something called pelvic massage .
We ca n’t laugh too hard at this one , though .
Many years later , it directly caused vibrating devices to be widely available for , um , home treatment .
3. Expanding Earth
As bizarre theories go , this one does n’t sound that far - fetched .
Expanding Earth is the idea that the planet was once a lot smaller and completely covered in one continent .
If you mentally shrink the globe and try to fit the continents together like a puzzle , you could almost start to believe this theory
“ She was doing precisely that , ” Professor Harvey said .
“ She said , ‘ This is our marriage and our business , ’ and he bounced back and he did n’t win New Hampshire but he won the nomination .
In that case , there were no allegations of laws being broken .
It was simple marital infidelity .
I think that ’s not what we ’re dealing with here . ”
Some political consultants and scholars said Ms. Wall Spitzer ’s appearance hit such a nerve not only because of the tawdriness of the accusations but because of her obvious devastation .
Unlike the blank demeanors of other aggrieved political spouses , Ms. Wall Spitzer , her eyes alternately downcast or glancing at her husband , had the drained , dazed look of someone in mourning .
In search of expert commentary , television news stations naturally zoomed in on one such spouse , Dina Matos McGreevey .
Ms. Matos McGreevey , author of “ Silent Partner : A Memoir of My Marriage , ” stood next to her husband , Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey , at a news conference in 2004 in which he disclosed that he was gay and announced his resignation .
In a telephone interview on Tuesday , Ms. Matos McGreevey said that two hours before that news conference , Governor McGreevey asked her to consider joining him at the lectern .
She told him she would think about it , she said , and then quickly consulted her therapist .
“ It was an instinct to be there , ” she said .
“ Despite the fact that he ’s humiliated you and caused you excruciating pain , this was a man I married , a man I loved , and your feelings do n’t evaporate overnight .
And then I thought about my daughter , and I did n’t want her 10 or 15 years down the line to ask me , ‘ Mommy , this was the most difficult point in Daddy ’s life , and why were n’t you there to support him ? ’ ”
Ms. Matos McGreevey said she did not regret her decision to appear with her husband as he proclaimed himself “ a gay American , ” even though she was later faulted .
“ I have been criticized for going out there , and people have said : ‘ Why did you do it ?
How could you stand there with a smile ? ’ ” she said .
“ But people who know me know that that was not a smile .
That was my attempt to keep my composure . ”
Some of the Internet chatter on Tuesday suggested that Ms. Wall Spitzer ’s silent presence at her husband ’s side represented a dark day for feminism , with one writer railing , “ Someone needs to tell his wife that ‘ stand by your man ’ does not apply here !!! ...
She needs to have some pride . ”
Yup – I ’m now done porting Quake III Arena to managed C++ with Visual Studio 2008 / v9.0 and .NET v3.5 .
My apologies to the guys on my private email list for getting this post out a week late .
I ran into massive problems getting the Release build to work , even though there was no difference between its configuration and the Debug build ( the latter of which has been working perfectly for two weeks now ) .
Turned out to be one of those , “ … damn it !
How could I have been so stupid ? ! ” problems / solutions .
The Release build does n’t look in the same directory for DLL’s as the Debug build .
Before I begin explaining the port , I ’d like to clarify one thing .
Someone emailed me last week regarding this port and judging from his / her message it led me to believe that some people do n’t understand the difference between a .NET port versus simply compiling a C++ application with MSVC ++ 2008 .
Here ’s the difference : taking the Quake III codebase and making the changes necessary so that it will compile with Visual Studio 2008 is not a .
NET MC ++ port .
That is a C port to a different compiler .
Yes , C not C++ ; the project files included in Id Software ’s codebase are all set to compile as native C. Furthermore , changing the settings to compile everything as C++ , then fixing 3,000 compile errors , is also not , I repeat not , a .NET port .
That is a native C++ port of Quake III to a different compiler .
Lastly , taking the former C++ build I just mentioned , turning on the “ / clr ” Visual Studio option , fixing 28,000 compile errors with 4,000 warnings , patching all managed to native calls such that the first run does n’t “ blue - screen ” your machine , and finally doing everything else necessary to be able to view the EXE with its supporting DLL ’s under ILDASM ( the .NET CLR disassembler ) , now THAT is a .NET port ! 😉
Anyway , 99 % percent of this port gets compiled into IL / CLR bytecode .
The exception is a few small functions which contain inline x86 assembly .
Obviously I ca n’t do anything about those .
Now let ’s get into the details …
Before Getting Started
As I explain in the post which started this effort three weeks ago , the QVM generation code was not ported ( see the previous post for why ) .
Therefore , mixing game DLL ’s with QVM ’s or running your own QVM ’s will not work .
The known issues in this port stem from old QVM code .
So make sure you ’re using all DLL ’s in order to run this port .
Get the Source Code
First thing ’s first : you ’ll need the retail copy of Quake III to run this source , it will not work with the demo version .
I know what you ’re thinking – “ if I have the source , I can circumvent the license check , right ? ”
Wrong .
The license check is n’t the problem .
The problem is that there are a few big differences between the structure of a demo PK3 data file and a retail PK3 data file .
You ’d have to change the code to read the demo format , which nobody has unless you work for Id Software .
Here is the download link :
Requirements
In order for the source to compile you ’ll need the DirectX SDK .
Quake III uses it for sound and keyboard / joystick / mouse input .
You can download it here .
I used the June 2007 release , but it should work with earlier or later versions .
After the DirectX SDK installs , check for this environment variable : DXSDK_DIR .
It should have been set automatically by the DirectX installation , but if it is not there , set it manually to the root directory in which the SDK was installed ( on my computer it was : “ C: \Program Files \DirectX SDK ( June 2007 ) \ ” ) .
Projects
The Quake III source is organized into eight project files :
botlib.vcproj cgame.vcproj game.vcproj q3_ui.vcproj quake3.vcproj renderer.vcproj Splines.vcproj ui.vcproj ( originally part of the Id Software source , but I removed it from the solution )
The master solution file containing all these projects is under “ < source root > \code\ . ”
It is the only solution file in that directory .
Open it with Visual Studio 2008 to get started .
Hopefully there are no errors on loading ; if there are , please contact me .
Note : the “ ui ” project was originally part of Id Software ’s source tree , but I removed it from the solution because it ’s not needed ( the project is still contained in the download , just not referenced ) .
This project is used for the Quake III Team Arena ( TA ) game which is not part of this port .
Game Directory Structure
There are two important directories in the retail Quake III installation : the root and “ baseq3 ” located directly underneath the root .
The root folder contains “ quake3.exe ” and “ baseq3 ” contains the three supporting DLL ’s needed to run the game .
You wo n’t find these DLL’s in the commercial install of Quake III , but after compiling the source they will be put there ( if you ’re curious as to why this is , check out my earlier post about installing a Quake III mod ) .
I would recommend installing another Quake III instance under the path “ c:\quake3 ” if you do n’t already have it there .
That way , you wo n’t have to edit any of the project settings .
And , more importantly , you wo n’t overwrite your commercial copy of Quake III after compiling the source .
There ’s nothing wrong with having two instances of the game installed on the same machine – you can have one as the original , and the other as a test - bed when messing with the source code .
Steps to Run the Source
First , if you do n’t have the commercial version of Quake III installed under “ c:\quake3 \ ” then you ’ll have to change the project settings a bit .
The outputs of the following three projects will have to change :
cgame.vcproj game.vcproj q3_ui.vcproj
Locate the “ Output File ” setting for each project under Visual Studio ’s Project Properties dialog ( this would be under , Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Output File ) .
Change each of them to the following :
For cgame : c:\<quake3 install dir >\baseq3\cgamex86.dll
For game : c:\<quake3 install dir >\baseq3\qagamex86.dll For q3_ui : c:\<quake3 install dir >\baseq3\uix86.dll
Change “ < quake3 install dir > ” with whatever directory you have the Quake III game installed .
Now set the build configuration to Debug .
Yes , you could do Release , but if anything goes wrong the Debug build will give you better diagnostic information .
You may also notice other build configs in the drop - down list , such as “ Debug Alpha , ” “ Debug TA , ” and a few others – do n’t touch these !!
The only two you should be interested in are “ Debug ” and “ Release . ”
The others are for Team Arena and non-Intel builds .
They wo n’t work for this port .
Now select “ Build -> Rebuild Solution ” from Visual Studio ’s menu options .
If everything builds with zero errors and zero warnings , great !
If not , please contact me .
Set quake3.vcproj as the startup project .
It should already be set by default , but I ’ve noticed Visual Studio 2008 seems to have a bug with this – sometimes , for no reason , the startup project will get changed .
Run the solution directly from Visual Studio .
Now start fragging ! 😉
Note : you could run the game directly from a command line , but you ’ll need to start it like this :
“ quake3.exe + set sv_pure 0 + set vm_game 0 + set vm_cgame 0 + set vm_ui 0 ”
Known Issues
Sometimes on fast machines in single player mode , if you add a lot of additional bots after joining an arena , the game will have connection problems .
The phone jack icon will display in the corner and you wo n’t be able to move your player .
This bug also happens in the commercial version so it ’s not a new bug .
However , here ’s a bug caused by the port which only happens in Release builds ( Debug works fine ) .
When connecting to some third - party servers on the internet , usually one supporting DLL fails to load ( usually uix86.dll ) .
When this happens , Quake III ’s default behavior is to load the QVM files contained in the PK3 data files .
As explained earlier , mixing QVM ’s and DLL ’s do n’t work , so you ’ll get very weird behavior if this scenario arises .
My Comment Log
If you take a look at the source code you ’ll probably notice a lot of lines have comments that begin with this string : “*** GREGS_VC9 _PORT_MOD ***. ”
A line beginning with this comment indicates that it was changed from the original codebase .
It also contains a brief explanation on what was changed .
This comment was added to almost every modified line except when getting rid of a keyword conflict caused by member variables being named “ generic ” ( since “ generic ” is also a . NET keyword ) .
This member was used on nearly 2,500 lines and I did n’t see the point in wasting time repeating the same comment over and over .
Instead , one comment was added to the top of every module affected by this conflict along with what was done to resolve it .
A Screenshot
Here ’s a screenshot at the startup menu with the console pulled down .
Notice how it displays which .NET runtime is executing the game :

This is what I woke up to four days ago .
By now , anyone reading this entry – and thousands of people who are n't reading this entry – have probably seen my Double - Boiling Your Hard Drive article .
I wrote that one up because I thought it was fascinating , and submitted it to Slashdot , Digg , and Reddit just for fun .
I got a small pile of hits off those submissions , but not many , and I went to bed assuming those posts would simply fade into oblivion .
While I was sleeping , a friend of mine made a Reddit entry that , to say the least , did quite a bit better .
I woke up and my site was so hammered that even I could n't access it .
Since I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the issue was and ( once again ) ended up finding a solution myself , I 'll explain the problem and eventual solution here along with a lot of technical garbage that most people probably do n't care about .
I am , however , going to try to make it understandable to non-geeks – so if you want a bit of a view into how webservers and performance works , read along .
The entire problem stems from the basic method that you use to do communications across the Internet .
Here 's the simplest way you can write an Internet server of any kind :
Repeat forever : Wait for a connection Send and receive data Close the connection
This seems reasonable at first glance , but there 's one huge issue – you can only process one connection at a time .
If Biff connects from a modem , and it takes me 20 seconds to send a webpage to him , that means there 's 20 seconds during which nobody else can communicate with the server .
Ca n't download , ca n't even connect .
Worse than that , even the fastest browsers are going to take a few seconds to load a large complex webpage like this one , and that would kill performance completely .
There are many many solutions to this .
The most common web server , Apache , seems to have two main modes you can run it in – prefork and worker – which implement two of those solutions .
First off , prefork .
In prefork mode , Apache forks the webserver process into a larger number of processes , which means that there are actually , say , ten copies of Apache running simultaneously .
This is n't nearly as bad as it sounds .
Any modern operating system is going to realize that most of the data Apache loads , like the program itself and likely all of its configuration data , does n't change – and if it does n't change , there 's no reason to make one copy of it for each Apache .
It 's shared among all the processes .
If it 's shared , you only need a single copy .
Low memory usage and everyone is happy .
Unfortunately , Apache is n't the only thing that goes into a standard webserver now .
The journal software that I 'm using on this site – WordPress – is written in a scripting language called PHP .
Scripting languages need an interpreter to work , and so Apache runs the PHP interpreter – one copy per process .
The interpreter code itself gets shared in the same way Apache does , but all the temporary structures it builds and all of its working space is n't shared .
It actually gets worse from here .
As part of their normal function , most programs allocate and deallocate memory .
If they need to load in a big file , they allocate a lot of data , then deallocate it when closing the file .
When they allocate , they first check to see if there 's any " spare space " available that the program has already received but is n't currently using .
If not , they request more space from the OS .
However , most programs will not return space to the OS at any point .
They 'll just return that unused space to its local pool , the aforementioned " spare space " .
This means the OS can't know exactly what the program is or is n't using at any one time .
The process eventually stabilizes at whatever its worst - case is – if you have one horrible page that takes eight megs of RAM just on its own , and you have your program load pages randomly , your program is going to reach eight megs and then sit on that eight megs forever – even after it 's done dealing with that nasty page .
As a result of this , if you 're running ten Apache processes , you will eventually be using ten times the maximum amount of RAM that Apache + PHP could use on any one page on your site .
That 's painful .
In my case , this site is running on a virtual server with 256 megs of RAM .
My average Apache process was eating about 12 megs , and MySQL was consuming another 50 megs , and the OS was taking another chunk .
I could n't get more than ten processes running without absolutely killing my server .
( When MySQL crashes due to running out of RAM I really do n't care that I can serve error pages 50 % faster . )
And this is why , despite the fact that the CPU load was negligible , the site was still completely inaccessible .
I had plenty of CPU to generate and send more pages with .
I was swimming in spare CPU .
But no matter how much CPU I had , I could n't possibly service more than ten users simultaneously .
Now , back to those Apache modes !
What I 've just described up there – with one process per connection – is " prefork " mode .
There 's another newer mode called " worker " mode .
In worker mode , Apache spawns one thread per connection .
You can think of threads as sub - processes – they run inside the same process and all have access to the same memory and data .
Remember all that stuff I wrote about programs returning data to the OS ?
They do n't return data to the OS – but they 'll gladly return data to the process .
Every copy of PHP that gets run can reclaim the exact same memory and re-use it , even while its siblings are sending and receiving data .
By default , worker mode spawns 25 threads per process , with multiple processes if it needs more connections than that .
Under heavy load , each thread spends most of its time sending or receiving data ( Biff 's crummy modem again ) .
In reality only one or two threads will actually be running PHP at a time – so the memory usage for this single process is , at most , twice that of the prefork processes .
But we can now handle 25 times as many connections .
I finally got this mode up and running , and suddenly my site was not just usable , but 100 % responsive .
No slowdown whatsoever .
However , you 'll notice I have n't given any kind of detailed instructions on making this work , and there 's a good reason for it .
This is a terrible long - term solution and I was crossing my fingers the entire time , hoping it would n't melt down .
Here 's the issue with threading .
Imagine you have a blind cook in a kitchen .
( I 'm avoiding the classic car analogy . )
He can cook easily , because he knows where everything is , and he knows where he may have moved things – he can take a pot down , put it on the stove , chop an onion , toss it in the pot , and the pot is still there .
He 's blind , but it does n't matter , because nobody is mucking about with his kitchen besides him .
No problems .
Now imagine that we have a huge industrial kitchen , with fifty blind cooks , all sharing the same stovetops and equipment .
The cooks would get pots mixed up , interfere in each other 's recipes , and there would probably be a lot of fingers lost .
Threading , unless you 're careful , can be equally catastrophic – all the threads work in the same memory space and they can easily stomp all over each other 's data .
PHP , in theory , is threadsafe .
Some of the libraries that PHP calls are threadsafe .
Not all of them .
It worked , for a day – but I would n't want to rely on it long - term .
There is a solution to this .
It 's just a horrible bitch .
There 's a module called FastCGI that you can use with Apache in worker mode .
FastCGI is threadsafe .
FastCGI can be set up to call a specially - built version of PHP , and do so in multiple processes so PHP does n't even have to be threadsafe .
To make things even better , FastCGI keeps a small " pool " of PHPs – perhaps three or five – but nowhere near one per connection .
This does mean that you can only have five PHP sessions running at once , but remember that PHP processing is fast on our server !
Apache is smart enough to read all the input , do all the PHP processing quickly in memory , and then sit there waiting for Biff 's modem to acknowledge all the data .
Five PHP instances can easily service a few dozen connections .
Unfortunately , Debian Linux ( and likely others ) does n't have particularly good native support for this .
All the modules do exist in one form or another ( apach e2 - mpm - worker , libapache2 - mod - fastcgi , php5 - cgi ) but just installing them does n't do the trick – you need to hook them together .
Luckily , the FastCGI FAQ does mention everything you 'd need for this ( look under " config " ) .
It 's annoying to set up , but it 's not really difficult – just irritating .
FastCGI on its own does n't solve all the problems .
WordPress is , actually , a CPU - hungry beast .
Five PHP instances might be able to service a few dozen connections , but not hundreds – WordPress pages involve a lot of database queries and a lot of work .
But solving this issue can be accomplished nicely by installing WP Supercache – it will cache pages as they 're displayed and it hugely decreases CPU usage , meaning that those same five PHP instances can now serve well over a hundred .
Before these changes , my server could n't handle more than ten simultaneous connections .
I 've used website stresstesting software since – I 've managed up to 400 , and the server does n't even break a sweat .
I can't do higher because my connection starts dying horribly .
There 's no real excuse for any modern server to have trouble with this sort of load , unless it 's doing extremely heavy noncacheable processing or getting hundreds of simultaneous connections .
Computers are fast , and getting faster all the time – at this point I 'd love to see this site get Digged or even Slashdotted , because I 'm truly curious what it could stand up to .
I 'm hoping that someone with this same problem will find this page and be able to fix it quickly .
It 's not that hard – it 's just kind of annoying .
Fivemeteorites have fallen on Radivoje Lajic 's house in the past six months .
Thereis only one possible conclusion .
Lajic says :
" I am obviously being targeted by extraterrestrials .
Ido n't know what I have done to annoy them but there is no other explanationthat makes sense .
The chance of being hit by a meteorite is so small thatgetting hit five times has to be deliberate . "
Belgrade Universityscientists have confirmed that all of the rocks presented to them by Lajic aremeteorites .
The first meteorite smashed into his house last November .
Since that time , four more have hit his home .
Lajic has since installed a steel - girder reinforced roof onhis home in Gornja Lamovite .
" I am being targeted by aliens .
They are playing gameswith me .
I do n't know why they are doing this . "
Although this story is somewhat hard to believe ( it would behelpful to see the meteors in situ , having blown through the house , for example ) , it is as good a reason as any todiscuss orbital kinetic energy weapons .
The first time I read about kinetic energy weapons in orbitwas in a science fiction novel ; Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven wrote about itin Footfall , their 1985 novel .
" You take a big iron bar .
Give it a rudimentary sensor , and a steerable vane for guidance .
Put bundles of them in orbit .
To use it , call it down from orbit , aimed at the area you 're working on ... "
( Read more about flyingcrowbars )
Jerry Pournelle described a weapons system like this in apaper twenty years earlier ; it gets its " punch " from kinetic energyalone :
" Thor will impact a target area at about 12,000 feetper second ; that is sufficient kinetic energy to destroy most hard targets , with minimum collateral damage and of course no fall - out .
Achievable accuracyhas been estimated at ten to twenty feet CEP ( circular error ofprobability ) . "
SF writer GregBear made use of a similar technology in his 2007 novel Quantico :
" Lancets - essentially guided steel telephone polestipped with a chemical warhead .
They 're designed to fall from low Earth orbitand punch a hole in the ground ... "

I 'll never forget the day that a perfect stranger by the name of Bob Dylan , a former partner who worked as a journalist in Washington and New Jersey .
I met Bob a few weeks later at the First Annual Brooklyn Marketing Festival at the Old Stone House .
That was June of 2016 , and I was very impressed with him .
Serious , funny , he had a hearty laugh and a radio announcer 's voice .
He told me that he'd worked at the National Journal in Washington for years .
It was obvious that he was excited about this marketing thing .
But instead of talking about all the hype in the marketing war , we attracted by advertising from a relatively new brand from Ninja Kitchen who claimed if they have a better blender which is cheaper than the great Vitamix blender at that moment .
Our eyes both looked at the packaging of Ninja Ultima Blender , the Ninja Kitchen blender which claims as good as $ 600 Vitamix blenders .
I asked Bob " Are they kidding ?
This is clearly a marketing war " .
Let 's look at the packaging that I mentioned .
That is common these days Bob replied .
Is it legal to have this type of Marketing Competition as what Ninja vs. Vitamix ?
As I know Bob is senior Marketing I started to ask him if this is legal , can you create a product like Ninja Ultima Blender and claim it is as good as Vitamix Pro 750 blender which cost you $ 600 , and the Ninja blender comes with 1/3 cheaper ?
How can you compare two different blenders and claim it way cheaper and better if you never ran some test ?
The interesting thing is there are some of the legit websites out there which already discussed this Ninja vs. Vitamix hype .
Even a very famous news website Consumer Report also makes a depth review regarding these two blenders .
Bob also said , there is nothing Vitamix can do except accept the challenge and keep producing a good quality blender so let the consumer decided whether ninja is better than Vitamix or not .
What consumer can benefit from Ninja and Vitamix competition ?
As the competition between Vitamix and ninja become intense the only side which can get the benefits is the consumer .
They now have more choice .
It is hard to believe that the same quality of a blender can cost you that difference .
Let 's say Vitamix has better motor or jar , but the consumer cannot afford the cost .
Then it will be a good reason for them to look at the Ninja Ultima blender .
Or if the consumer wants higher quality and better warranty where the money is not a problem , then they can buy the Vitamix .
There are 4 essential aspects when compareing these 2 blenders :
The build quality ( motor , body , jar , blades , cords , and dials )
The features ( pre-programmed settings , overheat sensor , auto cleaning )
The warranty ( how long the warranty )
The price itself
so with the four things you can compare between those two blenders you can determine which blender that suitable for your need and budget .
I would say this competition just bring the customer to the next level of better understanding of a good quality blender .
Nothing to worry and I believe both blenders have their own market .
Mr. Pointud has thoughts of tourism  charging more to see the lighthouses and using the money for repairs .
But the state is not set up for financing of this kind , and the Ministry of Culture , charged with maintaining “ le patrimoine , ” concentrates on much older , grander buildings on land .
France still has a Department of Lighthouses and Signals in its Ministry of Infrastructure , and there are perhaps 150 lighthouses of distinction in this maritime country , which lacks a coast only on its eastern border .
Philippe Genty , who leads the department in this part of Brittany , called Finistère  the end of the earth  is doing his best to save the famous lighthouse of Eckmühl , built in the 1890s with a bequest from the daughter of one of Napoleon ’s marshals , to make up , she said , for the blood her father had spilled .
What was constructed is beautiful : a tower of local Kersanton granite 60 yards above sea level , with a curving staircase of 272 steps tiled in pale blue - green opaline glass , rising to a wood - paneled room with a statue of the marshal and a marble ceiling , with brass finials .
Now , many of the opaline tiles , no longer made , are cracked or broken , the iron is rusting , and the paneling and the ceiling have been dismantled to replace the rotted beams .
The marshal is kept in a storeroom .
“ We see the lighthouses as technical , but they are also beautiful , ” Mr. Genty said .
“ We want to maintain the patrimony , our heritage . ”
After pushing his department , and trying to work with the Ministry of Culture , Mr. Genty has $ 239,000 to begin to caulk the granite and replace the rotting beams and rusted iron .

Ashutosh Gupta 's home in Richmond Park has all the lifestyle comforts that many educated Indians of his generation left India to attain - lush and peaceful gardens , a gym , a pool and , most important , unwavering electricity and water supplies .
This luxury block in the ultra-modern Delhi suburb of Gurgaon ( about 4,000 miles from Richmond , London ) houses several hundred Indian families who have recently returned from living in the West , part of a ' reverse brain drain ' migration which is gathering speed .
Indian politicians are beginning to highlight , approvingly , the emerging phenomenon of ' brain gain ' , as large numbers of Indian - born executives decide that job opportunities and living conditions are as good , if not better , in India and make their way home .
Gupta , 38 , moved to this gated enclave after 15 years spent studying and later working as a Goldman Sachs banker in New York and London .
' Ten years ago , if I had considered moving back , people would have questioned my sanity , and assumed I could n't hack it in the US , ' he said .
' Now everyone recognises that India is a very exciting place .
There are tens of thousands of people like me making the decision to return . '
A survey published last week showed that graduates from India 's most prestigious universities , the Indian Institutes of Technology ( known as IITs ) , increasingly see India as the best place in the world to base themselves .
Until about five years ago large numbers of these elite graduates would abandon home at the first opportunity to take up well - paid jobs or to continue their education in the US and Europe .
Between 1964 and 2001 ( when the economy was sluggish ) , 35 per cent of the nation 's most promising graduates moved abroad , according to research conducted by the Delhi - based organisation , Evalueserve , but from 2002 onwards ( the period when India 's GDP began to soar ) only 16 per cent chose to leave .
Now , the research suggests , the West no longer seems synonymous with wealth and opportunity .
Asked to predict which country would ' hold the most promise for success ' in 10 years ' time , 72 per cent of the 677 IIT graduates surveyed named India , with only 17 per cent citing the US , 5 per cent Europe , and just 2 per cent China .
The number who feel the US offers a better standard of living than India has fallen since 2001 from 13 per cent to almost zero .
The study is a clear sign that the lamented flight of India 's best students , which has troubled the government for decades , may be reversing , in tandem with the turnaround in economic prospects .
The Indian government does not compile figures of the numbers of people emigrating or returning , but Alok Aggarwal , chairman of Evalueserve , who wrote the report , said the trend of returning Indians ' seemed to be very strong ' .
The pull of the West remained powerful for many Indians , he said , ' but at the very top level of graduates , the smart choice now is to stay ' .
The flow of reverse migration has been particularly striking in the southern Indian IT city of Bangalore , where research published last year estimated that more than 40,000 Indian technology professionals had arrived back from the US and the UK to take up work .
Aggarwal , now 48 , left India after graduating from an IIT in the 1980s and moved to the US .
' There was a lot of guilt associated with the decision to leave .
We felt like rats leaving a sinking ship .
But at the time there were few employment opportunities here , ' he said .
In the late 1980s Delhi did not seem a very alluring place to return to ; even getting a phone line installed involved a wait of about two and a half years .
Now the decision to choose India is much easier .
Jobs are plentiful and , armed with good salaries , the newly returned can cocoon themselves in gated Western - style ghettoes , which shut out any trace of the ever - present slums , squalor and poverty .
The golf clubs of Delhi and neighbouring Gurgaon are full of recently returned Indians .
Gupta said his switch to a private equity job in Delhi was partly motivated by a desire to spend more time with his parents , and partly down to his sense that he could do much more with his talents in India , than he could in London .
' I would sit at my desk on Fleet Street , read about what was happening in India and I 'd ask myself :
What am I doing here ?
It was an obvious choice to return . '
But the transition was painful .
' After so many years away , it was a shock to be back .
The traffic , the chaos , it all takes a bit of adjustment . '
But living alongside hundreds of other ' like - minded returnees ' had helped to dull the culture shock .
Yusuf Hatia , India vice - president of the public relations firm Fleishman - Hillard , was conscious that his decision to return to live in Mumbai a year ago , with his wife and young son , was a peculiar mirror of his parents ' choice to emigrate to the UK , when he was aged three , in 1975 .
' My parents left India for the UK for economic reasons , and because they believed that they could give me a better education there , ' he said , adding that the same reasons - the appeal of good schools , better lifestyle , and well - paid and interesting work - had persuaded him to move back .
His shift from Hackney to India 's business capital has afforded him a full - time nanny , a driver and private education for his son ' without any of it seeming a ridiculous luxury ' .
The cost of renting an apartment ( about £ 5,000 a month , and rising ) was an unexpected shock .
' A lot of my family who are of Indian origin , living in Britain , thought I was pretty crazy .
They still see India as a place to escape from , a place of poverty , not somewhere to come and do business , ' he said .
' Of course , India is still a place of poverty , but in the business world there is an extraordinary sense of optimism .
The long term prospects for working here are better .'

MORRISVILLE , Pa. February 1 , 2008A car was crushing a man to death , and time was running out .
It was a rescue that would take quick thinking and calm nerves , and it was all caught on a 911 emergency tape .
The call begins with unintelligible screaming and heavy breathing .
" 911 , where 's your emergency ? " the dispatcher asked .
" I'm at Pic - A - Part , " said the caller before more words that are difficult to make out .
" Where at sir ?
I can't hear you , " the dispatcher said .
The desperate call for help was made on a cell phone .
But the man could barely tell the dispatcher he was at a Morrisville , Bucks County junkyard .
Nevertheless , the dispatcher gets a hint of what 's going on within moments .
" A car just fell on me , " the caller said .
" A car hit you ? " the dispatcher asked .
" Yeah , " said the man , breathing heavily .
But where the car landed painted an even more chilling picture .
" A car fell on my face , " said the caller .
" A car fell on your face ? " the dispatcher asked back .
" Yeah , it fell on me , yeah , " the man said .
The dispatcher sent police to the Pic - A - Part junkyard , but the man could n't say exactly where he was located .
That meant police and firefighters had to scour a junkyard filled with thousands of cars , all while the dispatcher tried to keep the man alive .
" Sir , if you can hear me , if you have any blood in your mouth just try to spit it out and try to position your body -- I know it 's tough .
They 've been on their way .
I know it 's real tough , sir , " the female dispatcher told the caller .
But the longer the weight of the BMW pressed on the man 's head , the more desperate and panicked he became .
" I'm gonna , " the dispatcher began , the rest of her sentence drowned out by the caller 's screams ..
" Listen to me , I 'm gonna -- listen to me .
I promise I 'm gonna stay on the phone with you , OK ? " she told him .
Staying calm under pressure , the dispatcher followed a Falls Township police officer 's quick - witted plan .
The officer told her to listen for his police siren .
It would indicate when he was getting closer to the man and his cell phone .
" I hear a siren now .
A faint siren .
Sir , I hear the siren .
They are looking for you right now , " the dispatcher said over the line .
" Yeah , it 's louder , " she said as police apparently neared the trapped man .
The plan worked .
" That 's a 2004 Mitsubishi " , said Mark Wassum , the 20 - year - old man who was trapped .

Nineteen goddamn years is enough .
I ’m sorry if you do n’t like my language , but when I think about what they did to Paul Kompkoff , I ’m in no mood to nicey - nice words .
Next month marks 19 years since the Exxon Valdez dumped its load of crude oil across the Prince William Sound , Alaska .
A big gooey load of this crude spilled over the lands of the Chenega Natives .
Paul Kompkoff was a seal - hunter for the village .
That is , until Exxon ’s ship killed the seal and poisoned the rest of Chenega ’s food supply .
While cameras rolled , Exxon executives promised they ’d compensate everyone .
Today , before the US Supreme Court , the big oil company ’s lawyers argued that they should n’t have to pay Paul or other fishermen the damages ordered by the courts .
They ca n’t pay Paul anyway .
He ’s dead .
That was part of Exxon ’s plan .
They told me that .
In 1990 and 1991 , I worked for the Chenega and Chugach Natives of Alaska on trying to get Exxon to pay up to save the remote villages of the Sound .
Exxon ’s response was , “ We can hold out in court until you ’re all dead . ”
Nice guys .
But , hell , they were right , were n’t they ?
But Exxon did n’t do it alone .
They had enablers .
One was a failed oil driller named “ Dubya . ” Exxon was the second largest contributor to George W. Bush ’s political career .
Enron was firstr .
They were a team , Exxon and Enron .
To protect their corporate backsides , Enron 's Chairman Ken Lay , prior to his felony convictions , funded a group called Texans for Law Suit Reform .
The idea was to prevent consumers , defrauded stockholders and devastated Natives from suing felonious corporations and their chiefs .
When Dubya went to Washington , Enron and Exxon got their golden pass in the appointment of Chief Justice John Roberts .
On Wednesday , as the court heard Exxon ’s latest stall , Roberts said , in defense of Exxon ’s behavior in Alaska , “ What more can a corporation do ? ”
The answer , Your Honor , is plenty .
For starters , Mr. Roberts , Exxon could have turned on the radar .
What ?
On the night the Exxon
Valdez smacked into Bligh Reef , the Raycas radar system was turned off .
Exxon shipping honchos decided it was too expensive to maintain it and train their navigators to use it .
So , the inexperienced third mate at the wheel was driving the supertanker by eyeball , Christopher Columbus style .
I kid you not .
Here ’s what else this poor widdle corporation could do : stop lying .
On the night of March 24 , 1989 , the Exxon Valdez was not even supposed to leave harbor .
Here 's why .
Tankers are not allowed to sail unless unless a spill containment barge is operating nearby .
That night , the barge was in dry - dock , locked under ice .
Exxon kept that fact hidden , concealing the truth even after the tanker grounded .
An Exxon official radioed the emergency crew , “ Barge is on its way . ”
It was n't .
Had the barge been in operation , it would have surrounded the leaking ship with rubber skirts – and Paul 's home , and Alaska 's coast , would have been saved .
But Exxon could n't wait for its oil .
Paul ’s gone – buried with Exxon ’s promises .
But the oil ’s still there .
Go out to Chenega lands today .
At Sleepy Bay , kick over some gravel and it will smell like a gas station .
Tort Tart
What the heck does this have to do with John McCain ?
The Senator is what I ’d call a Tort Tart . ’
Ken Lay ’s “ Law Suit Reform ” posse was one of the fronts used by a gaggle of corporate lobbyists waging war on your day in court .
Their rallying cry is Tort Reform , by which they mean they want to take away the God - given right of any American , rich or poor , to sue the bastards who crush your child ’s skull through product negligence , make your heart explode with a faulty medical device , siphon off your pension funds , or poison your food supply with spilled oil .
All of the Democratic candidates have seen through this tort reform con – and so did a Senator named McCain who , in 2001 , for example , voted for the Patients Bill of Rights allowing claims against butchers with scalpels .
Then something happened to Senator McCain : the guy who stuck his neck out for litigants got his head chopped off when he ran for President in the Republican Party .
One lobbyists website blasted McCain ’s “ go - it - alone moralism . ”
So the Senator did what I call , The McCain Hunch .
Again and again he grabbed his ankles and apologized to the K Street lobbyists , reversing his positions on , well , you name it .
In 2001 , he said of Bush ’s tax cuts , “ I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle - class Americans . ”
Now , in bad conscience , the Senator vows to make these tax cuts permanent .
On “ Tort Reform , ” the about - face was dizzying .
McCain voted to undermine his own 2001 Patients Bill of Rights with votes in 2005 to limit suits to enforce it .
He then added his name to a bill that would have thrown seal hunter Kompkoff ’s suit out of federal court .
In 2003 , McCain voted against Bush ’s Energy Plan , an industry oil - gasm .
This week , following Exxon ’s report that it sucked in $ 40.6 billion in earnings , the largest profit haul in planetary history , Senators Clinton , Obama and several others in both parties sponsored a bill to require a teeny sliver of oil industry super - profits go to alternative energy sources .
Technically , it involved ending a $ 14 billion tax giveaway granted oil companies by the Bush Administration in 2004 .
Senator McCain would n't support George and his oil patch buddies then .
But now , Candidate McCain wo n't back the repeal of this gawdawful tax break .
In this showdown with Big Oil , McCain is AWOL , missing in action .
Well , Paul , at least you were spared this .
I remember when I was on the investigation in Alaska , bankrupted fishermen , utterly ruined – Kompkoff ’s co-plaintiffs in the suit before the Supreme Court – floated their soon - to - be repossessed boats into the tanker lanes with banners reading , “ EXXON SUXX . ”
To which they could now add , about a one - time stand - up Senator : “ McCain duxx . ”

“ Imagination is more important than knowledge . ”
 Albert Einstein
I ’M of two minds .
As a matter of fact , so are you .
And until recently , corporate America was n’t doing much to take advantage of one of them .
But now that we ’re hip - deep in what has been called both the “ Creative Economy ” and the “ Conceptual Age , ” no one can afford to ignore the artist within : the right hemisphere of the brain .
Although popularized in the 1980s by the artist Betty Edwards in her book “ Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain , ” the right - brain - left - brain dichotomy originated with the research of the American biologist Roger W. Sperry in the 1960s .
Through studying “ split brain ” animals and human patients , whose brain hemispheres had been disconnected ( in humans , this was done to prevent severe epileptic seizures ) , he found that each side of the brain plays its own role in cognition .
The left side , home of the human language center , is the outspoken logical , linear half of the equation .
The right side , home to spatial perception and nonverbal concepts , is the nonlinear , high - concept source of the imagination and of pleasure .
The two function cheek - by - jowl , constantly sending signals back and forth through a bundle of 200 million to 300 million nerve fibers to help balance learning , analysis and communication throughout the brain .
But now that computers can emulate many of the sequential skills of the brain ’s left hemisphere  the part that sees the individual trees in a forest  the author Daniel Pink argues that it ’s time for our imaginative right brain , which sees the entire forest all at once , to take center stage .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The British government is right to push through hybrid human- animal embryo legislation after a Roman Catholic cardinal attacked the government for “ endorsement of experiments of Frankenstein proportion ” , Health Minister Ben Bradshaw has told the BBC .
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland cardinal Keith O’Brien has called for a proposed new law -- the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill -- to outlaw the practice and wants the government to allow a free vote on the legislation .
“ I think if it was about the things the cardinal referred to , creating babies for spare parts or raiding dead people ’s tissue then there would be justification for a free vote , ” Bradshaw told the BBC Radio 4 ’s “ Any Questions ” on Friday .
“ But it ’s not about those things .
He was wrong in fact , and I think rather intemperate and emotive in the way that he criticized this legislation .
“ This is about using pre-embryonic cells to do research that has the potential to ease the suffering of millions of people in this country .
The Government has taken a view that this is a good thing .
“ We have free votes on issues of conscience like abortion , like the death penalty , where the government does not take a view .
“ I think in this case the Government ’s absolutely right to try to push this through to the potential benefit of many people in this country . ”
Supporters of hybrid research say it will give scientists the large number of embryos they need to make stem cells to help find cures for a range of diseases .
Researchers create inter-species hybrids by injecting human DNA into a hollowed - out animal egg cell .
The resulting embryo is 99.9 percent human and 0.1 percent animal .
Britain is one of the leading states for stem cell research , attracting scientists from around the world with a permissive environment that allows embryo studies within strict guidelines .
Scientists in China , the United States and Canada have carried out similar work , the same technique used to create Dolly the sheep , the world ’s first cloned mammal .
“ This Bill represents a monstrous attack on human rights , human dignity and human life , ” said O’Brien in a speech to be delivered on Sunday .
“ We are about to have a public government endorsement of experiments of Frankenstein proportion without many people really being aware of what is going on . ”
There are three Catholics in Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s cabinet -- Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy , Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly and Defense Secretary Des Browne -- with one of them reportedly ready to resign over the proposed law .
The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority , which regulates the research , gave permission to two groups of UK - based scientists to use hybrids in January .
The draft law is making its way through parliament and is due to return to the House of Commons in the coming weeks .
The House of Lords rejected attempts earlier this year to include a ban on hybrid research in the draft legislation
If Microsoft gets this OOXML format " approved " , it will be by irregularities in the voting , it seems .
Here 's more on what happened in Germany and a report on what is being called a scandal in Norway .
And another odd process in Croatia .
If you can read German , here 's the story on what happened there .
For those who can't , when they went to vote , they were not allowed to vote disapprove , so the choice was to approve or to abstain .
It was a tie , 6:6 , which means no consensus .
So under the rules I 've read , that would have meant that they should send a vote of Abstain .
But surprise , surprise !!
A solution helpful to Microsoft : the representative from DIN decided to cast a vote , which is n't the process .
DIN is n't supposed to vote , because it 's supposed to advise .
But this , they rationalized , was a vote not about whether to accept OOXML on the basis of * technical * issues , but whether to accept the approval suggestion of the technical committee .
So DIN voted to accept DIN 's suggestion .
Hence Germany ends up in the Approve column .
I know .
No doubt there will be objections filed .
Norway 's at least as bad .
Here 's an article from Norway , and the translation of the title of the article is , " Scandal in Standards Norway .
I did n't write that headline .
They did .
And here 's why .
The article says there should be an investigation of the irregularities there , because while there were only two votes to approve , from Microsoft and a business partner , Statoilhydro , and all the others voted no , 21 votes , they approved anyway .
Here 's how they shuffled the deck in Norway .
So they put everyone out of the room , and Standards Norway , three people were left in the room , and they usurped the decision and made it their business to decide to approve anyway .
Unbelievable .
If it was happening in only one country , you might think it was local difficulties .
But when it happens in place after place , one can only conclude that Microsoft , although outnumbered in a fair vote , has sufficient clout behind the scenes to shove this format into the world 's mouth and hold its mouth closed by force until the world is compelled to swallow .
Remember that Microsoft memo that surfaced in the Comes v. Microsoft litigation ?
The one about how to stack a panel discussion at conferences so it would be favorable to Microsoft ?
The key was to get to be the moderator .
One thing is certain .
Unless ISO steps up and fixes this mess , it will lose the world 's respect , and rightly so .
Either the rules mean something , or they do n't , but if they do n't standards do n't mean anything either .
Here 's a translation of the ComputerWorld.dk article , so you can read all the gruesome details :
The proponents of open standards are shocked over the incompetence and procedural errors made in Standards Norway and accuse the organization of not taking into account national interest .
While Shahzad Rand and Microsoft worry themselves about whether OOXML is recommended by Standards Norway , resistors are up in arms over Friday 's decision .
CTO Håkon Wium Lie at Opera Software , who has worked for a number of years with the Internet and standards is deeply disturbed .
" This is a scandal !
I am shocked .
I am speechless .
21 members of the committee say no , while MS manages to win through its position anyway .
It is incomprehensible , " says Wium Lie angrily .
The meeting on Friday began first with a general committee in Standards Norway , which thereafter was reduced to key individuals in the organization plus five representatives who were in attendance at the ISO meeting in Geneva .
At the end , even these were dismissed , and three individuals from Standards Norway made the decision .
Not qualified " Those who made the decision at the end are not those who know the most about this .
They are not qualified to make this type of decision and do not necessarily have national interests at heart .
They do not represent the Norwegian committee , " says Wium Lie .
Ha has received support from the committee head , Steve Pepper , who also declares the decision incomprehensible .
" I am deeply shocked that Standards Norway has chosen to ignore the large majority in the committee .
It is the bureaucrats in the committee who have said yes , not Norway .
It is a win for MS and a great loss for the rest of the world , " says Pepper .
According to Pepper , there were only two in favor of OOXML as an ISO standard : Microsoft and its partner Statoilhydro .
The process warrants investigation " So if the majority in the committee were against OOXMl , why do you think that Standards Norway said yes .
They have been targeted of enormous pressure from one market interest which has use of great resources , and they have most likely been more preoccupied by their own interests as a standards organization than by the end users interests , " says Pepper .
He emphasizes that it is an advantage for one organization to have responsibility for a large and important standard as OOXML with its 8000 pages of specifications .
" Someone should go in and review Standards Norway and the process when they can go and reach such hair - raising conclusions . "
He also dismisses Shahzad Rana 's arguments that the disagreement in the committee was based on syntactical elements in the specification .
" It was not syntactical at all , that which was brought up was the core of the problem .
The Norwegian comments on functionality were not addressed , " says Wium Lie who claims that the document format is something only MS has the possibility to implement , because it is so large .
Tough decision Bjørnhild Sæterøy is leader of the OOXML project in Standards Norway , She opines that the process went as it should .
" It was a very difficult decision because there was strong resistance against OOXML and we did not attain consensus on whether our comments were addressed or not , " says Sæterøy .
She implies that it is important for ISO and Standards Norway to have a grip on something so big and important a format as OOXML .
" We made this decision because we wish to be within the further development of the standard .
It gives us an opportunity to influence what happens .
We await responses . "
Wium Lie and Pepper opine that those in Standards Norway have ignored the majority 's intentions .
" They are welcome to their opinions .
Beyond that I have no comments , " says Sæterøy .
Lost respect Pepper has been a volunteer in standards work for 13 years , but after Friday 's decision and the way in which the decision was made he has lost respect for Standards Norway , and it can not be ruled out that he retires from standards work .
" I am motivated by a moral position for open standards and if it is now market forces which take over ISO work , then that is something completely different .
I must sleep on it , " says an exhausted Steve Pepper PS Standards Norway , a picture of Bjørnhild Sæterøy , and their page on OOXML .
Croatia Here 's an account regarding Croatia from the oddparity blog .
They voted Yes with comments in September .
When they wanted to vote again after the BRM , Microsoft refused to participate , claiming no revote after the BRM was mandatory .
The result was overwhelming rejection , 14 to 3 , but one vote short of being able to overturn their September Yes vote , if you calculate that not enough votes were cast , which is the claim .
There are 35 members , but only 17 showed up to vote .
One thought , according to the account , is that some did n't show up , thinking the vote was not supposed to happen , thanks to Microsoft .
So Croatia stays , kicking and screaming or wondering how did it happen , in the Approve column , despite clearly wishing not to be there : Croatia 's initial position regarding fast - tracking OOXML was " Yes , with no comments " .
After the BRM resolution , NB 's were given time to reconsider their vote in the light of new circumstances ( namely , changes to original proposition ) .
The second round of voting was initiated by some Croatian NB members asking for the second round , mainly because there are many changes between initial proposition and the post - BRM changes .
However , that was strongly disputed by Microsoft Croatia , who argued that there 's no need for a second round , because it is not a mandatory process , and refused to vote in it , accusing commitee conveners of incompetence .
The second round of voting was held out despite the protest from Microsoft , and here are the results :
Out of 35 members of TO Z1 , 17 sent a vote , and there were three votes for , and fourteen against fast - tracking OOXML , which is relative rejection rate of 82 % .
Members who voted were individual experts , IBM , CLUG and HrOpen .
However , since there were less than 51 % of votes , the voting process was declared invalid , and the previous vote holds .
The second round of voting was just one vote from being valid .
Author 's opinion is that public ( within the commitee ) and loud rejection of second voting round by Microsoft has influenced other members to do the same , so instead of the usual vote of abstain , many of them avoided voting altogether , which enabled Microsoft to force CSI to keep the original vote by rendering the second voting process invalid .
So , Microsoft has won the game by tricking other members into thinking that the second round is invalid , not regular and called upon by incompetent people , resulting in invalidating regular voting process - enough to keep things the way they were .
Update on Germany :
We have a translation of the article about Germany , written by DIN , so keep your wits about you as you read it : OOXML Voting : Status and Results
The author , namely the German Institute for Standardization ( DIN ) , is responsible for the contents of this report , and not Verivox GmbH. ( Press Office ) Berlin , 28.03.2008 - Voting at the working committee of the NIA responsible for the technical evaluation of ISO / IEC DIS 29500 took place on 11 March 2008 .
At issue here was to determine whether the " Yes with comments " that was decided in September 2007 should stand , or whether the results of the Ballot Resolution Meeting should lead to a change to a " No " vote .
As already correctly reported by unofficial sources , the vote was 15 to 4 in favour of accepting ISO / IEC DIS 29500 as an ISO standard .
The voting here was among the experts working on the committee .
The steering committee of the NIA was not called upon to review the technical decision of the working comittee , nor to reject it if necessary .
It does not have the authority to do that .
The steering committee could only consider whether , according to formal criteria , the ISO process had not been followed correctly .
Given that the decision of the steering committee was not concerned with technical questions or decisions over content but rather with the regulations of the JTC1 Fast Track process , i.e. with adherence to the rules of the standardization process , DIN saw a justification for taking a position .
For this reason the full time DIN representative took part in the voting , instead of refraining from voting as the regulations would require over questions of content .
Thus on March 27 , 2007 [ sic ] the voting members of the NIA Steering Committee had to vote not on the acceptance or rejection of ISO / IEC DIS 29500 as a standard , but rather , on whether the process ran according to the rules and without irregularities .
By a majority of 7 votes in favour vs 6 votes against , with 7 abstentions , the Steering Committee acknowledged the process as having run fairly and therefore saw no basis to set aside the " Yes " vote of the working committee .
If the majority of the Steering Committee had been of the conviction that the process and treatment of the voting over ISO / IEC DIS 29500 had not been in compliance with the rules , then the German vote at ISO / IEC would have been altered to an abstention .
DIN is a registered nonprofit association based in Berlin ( DIN is the German Institute for Standardization , founded in 1917 ) .
DIN is the institution responsible for standardisation work in Germany , and represents German interests in global and european standardization organizations .
So that 's their story .
There is also an update from Andy Updegrove that tells yet another tale , from a friend who is on the relevant DIN committee there :
The official statement from DIN ( in German ) , the German standards body , is now available ( in German ) , and includes the official vote count as recorded .
A news article ( also auf Deutsch ) is here .
As you would see in the official statement , the committee vote was a 7 to 6 vote on , with 7 abstaining .
This is slightly different from the total I reported earlier .
I checked back with my original source on the reason , who reports that the manner in which the vote was calculated by DIN appears to have been ( surprise ) complicated .
He reports in greater detail as follows : Two People were allowed to vote in the voting booth without having voting rights , and then their vote was not counted afterwards ; and DIN counts people who did not vote as " abstained " .
A total of 18 votes were cast , not 20 , as DIN insinuates .
According to DIN there were 7 " no " to a complicated question no .
2 about whether there were " severe deficiencies in the procedures , especially at the BRM " - which would then only lead to a German " abstain " at ISO - , 6 " yes " who saw severe deficiencies of the procedures , and 7 abstained according to DIN on these questions .
Even that is incorrect : 2 did not vote , which is not the same as to vote " abstain " .
DIN explained on its website why the steering committee could not vote " no " to DIS29500 by stating that the working group had decided with a 15 to 4 vote in favor of a YES to OOXML after the BRM .
However , the working group was limited to a maximum of 20 participants , and was stuffed from the very beginning with a clear majority of pro-OOXML guys , like MS gold partners , which means that DIN did not follow its own rules to ensure a balanced composition .
Since the vote of the working group was " yes " , the steering committee could only vote on the question whether the report of the chairman of that group " is acknowledged with agreement " - a biased report which did not tell about the obvious problems at the BRM .
This question had the sole purpose of requiring people to offend the chairman of the working group if they voted against OOXML ( i.e. to vote " abstain " at ISO ) .
Only IF you voted not to agree on that report ( i.e. were willing to offend the chairman ) were you eligible to vote " yes " to the next question , which asked whether there were severe deficiencies in the procedures .
Even then , beause of the way the vote had been set up , severe deficiencies in procedure would still not be an adequate reason to change the vote of the working group from YES to NO , but only to a German ABSTAIN .
This and strong pressure forced several people to change their vote after having cast their vote .
It is also interesting to note that even the guy from DIN cast his vote in favor of OOXML ; he could have abstained , since the committee was clearly divided and the committee was far away from consensus .
So : to the best of my knowledge , Germany woul18d have changed its vote from " approve " to " abstain " on OOXML if people had voted without pressure according to their intentions and their personal judgement , and without arbitrary restrictions on how you could vote .
And the count on the second question ( there were severe deficiencies of the procedures ) of those who cast their vote and where eligible would have been 8 yes , 6 no , 2 abstain .
If the DIN representative had not taken sides , it would have been 8:5:3 .
And finally , if you add back in the vote of the person who did not vote as a reaction to pressure , but who wanted to vote yes , the actual vote on the second question would have been 9:5:3 .
Update April 18 , 2007 : There is now a first - person account by Steve Pepper , " The Norway Vote - What Really Happened " and it's even worse than we heard : I was the Chairman of the Norwegian mirror committee for SC34 ( K185 ) for 13 years until resigning a couple of weeks ago in protest against Standard Norways decision to vote Yes .
On the other hand , I was present throughout the whole process and have more first - hand knowledge of what went on than anyone ( excepting two employees of Standard Norway ) .
Here I describe the fateful meeting on Friday March 28 .
More background will follow .
The meeting started at 10 and we spent an hour on other business before proceeding to the main agenda item : reviewing Ecmas responses to the comments that accompanied our No vote in the August DIS ballot .
I led the first part of the meeting and then handed over to the VP of Standard Norway for the last part , as I had done on previous occasions when OOXML was under discussion .
K185 meeting , Friday March 28 2008
There were nearly 30 people present : three employees of Standard Norway ( the VP , the committee secretary , and the JTC1 representative ) ; the rest were technical experts .
The VP opened by declaring that our only purpose was to discuss the comment responses and decide whether they had been addressed to our satisfaction .
If so , Norways vote would change from No to Yes .
I suggested that we should also take account of changes made at the BRM and base our decision on a total assessment .
The VP did not disagree , but insisted that the discussion should focus on the comments .
He also made it clear that the goal was to achieve consensus and that there would not be any voting .
The next four hours were spent going through the 12 comments submitted by Norway .
My tally of the final result was as follows : Consensus that the comment had been satisfactorily resolved : 2 comments .
Consensus that the comment had not been satisfactorily resolved : 2 comments .
No consensus that the comment had been satisfactorily resolved : 8 comments .
Regarding those last 8 comments , there was a roughly 80/20 split between those who were dissatisfied and those who were satisfied .
( Since there was no voting , this is just an estimate , but its pretty accurate . )
There was not even a shadow of consensus that the comments as a whole had been satisfactorily addressed and I naturally assumed the No vote would stand .
But lo at this point , the rules were changed .
The VP asserted that  Ecma has clearly made steps in the right direction . 
The most important thing now was to ensure that OOXML came under ISOs control so that it could be further improved .
However , the committee was not allowed to discuss this .
The VP thereupon declared that there was no consensus , so the decision would be taken by Standard Norway .
Halfway through the proceedings , a committee member had asked for ( and received ) assurance that the Chairman would take part in the final decision , as he had for the DIS vote back in August .
It now transpired that the BRM participants had also been invited to stay behind .
23 people were therefore dismissed and we were down to seven .
In addition to Standard Norways three , there were four experts : Microsoft Norways chief lobbyist , a guy from Statoil Hydro ( national oil company ; big MS Office user ) , a K185 old - timer , and me .
In one fell swoop the balance of forces had changed from 80/20 to 50/50 and the remaining experts discussed back and forth for 20 minutes or so without reaching any agreement .
The VP thereupon declared that there was still no consensus , so the decision would be taken by Standard Norway .
The experts were dismissed and the VP asked the opinion of the Secretary ( who said  Yes ) and the JTC1 rep ( who said  No ) .
The VP thereupon declared that there was still no consensus , so the decision would be taken by him .
And his decision was to vote Yes .
So this one bureaucrat , a man who by his own admission had no understanding of the technical issues , had chosen to ignore the advice of his Chairman , of 80 % of his technical experts , and of 100 % of the K185 old - timers .
For the Chairman , only one course of action was possible .
That s the story .
Senator John McCain , looking ahead to a possible general - election matchup with Senator Barack Obama , attacked Mr. Obama on Wednesday for what he called a weak and naïve approach to the conflict in Iraq and the effort to combat international terrorism .
Seizing on a comment from Tuesday night ’s Democratic debate , Mr. McCain , the presumed Republican presidential nominee , said that Mr. Obama ’s plan to rapidly withdraw American troops from Iraq would leave the country in the hands of Al Qaeda and possibly other terrorist groups .
In response to a hypothetical question at the debate , Mr. Obama said that although he intended to withdraw American forces as rapidly as possible , he reserved the right to send troops back in “ if Al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq . ”
Mr. McCain pounced on the remark .
“ I have some news , ” he said at a town hall - style meeting in Tyler , Tex .
“ Al Qaeda is in Iraq .
It ’s called ‘ Al Qaeda in Iraq . ’
My friends , if we left , they would n’t be establishing a base .
They ’d be taking a country and I ’m not going to allow that to happen . ”
I ’m glad it ’s not just me , as whenever we have a video tele - conference at work I always try to hide out of the way of the camera , and just ca n’t bring myself to look at my own face on screen .
I can just about cope with my photo in private , but seeing myself on the big screen is just too much for me !
This fact in the headline was one of the interesting facts to come out of a recent survey by Cross Marketing Inc and reported by japan .
internet.com on the subject of web cameras .
Demographics
On the 18th and 19th of July 2007 300 members of Cross Marketing Inc ’s online monitor group successfully completed a private internet - based questionnaire .
The sample was exactly 50:50 male and female , and 20.0 % in their teens , 20.0 % in their twenties , 20.0 % in their thirties , 20.0 % in their forties , and 20.0 % in their fifties .
As a cross-reference , back in October of last year MyVoice looked at video calling on mobile phones , and there they found a similar lack of enthusiasm for video calling on mobile phones .

Just when we thought we were going to get a sensory overload thanks to Tony , Bruce , Hulk , and Indy , here comes Watchmen to kick our eyeballs again .
Like JJ Abrams ' Star Trek , director Zack Snyder is actually building massive sets instead of depending entirely on 3D graphics and green screens .

And I can't be more grateful for that decision .
I do n't know about you , but the idea of having these strange ( anti ) heroes walking around a " real " 1985 's New York , Ozymandias 's massive Karnak , Mason 's garage , Dr. Manhattan 's nuclear lab , the Comedian 's tacky bachelor 's pad , and Rorschach 's jail — all full of the retro gadgets , technology and the dirt of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ' comicbook masterpiece — has me excited .

If the movie is as good as his take on Frank Miller 's 300 , Snyder 's Watchmen is going to be one for the books .

Woe unto thee in cubical farms , for this is our greatest attempt yet to get you canned
When the bailiff opened the door of the cell on Monday , Ms. Torres - Flores was lying on the floor , the deputy said .
The cell typically holds prisoners for no more than an hour , measures 9 feet by 10 feet and contains only a metal table with benches that swing out from it .
It has a steel door and concrete walls .
“ From what I understand  it sounds horrible to say  it was an oversight , ” said Nathan Lewis , Ms. Torres - Flores ’s lawyer .
“ No one is walking around there Friday , and she just got left in there over the weekend . ”
“ There ’s no water , there ’s no food , ” Mr. Lewis added .
“ She basically said it was really bad . ”
She was taken to a hospital and treated , and is now recovering at home , Mr. Lewis said , “ very worn out from the whole ordeal . ”
Ms. Torres - Flores has been in the United States for 19 years , and her children were born here , though she is in the country illegally , said her immigration lawyer , Roy Petty .
Mr. Petty said she had been among numerous people arrested at a flea market on charges related to the sale of pirated DVDs and CDs .
She went to court Thursday for a hearing on a plea agreement over the charges , but decided to plead not guilty .
She was then placed in the holding cell for transfer to the county jail , since the new plea was contrary to the terms of her original release on bond .
Instead , she was forgotten .
Hillary Clinton needed a BIG win ; something along the lines of a landslide to have any realistic chance of getting the Democratic Nomination .
It did not happen .
Put aside all of the spin and the public relations victory she may have won with last night ’s Pennsylvania primary .
The cold , hard truth rests in the numbers .
And all of the numbers belong to Barack Obama .
Going into the Pennsylvania contest , team Clinton knew that they had little chance of winning the pledged delegate count ( delegates chosen by voters ) .
They knew that Obama had already won the most states .
So , what they wanted to do was attempt an enormous win that would propel them to victory in the popular vote .
They failed .
And Pennsylvania was their last chance to catch up .
Numbers do n’t spin .
Numbers do n’t lie : Hillary Clinton ended the month of March in debt .
Barack Obama , thanks to a grassroots funding apparatus bankrolled by thousands of small donations from ordinary Americans , ended March with over 40 million dollars in the bank .
She needs money ….. fast !!!.
How many people are willing to donate money to a candidate that has no chance to win during a recession ?
Numbers do n’t spin .
Numbers do n’t lie :
The remaining states to be contested do not offer Clinton the opportunity to significantly gain on Obama in any way .
Clinton simply lost too many states earlier in the year to be competitive .
Here are the remaining states in play :
• Guam ( May 3rd )
• Indiana ( May 6th )
• North Carolina ( May 6th )
• West Virginia ( May 13th )
• Kentucky ( May 20th )
• Oregon ( May 20th )
• Montana ( June 3rd )
• South Dakota ( June 3rd )
• Puerto Rico ( June 7th )
Clinton , who prides herself in her ability to win BIG states ( while often not campaigning and even ignoring smaller states ) , ironically does not have the population base from these “ smaller ” states to overcome her earlier defeats .
To make things more difficult , polling shows that she is 20 points behind Obama in North Carolina and 5 points behind in Indiana ( which borders Obama ’s home state of Illinois ) .
Clinton has lost any claim to the popular vote argument .
It belongs to Obama .
And his margin of victory will get larger .
As she awakes this morning , she realizes that her victory in Pennsylvania was not sufficient enough to change anything .
When she opens the newspaper , she sees that another superdelegate , Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry , has endorsed Barack Obama today .
From the Governor of very conservative Oklahoma : “ Senator Obama is uniquely positioned to unite our nation and move beyond the divisiveness and partisan skirmishes that too often characterize politics as usual in Washington . "
As she flips further through the paper , she sees a scathing rebuke of her candidacy from the New York Times , the same hometown paper that endorsed her candidacy in January : " The Pennsylvania campaign , which produced yet another inconclusive result on Tuesday , was even meaner , more vacuous , more desperate , and more filled with pandering than the mean , vacuous , desperate , pander - filled contests that preceded it . "
" Voters are getting tired of it ; it is demeaning the political process ; and it does not work .
It is past time for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to acknowledge that the negativity , for which she is mostly responsible , does nothing but harm to her , her opponent , her party and the 2008 election . "

Crossing the Bridge
Four friends need to cross a bridge .
They start on the same side of the bridge .
A maximum of two people can cross at any time .
It is night and they have just one lamp .
People that cross the bridge must carry the lamp to see the way .
A pair must walk together at the rate of the slower person :
Rachel : - takes 1 minute to cross
Ben : - takes 2 minutes to cross
George : - takes 7 minutes to cross
Yvonne : - takes 10 minutes to cross
The second fastest solution gets the friends across in 21 minutes .
The fastest takes 17 minutes .
Can you work out how it is done ?
What if we change how long it takes each person to cross ?
There are two optimal strategies for solving this type of problem :
Strategy 1 solves the original problem in 17 minutes
Strategy 2 solves the original problem in 21 minutes
Experiment with different speeds and work out when to use Strategy 1 and when to use Strategy 2 .
Is there a way of determining which strategy will be best ?
Can you find sets of speeds for which both strategies give the same crossing time ?

Attitudes to the United States are improving , an opinion poll carried out for the BBC World Service suggests .
The average percentage of people saying that the US has a positive influence has risen to 35 % from 31 % a year ago , according to the survey .
Those saying the US has a negative influence fell five percentage points to 47 % .
The poll , part of a regular survey of world opinion , interviewed more than 17,000 people in 34 countries .
The survey period was the three months up to the end of January 2008 .
However , the poll finds that views of US influence in the world are still mainly negative , though they improved in 11 out of the 23 countries also polled a year ago .
Perceptions of the US worsened in three - Canada , Lebanon and Egypt. READ THE REPORT
Global views of USA improve [ 3.94MB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here The World Service poll has been canvassing opinions about the influence of countries since 2005 .
Of the 17 countries surveyed every year since 2005 , positive views of the US have recovered for the first time this year to 32 % after showing a steady decline over the previous three years .
Reacting to the poll results , senior US state department official Kurt Volker acknowledged perceptions had been negative in recent years , but said 2003 and 2004 had been an " anomaly " because of the Iraq war .
" I would say public opinion is a lagging indicator of what we are doing , working together with European governments and other elites , " he said in a BBC interview .
" Everyone wants to be loved , " he said .
But he added : " We are a superpower .
We have tremendous responsibility , a large economy , large diplomatic reach and military reach , so naturally the world looks at the US with much greater attention than any other country in the world . "
Most negative
Of other countries rated , Iran and Israel are viewed most negatively .
Negative views of Iran 's influence remained at 54 % .
But Israel 's negative rating went down from 57 % to 52 % .
Pakistan was the third most poorly rated country .
Germany , included in the ratings for the first time , is viewed most positively , with a 56 % positive score to 18 % negative .
Japan comes in a close second , with 56 % positive to 21 % negative .
But a majority of those surveyed in neighbouring China and South Korea expressed negative views of Japan .
Russia showed the greatest improvement , with positive views rising on average among the countries surveyed from 29 % to 37 % .
The survey was carried out by the international polling firm GlobeScan with the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) at the University of Maryland .
PIPA director Steven Kull said the improved rating of the United States could be linked to the forthcoming presidential election .
" It may be that as the US approaches a new presidential election , views of the US are being mitigated by hope that a new administration will move away from the foreign policies that have been so unpopular in the world , " he said .
People were asked to rate Brazil , Britain , China , France , Germany , India , Iran , Israel , Japan , North Korea , Pakistan , Russia , the US and the European Union as having positive or negative influence .

Bush : Al Qaeda is in Iraq , stealing our oil Eric Brewer
Published : Thursday March 20 , 2008

Print This Email
This I had a lot of fun at the White House Wednesday afternoon , and not because I made Dana Perino mad .
In fact , I felt a little sorry for her today .
It 's not her fault that Bush 's speechwriters put ludicrous statements into his speeches .
It all started when I came across the following line in the President 's Iraq War Birthday speech : " An emboldened al Qaeda with access to Iraq 's oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations . "
I almost started salivating .
Bush first used a more modest variant of that argument while campaigning for Republicans during the 2006 Congressional elections .
Back then , the threat was that " extremists and radicals " would " pull a bunch of oil off the market " .
While it was refreshing to hear him finally acknowledge the blood - oil nexus , I do n't think the threat resonated with many voters , judging from the election results .
A couple of months later , during his surge announcement , Bush upped the ante .
Now it was " radical Islamic extremists " who were going to " use oil revenues to fund their ambitions . "
And finally , today , Bush threw in " al Qaeda " and " weapons of mass destruction " for good measure .
But did he go too far ?
Here 's the transcript of my discussion with Dana : Me : The President warned of the danger that al Qaeda could gain access to Iraq 's oil resources .
But I do n't understand how a fragmented , clandestine , non-Iraqi terrorist organization could produce and sell Iraqi oil on the global market , especially when the majority of Iraqis have turned against al Qaeda .
Could you describe a plausible scenario ?
Dana :
The purpose of what the President said is that al Qaeda should not be allowed to have safe haven in Iraq and take over -- Me : How can they take over Iraq 's oil reserves ?
Dana :
Well , if we were to leave we would certainly ensue chaos and not be able to -- if we were to leave too soon , it would certainly be chaos and it would be terrible for not only the innocent Iraqis , but the entire region and , in fact , our own national security .
That 's what the President -- Me :
So the Iraqis would let a foreign terrorist organization take over their oil ?
Dana :
You 're missing the point , and I think that you should go back and read -- Me : No , I -- Dana :
Yes , actually , I think you are missing the point .
And I call on you because I see what you write about how you come here and you really want to have questions asked .
And I 'm calling on you and I 'm providing it to you , but I suggest that you read the President 's speech and read it in context , because that 's -- what you 're suggesting is not what the President said .
Me :
That 's what he said .
Increasingly for the Bush administration , " al Qaeda " has become shorthand for " anyone in the Middle East who does n't like us . "
That 's why John McCain got into trouble on Tuesday .
I know they have to simplify things for their base , but they 're running the risk of alienating anyone with a brain .
At the end of the briefing , a man who'd been sitting in back came up to me and said , " That was great , what you just did .
That was brilliant . "
I asked him who he was .
He said , " Just visiting .
I 'm military . "
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .
Think Progress has video of the exchange between Brewer and Perino at this link .

I 've just emerged from the Microsoft machine , shaken but unscathed .
I 've interviewed Bill Gates three or four times over a 12 year period , and each time I come out impressed by the sheer professionalism of the Microsoft PR operation but wondering whether we 've been successfully spun .
This time we tried a new tactic - getting BBC viewers , listeners and readers to ask the questions .
We had thousands , covering every aspect of Bill Gates and Microsoft - past , present and future .
Over two hundred were seeking jobs , one gentleman was proposing himself as the next CEO of Microsoft , and another wondered whether the secrets of Windows software had been recovered from a crashed UFO .
We did not ask that one , but managed to get through around fifteen questions during our allotted fifteen minutes .
As ever , Mr Gates appeared very well briefed .
Yes , Vista was a success , despite the frustrations expressed by Barry from London .
Sure , he understood the anger felt by people like Daniel from Aberdeen about the reliability of the Xbox 360 , but it was being sorted .
Yes , Microsoft had missed some trends - the importance of search - and perhaps over - estimated others - the tablet computer , for instance .
And no , Mr McInerney from Southampton , there is n't a single Mac to be found in the Gates household .
Throughout the interview the Microsoft chairman reached over to a handily placed table covered in mobile phones , all of them running Windows Mobile .
Surely , I chipped in , this was one area where the likes of Google ( with its new Android operating system ) and Nokia , would prevent Microsoft from dominating ?
Windows is on 20 million phones , Google is on zero , though Nokia is pretty big , was the response .
( I had arrived in the Microsoft tent bearing a blackberry , a Nokia phone and an iPhone , not quite realising how provocative that might be . )
The formal part of the interview over - and timed to the exact second by the Microsoft PR people - we went to have a look at Microsoft 's surface computer .
Bill Gates demonstrated it for me , afterwards admitting that this was just his second rehearsal of the demo he 'll perform in his keynote tonight .
And finally he stuck his neck out , predicting that this kind of computer will be in tens of millions of homes within a few years .
Such predictions have sometimes gone awry - remember the wristwatch computer ?
But Bill Gates , who is stepping aside from his day - to - day role at Microsoft to concentrate on his charity later this year , was in a relaxed mood .
Whatever you think of the man or of Microsoft , he has undoubtedly been the leading figure in the world 's most important industry over the last two decades .
Have a look at the interview , which will appear in various forms on this site and on television in the next 24 hours .
And let us know what you think of the answers - and the questions .
I was doing my regular web money reading and came across an interesting article on MSN Money Central about marriage infidelity .
No , not that kind of infidelity , I 'm talking about financial infidelity .
What is financial infidelity ?
This is where one spouse in the relationship overspends without the other spouse knowing .
I can see this being a major problem if it happens often , especially if money is already tight .
According to divorce lawyers interviewed by MSN , they see more divorce cases lead by financial rather than sexual infidelity .
Some marriages never recover from that breach of trust , says Brandt , the lawyer .
That 's when they come to see her .
" I get people at the end of the marriage when it's too late , " says Brandt .
" You have to start talking about these things before you even get into a marriage . "
What 's the solution ?
I believe that the key to avoid money related issues is through open communication about money .
Even with our most trusted partners , some of us still treat money as a taboo subject .
Here is what the MSN article suggests :
Brandt and others advise that the best way for couples to avoid this problem is for both partners to get actively involved in the finances .
You do n't both have to pay bills , but both partners must be aware of how much money they have and where it 's going .
Couples should also have an agreement about how much they can spend using joint funds before they need to clear it with the spouse .
Online banking makes it simple to periodically check for unusual withdrawals or changes in financial position .
Do n't leave financial management all up to one person , especially if that person has had spending problems in the past .
Money may seem like a secretly understood topic , but everyone has their own opinions / views .
In addition to the above , David Bach from Smart Couples Finish Rich teaches that the key to financial success between couples is to determine a common ground with regards to money .
He suggests to base family financial goals around values instead of monetary goals .
How do we handle purchases in our family ?
I have to admit that I 'm the family chief financial officer but all bigger purchases need to be agreed upon .
To give ourselves a little freedom , we each get some discretionary cash at the beginning of each month to spend on whatever we please without question .
If you 're in a relationship , how do you deal with purchases ?
Are you guilty of hiding purchases from your partner ?

Interview with Die Presse , Der Kurier , Der Standard and Salzburger Nachrichten
Will the next decision of the ECB be to cut interest rates or is it possible that you will raise them ?
Trichet :
As you know , we at the ECB ’s Governing Council take the decisions on monetary policy on a monthly basis after a thorough analysis of the facts and figures .
We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to delivering price stability and to firmly anchoring inflation expectations .
Some days ago Governor Noyer of the Banque de France hinted that the ECB could increase interest rates instead of lowering them .
Was he expressing the opinion of the whole ECB council ?
Trichet : I do not comment on declarations made by members of the Governing Council in their own capacity .
As you know , the President is the “ porte parole ” of the Governing Council and expresses the opinion of the whole Council .
This is what I have done on behalf of the Governing Council .
Our opinion is that we believe that our current monetary policy stance will contribute to delivering price stability .
Allow me also to stress the formidable team spirit that we have in the Eurosystem .
I would like to praise the work of Governor Liebscher in particular for his invaluable contribution to our work .
The European Commission delivered a new , more pessimistic , outlook for 2008 and 2009 .
Does this change your projection ?
Trichet :
There is a wide range of forecasts for this year and next ; there are a lot of figures , from the EU , from the OECD , from the IMF and from private institutions .
In the case of growth , as well as inflation , it depends very much on new data that are incorporated , so it is often a question of timing .
What we are observing in the first quarter of 2008 is that the economy was quite robust and in the first half of the year it will probably be reasonably resilient .
At this stage we consider that the projection of the IMF for the EU may be too pessimistic .
We will see what happens .
As you know , the ECB ’s staff projections do not give a precise figure for growth , but rather a range .
The range for GDP growth in 2008 is 1.3 % to 2.1 % .
Would you say that the current monetary policy of the ECB accommodates sustainable economic growth ?
Trichet : I would say that delivering price stability and being credible in this delivery is a precondition for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation .
There is no contradiction between these goals .
Our past track record argues in favour of this .
We have created 15.7 million new jobs in Europe , almost three times more than in the nine years preceding the euro .
This was more than the jobs created in the United States during the same period .
As you know , at the global level , there is now a mainstream sentiment among economists that price stability permits sustainable growth and job creation .
We have maintained medium - term inflation expectations in line with our aim of price stability – less than 2 % , but close to 2 % – whilst contributing to creating a significant number of new jobs .
The Federal Reserve lowers the interest rates , the Bank of England does it .
Do you think that the pressure on the ECB will get stronger to lower interest rates as well ?
Trichet : Each of us has its role and responsibilities .
We have to face different economies , with different features , different levels of flexibility and very different kinds of shocks within each economy .
There is one thing we have in common :
We have to deliver price stability and we have to be credible .
And we have to continue to solidly anchor price expectations .
That is true for all central banks .
Otherwise we would jeopardise medium and long - term growth and job creation and we would also create problems for the financial markets .
When the Fed makes another cut of interest rates , will there be more pressure on the US - dollar and because of this more problems for the European export industry ?
Trichet :
There have been , at times , sharp fluctuations in the exchange rates of major currencies .
We are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability .
Also , I trust it is important that the US President , the US Secretary of the Treasury and my colleague Ben Bernanke said that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States .
You stressed many times that extreme exchange rate volatility is highly unwelcome .
But the markets tend not to listen to you and other central bankers .
Why is this so ?
Trichet : I think that observers and market participants are certainly listening to what we say , on both sides of the Atlantic .
Two questions :
What are your expectations as regards the financial market crisis and what repercussions will it have on credit activities for businesses ?
Trichet :
At the moment outstanding loans to the non-financial corporate sector are growing at a rate of 15 % , which is dynamic .
On the one hand we see a progressive slowdown as regards loans to households and the housing sector .
At the same time credit standards have tightened and we have to look at the situation very carefully .
As regards the very significant ongoing market correction we will continue along our path : on the one hand adopting the appropriate monetary policy stance to deliver price stability and , once that decision is made , we have to ensure the smooth functioning of the money market in line with our policy rate .
As you know , we have also been in close contact with other central banks , including the Federal Reserve .
In the course of the financial crisis the impression of many people is that gains are privatised and losses are socialised .
Do you regard this as a problem ?
Trichet : I think the issue of moral hazard is very important .
It is absolutely clear that if those who have behaved improperly are not punished and do not take their losses then we cannot pave the way for sound decisions of financial institutions in the future .
Therefore we have always made the point that what we are doing is not , in any manner , aiming at bailing out any individual or institution and at diminishing the losses that would be made because of bad management .
It is all about protecting those who behaved properly against the harm that has been done to the market as a whole by those who have taken bad decisions .
That has been very well understood by observers and by market participants .
But there are tendencies in the European Union to think that bailouts would be considered if distortions of the economy are at stake .
Trichet : I was speaking for the ECB , the Eurosystem and central banks in general .
In exceptional cases one can imagine that the executive branches and the parliaments would consider that the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one particular institution because of a solvency issue would make it worth mobilising taxpayers ’ risk and taxpayers ’ money .
This is something which can not be excluded .
As central banks we exclude taking such risks associated not with a liquidity issue but with a solvency issue of a given financial institution .
But the European Union has already proposed sharing the burden in case of a collapse in order to divide the rescue costs .
Trichet :
There can be no decision ex ante to mobilise taxpayers ’ money .
In very exceptional cases , the decisions , if any , would have to be taken ex post .
To my knowledge there is absolutely no consensus of ex ante burden - sharing of taxpayers ’ money .
We can now have a lively discussion about the stronger regulation of financial markets .
Do you think that we need tougher equity rules for banks ?
And what should be done with hedge funds that oppose stronger disclosure rules ?
Trichet :
You know that we have 67 recommendations that were made public by the Financial Stability Forum and approved by theG7 and the international community .
We are not at a level at which we are still exchanging ideas .
We have come to an agreement .
What inspired these recommendations was the idea of transparency – more transparency for both institutions and for the sophisticated financial instruments that were the source of the market correction .
It is exactly the same as we did in the case of the Asian crisis .
We have to correct all the components of global finance if we want to avoid new significant market corrections with all their negative consequences .
We have to correct the elements of procyclicality which currently exist in global finance and which amplify both the booms and the busts .
Would off - balance risks be one of the components that have to be adjusted ?
Trichet :
That is something which has been identified as one of the main problems .
It calls for a review of the “ originate and distribute ” model that has been generalised in commercial banking .
It appears that it was a dangerous way of distributing credit .
We have also noted that the rules of Basel I were very complacent regarding these structured investment vehicles or conduits or other off - balance - sheet entities .
Basel II rules are fortunately much more stringent in this respect .
Had we generalised Basel II earlier , it is likely that we would have fewer of these operations and therefore fewer damages .
So it is important that more countries implement Basel II and that we see how we can improve and update this framework .
And we are also strongly encouraging the private sector to improve its risk management .
So everything is left to the behaviour of the private sector ?
Trichet : Certainly not .
Surveillance authorities have to be as alert as possible , as recommended in the Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) report .
And we have to update and improve regulation .
I also welcome the work which has been done by the private sector .
It seems fair to me to give the financial institutions a chance to work out good practices and benchmark principles for their own voluntary behaviour .
If they are not able to do that or if we judge their work insufficient then we have a case for regulation .
In any case we should implement the 67 recommendations of the FSF as actively as possible .
Some recommendations should be implemented in 100 days , others by the end of the year .
How do you judge the plans to create a World Financial Organisation proposed by the Austrian Chancellor ?
Trichet : I would take the Chancellor ’s suggestions as a call to “ work as actively and as well as possible at the level of Europe and the international community ” .
I have to say we have the FSF , which has been created after the Asian crisis .
It is a group which brings together all the relevant financial institutions and groupings .
We have the International Monetary Fund , we have the Bank for International Settlements , we have the G7 and we have the G20 .
So my sentiment is that there is a will to make the present framework function as well as possible , and this is good .
The new ECB tower in Frankfurt is being planned by the Austrian architects COOP HIMMELB(L ) AU .
Are there any delays in the work on this building and when will the tower be ready ?
Trichet :
We must be very alert , cautious and prudent , but at the moment there are no delays that I know of .
The inauguration could take place at the end of 2011 .
One final question .
Do you ever listen to politicians like Prime Minister Berlusconi or President Sarkozy when they are criticising the ECB – or does a central banker have to ignore such comments ?
Trichet : Let me say that the Maastricht Treaty has given us full independence .
This is very well known the world over .
I do not know of any observer or market participant who would call into doubt the fact that we are fully independent and that the President and the members of the Governing Council are fiercely attached to this independence , as required by the Treaty .
Rising by over 1 Million , the number of vacant homes has now been marked at 18.6 Million in the United States .
A record 18.6 million U.S. homes stood empty in the first quarter as lenders took possession of a growing number of properties in foreclosure .
The figure is 5.7 percent higher than a year ago , when 17.6 million properties were vacant , the U.S. Census Bureau said in a report today .
The vacancy rate , the share of homes empty and for sale , rose to 2.9 percent , the highest since the bureau started keeping count in 1956 .
About 2.3 million empty homes were for sale , compared with 2.2 million a year earlier , the report said .
The worst U.S. housing slump in more than a quarter century is deepening as falling values encourage buyers to delay purchases in hopes of getting a better deal .
The median U.S. home sale price may drop 5.8 percent in 2008 , the most on record , followed by another 4.7 percent decline next year , Fannie Mae , the world ’s largest mortgage buyer , said April 7 .
“ We think it unlikely that prices begin to stabilize until vacancy rates start declining , ” Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York , said today in a report for clients .
There were 129.4 million homes in the U.S. in the first quarter , the study said .
In addition to homes for sale , the report counted 4.1 million vacant homes that are for rent and 4.7 million that are seasonal .
Most foreclosures are contained in the report ’s “ other ” category , which includes homes tied up in legal proceedings as well as homes that are empty because the owner is renovating and living somewhere else , according to the Census Web site .
There were 7.5 million such homes that were vacant , up from 7.3 million a year earlier , the report said .
I ’ve said before that a “ good time to buy ” is relative to your plans .
In this case , liquidity is also important .
Can you survive a job loss and still make your payments ?
Can you stay in your house for 10 years before you break even after being upside down on your home mortgage loan for several years ?
Very important questions to ask yourselves as we get more and more statistics from very reputable sources .
Is it really a better time to rent than to buy right now ?
Personally , I say no .
Until you can purchase a property that cashflows and rents for the cost of your mortgage and HOA bill , I believe many Americans will be holding on to their pockets for the next couple years until things pick up .
Will The Housing Bubble Continue ?
All signs point to yes .
If you think that the ARM resets are now over and we ’re in the clear .
That we simply need to clear out this inventory issue and we ’re good to go – consider this :
3 out of every 5 stated income loans had inflated income by at least 50 %
As Slate pointed out in their article :
In 2006 , a man named Steven Krystofiak gave a statement in a Federal Reserve hearing on mortgage regulation , representing an organization called the Mortgage Brokers Association for Responsible Lending .
The organization had compared a sample of 100 stated income mortgage applications to IRS records .
More than 90 of the applications overstated the borrower ’s income at least a little .
More strikingly , more than three out of five overstated it by at least 50 percent .
This is n’t a few people fibbing a little .
This was the whole system breaking down .
The consequences are predictably depressing .
A blogger named Michael Shedlock has done some terrific work tracking the performance of these kinds of loans .
Shedlock analyzed one particular bundle of loans from Washington Mutual consisting of 1,765 mortgages from around May 2007 , a total of $ 519 million in loans .
These were not “ subprime ” loans .
The borrowers ’ average credit score was 705 , well within prime territory .
This is a fairly typical package of loans for a mortgage - backed security , but one thing that does make it stand out is the proportion of these loans that did n’t ask for income documents : 88 percent .
Historically , a year into the life of a loan , well less than 1 percent of typical prime loans would be 30 days late or more .
By the end of January , when Shedlock first looked at it , just eight months after the loans were made , almost one in five were at least 60 days overdue .
I believe we ’ll be mid-way through 2009 before we see the dust start to settle .
Even then , remember that just because things are slowing down , real estate is n’t appreciating .
Consumer confidence has to rise before the market will allow real estate to appreciate anywhere near low - normal levels for several years to come .

Brenda Hughes of Savannah , GA was accused of throwing acid on her neighbors in an alleged hate crime .
She claims she did n’t do it , and even has a special t- shirt that proclaims her innocence .
And , even if she did do it , the acid would n’t have hurt anyone , she asserts , proving it on the TV news by putting some in her mouth .
Have a look :
Wing Men
On the eve of the world championship of remote - control flight , an American financier , a three - star general , a jet engineer and the Air Force ’s most powerful civilian have come together in Thailand to build the perfect fighting plane — at 1:5 scale
Solving America 's energy challenges obviously means overcoming a phalanx of obstacles .
But the most pressing might be the most basic : understanding how energy markets actually work .
Politicians on the campaign trail clearly , um , struggle with this .
Witness their simultaneous enthusiasm for gasoline - tax holidays and calls for a tough cap on greenhouse - gas emissions ( which would mean higher energy prices ) .
O'Reilly : ' They can charge whatever they want to charge , correct ? '
Last Wednesday , Fox News ' " The O'Reilly Factor " set out to determine why oil and gasoline prices are high ( as well as what will happen to Hannah Montana ) .
The show called John D'Agostino , the youngest vice president of the New York Mercantile Exchange and an oil - market guru in his own right .
Full disclosure : Fox News , like the Wall Street Journal , is owned by News Corp .
The video segment is not available on the website .
But the transcript of the interview is an enlightening window into the extent of populist outrage at Big Oil :
BILL O'REILLY : OK , now look , in my town out on Long Island , gasoline has gone up 75 cents a gallon in about a month , a month and a half .
Why now ?
Why this point in time ?
JOHN D'AGOSTINO , FORMER VP OF NYMEX : Well , a couple of things .
One is crude oil has been high and stayed high .
O'REILLY : Now , who 's driving that ?
Is that the greedy sheiks and Hugo Chavez ?
D'AGOSTINO : No , no , no , I do n't know about that .
What we know for a fact is that we have a weak dollar .
We have global demand that 's staying put , no matter how much the price has gone up .
O'REILLY : We had that last year .
The demands have gone up globally since last -- but let 's -- wait a minute .
Let 's walk through it so everybody understands what we 're talking about .
OPEC sets the price for a barrel of oil .
And they keep raising it and raising it and raising it .
Dick Cheney went over there and tried to say , " Hey , give us a break . "
They gave Cheney the middle digit .
All right ?
So they can -- they can charge whatever they want to charge , correct ?
D'AGOSTINO : Well , OPEC sets the supply for what they can produce .
The price of oil is actually set in exchange at trades in New York and in London , as well .
O'REILLY : Is there a guy who says $ 121 a barrel ?
D'AGOSTINO : No .
There 's a huge market .
It 's filled with hedgers .
It 's filled with speculators .
It 's filled with moms and dads , average Americans .
It 's a big market that sets this price .
O'REILLY : Somebody has to put the $ 125 a barrel on the barrel .
Who does it ?
D'AGOSTINO : They 're taking it from this market .
They 're just like ...
O'REILLY : Who is " they " ?
D'AGOSTINO : The producers .
They 're looking at this , just like when you decide how much a share of IBM is worth .
You look at the settlement price in the New York Stock Exchange .
O'REILLY : The CEO of Shell or the CEO of ExxonMobil say , " We 're going to pay $ 125 a barrel . "
Is that what they say ?
I thought it was the sheiks and Hugo Chavez saying , " We 're going to charge you $ 125 a barrel . "
D'AGOSTINO : No .
They 're all looking to the exchanges or the free markets to set that price point .
The free markets right now are saying the price of crude oil is about 120 bucks a barrel .
It 's been going up .
It continues to go up .
If you like me are sometimes updating multiple blogs , then you know how annoying it is to jump between admins .
I ’m a WordPress user myself , but I could find myself using other platforms , which would further add clutter to my workflow .
I do n’t like clutter one bit .
Enter blogging software , programs that let you post to several blogs ( or just one , should you want to do that ) using one interface .
This post focuses on blogging software for Mac .
The good and the bad
There are both pros and cons with using blogging software for your everyday blog posting .
Some might seem a bit over the top , but assuming you take pride in your blog , and perhaps make money maintaining it , I think these issues are important .
Pros :
Easy to manage several blogs .
Offline writing , often including drafts .
Cons :
Uncertainty .
Did it really work ?
General program design means that it might not be optimized for your blogging platform of choice .
Blog platform updates might break your blogging program ’s functionality .
If you ’re doing custom stuff , like fields or cool plugins , you ’re stuck with your blog platform ’s admin .
That being said , here goes !
MarsEdit
MarsEdit ’s been around for a while .
It costs $ 29.95 and there ’s a 30 - day trial available .
This is n’t the program for people using the WYSIWYG editor in their blogging platform of choice , since there ’s nothing of that here .
What you have is a simple dropdown that lets you input standard tags ( strong , link tags , blockquote , and so on ) , much like the traditional editor in WordPress .
This might not be enough for everyone , but personally I find it doing its job , then again I always turn of the visual editor since I speak html fluently .
A good thing is that you can setup your own templates for previewing posts , and you can also store macros so that you do n’t have to type the same thing over and over again , a good feature .
There ’s also support for AppleScript , but I do n’t know much about that .
Uploading images is easy , and should you be the type who likes to nab photos from Flickr , then you can have your account integrated into the MarsEdit Media manager .
As for compatibility , MarsEdit works with most blogging platforms , be it WordPress , Movable Type , Blogger , Vox , or even Drupal .
Tagging is supported .
I did find one annoying bug , or whatever you want to call it , though .
When writing posts that you want to split up using the more feature ( we ’re talking WordPress again ) , then you type in two different boxes ( Body and Extended ) .
Everything in the Extended box is after the more link .
However , the more link will be inserted on its own row , and not directly after the last character in the Body box , which makes it look a bit weird on sites where the read more link is designed to just follow the content .
Overall MarsEdit is a great choice , as long as you know your html .
I do , so I love it !
Ecto
Ecto is the most stylish blogging program that I ’m writing about in this post .
It costs $ 17,95 , and there ’s a 21 - day trial available so that you can play around for yourself .
At the moment , only Ecto 3 beta supports Leopard , but on the other hand the beta is stable so you can play around with it .
Unfortunately , Ecto ’s got a reputation of having problems with WordPress , although it ’s mostly something for the version 2 branch .
There are some weirdness in Ecto 3 as well , most importantly the fact that you ca n’t add new categories in the program .
Tagging works though .
This might be something that will work once Ecto 3 leaves beta , but right now it ’s buggy .
One selling point for Ecto is that it looks good , and it ’s got a visual editor , as opposed to MarsEdit ’s html code one .
You can swap between visual and code in an instant , and Ecto does n’t seem to output too much unnecessary code , if any in the simpler cases .
Certainly a good thing .
Ecto works with more or less any blogging platform , just like MarsEdit .
There ’s support for AppleScript , and there ’s also a few plugins available , including a Flickr one , and support for posting tweets to Twitter .
That ’s really cool .
However , although Ecto looks a bit better than MarsEdit , I think it falls short .
Keep in mind that I ’m not interested in the visual editor , though , so you might prefer this one after all .
Beta is never a good thing , but I believe Ecto will deliver in the end .
Blogo
Blogo is a newcomer , costing $ 25 and offering a 21 - day trial .
It ’s got a very straight forward design , not exactly leaning on the OS X look , if you know what I mean .
Either you like it , or you do n’t .
I ’m fine with it .
The full screen mode , more or less doing the same thing as the popular WriteRoom application , is genius !
However , Blogo fails on a very crucial aspect , and that ’s categorization of your posts .
You ’ve got no category nor tag management , and while you can add tags in the “ categories ” box below the body , you ’ll find that , with wordpress.com blogs , these will be saved as tags .
This is not acceptable , and I do hope that it will be remedied and then remade for a future version .
There are good things in Blogo for sure , especially the image manager which let you crop and position images with ease .
Drag and drop is very nice when it ’s working .
The fact that Blogo is n’t giving you tons of options when writing is n’t always a good thing , but it sure makes you focus on the important thing , being the content .
However , a handy code editor would ’ve been nice .
I ’ll be keeping an eye on Blogo , and if you like the straight forward style you should too .
Final words
My trial periods have expired , and I ’m hooked .
The most expensive blog software , MarsEdit , is also the one I ’ve decided to go with in the long run .
I realize it ’s not for everyone , and there are flaws ( which I ’ll point out to the developers of course ) , but it certainly saves me time .
I ’m fluent in html and css though , so this might not be the obvious solution for everybody .
Make good use of the trial periods offered , and do share what your blogging software you ’re using for the Mac .

The toughest two weeks of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales 's career just became a whole lot worse , with a former chief scientist at one of the world 's biggest technology companies claiming Wales traded Wiki edits for donations .
Jeff Merkey , a former computer scientist at Novell , claims Wales told him in 2006 that in exchange for a substantial donation from Merkey , he would edit his uncomplimentary Wikipedia entry to make it more favourable .
Merkey made a $ US5000 ( $ 5455 ) donation in 2006 and the edit history for his Wikipedia entry showed that , around the same time , Wales personally made changes to the entry after wiping it out completely and ordering editors to start over .
Ryland Group CEO R. Chad Dreier Loyola Marymount University CEOs are just like the rest of us :
They hate paying for things out of pocket if they can find someone else to foot the bill .
Fortunately for them , in many cases there is someone willing to pick up the bill for selected personal expenses : the shareholders .
A new study from The Corporate Library finds that the most common form of perk being granted to CEOs these days is something called a tax " gross -up . "
In plain English , it means that a company pays the taxes owed by the CEO on benefits granted by the company .
The Corporate Library , a shareholder watchdog group , found that 20 % of major American companies , or 657 of nearly 3,300 examined , picked up the tab on at least one tax owed by the CEO .
" We are sure that many U.S. workers would be grateful if their employers also paid their income tax obligations , " writes Paul Hodgson of The Corporate Library in the report .
Almost any perk granted to a CEO generates a tax bill , from an executive life insurance policy paid by the company to country club dues .
But one of the most common reasons cited by the report for tax " gross- ups " is use of the corporate jet .
Since the Sept. 11 attacks , for security reasons , the boards of many companies have encouraged their CEOs to fly on private jets rather than commercial airlines when traveling on business .
Public companies often allow the CEOs to use the corporate jet for personal travel as well .
Personal use of the company plane is a form of compensation to the executive , so it generates a tax liability .
But rather than making the CEO pay tax on that benefit , dozens of companies in the Russell 3000 pick up the tax bill .
The Corporate Library report singles out Ryland Group ( RYL ) , a home - building company , as the biggest provider of " gross - up " payments to its CEO .
For 2007 , Ryland provided CEO R. Chad Dreier with $ 4 million in gross-ups as part of a pay package that totaled $ 12 million .
Ryland did not return calls for comment .
Revelations about corporate perks can create ill will among investors , says Ira Kay of the compensation consulting firm Watson Wyatt .
" We advise our clients to minimize perks as much as possible , " he says .
" It 's an irritant to shareholders and a distraction from incentive plans that work well . "
Alan Johnson of Johnson & Associates suggests that many companies maintain a corporate jet primarily to accommodate the CEO , or , if the company already has a corporate jet that 's used for business , a CEO 's needs can lead the company to lease another jet .
Some companies , such as General Mills ( GIS ) , have canceled the personal - use - of - the - corporate - jet perk .
It 's a trend that 's likely to grow , says Watson Wyatt 's Kay .
Hodgson agrees .
" There are more boards who are less happy paying for quite so many perks now that they 've been exposed , " he says .
" I 'm expecting a reduction in number and range of perks being paid . "

Your snack choice is more important than you think .
New research indicates that in addition to affecting your waistline , food also can influence your brain .
Some diets appear to aid mental functioning while others harm it .
Altogether the studies show the importance of diet on mental health and also may have implications for those who suffer from certain brain ailments .
Loathe anything leafy and green ?
Obsess over cream - filled cupcakes ?
A better understanding of food 's complex actions .
The development of diets that may improve brain functions and help prevent or treat brain ailments .
Junk food junkies take notice .
What you eat does more than influence your gut .
It also may affect your brain .
Increasing evidence shows that certain fruits and veggies produce brain benefits , while some types of fat appear to cause harm .
The new studies are leading to :
General diets rich in antioxidants also have benefits .
By following a group of people aged 65 and over for about four years , researchers recently found that a diet packed with high levels of the antioxidant , vitamin E , was associated with a lower risk of developing AD in some people .
On the other end of the spectrum , a crop of studies finds evidence that gorging on foods that contain high levels of saturated fat - think french fries and donuts - can hinder brain function .
Even though some fat is important for health , many Americans go overboard , especially with the saturated form .
Studies indicate that rats kept on a comparable diet , where approximately 40 percent of their daily calories come from saturated fats , perform poorly on tests of memory and learning .
Human studies also report negative effects .
In one study researchers examined the food intake of some 5,000 participants .
People who ate diets high in saturated fat had an increased risk of dementia .
It 's not clear how excessive saturated fat harms the brain , but there are many theories .
Some blame its effect on glucose , a sugar that provides energy to the body and brain .
While a short - term supply of glucose can help the brain , excess fat may create a situation where brain cells receive a long - term , harmful exposure to glucose .
Research on people with diabetes , a disease marked by problems with glucose , fits with this idea .
For example , one report found that diabetics perform poorly on memory tests .
Other research indicates that excess fat affects certain brain memory molecules .
One of the studies on rats found that the high fat diet cut levels of brain - derived neurotrophic factor and other related molecules in the brain , which are thought to aid the formation of memories .
More research is needed to sort out all the complicated effects of food , but scientists hope eventually to develop specific dietary guidelines that aid brain health .
For now , researchers say it can't hurt to eat more fruits and veggies and cut down on saturated fat .
[ Explanations to the fig .
One way certain foods may help the brain is by fighting off harmful free radical molecules ( A ) , which roam around anxiously looking to combine with other molecules .
Their rush for a mate is thought to cause cell damage or even cell death ( B ) and contribute to a variety of brain function problems .
Researchers believe that foods , such as strawberries , blueberries and spinach , provide the brain with extra platoons of antioxidants .
These protective molecules can take the free radicals out of commission , ending their assault . ]

Mentally healthy foods include strawberries , blueberries and spinach , according to some of the work .
In one example , researchers fed aging rats the daily equivalent of a pint of strawberries , pint of blueberries or a spinach salad for two months .
Compared with aging rats on a regular diet , molecular measures of brain cell communications showed that the supplemented animals had better cell function .
They also performed better on a memory test .
In addition , preliminary findings indicate that the food possibly may have an effect on Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , a memory - impairing disorder that hits in old - age .
Mice bred to develop AD perform better on a memory task when they receive a blueberry supplement .
Their brain cell communication also enhances .
Plans to study supplements of the foods in humans are under way .

AT&T getting LG CU920
Whodathunkit , AT&T are getting an iPhone competitor when they are the sole US retailer of the iPhone .
Maybe they want a New Deal , Roosevelt style .
Regardless , this LG phone looks a lot like the iPhone , and appears to have a touch - only interface like the iPhone .
The difference would lie in the addition of 3G via HSDPA .
The LG device is also rumored to run the upcoming mobile version of FireFox too , instead of Safari .
Other than those differences it looks like it will work exactly like the iPhone , no word on whether it will have the flash storage though .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel has removed 44 roadblocks in the occupied West Bank , short of the number promised to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , a United Nations agency has found .
A Palestinian waves the national flag as he stands near the border wall between Egypt and the Gaza Strip , during a protest calling for an end of Israel blockade to the Gaza Strip , April 10 , 2008 . .
REUTERS / Ibraheem Abu Mustafa
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) said most of the roadblocks removed were of little or no significance .
Palestinians say Israel ’s network of hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks amount to collective punishment , stifle their economy and undermine support for U.S. - backed peace talks .
Israel says the barriers are needed to stop suicide bombers from reaching its cities .
OCHA , which charts the location of roadblocks in the West Bank , conducted its own field survey of the 61 obstacles that Israel said it removed earlier this month after Rice ’s visit .
OCHA found that 44 of the 61 obstacles had been removed , six remained and 11 could not be found , according to a preliminary report presented to Western donors , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters .
The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the U.N. findings .
The army announced last week the removal of 50 roadblocks plus one checkpoint , as promised to Rice .
It subsequently said an additional 10 barriers were taken down , but the army would not disclose their locations publicly .
Of the 44 obstacles that OCHA confirmed as having been removed , five were classified by the U.N. agency as “ significant ” for Palestinians in the area .
OCHA said nine of the 44 were of “ minimal significance ” to Palestinians , noting there was another roadblock nearby or that the obstacle blocked an unpopulated area used by the Israeli army .
OCHA said 17 of the 44 roadblocks were of “ no significance ” , either because they obstructed a closed military zone , had already been removed , were located near a Jewish settlement or were in the middle of a field .
OCHA cited 13 “ questionable circumstances ” .
In those cases , the agency visited the sites where it received repeated reports that obstacles were added at the last minute and then removed .
A U.S. general has been tasked with monitoring whether the roadblocks were removed as promised , but his findings have not been made public .
Rice said during her recent visit that she would push hard to ease West Bank restrictions to try to bolster Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , whose authority has been limited to the West Bank since Hamas Islamists seized the Gaza Strip in June .
But Israel ’s army and defense establishment have put up stiff resistance to making sweeping changes to the roadblock network , citing security concerns .

In 2001 , religious fundamentalists destroyed two colossal , ancient Buddha statues in the Afghan region of Bamiyan .
Behind those statues , there are caves decorated with artwork dating from the 5th to 9th centuries A.D and those also suffered from the destruction of the Taliban along with their natural environment , but recently they became the source of a major discovery .
Scientists at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) have shown that the paintings were made of oil , hundreds of years before the technique was “ invented ” in Europe .
The results were presented at a scientific conference in Japan last January and are just now published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry .

In many European history and art books , oil painting is said to have started in the 15th century in Europe but scientists from the National Research Institute for Cultural Properties in Tokyo ( Japan ) , the Centre of Research and Restoration of the French Museums - CNRS ( France ) , the Getty Conservation Institute ( United States ) and the ESRF have recently identified drying oils in some of the samples they studied from the Bamiyan caves .
Painted in the mid-7th century A.D. , the murals show scenes with Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures .
The scientists discovered that 12 out of the 50 caves were painted with oil painting technique , using perhaps walnut and poppy seed drying oils .

A combination of synchrotron techniques such as infrared micro-spectroscopy , micro X - ray fluorescence , micro X - ray absorption spectroscopy or micro X - ray diffraction was crucial for the outcome of the work .
" On one hand , the paintings are arranged as superposition of multiple layers , which can be very thin .
The micrometric beam provided by synchrotron sources was hence essential to analyze separately each of these layers .
On the other hand , these paintings are made with inorganic pigments mixed in organic binders , so we needed different techniques to get the full picture " Marine Cotte , a research scientist at CNRS and an ESRF scientific collaborator explains .

The results showed a high diversity of pigments as well as binders and the scientists identified original ingredients and alteration compounds .
Apart from oil - based paint layers , some of the layers were made of natural resins , proteins , gums , and , in some cases , a resinous , varnish - like layer .
Protein - based material can indicate the use of hide glue or egg .
Within the various pigments , the scientists found a high use of lead whites .
These lead carbonates were often used , since Antiquity up to modern times , not only in paintings but also in cosmetics as face whiteners .
“ This is the earliest clear example of oil paintings in the world , although drying oils were already used by ancient Romans and Egyptians , but only as medicines and cosmetics ” , explains Yoko Taniguchi , leader of the team .

The paintings are probably the work of artists who traveled on the Silk Road , the ancient trade route between China , across Central Asia 's desert to the West .
However , there are very few studies about this region .
“ Due to political reasons research on paintings in Central Asia is scarce .
We were fortunate to get the opportunity from UNESCO , as a part of conservation project for the World Heritage site Bamiyan , to study these samples and we hope that future research may provide deeper understanding of the painting techniques along the Silk Road and the Eurasian area ” , says Taniguchi .

Seed vault looking out .

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault opened today on a remote island in the Arctic Circle , receiving inaugural shipments of 100 million seeds that originated in over 100 countries .
With the deposits ranging from unique varieties of major African and Asian food staples such as maize , rice , wheat , cowpea , and sorghum to European and South American varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , the first deposits into the seed vault represent the most comprehensive and diverse collection of food crop seeds being held anywhere in the world .
At the opening ceremony , the Prime Minister of Norway , Jens Stoltenberg , unlocked the vault and , together with the African Nobel Peace Prize - winning environmentalist Wangari Maathai , he placed the first seeds in the vault .
The President of the European Commission , José Manuel Barroso , and a host of dignitaries and agriculture experts from around the globe deposited seeds during the ceremony .
A variety of Norwegian musicians and choirs also performed in the opening ceremony held 130 metres deep inside the frozen mountain .
Built near the village of Longyearbyen on the island of Spitsbergen , the vault at its inception contains 268,000 distinct samples of seeds — each one originating from a different farm or field in the world .
Each sample may contain hundreds of seeds or more .
In all , the shipments of seeds secured in the vault today weighed approximately 10 tonnes , filling 676 boxes .
The opening of the seed vault is part of an unprecedented effort to protect the planet ’s rapidly diminishing biodiversity .
The diversity of our crops is essential for food production , yet it is being lost .
This “ fail - safe ” facility , dug deep into the frozen rock of an Arctic mountain , will secure for centuries , or longer , hundreds of millions of seeds representing every important crop variety available in the world today .
As well as protecting against the daily loss of diversity , the vault could also prove indispensable for restarting agricultural production at the regional or global level in the wake of a natural or man-made disaster .
Contingencies for climate change have been worked into the plan .
Even in the worst - case scenarios of global warming , the vault rooms will remain naturally frozen for up to 200 years .
“ With climate change and other forces threatening the diversity of life that sustains our planet , Norway is proud to be playing a central role in creating a facility capable of protecting what are not just seeds , but the fundamental building blocks of human civilization , ” said Norway ’s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg .
“ Crop diversity will soon prove to be our most potent and indispensable resource for addressing climate change , water and energy supply constraints , and for meeting the food needs of a growing population , ” said Cary Fowler , Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust .
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is funded and established by Norway as a service to the world .
The Global Crop Diversity
Trust is providing support for the ongoing operations of the seed vault , as well as organizing and funding the preparation and shipment of seeds from developing countries to the facility .
NordGen will manage the facility and maintain a public on - line database of samples stored in the seed vault , which has the capacity to house 4.5 million samples — some 2 billion seeds .
Prime Minister Stoltenberg and Wangari Maathai , founder of the African Green Belt Movement and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate , delivered together the first box of seeds to the vault .
It contained rice seeds specially prepared with varieties originating from 104 countries .
The box was opened during the ceremony , and then resealed before being placed in the vault .
“ The significant public interest in the seed vault project indicates that collectively we are changing the way we think about environmental conservation .
We now understand that along with international movements to save endangered species and the rainforests of the world , it is just as important for us to conserve the diversity of the world ’s crops for future generations , ” Maathai said .
“ The opening of the seed vault marks a historic turning point in safeguarding the world ’s crop diversity , ’’ said Fowler .
“ But about 50 percent of the unique diversity stored in seed banks still is endangered .
We are in the midst of trying to rescue these varieties .
Our success means we will guarantee the conservation and availability of these wildly diverse crops .
Forever . ”
Unique Building
The building of the vault itself has attracted much outside interest due to its location and its unusual engineering , security , and aesthetic features .
Its engineering allows it to stay cool with only a single 10 - kilowatt compressor , which is powered by locally generated electricity .
The vault consists of three highly secure rooms sitting at the end of a 125 - metre tunnel blasted out of a mountain on Norway ’s Svalbard archipelago .
The seeds will be stored at minus 18 degrees Celsius ( minus 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) and sealed in specially - designed four - ply foil packages .
The packages are sealed inside boxes and stored on shelves inside the vault .
Each vault is surrounded by frozen arctic permafrost , ensuring the continued viability of the seeds should the electricity supply fail .
The low temperature and moisture level inside the vaults will ensure low metabolic activity , keeping the seeds viable .
If properly stored and maintained at minus 20 degrees Celsius ( about minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit ) , some seeds in the vault will be viable for a millennium or more .
For example , barley can last 2000 years , wheat 1700 years , and sorghum almost 20,000 years .
Anyone seeking access to the seeds themselves will have to pass through four locked doors : the heavy steel entrance doors , a second door approximately 115 metres down the tunnel and finally the two keyed air - locked doors .
Keys are coded to allow access to different levels of the facility .
Not all keys will unlock all doors .
Motion detectors are set up around the site .
Boxes of seeds inside the rooms are scanned before entering the seed vault .
A work of art also will make the vault visible for miles around .
Artist Dyveke Sanne and KORO , the Norwegian agency overseeing art in public spaces , have worked together to fill the roof and vault entrance with highly reflective steel , mirrors , and prisms .
The installation acts as a beacon , reflecting polar light in the summer months , while in the winter , a network of 200 fibre - optic cables will give the piece a muted greenish - turquoise and white light .

Maintaining aerobic fitness through middle age and beyond can delay biological ageing by up to 12 years and prolong independence during old age , concludes an analysis published ahead of print in the British Journal of Sports Medicine .
Aerobic exercise , such as jogging , improves the body 's oxygen consumption and its use in generating energy ( metabolism ) .
But maximal aerobic power starts to fall steadily from middle age , decreasing by around 5 ml / [ kg. min ] every decade .
When it falls below aound18 ml in men and 15 ml in women , it becomes difficult to do very much at all without severe fatigue .
In a typical sedentary man , the maximal aerobic power will have fallen to around 25 mil / [ kg. min ] by the age of 60 , almost half of what it was at the age of 20 .
But the evidence shows that regular aerobic exercise can slow or reverse the inexorable decline , even in later life .
Research shows that relatively high intensity aerobic exercise over a relatively long period boosted maximal aerobic power by 25 % , equivalent to a gain of 6 ml / [ kg.min ] , or 10 to 12 biological years .
" There seems good evidence that the conservation of maximal oxygen intake increases the likelihood that the healthy elderly person will retain functional independence , " says the author .
The other positive spin -offs of aerobic exercise are reduced risks of serious disease , faster recovery after injury or illness , and reduced risks of falls because of the maintenance of muscle power , balance , and coordination .

The smart - skin antenna could replace protruding antennas on airplanes to prevent weakening of the plane ’s mechanical strength .
The new antenna might also be used in consumer electronics devices .
Credit : Seong Ho Son , et al .
The long , wiry antennas that protrude from airplanes , cars , cell phones – and even the bunny ears on some TVs – may one day become novelty items .
Researchers are developing a smart - skin antenna that is simply a thin patch of electrical elements , which could contain a variety of antennas for different purposes within its palm - sized surface .
A team of researchers – Seong Ho Son and Soon Young Eom from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute in the Republic of Korea , and Woonbong Hwang of the Pohang University of Science and Technology in the Republic of Korea – has recently developed a smart - skin material that contains embedded microstrip antennas .
The smart - skin could , for example , become an integral part of a plane or other vehicle , where it could be used for radar , communications , broadcasting reception , GPS , and other applications .
“ The smart - skin antenna provides a new paradigm where the structural surface becomes an antenna , ” Hwang told PhysOrg.com .
“ Because the new kind of antenna is integrated into the structural surface , the antenna can be aerodynamically designed ; the appearance is very nice and no outer space is required for the antenna installation .
[ In airplanes , ] the installation of protruding antennas weakens the mechanical strength of its structure .
So the smart - skin antenna can also improve the structural performance . ”
As the researchers explain in a study published in Smart Materials and Structures , the smart - skin is made of an organic honeycomb structure sandwiched between two dielectric layers .
Several microstrip antennas – basically , metal patches – are embedded within the honeycomb structure in layers .
The flat antennas can then radiate radio - frequency signals , and have a scanning range of 90 degrees .
Stacking microstrip antennas of slightly different sizes slightly offsets their frequencies , which in turn increases the bandwidth of the frequencies and enables faster functioning .
The current system , which operates at 7.5 GHz frequency , has a bandwidth that exceeds 500 MHz .
The honeycomb structure can also accommodate antenna arrays to produce a directional radiation pattern .
By precisely spacing the antennas and changing the phase , the array can also perform electronic beam scanning .
The researchers suggest that the new multi-functional smart - skin might replace the many antennas that typically protrude from vehicles .
The flat antenna design could also lead to innovative radio - frequency communication in vehicles .
“ The smart - skin antenna , with a lightweight , durable , and load - bearing structure , could replace the body and roof panels of vehicles , ” Hwang said .
“ Then , the structural surface itself makes it possible to get services including AM / FM , TV , GPS , DAB ( Digital Audio Broadcasting ) , and DMB ( Digital Multimedia Broadcasting ) . ”
Hwang added that consumer electronics devices , which often rely on wireless communication , could also use the smart - skin antenna concept .
“ Traditionally , the necessary antennas are separately installed into the case of the device and / or are protruded from the case , ” he said .
“ However , the smart - skin antenna technology is helpful to design the new case with structurally - integrated antennas in electronics devices such as cellular phones , laptop computers , etc . ”

Readers will no doubt be shocked — shocked — to hear that the RIAA works for its own self - interest , but a recent Public Knowledge piece suggests that the organization is being more than usually self - interested in two current debates .
On the one hand , the major labels think that webcasters should pay a flat rate for every track streamed , even if this means that a webcaster 's total bill for music exceeds revenues in any given year .
On the other hand , the RIAA does not want to pay a flat rate for its own music , suggesting that a percentage rate of the kind that webcasters were denied is the way to go .
Confused ?
Let 's break it down .
No hobgoblins here
If consistency is the " hobgoblin of little minds , " as Emerson put it , then the music industry must have a collective brain the size of the moon .
Contradictions and paradoxes abound .
For instance : why does satellite radio pay artists and songwriters for playing their songs , but terrestrial radio only pays songwriters ?
Why do webcasters also pay both , but at a different rate ?
When it came to setting webcaster rates last year , the webcasters wanted to pay a percentage , just like satellite radio services do .
But revenue is hard to come by in the webcasting business , so SoundExchange ( an RIAA spinoff that collects the money and redistributes it to labels and artists ) pushed for a flat fee per stream per user .
And it got it last March when the Copyright Royalty Board set the fee at $ 0.0011 per song streamed .
You may recall that this touched off a heated debate over webcasting that escalated to the floor of Congress , as legislation was introduced to overturn the new rates .
Eventually , SoundExchange cut separate deals with both large and small webcasters , though the CRB 's official rates remain unchanged and SoundExchange could enforce them if it wanted to .
Enter the RIAA
The RIAA finds itself in a similar situation , though one that 's been dragging on for a century now .
Back in 1909 , Congress set up a " mechanical royalty " to be paid to songwriters when a physical copy of a sound recording of their work is made .
This rate has been upgraded over time , and today stands at $ 0.091 per track .
That sounds cheap , but it means that a ten - track CD can cost the labels nearly a buck just for the songwriting fees .
And because this is a fixed cost , it becomes harder for the labels to pay as the price of music drops and revenues plunge .
So during the most recent CRB " trial " to fix these rates , the RIAA said that it wanted to move to a percentage model as well .
Cary Sherman , the RIAA boss , reveals in his filing that Cat Stevens ' " The First Cut is the Deepest " is one of his favorite songs ; instead of paying $ 0.091 to Stevens every time an RIAA artist sells a CD with a cover of that song on it ( as Sheryl Crow did recently ) , Sherman suggests that the label pay a percentage instead .
This would solve problems that arose a few years back with " DualDiscs , " where CD audio might be on one side of the disc and DVD - Audio on the other .
In that case , the music publishers ( who represent the songwriters ) argued that they deserved to be paid twice , once for each side .
But that would come to 18 cents per song , which could be nearly $ 2 per album .
Since DualDiscs did n't command much of a price premium , this was unworkable to the labels .
In Sherman 's view , a percentage model would make these problems go away .
" I have increasingly come to believe , " he said , " that the only rate structure that makes sense is a percentage rate that can be applied readily to all products in the marketplace . "
Other filings from executives at EMI and Sony BMG make clear that the labels think the current setup horribly unfair .
As their own revenues tank , the music publishers ( and the songwriters they represent ) continue to rake in that same mechanical rate .
As EMI 's Colin Finkelstein put it , " Record labels bear almost all of the risk . "
Songwriters are shielded from that risk by the fixed nature of the mechanical rate .
What 's good for the goose ...
All of this begs the question : why should the RIAA get a percentage deal for itself but insist on a widely - despised flat - rate deal for webcasters who want its music ?
That 's what Public Knowledge staff attorney Rashmi Rangnath asked this week .
" Is it fair that RIAA / SoundExchange switch to a percentage of revenue model for music sales while holding back the small webcasters from taking advantage of the same for streaming ? " she wrote .
Rashmi Rangnath
Part of the issue is that the RIAA and SoundExchange are separate entities ( though SoundExchange began life as an RIAA subsidiary ) and their interests are no longer exactly aligned .
SoundExchange now includes numerous non-RIAA board members , though it is still the focus of intense debate as to exactly how beholden it is to the major labels .
While Emerson may have downplayed the importance of consistency , it certainly seems like a bit more would be welcome in the music business ... and it's exactly this argument that the RIAA is using its concurrent push to get radio stations to pay up ( radio , webcasting , and satellite should all pay a consistent set of fees ) .
Too bad SoundExchange and its RIAA backers did n't push the CRB to do the same thing for webcasters .
Update : The RIAA tells
Ars that it and SoundExchange did in fact support a percentage rate for webcasters .

The news that his longtime friend William Jacobson had disappeared after a theme party at his East Coast college was a terrible shock to Wil Anderson .
But he was n't surprised that Jacobson had been dressed as William Shakespeare at the party .
A year ago , when the two attended St. Paul 's Central High School , Anderson said , Jacobson enjoyed wearing a vest and a white long - sleeved dress shirt .
" And he did love Shakespeare very much , " he said .
On Wednesday morning , divers found the body of Jacobson , 19 , known as Willie to his friends , in a pond less than half a mile from the house party at Ithaca College in upstate New York , college spokesman Dave Maley said .
There were no indications of foul play , but police are investigating .
Jacobson , a lover of literature , was a freshman majoring in writing , Maley said .
He was last seen between 3:30 and 4 a.m. Sunday at the party .
His roommate reported him missing Monday night .
According to interviews with party - goers , Jacobson had been drinking during the theme event , Maley said .
But whether alcohol was a factor in his death has yet to be determined , he added .
Police are awaiting toxicology results .
Jacobson 's body was found in a retention pond that is just down an embankment from a sidewalk that Jacobson could have been using to get home early Sunday , Maley said .
Asked if it were possible to tumble into the pond , Maley said , " It 's conceivable , yes , " but that it was too early to know exactly what happened .
Jacobson still had his wallet and his cell phone with him , he said .
An on - campus vigil was held Wednesday night .
Maley said that Jacobson 's mother and brother arrived on campus Tuesday , and that other family members were on their way .
Family members did not attend a Wednesday afternoon news conference .
No comment , locally
At Central High School , officials and staff members declined to comment about Jacobson " out of respect to the family , " St. Paul schools spokesman Howie Padilla said .
Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday lashed out at the United States and NATO for igniting a “ new arms race ” and praised his country ’s reviving fortunes at home and abroad in a wide - ranging valedictory address after eight years in office that Moscow wags dubbed “ Putin ’s will . ”
With designated heir apparent Dmitry Medvedev and a sea of Kremlin power brokers filling the ornate St. George Hall , the Russian president delivered a 50 - minute State of the Union - style address that mixed pugnacity toward the West with pride at Russia ’s domestic successes and a laundry list of things still to be done .
“ It is clear that a new arms race has been unleashed on the world , ” Mr. Putin said .
“ It is not our fault , because we did not start it . ”
He repeated old complaints that NATO took advantage of Moscow ’s weakness in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union to expand the alliance to Russia ’s borders and to boost spending on missile defense systems and other programs despite the end of the Cold War .
“ We closed [ Soviet - era ] bases in Cuba and Vietnam .
What did we get ?
New American bases in Romania , Bulgaria , a new third missile defense system in Poland , ” Mr. Putin said .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other top U.S. officials insist the modest missile defense system being considered in Poland and the Czech Republic poses no threat to Russia ’s vast missile arsenal — an argument the Kremlin has never accepted .
“ We are categorically being told these actions are n’t directed at Russia , and therefore our concerns are unfounded , ” Mr. Putin said .
“ That ’s not a constructive response . ”
But Mr. Putin insisted Russia would not be drawn into a new arms race and praised Russia ’s revival since he took power from President Boris Yeltsin in January 2000 .
“ We have returned to the world arena as a state which is taken into consideration , a state that can stand up for itself , ” he said .
Like President Bush , Mr. Putin is finishing up two momentous terms in office .
Unlike Mr. Bush , Mr. Putin is finishing his tenure on a high note , dominating public opinion polls and universally expected to play a major policy role even after the March 2 presidential vote .
Critics in Russia and abroad say that success has come at a price , with human rights and political freedoms suffering as Mr. Putin has centralized power in the Kremlin .
The Russian president devoted the bulk of his speech to Russia ’s domestic situation , saying the country had achieved much but still had far to go .
Noting that economic growth last year was the highest in seven years and that Russia ’s once - battered state coffers were now replenished , Mr. Putin said , “ Today , we have already completely restored the state of socio- economic development we lost in the 1990s . ”
But he noted that Russia still trailed far behind Western economies and that heavy reliance on natural resources — notably vast oil and natural gas deposits — had left the country with an “ inertial scenario of development . ”
“ We are still modernizing our economy in a very fragmented way , ” he said .
Without mentioning Mr. Medvedev once in his address , Mr. Putin said Russia must embark on a broad reform program over the next 12 years in education , in pensions , in taxes , wages and productivity .
Mr. Putin also cited mixed news on the demographic front .
He hailed new figures showing more babies were born in Russia in 2007 than at any year since 1991 — stemming a population decline that has long been a Putin priority .
But he noted that Russian health standards still lag far behind those of industrial countries .
“ Today , every second man in Russia does not have the chance to live to be 60 years old , ” he said .
“ That is shameful . ”

Torch leaves S.F. after surprise route shift
As crowds and tensions increase , San Francisco 's leaders pull a fake - protesters and spectators miss the torch
On Wednesday April 9 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif Photo By Kurt Rogers / San Francisco Chronicle On Wednesday April 9 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif Photo By Kurt Rogers / San Francisco Chronicle Photo : Kurt Rogers Photo : Kurt Rogers Image 1 of / 118 Caption Close Torch leaves S.F. after surprise route shift 1 / 118 Back to Gallery
It was an Olympic - sized fake - out , and by the end of the day , instead of the violent clashes that some had feared , the Beijing Olympic torch run left only thousands of frustrated protesters on one end of San Francisco and mostly relieved runners and officials on the other .
The finger - pointing is bound to go on for days about whether changing the route at the last minute was right .
But on Wednesday , Mayor Gavin Newsom and other officials said that once they got a good look mid-morning at the chanting , surging , flag - waving crowds along the torch 's advertised route , they felt they had no choice .
" If we had started down that ( original ) route , I guarantee you would have seen helmet - clad officers with batons pushing back protesters , " San Francisco Police Chief Heather Fong said .
Complaints about the bait - and - switch rang long and loud from many among the estimated 10,000 people milling along the original route all morning .
Many rallied for a range of causes , such as China 's human rights record and even the idea that the Olympics should be free of politics , and they viewed the torch run as an opportunity to vent their positions before an international audience focused on the torch 's only stop in North America .
All anticipated a noisy , politically charged experience , perhaps even as dramatic as the demonstrations in London and Paris .
Instead , the city pulled a fast one , which was evident from the moment the first runner emerged from AT&T Park and ducked into a cavernous warehouse on Pier 48 instead of heading up the Embarcadero as planned .
Before the crowds could fully react , the torch runners soon emerged mysteriously two miles away on Van Ness Avenue and started a low - key trot northward into the Marina .
Hundreds of police officers flanked the runners on foot and on motorcycles and bicycles , but they were not needed much .
The whole torch run , once the runners began their radically altered route at about 2 p.m. , took less than two hours .
Rather than furious clashes between protesters , there were mostly screams of support and delight at seeing the torch go by .
Mother , son see torch
Nancy Chan of San Francisco , with her son Christian , 4 , ran over from her house two blocks away when she heard that the route was suddenly moved to Van Ness instead of the waterfront .
" This is a once - in - a - lifetime thing for us to see the torch , " she said .
" There is a lot of politics around it , but that is the great thing about America - the free speech . "
Likewise , Joan Woodaver , who works near Van Ness , saw on television that the route had altered and headed over .
But unlike Chan , she toted a sign reading " Free Tibet and Free Burma . "
" I really admire the Dalai Lama , and I feel disturbed that the government of China treats people so poorly , " Woodaver said .
Only three people were arrested Wednesday : one at McCovey Cove and two in the Marina .
However , police did at times shove the crowds back and detain some protesters on the sidelines before letting them go .
The morning had portended a much different , more contentious affair .
The torch was supposed to be carried along the Embarcadero after a 1 p.m. ceremony at AT&T Park on the waterfront , but by early morning thousands of people had already gathered .
Most at first were supporters of China and onlookers who came just to see the torch .
Around 11 a.m. , protesters started to arrive , and the tone changed .
Hundreds of people began screaming and sometimes pushing each other .
Many of the pro-torch demonstrators carried red Chinese flags and said they were bused in by the Chinese Consulate and other pro-China groups , though others said they had come of their own accord .
Meanwhile , opposing demonstrators carried Tibetan flags and preached independence for the country .
Others were on hand to support Burma or rail against China 's backing of the Sudanese government in its war in Darfur .
At one point early in the morning , Jeremy Darrah , 26 , walked into Justin Herman Plaza and began asking pro-China supporters if they knew about Beijing 's backing of the Sudanese government .
He was immediately surrounded by 30 people who told him to go home .
About 10 police officers then stepped in and told Darrah he could not protest in that area because the Chinese supporters had secured permits - an apparent misunderstanding of the city 's official policy to allow all protesters at the site .
The clashes got more intense from then on as crowds of more than 1,000 surged up and down the Embarcadero chanting , " Free Tibet ! " or - less often - " Leave the torch alone ! "
A tense beginning
By the time the torch was lit at McCovey Cove around 1:20 p.m. , the mood in the streets up and down the waterfront was tense , some protesters blocking vehicles they thought contained the torch and others yelling at and pushing each other .
After a few opening remarks by ceremonial officials , the first runner , surrounded by Chinese and American police , headed away from the crowd and into the Pier 48 building .
Unbeknownst to anyone watching , that torch never left the building .
A mile away , the torch runners were gathered at a hotel on O'Farrell Street with one of several backup torches - and they drove with that torch in a convoy up Ellis Street to Van Ness Avenue and Pine Street .
The 70 - plus torchbearers wound up starting their relay there .
A new torch was unloaded from one of the cars and lit , and the runners , carrying the flame in pairs , began to make their way north .
The torch was handed off every half - block or so to a new pair of torchbearers .
As the route progressed , the crowds slowly grew .
At one point , a knot of pro-Tibet demonstrators yelled , " Shame on China !
How dare you represent China ! "
In return , a group of torch supporters yelled back : " They represent the U.S. ! "
By the time the runners got to Broadway , the crowds were five people deep on the sidewalk , mostly screaming support and craning for good views beyond the police lines .
Some protesters caught up to the run along its surprise route , but most stayed at Justin Herman Plaza , where a closing ceremony was planned .
That ceremony was canceled in lieu of a quieter , shorter one , with just officials and the runners , at San Francisco International Airport .
Torch off to Argentina
The torch finally headed out of the city around 3:30 p.m. and arrived at the airport at 4:15 .
The motorcade bearing the torch was immediately whisked to a parking area near the international terminal and placed off limits to the half - dozen protesters and a clutch of news crews .
Airport officials said a chartered Air China plane took off at 9:05 p.m. , carrying the torch to its next stop in Argentina .
Back at Justin Herman Plaza , as word filtered through the crowds that there would be no ending ceremony after all , many reactions ranged from deflated to flat - out angry .
" I am very upset , " said Rosie Salis , 51 , who came in from Foster City to see the relay .
" There were lots of people here with their kids .
They had to wait for four or five hours , and it's very disappointing . "
Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin , a vocal critic of Newsom 's administration , was equally unhappy , as was the local ACLU chapter .
" Gavin Newsom runs San Francisco the way the premier of China runs his country - secrecy , lies , misinformation , lack of transparency and manipulating the populace , " Peskin said .
" He did it so China can report they had a great torch run . "
Newsom emphatically denied those accusations .
" We felt it was in everyone 's best interest that we augment the route , " Newsom said .
" I believe people were afforded the right to protest and support the torch .
You saw that in the streets .
They were not denied the ability to protest . "
Peter Ueberroth , head of the U.S. Olympic Committee , agreed .
He was with the mayor during the run , and he thought the tactics saved the day .
" The city of San Francisco , from a global perspective , will be applauded , " he said .
Exaggeration with Maps
All maps distort whatever data they try to present .
The examples below show , in increasing levels of magnitude , how badly this exaggeration can accumulate with scale .
These examples are n’t being used for propaganda purposes , but illustrate how similar representations could be used in such a way .
Take this example from a recent article on foreclosures in the Chicago area :
Each red square represents a single property under foreclosure .
The problem is that distortion of scale presents the problem as being much worse than it may be .
At the scale of the of the image above ( approximately 13 pixels per mile ) each red marker represents a square of approximately 400 feet on a side .
It ’s enough to make it appear that the entire city about to go bankrupt .
That sea of red certainly elicits a sense of an emergency .
Satellite imagery from the MODIS ( Moderate - resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ) Rapid Response Project which shows near real time heat anomalies ( most often associated with fires ) , has been used to raise awareness of slash and burn deforestation techniques .
Image courtesy of MODIS Rapid Response Project at NASA / GSFC
At this scale though each pixel represents around 1000 square miles .
Looking at the image its not hard to imagine that the entire world is aflame .
Perhaps most exaggerated of all though has to be the images that are typically given to show the accumulation of “ space junk “ — remnants of space flights and defunct satellites , etc .
In this image each pixel represents approximately 114 miles ; so a piece of debris the size of a car is marked with a point the size of Long Island - easily a 6 order of magnitude exaggeration .

Cultured meat becoming a reality , still grossing people out
Today the Times ' environmental blog Dot Earth has a piece about manufactured meat , which is grown in a lab through animal cell cultures instead of as actual animals .
The idea of lab meat has been freaking people out for a few years now as scientists have been figuring out how to culture meat using stem cells .
Advocates point out that cultured meat does n't require killing animals , does n't cause the environmental damage of raising livestock , produces no waste bone , fat , or other tissue , and is essentially no different from making yogurt or wine by processing natural raw ingredients .
And sausages and chicken nuggets are already heavily processed and not really visually recognizable as meat the way a steak or a chicken wing is .
But people still think eating meat grown in a lab is creepy , even if they 're cool with eating actual animal meat that 's been processed into a sausage or chicken nugget .
You also can't grow a pork chop or a wing in a lab .
The Times has been covering this technology for a while , and featured it in the 2005 Year In Ideas issue .
The best part of that article is a photo of mouse stem cells , labeled with the caption , " Tube steak ? "
Dick joke in the Times !
I 'm probably going to stick with Boca 's delicious Chick'n Nuggets and breakfast links , which are pretty much indistinguishable from genuine processed meat already .

Pennsylvania 's Six Week Primary Ends Tonight Hillary : If Iran attacked Israel , " we would be able to totally obliterate them . "
April 22 , 2008  --
For the last six weeks Sens. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , and Barack Obama , D - Ill. , have battled and bickered and both have unleashed a barrage of negativity in television ads that have aired thousands of times in the state .
That barrage of ads will come to an end today as the Democrats of Pennsylvania head to the polls in what could be a make - or - break day for Clinton , or prolong the Democratic primary season into at least another month .
Clinton Ad Features Osama bin Laden
In an ad that began airing in Pennsylvania Monday morning , Clinton implies she is tougher than Obama .
" Who do you think has what it takes ? " the narrator asks in an ad depicting historical images of crises that presidents have had to deal with : Osama bin Laden , headlines about the stock market crash of 1929 , long gas lines from the 1970s oil - shocks , images of the Cold War , Hurricane Katrina and soldiers .
It features the first image of Osama bin Laden to be used in a TV ad this political season .
" It 's the toughest job in the world , " says the ad's narrator .
" You need to be ready for anything — especially now , with two wars , oil prices skyrocketing and an economy in crisis . "
The ad quotes President Harry Truman 's famous line : " If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen , " — to cast Obama as complaining about last week 's ABC News presidential debate .
Responding to the ad , Obama spokesman Bill Burton accused the New York senator of engaging in scare tactics .
Clinton on an Iran Attack : ' Obliterate Them '
Clinton further displayed tough talk in an interview airing on " Good Morning America " Tuesday .
ABC News ' Chris Cuomo asked Clinton what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons .
" I want the Iranians to know that if I 'm the president , we will attack Iran , " Clinton said .
" In the next 10 years , during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel , we would be able to totally obliterate them . "
Watch the full interview with Sen. Hillary Clinton on " GMA " Tuesday .
Obama , for his part , has to be worried about obliterating his repeated promise of a " new kind of politics . "
But he told ABC News ' Robin Roberts on " Good Morning America " his attacks are necessary .
" You 've always got to measure if somebody throws an elbow at you , and after three or four times of gettin ' elbows in the ribs , you know , at what point do you sort of say , ' OK , you know , we , we , we 've gotta put a stop to that ' ? "
Obama said .
Washington a ' Miserable Place '
In Obama 's latest ad airing Monday in Pennsylvania , the ad accuses , " Sen. Clinton has internalized a lot of the strategies , the tactics that have made Washington such a miserable place . "
Campaigning in Bethlehem , Pa. , Monday , Clinton fired back , accusing Obama of running a campaign that is just as negative .
" He has consistently , and including in Pennsylvania , he has sent out mailers , he has run ads misrepresenting what I have proposed , " Clinton said .
The negativity continued this week with Pennsylvania voters receiving automated phone calls .
" Why would Barack Obama vote for a Bush - Cheney energy bill ? " said a robotic call for the Clinton campaign .
" I do n't trust Sen . Clinton as much on issues that are important to sportsmen , " said a call for the Obama campaign .
Going Negative , Going to the Mat
Fittingly , both candidates recorded messages Monday night for WWE pro wrestling .
" This election is starting to feel a lot like ' king of the ring . ' "
Clinton said in the message .
" The only difference ?
The last man standing may just be a woman . "
" To all the forces of division and distraction that has stopped us from making progress for the American people , I 've got one question :
Do you smell what Barack is cooking ? "
Obama said in his message .
In a sign of how much party officials are worried about the damage this intense fight is doing to the Democrats , the North Carolina Democratic Party has canceled a proposed debate , and one of the reasons for the cancelation is a reluctance to further highlight the fighting between the two candidates .
ABC News ' Richard Coolidge , Eloise Harper , and Sunlen Miller contributed to this report .

In her quest to breed the world 's biggest rabbit , Annette Edwards has struck 24 - carrot gold .
Three - year - old Amy , a Continental Giant , now weighs three and a half stone and is 4ft from the tip of her nose to her bumper bobtail .
Scroll down for more ...
Huge :
Amy the rabbit , from Worcester , weighs in at almost three stone - making her the world 's biggest .
She is pictured with her owner Annette Edwards
Thanks to her huge appetite , she is almost a stone heavier and six inches longer than the previous record holder Roberto , also owned by Mrs Edwards .
Both of them dwarf a previous pretender to the throne , a German chap nicknamed Herr Rabbit which was officially a mere 22lb and 3ft 1in .
It wo n't be long , however , before Amy has to surrender her title .
She and Roberto have been busily breeding in their reinforced hutch at their home in Worcester , and Mrs Edwards is confident that one of their 32 offspring will turn out even larger .
The reversal of fortunes in the battle of the superbunnies has astonished the owner of the heavyweight pair .
It was in 2004 that the Daily Mail highlighted Roberto , who was 3ft 6in from back legs to front paws and weighed an astonishing 35lb – heavier than the average three - year - old child .

Giant bunny
Amy dwarfs a normal - sized rabbit
At that time Amy , who is a year Roberto 's junior , was a mere 18 inches long and weighed just over a stone .
Two years later Roberto fought off challenges to his title from a German giant called Rudi , who weighs 22 pounds and measures a mere 3ft 1ins in length .
But the four - year - old buck was finally overtaken by his mate Amy last month .
The doe is now so huge that she has to sleep in an outside dog kennel .
Every day she chomps through enough rabbit food to fill a dog's bowl , as well as two apples , a handful of carrots , half a cabbage and fresh hay .
But Mrs Edwards , 55 , of Worcester , who spends £ 10 a day on Amy 's food , claims that she is not overweight and eats healthily .
She said : " I never thought I would see it but Amy is now officially bigger than Roberto .
" She is enormous but not because she over eats on junk but because she gets plenty of exercise and eats very healthily .

Not a ( cabbage ) patch on Amy : The German giant
" Amy is a fussy eater , the carrots must have their green tops still on , and the hay has to be fresh and green or she wo n't go near it . "
Now Mrs Edwards hopes that the next record holder will be one of Roberto and Amy 's 32 offspring .
Both rabbits were bought from a breeder in Holland while Mrs Edwards was running the Bunnyland pet shop in Worcester .
Two years ago , Mrs Edwards arranged a wedding ceremony for the pair inviting 100 guests to attend the ceremony near her Worcestershire home .
She added : " Luckily there are no jealousy issues - they get on fine .
We do have to keep them separate because if they come to together they start mating - like rabbits .
" She is a dopey thing to be honest , she loves children and she loves attention and she adores my other pets .
" The next record holder will be one of their children - which are all big but still have some growing to do .
" I love the rabbits and I seriously doubt there is a bigger pair in the world right now .
They certainly are an incredible pair of bunnies ! "

by Mikael Rudolph – IFP cofounder
With record turnout last night to the DFL ( Democratic Farmer - Labor ) Party precinct caucuses all over the Twin Cities , impeachment resolutions passed in a number of areas .
In my precinct in Senate District 62 , Precinct 11/7 , the small group that remained until the end of a long night voted narrowly to pass my very strongly worded resolution in support of efforts to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
Barrack Obama won our highly progressive and very involved precinct ’s support 355 - 120 over Hillary Clinton and went on to resoundingly win Minnesota ’s delegates as well .
Last caucus 170 people voted in total so this represents a huge increase in voter participation .
I received a phone call from Tom Lobello this morning who reported that his similar impeachment resolution , taken directly from our website , had passed resoundingly by voice vote in SD 58 , Precinct 4/6 in ‘ Nordeast ’ Minneapolis .
Impeach for Peace cofounder Jodin Morey had similar success at his St. Paul caucus , stating :
“ Mine passed ( ST. PAUL W - 3 P - 12 ) .
I do n’t have an exact count , but it was about 70 - 4 !!!
I also had a friend in MINNEAPOLIS W - 13 P-03 who indicated their impeachment resolution passed .
Another friend reported a UNANIMOUS passing of an impeachment resolution in ST .
PAUL W - 4 P - 16 . ”
Kristin Rafferty checked in from another area of St. Paul with good news as well :
“ I had the resolution from your website all printed up and ready to go .
All I had to read was “ Resolution to Impeach Richard B. Cheney ” and before I began to read anything more , the whole room loudly voted in favor .
One man in the room said , “ How about indictment ? ”
The guy running the meeting pointed out that he remembered me bringing forward that same resolution at one of the last caucuses I attended . ”
It turns out that Ms. Rafferty had introduced an impeachment resolution four years ago that had also been unanimously passed .
From Soren Sorenson :
“ Mine passed in SD 61 Precinct 6 - 4 , I saw it submitted in Precinct 6 - 5 as well , and expect someone took it to precinct 6 - 3 .
I doorknocked and talked impeachment in Comstock Hall yesterday , and I hope students took the resolution to caucus at Coffman Union .
Another friend who attended my pre-caucus feed was going to caucus at Wiley Hall , so that should equal multiple submission sites in SD 59 .
My mom took one to SD 40 Precinct 1 - 10 ( Bloomington ) and it was amended during debate to also include the impeachment of President Bush and it passed .
I had hundreds of website hits from around the state , and I e-mailed out the link to where the resolution could be downloaded to people across the state in every congressional district .
I am on the pre-convention resolutions committee for SD 61 . ”
“ Mikael , this is Delia Jurek reporting from Center City MN .
After spirited discussion we PASSED !!!
an impeachment resolution , unanimously , which I authored .
I am also a delegate , hoping to spur it forward .
Center City is in the 8th Congressional District , Senate District 17 , legislative Dist .
17B , precinct 15 .
I was WOWed .
I am calling Oberstar , my representative , today to tell him of this and ask him to support Kucinich and Wexler work to get this before the judiciary .
See you in DFL convention .
Thanks for your work .
Power to the People !! ”
Another one found online :
“ Minneapolis , MN :
She said there had been a motion submitted and passed to impeach Bush ( merely symbolic , but inspiring ) , as well as one for restrooms for the Airport Taxi employees ( “ Let ’em piss ! ” cheered one supporter ) . ”
This page will be updated as others report in .
Please e-mail me at : [ email protected ] if you have any news of how impeachment resolutions fared around Minnesota and around the rest of the country .
This from Colorado :
“ Being a recent transplant to Colorado , not only had I never caucused before but I had never even lived in a state that held caucuses before , so I was n’t sure what to expect .
Nevertheless things went pretty smoothly overall , given the circumstance of a turnout that was a little too much for the location to handle .
[…]
After the presidential vote there were a few other items of business , but most people did n’t stick around for that , nor did I after a certain point .
The interesting thing about this part is that you can vote on party resolutions , which are just basically statements that are supposed to influence the policy positions of the democratic party in your district , and on up the chain , etc .
You can introduce resolutions there at that time , but there are also ones that are already prepared .
I was n’t prepared for this , and thus did n’t introduce anything .
But , this seems like a good opportunity for introducing a resolution on separation of church and state , which is something that I will keep in mind for the future .
The obligatory “ Impeach Bush and Cheney ” resolution came up , which got resounding cheers , 100 % support , and a few chants of “ send ’em to prison ” . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Teams of university scientists backed by U.S. government funds hope to grow new skin , ears , muscles and other body tissue for troops injured in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Defense Department said on Thursday .

The $ 250 million effort aims to address the Pentagon ’s unprecedented challenge of caring for troops returning from the war zones with multiple traumatic injuries , many of which would have been fatal years ago .
“ We ’ve had just over 900 people , men , some women with amputations of some kind or another since the start of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq , ” said Ward Casscells , assistant secretary of defense for health affairs .
Many have also suffered burns , spinal cord injuries and vision loss .
“ Getting these people up to where they are functioning and reintegrated , employed , able to help their families and be fully participating members of society , this is our task , ” he said .
Under the initiative , the Pentagon launched the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine made up of two teams -- the first led by Wake Forest University in North Carolina and the University of Pittsburgh and the second led by Rutgers University in New Jersey and the Cleveland Clinic .
Their goal is to develop within five years therapies for burn repair , wound healing without scarring , facial reconstruction and limb reconstruction or regeneration .
Scientists with the university teams said such work was already being done and had been demonstrated on animals .
Clinical trials on people have not started .
Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker , the Army ’s surgeon general , expressed hope the therapies could help badly injured troops within just a few years .
He showed a photo of a Marine with burns covering his head .
He said the Marine had undergone 40 operations , but there was currently no way to rebuild his ears or nose .
Using methods being studied , the Marine ’s stem cells could be used to grow more cells that are then painted on a scaffold in the shape of his ears and nose .
After an incubation period of weeks , the biodegradable scaffold would be implanted on the skin and absorbed , ultimately becoming fully functional , Schoomaker said .
“ We ’re embarking on a new generation of research that ’s going to redefine the Army and military medicine as we know it today , ” he told reporters at the Pentagon .
Roadside bombs , known as improvised explosive devices , and suicide bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to a dramatic increase in blast trauma among U.S. troops .
Medical advances have kept many of those service members alive , requiring long - term specialized care from a military health system under fire for miring troops in bureaucracy .
The Defense Department has dedicated $ 85 million to the regenerative health project .
The rest of the funding comes from other parts of the federal government , state agencies and academic institutions .
The law also allowed states to establish their own goals for improving graduation rates .
Many set them low .
Nevada , for instance , pledged to get just 50 percent of its students to graduate on time .
And since the law required no annual measures of progress , California proposed that even a one - tenth of 1 percent annual improvement in its graduation rate should suffice .
Daniel J. Losen , who has studied dropout reporting for the Civil Rights Project at the University of California , Los Angeles , said he once pointed out to a state official that , at that pace , it would take California 500 years to meet its graduation goal .
“ In California , we ’re patient , ” Mr. Losen recalled the official saying .
Most troublesome to some experts was the way the No Child law ’s mandate to bring students to proficiency on tests , coupled with its lack of a requirement that they graduate , created a perverse incentive to push students to drop out .
If low - achieving students leave school early , a school ’s performance can rise .
No study has documented that the law has produced such an effect nationwide .
Experts say they believe many low - scoring students are prodded to leave school , often by school officials urging them to seek an equivalency certificate known as a General Educational Development diploma .
“ They get them out so they do n’t have them taking those tests , ” said Wanda Holly - Stirewalt , director of a program in Jackson , Miss. , that helps dropouts earn a G.E.D .
“ We ’ve heard that a lot .
It happens all over the system . ”
After several research groups questioned graduation rates , the federal Department of Education in 2005 published an estimated rate for each state , to identify those that were reporting least accurately .
The figures suggested that nine states had overstated their graduation rates by 10 to 22 percentage points .
Part of the discrepancy is because many states inflate their official rate by counting dropouts who later earn a G.E.D. as graduates or by removing them from calculations altogether .
It was gratifying to see - after only a one - week delay - the government announcing that they would follow my suggestion on the comment pages last week , and demand that drug companies disclose all trial data , to make sure they 're not hiding anything .
This has been pegged to the issue of undisclosed side - effects of antidepressants , because a drug company hiding side - effects is intuitively evil .
This is unfortunate because - as I have repeatedly argued - much more worrying is the tendency to only publish results which show your drug performing well , and to leave the less flattering trials in a desk drawer .
This happens much more commonly , it makes drugs look better than they are , it wastes money , it exposes people to risks of unnecessary side - effects , and it leaves doctors prescribing on inaccurate information .
But how can you tell if the research literature on a given subject has been rigged ?
It 's a tricky problem , because you 're chasing evidence for the existence of trials you cannot see .
One option is to use mathematical tools , and something called a funnel plot , one of the cleverest ideas of the last century .
It 's so clever that you might need to concentrate for the next bit .
Let 's imagine that there are 30 trials on a given drug .
Some are big , and more accurate .
Some are small and less accurate , with more random noise .
You 'd expect that the big , accurate trials should all cluster together around the true finding , all giving similar results for the efficacy of a drug .
Meanwhile the smaller , rubbish trials - because they are less accurate measures of the drugs efficacy - will be scattered about randomly , some showing the treatment to be better than the good big trials indicate , some showing that it is worse .
You could then plot all your trials on a graph , one dot for each trial .
On the x -axis , left to right , is " how good the drug was shown to be by this trial " and on the y - axis , " how methodologically sound and large the trial was " .
If there is no publication bias , you should get a triangle shape : at the top of your graph , you will see all your good - quality , accurate trials , clustered together around the true answer .
At the bottom of the graph , you will see a broad smear of results , the poor quality trials showing random variation .
But if there is publication bias , you will see a distorted triangle : the small , poor - quality trials at the bottom will be smeared over to the right , because small trials with unwelcome results are much more likely to be overlooked , and dumped in desk drawers , than huge multicentre collaborative studies involving dozens of academics and tens of thousands of participants , which are almost definitely going to get published .
If you get a distorted triangle , you know there are some interesting negative trials missing .
This happens repeatedly , in too many fields to list , and it does n't just happen because of big pharma evil .
If you 're an academic , and you get a negative result , you 're less likely to get round to publishing it , because it 's not going to get in a big journal , so it 's not going to buff your department 's " research assessment exercise " score for this year , nobody 's going to invite you to give lectures about it , the whole thing feels like a disappointing waste of time .
And even though you know in your heart that a negative finding is still an interesting piece of evidence there are undergraduates that need teaching and you hate doing that and the references for that other paper need reformatting before submission to a third journal and before you know it five years have passed and nobody 's even mentioned the negative finding at the departmental meeting since the last prof retired so you can probably get away with leaving it for another year at least and possibly even ideally until you die .
I 've said it before : all trials should be registered before they start , no trial - by anybody - should be passed by any ethics committee without a firm commitment to publish .
No exceptions , because bad data costs lives .

“ I know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion as in America . ”
Alexis de Tocqueville , in Democracy in America
In Democracy in America , published in 1835 , Tocqueville wrote of the New World and its burgeoning democratic order .
Observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist , Tocqueville wrote of his travels through America ( both in the United States and Canada ) in the early 19th century when the market revolution , Western expansion , and Jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the fabric of American life .
He saw democracy as an equation that balanced liberty and equality , concern for the individual as well as the community .
A critic of individualism , Tocqueville thought that association , the coming together of people for common purpose , would bind Americans to an idea of nation larger than selfish desires , thus making a civil society which was n’t exclusively dependent on the state .

" Do I have fat days ?
Of course , but what woman does n't ! "

The teenager , who has been signed up by the Models Plus agency , added : " Everybody thinks you have to be a tall , slim blonde and I 'm a curvy brunette .
" I want to show it is possible to be beautiful and not a standard size zero . "
" The reaction I 've had is great .
Other girls have told me I have really boosted their confidence , which is terrific . "
" I wanted to make a bit of a statement .
When I studied the other entrants for the Miss Surrey competition I concluded that pretty as the contestants were , they were equally all uniformly blonde and Barbie doll like .
" My mum is really happy and proud of me that I am doing something not just for myself but other people as well and my friends are really supportive , they can't stop going on about it . "

If there 's one universal constant in human society , it has to be alcohol .
Rare indeed is the culture that has n't worked out the tricksy process of fermenting and / or distilling some type of vegetable matter -- be it malted barley , potatoes , honey or grape juice -- into a brew containing a significant percentage , as the dictionary puts it , of an " organic compound in which a hydroxyl group is bound to a carbon atom of an alkyl or substituted alkyl group . "
In other words , booze .
Among the mildest and most variable of these alcoholic beverages is that fine elixir known as beer .
A true beer connoisseur would never pass up an opportunity to try the local brew , no matter where on Earth where they found themselves , and so it behooves the serious beerologist to know how to order a beer in as many languages as possible .
That 's why we 've taken it upon ourselves to provide you with a handy guide on how to order a beer in 50 different languages .

With the recent presentation of the latest google service called Google App Engine , it is even more clear that there is a single very important missing opensource solution to write scalable and reliable web applications : that is as simple to use as to buy N cheap PCs linked together via LAN running this DB system that makes it easy to add more servers as needed .
To scale the http servers side of a web application is trivial , expecially if you avoid to take state in the server itself avoiding sessions : every web server is just a copy of all the other one with a balancer on top that makes sure the load is dispatched among your http servers .
Instead for the DB back end there is no easy solution : MySQL sucks at this and PostgreSQL is not better AFAIK .
They are simply hard to use as a cluster that automagically take care of growing load and data redundancy problems .
We really need a simple to use solution that just let us to add / remove servers as needed , and of course able to handle the failure of some PC in the cluster .
Something that allows to remove the server and add a new one , tell the cluster of what is happening and it will resync the new machine ( or the fixed one ) in background without downtimes .
It does not matter even if it is not a fully features ANSI SQL , something like GQL or even simpler can be enough for most developers , but we really need it in the future because the current LAMP architecture simply does not scale well in a transparent way .
my friend David Welton pointed out that Mnesia looks interesting but the fact that it's not remotely close to sql , and has some limitations on data size are big problems .
Also it 's worth to remember what are the problems with MySQL cluster : the data set can't be larger than the RAM of the PC , not all the nodes are the same , there is a Master that is a single point of failure , and it does not auto - sync in a transparent way when you add servers .

American Al Qaeda Leader To Bush : ' We Will Be Waiting For You ' Native Californian al Qaeda leader makes threats against Bush Middle East visit .
Jan. 6 , 2008  -- American Al Qaeda leader Adam Gadahn told his followers to welcome Bush " with bombs and traps " upon his upcoming visit to the Middle East this week .
" The occupied territories are awaiting their first visit by the crusader Bush and the mujahideen are also waiting for him , " said Gadahn , a California native and now an Al Qaeda spokesman .
Gadahn is the star of the latest al Qaeda propaganda video to be posted online by the group 's media wing , As Sahab .
In his newest dramatic gesture , Gadahn tore up his U.S. passport in protest of the imprisonment of fellow al Qaeda followers Abu Zubaydah , John Walker Lindh and Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman .
" I do n't need it to travel anyway , " he said afterwards .
Gadahn made reference to November 's Annapolis conference of Middle Eastern leaders , saying it was a gathering of Bush 's " loyal puppets . "
He said the United States has been " unmistakably defeated " in Iraq in Afghanistan and has lost the battle for hearts and minds " in spectacular fashion . "
" They 're about to hand the whole mess over to local proxies who , if they have n't already , shall soon rue the day they sold their souls and religion to the American devil , " Gadahn said .
Gadahn also made reference to Pakistan , but did n't mention the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto , indicating the video may have been made before her death .
Rather , he said Al Qaeda " continues to strike the ruling regime " there as it fights against President Pervez Musharraf 's " farce of elections . "
Gadahn , who is under federal indictment for treason , is believed to be hiding in Pakistan .
He left Orange County , Calif. , almost 10 years ago for Pakistan and has been a regular feature in al Qaeda videos , at first wearing a mask , but he has been appearing unveiled for more than a year now .
He often threatens to continue to target the United States at home and abroad .
Despite his rejection of U.S. citizenship , Gadahn made reference to the mortgage crisis in the United States , saying that it was triggered by right - wing fanatics trying to usher in the " end days . "

It ’s a sign of the amount of raw misinformation floating around the FISA debate that even fundamentally smart and conscientious conservative writers often get the story badly wrong .
And by this , I really do n’t just mean “ come to a normative conclusion I disagree with ” or “ weigh competing policy values in a non-libertarian way . ”
I mean “ blow the basic facts . ”
Consider , as a sort of case study , Matt Continetti’s FISA editorial in the most recent Weekly Standard .
He begins with a bunch of throat clearing to the effect that the lapsing of the Protect America
Act has put us all in danger , and this is somehow the fault of Democrats , who repeatedly offered to extend the PAA — and who , unfortunately , appeared all along to be perfectly willing to sign off on a more permanent surveillance bill if the issue of telecom immunity was broken out to be considered separately .
And then the real wrongness begins :
It is true that the wiretaps granted under the Protect America
Act may be continued for a year from their date of issue .
If a wiretap was approved on December 5 , 2007 , for example , it legally can remain in place until December 5 , 2008 .
But any new wiretaps the government seeks will have to go through stringent FISA procedures , which require the government to show “ probable cause ” that a “ U.S. person ” is a “ foreign power ” or an “ agent of a foreign power ” before a search warrant targeting him can be issued .
And this is troubling because–pace Richard Clarke–the old FISA did n’t and does n’t work .
First , under any of the legislation under consideration , you would still need a FISA warrant to “ target ” a U.S. person .
Nobody , as far as I can tell , wants to eliminate that requirement .
What controversy exists here is over how to deal with collection of U.S. persons ’ communications in the course of acquisitions whose target is a non-U.S. person .
Second , it is at the very least highly misleading to say that “ new wiretaps ” are not covered by existing authorizations under the PAA .
That ’s because these “ authorizations ” are frequently general orders specifying an organization or corporate entity ( e.g. “ Al Qaeda ” ) , meaning that new individual targets and facilities — in other words “ new wiretaps ” — can be added to these existing orders .
And indeed , this has already been done since the PAA lapsed .
More importantly , even if there were no PAA , it is just not true that all new wiretaps would require FISA orders .
But we ’ll get back to that .
Let ’s review what brought us to this impasse .
Back in December 2005 , the New York Times reported that , “ months after the Sept. 11 attacks , ” President Bush “ secretly authorized ” the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to “ eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States ” in order to gather intelligence “ without the court - approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying . ”
Now , the NSA ’s Terrorist Surveillance Program was n’t so secret , it turns out ; select members of Congress , Democratic and Republican , had been informed of its existence long before the Times ‘s blockbuster report , and none of them seemed to have had a problem with it .
False .
And frankly , there ’s no excuse for getting this wrong , since it requires all of ten seconds to confirm that this is false if you ’ve mastered an arcane technology called “ Google . ”
Several of the Democratic members of Congress who were briefed about the NSA program did object at the time ; others say that the briefings they received were highly misleading about the full extent of surveillance .
Of course , given the classified nature of the program , they were not at liberty to make their objections public .
( We can imagine what the Weekly Standard would have written if they had . )
It turns out , further , that the NSA was n’t spying on Americans willy - nilly .
Most of the warrantless surveillance targets were foreign nationals located overseas , though the program also surveilled the 500 - odd people in the United States with whom those overseas targets were communicating .
The first assertion can’t possibly be made with any confidence .
It has become transparently clear over time that most of what we know about the “ NSA program ” concerns one component of much broader surveillance authorized by the president after 9/11 .
We know that whatever else was going on , some of it was so extensive that top Justice officials , including John Ashcroft and FBI head Robert Mueller , were ready to resign if the president reauthorized it over the objections of the acting Attorney General , even as the “ Terrorist Surveillance Program ” we know about continued without incident .
The second sentence is simply wrong about the number of Americans surveilled , and again , can be easily checked against the original reporting on the program :
The NSA was listening in on 500 Americans at any given time , which over the course of several years almost certainly means many , many more than that in total .
Nor was it at all clear whether or not FISA superseded the president ’s plenary , constitutional authority to “ protect and defend ” the United States from attack .
No court has ever said so .
First ,
Matt has apparently mistaken the language of the oath of office for an affirmative grant of authority — of plenary authority no less .
Second , in his haste to save us all from scary terrorists , he has neglected to finish reading the sentence he is quoting , in which the president pledges to “ protect and defend ” the Constitution of the United States ( would n’t that be nice ! ) , not to guard against attacks .
Third , on the substantive question , no court has had occasion to consider the matter .
But one could as easily say that FISA has been around for thirty years , and no court has ruled it to be in conflict with the Constitution either .
As for this particular program , one district judge and one appellate judge ( in a minority opinion ) have considered the NSA program on the merits and found that it was illegal .
The majority on that appellate panel declined to take up the substantive question for reasons of standing .
And no administration , including Carter ’s and Clinton ’s , has ever accepted FISA as determinative of its constitutional power .
It ’s hard to know just what Continetti means here .
Some conservatives have taken to quoting counsel for the Clinton administration out of context as asserting “ inherent authority ” to conduct surveillance in spite of FISA , when in fact they were asserting that the president could authorize physical searches back when FISA did not cover such searches .
So in a very technical sense , this is true : Presidents have asserted the power to act when Congress is silent .
The FISA statute is not “ determinative ” of the executive ’s “ constitutional power , ” more or less as a definitional matter .
It does not follow from this that the executive ’s discretion cannot be limited by Congress , under its own constitutional authority to regulate the same forces that the president commands .
Anyway , Continetti reminds us that the president finally deigned to submit ( some of ) his spying to court oversight , and then gives us this :
The FISA court decided that calls or emails merely routed through the United States were , in fact , domestic communications falling under the “ probable cause ” evidentiary standard .
It did n’t matter that the target and the recipient of his communications might both be abroad–if the electrons zipped across the United States , as they often do in a globally networked world , then a warrant was required to listen in .
By the miracle of technology , Abu Omar and Mullah Mohamed in Pakistan could both be “ U.S. persons . ”
OK , pay attention here , because this is really , really important : THIS IS NOT TRUE .
We now have confirmation from the top national security lawyer at Justice that , as experts on FISA have been saying all along , foreign - to - foreign wire and radio conversations have never been and are not now subject to FISA .
There is , rather , a limited problem with e-mails sent by a target that end up stored on a U.S. server , when we do n’t know where the recipient is ( or will be when he downloads the message ) .
In fairness , Continetti wrote his editorial before this news came out , but informed people , including former top national security lawyers at Justice , have been saying all along that the FISA court could not possibly have imposed a blanket warrant requirement on foreign - to - foreign intercepts .
And at any rate , that is not at all the same thing as making Osama bin Laden a “ U.S. person ” under the law .
Meanwhile , the ACLU and the tort bar filed lawsuits against the telecommunication companies that had cooperated with the U.S. government in the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Naturally , the telecoms , fearing that they soon would be paying damages , grew wary of cooperation with the government .
Wariness that I suppose might be a cause for concern if they had any choice in the matter of “ cooperation with the government , ” at least when the government follows the law .
And some of the FISA judges –the same folks often accused of “ rubberstamping ” the executive ’s wishes–raised the bar that needed to be met before counterterrorist surveillance could begin .
I ’m not even going to say anything here ; just look at the numbers .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell recently told Fox News Channel ’s Chris Wallace that by summer 2007 , “ We were in extremis , because we had lost .??.??. about two - thirds of our [ surveillance ] capability . ”
While this does n’t strike me as credible , there ’s no independent way to confirm or rebut this , so I suppose McConnell can say whatever he wants .
He can even say different and contradictory things from week to week .
Now , let ’s skip a bit …
At issue is the so - called “ retroactive immunity . ”
The House Democratic leadership does n’t like it .
Most of their arguments against retroactive immunity are n’t any more sophisticated than Senator Edward Kennedy ’s disgusting assertion that President Bush is “ willing to let Americans die to protect the phone companies . ”
But the crux of the anti-immunity Democrats ’ argument seems to be that because the original Terrorist Surveillance Program was “ illegal ” and the phone companies were complicit in its “ illegality , ” they therefore should be liable for damages resulting from such “ illegal ” invasions of privacy .
If the program was not illegal , or even if it was but the telecoms had a good faith belief that it was lawful , then there is no need for immunity :
The courts will quickly establish as much , and they wo n’t be liable for any damages .
If any Democratic legislators have asserted , not only that the ACLU should have its day in court , but that the telecoms actually owe damages , then I have n’t heard it .
This is wrong on all counts .
The Terrorist Surveillance Program was not illegal .
This is just a bald , unargued assertion .
And as mentioned earlier , that is not the opinion of the only two judges to have actually considered the question .
In fact , it does n’t seem to be the opinion of too many legal experts who have not been employed by the Bush administration .
And the telecoms were engaged in a good - faith effort to help the federal government protect the United States from attack .
Is n’t that how we should want corporations to behave in a time of war ?
Given the available facts , I have no idea what the state of mind of the people in charge at the telecoms was during the years that the TSP was carried out secretly .
Neither does Matt Continetti .
But since he asked :
No , we should want corporations to follow the law .
We get a few paragraphs worth of handwringing about telecoms wary of “ cooperating ” with the government , even though they have to cooperate when surveillance is consistent with the law , and the concession that immunity is , in fact , irrelevant if the TSP was legal after all .
And then :
And that ’s pernicious nonsense .
Apolitical career types like McConnell , FBI director Robert Mueller , and attorney general Michael Mukasey ,
Oh God , my sides … whew .
Sorry , needed a minute to catch my breath …
along with Democrats like Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller , agree on this .
It was fear of the FISA court , after all , that prevented Minnesota FBI field agents from searching the laptop of al Qaeda terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui–the suspicious student at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Eagan , Minnesota–even though they knew about Moussaoui ’s jihadist beliefs and connection to a Chechen terrorist .
Except , as a Senate Judiciary Committee report found , the problem here was with the FBI , not FISA :
The FBI declined to seek a warrant — purportedly because they feared they ’d be turned down — even though they did have legal grounds for one .
But , uh , this also has nothing to do with the Protect America Act or its successor legislation .
In order to physically search the computer of a target located within the U.S. , a warrant would still be necessary , under any of these laws .
Congress returns from recess this week .
As we go to press , Speaker Pelosi continues to indicate she will not allow a vote on the bipartisan Senate surveillance bill .
This demonstrates a fundamental lack of seriousness about national security on the part of congressional Democrats .
Newsflash : The United States faces a persistent threat of attack from a terrorist organization with global reach and the desire to massacre as many innocent people as possible .
Do House Democrats really want to make the terrorists ’ jobs any easier ?
Should we give a shit about the answer to a tendentious rhetorical question predicated on a string of falsehoods ?
I ’m just askin ’ .
I went to the ABC News website tonight to see the creepy Wal - Mart videos .
Instead , I became fixated on something truly disturbing .
This latest revelation is something you kind of thought probably happened at the top levels of the Bush administration :
In dozens of top - secret talks and meetings in the White House , the most senior Bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , sources tell ABC News .
The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of “ combined ” interrogation techniques — using different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time — on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects — whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding .
The high - level discussions about these “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .
What did Bush know — and what was his preferred method of torture — are the next questions we need answered .
Churches Should Stay Out of Government
SPEAKING OUT : Churches Should Stay Out of Government by Chuck Baldwin
To any honest observer of history , the conditions of the Church in America today are eerily similar to those of the Church in Nazi Germany .
I f the reader has not already done so , I again urge you to read the book , Hitler 's Cross , which was written by Erwin Lutzer and published by Moody Press .
This book should be " required reading " for every pastor and Christian layman in America .
In his book , Lutzer focuses on the attitudes and actions of Germany 's pastors and churches during the rise and reign of the Third Reich .
It is a masterpiece .
For those of us living in a country and time far removed from Hitler 's Germany , it is hard to comprehend how that nation 's Christians — and especially its ministers — could have been so thoroughly taken in by old Adolf .
We assume such an event could never happen again — especially to us .
However , to any honest observer of history , the conditions of the Church in America today are eerily similar to those of the Church in Nazi Germany .
For one thing , as did the Church in Nazi Germany , the Church in America has become infatuated with Big Government .
Historically , patriotism in the United States meant love for God , love for family , and love for freedom and independence .
Today , however , Christians of all persuasions have come to accept and even embrace the Nanny State , complete with its intrinsic obsession with an omnipotent federal bureaucracy that exercises perpetual surveillance and absolute control over every area of our lives .
For example , according to today 's Republican Presidential candidates ( with the exception of Ron Paul ) , patriotism demands that we click our heels to the Department of Homeland Security and that we enthusiastically support aggressive , preemptive war .
This is exactly the kind of redefinition of patriotism used so brilliantly by Hitler and his fellow propagandists .
Yes , Martha , it appears that history really does repeat itself .
When Ron Paul was asked about Mike Huckabee 's overt usage of a cross for a campaign advertisement , he quoted Sinclair Lewis as saying , " When fascism comes to America , it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross . "
When Ron Paul was asked about Mike Huckabee 's overt usage of a cross for a campaign advertisement , he quoted Sinclair Lewis as saying , " When fascism comes to America , it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross . "
Many Christians railed against Dr. Paul for making this comment .
However , the truth is , Ron Paul ( himself a committed Christian ) is one hundred percent right !
( To see how Hitler used this same tactic , I invite readers to note the photograph of the German Fuhrer in Lutzer 's book , on page 75 , which shows Hitler coming out of church with a large emblem of the Cross directly over his head .
This photo was used extensively by Hitler during his political campaigns . )
More than any other Republican Presidential candidate , Mike Huckabee carries his Big Government machinations on a cross .
I strongly recommend that readers take a look at Selwyn Duke 's excellent exposé on Mike Huckabee .
Christians throughout Germany were convinced that Hitler was " God 's man . "
They saw him as more than a political leader : he was a spiritual leader as well .
In his book , Lutzer notes that the tool Adolf Hitler used to ascend to power in Germany was his ability to wrap the Nazi flag around the Cross of Christ .
In fact , Hitler often required that the Cross be emblazoned directly in the middle of the Nazi flag .
These flags were not only prominently displayed in parades , but also in church auditoriums .
As a result of Hitler 's brilliant deception , Christians throughout Germany were convinced that he was " God 's man . "
They saw him as more than a political leader : he was a spiritual leader as well .
They saw him as their country 's President and as their Christian brother .
If Hitler said the German people needed to surrender their firearms , they saw it as their Christian duty to comply ; if Hitler said they needed to enact a total surveillance society , they freely gave up their privacy ; if Hitler said Germany needed to invade other nations for its security , Christians were among the first to volunteer ; and if Hitler said they could only be good Christians if they supported the Nazi Party , they enthusiastically supported the Nazi Party .
In short , Germany 's Christians and pastors surrendered their hearts and minds to Adolf Hitler , because they believed him to be one of them .
What they never would have surrendered to a professing agnostic , they gladly surrendered to a professing Christian .
Truly , fascism came to Germany " wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross . "
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Christian minister who actively opposed Hitler by organizing what he called the " Confessing Church . "
These were believers who would not surrender Christ 's sphere of authority to Hitler .
They saw through " Hitler 's Cross . "
Of course , there were a few in Germany who saw through Hitler 's deception .
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Christian minister who actively opposed Hitler by organizing what he called the " Confessing Church . "
These were believers who would not surrender Christ 's sphere of authority to Hitler .
They saw through " Hitler 's Cross . "
Unfortunately , of the more than 14,000 pastors in Germany , only 800 joined with Bonhoeffer .
To the vast majority of Germany 's pastors , Bonhoeffer was an " extremist , " or a " kook , " or a " nut . "
They relegated Bonhoeffer to the fringe of Christendom .
They believed Hitler and repudiated Bonhoeffer ; they chose Hitler 's " German Church " over the Confessing Church .
In retrospect , however , who would they follow today , if they had the chance ?
Likewise , many Christians and ministers today have succumbed to the purveyors of internationalism .
Issues such as trade , climate control , health and education — and even war — are the tools globalists use to construct their One World Order .
For example , Mike Huckabee 's success in Iowa is largely due to the pastors and Christians of that State buying into his " Christian " campaign .
In a manner very similar to the 2000 campaign of George W. Bush , Huckabee has carried his political campaign on the Cross .
At the same time , however , Mike Huckabee ( as does George W. Bush ) embraces and promotes globalism .
And , unfortunately , many Christians and pastors do not seem to notice or care .
In a previous column , I wrote this : " Have you wondered why Mike Huckabee is suddenly getting so much favorable attention from the mainstream media ( who themselves are controlled by this gaggle of global elite ) ?
To find the answer as to why a professing pro-life , conservative Christian would suddenly become the darling of the media , look no further than the fact that just a couple of months ago , Mr. Huckabee appeared before the globalist - minded Council on Foreign Relations .
( Read his speech here . )
And when he did , it became abundantly clear that Huckabee was a man globalists could trust .
" By the way , as you read Huckabee 's speech , you will find that he is George W. Bush on steroids !
This is a man who intends to meddle in the affairs of nations around the world like you can't believe .
Talk about entangling alliances : Huckabee intends for our State , Energy , Housing , Education , Justice , Treasury , and Transportation departments to spend untold billions of tax dollars on just about anything and everything , including schools , medical facilities , roads , sewage treatment , water filtration , electricity , and legal and banking systems in countries all over the globe .
And that is exactly the kind of man the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) wants in Washington . "
After reporting the connection between Mike Huckabee and the CFR , numerous Christians quickly consigned my soul to the regions of the damned and accused me of being a " nut . "
Some emphatically declared that I had no right to criticize " a Christian brother . "
Now , who does that sound like ?
More importantly , however , is the question , Were my remarks accurate ?
And the answer is , Yes , they were .
We now learn that Mike Huckabee has named Richard Haass as his advisor on foreign policy .
And just who is Richard Haass ?
He is the President of the CFR .
And what does Haass believe ?
He believes that the United States ( and every other country ) must surrender its sovereignty to international or global entities .
On February 21 , 2006 , Haass wrote a column for the Taipei Times entitled , " State Sovereignty Must be Altered in Globalized Era . "
This treatise is nothing more than an explicit solicitation for global government .
In his treatise , Haass writes , " For 350 years , sovereignty — the notion that states are the central actors on the world stage and that governments are essentially free to do what they want within their own territory but not within the territory of other states — has provided the organizing principle of international relations .
The time has come to rethink this notion . "
He also wrote , " Moreover , states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function . "
He went on to say , " [ S ] overeignty must be redefined if states are to cope with globalization .
"
He further said , " Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality , but that it needs to become weaker .
States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves ... Sovereignty is no longer a sanctuary . "
Haass also wrote , " Our notion of sovereignty must therefore be conditional , even contractual , rather than absolute . "
Haass then summarized his desire for global government by saying , " The goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalization , to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy . "
These are the sentiments of the man that the " Christian conservative " Mike Huckabee has chosen to be his foreign policy advisor .
Can you not see how , once again , a global government elitist wraps his Big Government ambitions around the Cross of Jesus Christ ?
We desperately need Bonhoeffer 's " Confessing Church " in America .
If pastors do not quickly wake up to the way most of our politicians — even those who profess to be Christians — are selling out America 's sovereignty and independence , our wonderful country will not long survive .
I have attempted to resurrect the " Confessing Church " in the form of a 21st Century " Black Regiment . "
Students of U.S. history recognize the " Black Regiment " as those Colonial Patriot - Pastors who led their churches to assist the efforts of America 's fight for independence .
Currently , we have over 100 pastors , evangelists , and missionaries listed on our Black Regiment directory .
( See the Black Regiment directory here . )
I , once again , encourage readers to buy Lutzer 's book , Hitler 's Cross .
I 'm praying that this time there will arise an army of Dietrich Bonhoeffers to lead a modern - day revival of true patriotism : love for God , love for family , and a strong love and commitment to freedom and independence .
Call it the " Confessing Church , " or the " Black Regiment . "
Call it what you will : we need it desperately , and we need it now .

A top Al Qaeda commander who trained and led foreign militants assisting the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan has been killed in neighboring Pakistan , officials said Thursday in what appeared to be a significant victory for U.S. - led forces hunting members of the terrorist network .
The death of Libyan - born Abu Laith al Libi was reported on militant websites , which praised him as a martyr who died helping lead a “ holy war ” against the West .
While Al Libi ’s death had not yet been confirmed by forensic evidence , a Western counter - terrorism official said intelligence agencies believed the postings were authentic , and that the militant had been killed within the last few days .
Some other senior Al Qaeda leaders may have died along with him , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss classified intelligence .
“ They have lost their senior paramilitary commander for Afghanistan , ” the official said .
“ It does n’t mean he could n’t be replaced .
But it does mean that Al Qaeda has lost a very seasoned commander with a great deal of experience . ”
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Brian Maka said Al Libi was killed in Pakistan , but he provided no details and referred calls to the Pakistani government .
Officials would not comment on whether Al Libi ’s death was related to a suspected CIA airstrike this week on an alleged Al Qaeda compound in the Waziristan region of northwest Pakistan .
Less than 48 hours before the report of Al Libi ’s death emerged , residents had reported a missile strike on the small compound just outside the town of Mir Ali , which is considered a militant stronghold .
Local officials had said about 12 people were killed in the strike late Monday or early Tuesday , most of them “ foreigners ” -- Arabs and Central Asians , which fits the profile of Al Qaeda fighters present in the tribal areas .
Witnesses said they heard what they believed were Predator drones flying in the area shortly before the compound was hit .
But on Wednesday and Thursday , Pakistani officials , including Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema and army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas , denied any knowledge of the strike , or of Al Qaeda deaths in it .
Airstrikes by the United States on Al Qaeda targets in Pakistan have occurred in the past , but they are extremely sensitive , given the Islamabad government ’s stated policy of not allowing U.S. military actions within its borders , American intelligence officials said .
The strike in North Waziristan came just three weeks before highly contentious elections in Pakistan , and as an influential group of U.S. diplomatic and military experts warned that the international effort to stabilize Afghanistan was faltering .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is under international pressure to restore democratic freedoms and ensure that the Feb. 18 balloting will be fair .
While the war against Islamic militants is unpopular in Pakistan , Musharraf ’s government has often been known to move against militants at times of pressure from the Bush administration to do more to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The experts warned that the Taliban , regarded as largely defeated just two years ago , has been able to infiltrate and control sizable parts of southern and southeastern Afghanistan .
Two suicide bombings Thursday killed seven people , including the deputy governor of Helmand province .
A coordinated attack Jan. 14 by Taliban militants on a hotel in Kabul , the Afghan capital , frequented by foreigners killed seven staff members and visitors .
Al Libi had taken on increasing prominence within Al Qaeda in recent years as a liaison to the Taliban , a battlefield commander and trainer of fighters in Afghanistan who regularly engaged U.S. and allied forces , according to the Western official .
The Libyan oversaw networks “ that trained , prepared and deployed fighters from different groups and different countries ” in Afghanistan and across the border in the tribal areas of Pakistan , where Al Qaeda ’s leadership is believed to be hiding , the official said .
He was particularly close to fighters from Central Asia who have become some of the most feared by American and NATO forces in Afghanistan , the Western official said .
“ You could place this guy in the top half - dozen figures in Al Qaeda , ” the Western official said .
“ He was a senior operational figure . ”
M. Akram Shaheedi , Pakistan ’s press attache in Washington , said his government believed that several Al Qaeda operatives were killed in this week ’s attack , but that authorities had not yet identified them .
“ Surely there are some foreigners who have been killed .
Now we are trying to establish the identity of those people , ” Shaheedi said , adding that authorities were on the lookout for evidence confirming that Al Libi was among the victims .
Shaheedi declined to discuss how the men were killed .
But news of Al Libi ’s death spread rapidly through websites that are monitored by Western counter - terrorism authorities and organizations such as the SITE Intelligence Group in Washington .
“ We congratulate the Islamic nation for the martyrdom of the sheik , the lion , Abu Laith al Libi , ” said a large banner on portions of the Al Ekhlaas website that are reserved for Al Qaeda - affiliated militant groups and not open to public posting , SITE reported .
A second statement by the Al Qaeda - affiliated Al Fajr Media Center was issued later in the day , according to SITE and its director , Rita Katz .
Al Fajr stated that Al Libi’s “ martyrdom with a group of his brothers ” occurred “ in the land of Muslim Pakistan . ”
“ How much he trained his brothers who joined the road of jihad , and how much he supervised the training camps , and how much he instructed them , gave advice , planned , and hurt the enemy .
He was an artist in what he did , ” SITE quoted the Al Fajr statement as saying .
He was also the leader of an Al Qaeda affiliate known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , which recently has tried with limited success to help Osama bin Laden ’s terrorist network spread its influence in North Africa .
Al Libi had become an inspirational presence for Al Qaeda on the Internet , which the network has increasingly used in recent years to disseminate propaganda and training manuals , to look for recruits and to raise funds , according to Katz and several current and former intelligence officials .
Last year , Al Libi appeared in at least three videos made by Al Qaeda ’s production arm , As Sahab Media , including one in November in which he announced that he was formally committing his Libyan group to the larger cause of Al Qaeda , according to SITE translations of the videos .
A U.S. military spokesman said last year that Al Libi was probably behind the suicide bombing that killed 23 people outside the main U.S. base in Afghanistan during a visit by Vice President Dick Cheney .
Cheney was far inside the perimeter of the large Bagram Air Base at the time of the Feb. 27 attack and was n’t hurt , but the bombing added to the impression that coalition forces and the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai were vulnerable to assault by Al Qaeda militants and the resurgent Taliban .

" [ They ] came to Musama business centre in Murewa and threatened MDC supporters with death if they ' revote ' MDC in the anticipated election rerun , " the affidavit says .
" Shops were forced to close down ; people were forced to attend the ZANU - PF rally . "
On Sunday electoral officials announced a delay in the partial recount of the disputed March 29 election .
The delay increased opposition concern about possible vote - rigging by ZANU - PF .
The recount could overturn the results of the parliamentary election , which showed ZANU - PF losing its majority to the MDC for the first time .
Results of the parallel presidential election have not been made public , but the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , now in exile in South Africa , says he won .
A run-off election will be called if the recount shows that neither side won at least 50 per cent of the presidential vote .
Dr Parirenyatwa's meeting , on April 10 , came as ZANU - PF began what has become an extensive campaign of beatings and intimidation in areas where Mr Mugabe and the ruling party lost ground in the presidential and parliamentary elections .
In the following days , party militias and the army established torture camps in several provinces , where they took MDC members to extract the names of opposition activists and deter the opposition from campaigning before the expected run-off election .
Mobs loyal to Mr Mugabe have forced about 3000 people to flee their homes .
Victims are coming to the capital , Harare , seeking safety and medical treatment .
Chingatayi Chimomo , 13 , was separated from his parents when a ZANU - PF gang burned down his home , 200 kilometres north - east of Harare .
His father , John , was an MDC parliamentary candidate .
" We ran into the forest and saw about 50 people burning our house down and taking all our things , " the boy said .
" My father … told us to run away and he ran away to another place .
" It was midnight , a lot of people came and two had guns , and they put fire and broke everything and they took all our property .
My father knows I am here but I do n't know when we will go home .
There is nothing left at home . "
Chingatayi was safe on Sunday in a Harare hospital .
The staff will not send him away , even though wards are overflowing with victims of Mr Mugabe 's thugs .
A spokesman for the MDC , Nelson Chamisa , said 10 opposition supporters had been murdered since the election and hundreds assaulted .
" I can confirm that 10 of our members have died , four of them in the last few days , due to political violence perpetrated by ruling party supporters in the aftermath of the elections , " Mr Chamisa said .
Amid mounting regional concern about instability and bloodshed , the 53 - member African Union urged Zimbabwe to release the election results immediately , and called for restraint from all parties .

At each US death - toll milestone in Iraq , believers in George Bush ’s belligerent policy have said the same thing :
“ If we leave too soon , those who ’ve fallen will have died in vain . ”
What they overlook — or are too brainwashed to appreciate — is that it was evident from the beginning that all Americans who would perish in a surpassingly illegal , immoral aggression cruelly undertaken without any provocation or credible , honest cause … would die needlessly and for abysmally wrong reasons .
In other words , about as “ in vain ” as you can possibly get .
Failing to comprehend that , they ’d keep us in Iraq until the current blood pool became a crimson ocean , and still they ’d mouth their falsely justifying inanity .
Thankfully , more and more Iraq veterans and serving personnel are exposing a countervailing truth .
They understand that it does n’t advance America ’s interest to perpetually present to the world ( let alone its Muslim sector ) an image of the US defined by our troops constantly kicking down residential doors in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities .
And then ransacking everything inside , as weeping children cling to their fearful mothers .
As evidenced by the Winter Soldier testimony recently offered by veterans sick of the inhumanity they themselves routinely displayed in Iraq , a growing number of our troops are coming to the stark awareness that , as they search for the “ enemy ” in trashed Iraqi homes , the real culprit can be seen in their own reflection in broken parlor mirrors .
Consider these words by Michael Prysner , one of the many veterans who testified to atrocities and war crimes at Winter Soldier :
“ Poor and working people in this country are sent to kill poor and working people in another country , to make the rich richer .
Without racism , soldiers would realize that they have more in common with the Iraqi people than they do with the billionaires who send us to war .
I threw people onto the street in Iraq , only to come home and find families here thrown onto the street in this tragic and unnecessary foreclosure crisis that is already leaving hundreds of Iraq war veterans homeless . ”
Some say that disaster would ensue if we “ precipitously ” departed Iraq , as if the present situation there is n’t already a monumental disaster for Iraqis and Americans alike .
But professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago , probably the planet ’s leading expert on suicide terrorism , has reached telling conclusions after extensive research , going back many years and involving numerous case studies .
He ’s found that terrorism arises , in most instances , from foreign occupations of someone else ’s sovereign territory .
Once those occupations end , terrorism almost always vanishes .
Moreover , the bulk of Iraqis battling us are n’t terrorists or extremists , but precisely the same kind of patriots we ourselves would be if it were our neighborhoods being vandalized by an invading foreign army .
They ’ll relentlessly continue fighting for generations , if we ’re insane enough to try to stay that long .
Backers of Bush ’s obscene war have their tawdry rationales , and they ’re quoted often .
But we , on the side of decency and reason , have more powerful words :
“ Do not partake in any barren works of darkness , instead expose them . ” — Ephesians 5:11
“ To sin by silence when the should protest makes cowards of men . ” — Abraham Lincoln
“ There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people . ” — Howard Zinn
For more than five years , we ’ve let the disguised voice of abject lust for Black Gold lead us tragically astray .
Reality , however , gives a dramatically different account … which we can continue to ignore only at our infinite , collective , national peril .
WASHINGTON , Feb 20 ( Reuters ) - Two U.S. Air Force F - 15 fighter planes collided in midair on Wednesday over the Gulf of Mexico near Panama City , Florida , during a training mission , officials said .
The U.S. Coast Guard recovered one pilot and a second was reported missing after the one - seat F - 15C Eagles crashed at 4:21 p.m. EST ( 2121 GMT ) about 50 miles ( 80 km ) south of Tyndall Air Force Base .
The recovered pilot 's condition was not immediately known .
The planes were from the Air Force 's 33rd Fighter Wing based at Eglin Air Force Base , near Fort Walton Beach , Florida .

I am puzzled by the resurgence of Austrian Business Cycle theory among Sachs , Krugman , Baker and many others who you would not ordinarily associate with the theory .
Sachs , for example , writes :
… the US crisis was actually made by the Fed … the Fed turned on the monetary spigots to try to combat an economic
slowdown .
The Fed pumped money into the US economy and slashed its main
interest rate … the Fed held this rate too low for too long .
Monetary expansion generally makes it easier to borrow , and lowers
the costs of doing so , throughout the economy .
It also tends to weaken
the currency and increase inflation .
All of this began to happen in the
US .
What was distinctive this time was that the new borrowing was concentrated in housing …. the Fed , under Greenspan ’s leadership , stood by as the credit boom gathered steam , barreling toward a subsequent crash .
What is puzzling about this is two - fold .
First , there is no standard model that I know of ( say of the kind normally taught in graduate school ) with these kinds of results .
Second and even more puzzling is that the foul - weather Austrians do n’t seem to draw the natural conclusion from their own analysis .
If the Federal Reserve is responsible for what may be a trillion dollar crash surely we should think about getting rid of the Fed ? ( n.b. I do not take this position . )
The true Austrians , like my colleague Alvaro Vargas Llosa , have long taken exactly this position .
So why are n’t Sachs , Krugman et al. calling for the gold standard , a strict monetary rule , 100 % reserve banking , free banking or some other monetary arrangement ?
Each of these institutions , of course , has its problems but surely after a trillion dollar loss they are worthy of serious consideration .
Nevertheless , I have n’t heard any ideas , from those blaming the crash on the Fed and Alan Greenspan , about fundamental monetary reform .
( Can Sachs , Krugman et al. really believe that it was Greenspan the man and not the institution that is to blame ?
That seems naive . )
Instead , the foul weather Austrians seem at most to call for regulatory reform .
But that too is peculiar .
Put aside the fact that banking is already heavily regulated , have these economists not absorbed the Lucas critique ?
In short , suppose that whatever regulation these economist want had been put in place in earlier years .
Would the crash have been avoided or would the Fed have simply pushed harder to lower interest rates ?
After all , the Fed lowered rates for a reason and if the regulation reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy in creating a boom well then that just calls for more money .
Tomgram : A Basis for Enduring Relationships in Iraq
[ Note for Tomdispatch readers :
For anyone interested in the often ignored but crucial subject of the U.S. garrisoning of the planet and the Pentagon 's system of imperial basing , there is a single indispensable book : Chalmers Johnson 's The Sorrows of Empire , volume two of his Blowback Trilogy .
The third volume , Nemesis , The Last Days of the American Republic , is almost as relevant on basing ( and riveting in its own right ) .

Iraq as a Pentagon Construction Site
How the Bush Administration " Endures "
By Tom Engelhardt
The title of the agreement , signed by President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki in a " video conference " last week , and carefully labeled as a " non-binding " set of principles for further negotiations , was a mouthful : a " Declaration of Principles for a Long - Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America . "
Whew !
Words matter , of course .
They seldom turn up by accident in official documents or statements .
Last week , in the first reports on this " declaration , " one of those words that matter caught my attention .
Actually , it was n't in the declaration itself , where the key phrase was " long - term relationship " ( something in the lives of private individuals that falls just short of a marriage ) , but in a " fact - sheet " issued by the White House .
Here 's the relevant line : " Iraq 's leaders have asked for an enduring relationship with America , and we seek an enduring relationship with a democratic Iraq . "
Of course , " enduring " there bears the same relationship to permanency as " long - term relationship " does to marriage .
In a number of the early news reports , that word " enduring , " part of the " enduring relationship " that the Iraqi leadership supposedly " asked for , " was put into ( or near ) the mouths of " Iraqi leaders " or of the Iraqi prime minister himself .
It also achieved a certain prominence in the post - declaration " press gaggle " conducted by the man coordinating this process out of the Oval Office , the President 's so - called War Tsar , Gen. Douglas Lute .
He said of the document : " It signals a commitment of both their government and the United States to an enduring relationship based on mutual interests . "
In trying to imagine any Iraqi leader actually requesting that " enduring " relationship , something kept nagging at me .
After all , those mutual vows of longevity were to be taken in a well publicized civil ceremony in a world in which , when it comes to the American presidential embrace , do n't - ask / do n't - tell is usually the preferred course of action for foreign leaders .
Finally , I remembered where I had seen that word " enduring " before in a situation that also involved a " long - term relationship . "
It had been four - and - a - half years earlier and not coming out of the mouths of Iraqi officials either .
Back in April 2003 , just after Baghdad fell to American troops , Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt reported on the front page of the New York Times that the Pentagon had launched its invasion the previous month with plans for four " permanent bases " in out of the way parts of Iraq already on the drawing board .
Since then , the Pentagon has indeed sunk billions of dollars into building those mega - bases ( with a couple of extra ones thrown in ) at or near the places mentioned by Shanker and Schmitt .
When questioned by reporters at the time about whether such " permanent bases " were in the works , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld insisted that the U.S. was " unlikely to seek any permanent or ' long - term ' bases in Iraq " -- and that was that .
The Times ' piece essentially went down the mainstream - media memory hole .
On this subject , the official position of the Bush administration has never changed .
Just last week , for instance , General Lute slipped up , in response to a question at his press gaggle .
The exchange went like this :
" Q : And permanent bases ?
" GENERAL LUTE : Likewise .
That 's another dimension of continuing U.S. support to the government of Iraq , and will certainly be a key item for negotiation next year . "
White House spokesperson Dana Perino quickly issued a denial , saying : " We do not seek permanent bases in Iraq . "
Back in 2003 , Pentagon officials , already seeking to avoid that potentially explosive " permanent " tag , plucked " enduring " out of the military lexicon and began referring to such bases , charmingly enough , as " enduring camps . "
And the word remains with us -- connected to bases and occupations anywhere .
For instance , of a planned expansion of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , a Col. Jonathan Ives told an AP reporter recently , " We 've grown in our commitment to Afghanistan by putting another brigade ( of troops ) here , and with that we know that we 're going to have an enduring presence .
So this is going to become a long - term base for us , whether that means five years , 10 years -- we do n't know . "
Still , whatever they were called , the bases went up on an impressive scale , massively fortified , sometimes 15 - 20 square miles in area , housing up to tens of thousands of troops and private contractors , with multiple bus routes , traffic lights , fast - food restaurants , PXs , and other amenities of home , and reeking of the kind of investment that practically shouts out for , minimally , a relationship of a distinctly " enduring " nature .
The Facts on Land -- and Sea
These were part of what should be considered the facts on the ground in Iraq , though , between April 2003 and the present , they were rarely reported on or debated in the mainstream in the U.S.
But if you place those mega - bases ( not to speak of the more than 100 smaller ones built at one point or another ) in the context of early Bush administration plans for the Iraqi military , things quickly begin to make more sense .
Remember , Iraq is essentially the hot seat at the center of the Middle East .
It had , in the previous two - plus decades fought an eight - year war with neighboring Iran , invaded neighboring Kuwait , and been invaded itself .
And yet , the new Coalition Provisional Authority , run by the President 's personal envoy , L. Paul Bremer III , promptly disbanded the Iraqi military .
This is now accepted as a goof of the first order when it came to sparking an insurgency .
But , in terms of Bush administration planning , it was no mistake at all .
At the time , the Pentagon made it quite clear that its plan for a future Iraqi military was for a force of 40,000 lightly armed troops -- meant to do little more than patrol the country 's borders .
( Saddam Hussein 's army had been something like a 600,000 - man force . )
It was , in other words , to be a Military Lite -- and there was essentially to be no Iraqi air force .
In other words , in one of the more heavily armed and tension - ridden regions of the planet , Iraq was to become a Middle Eastern Costa Rica -- if , that is , you did n't assume that the U.S. Armed Forces , from those four " enduring camps " somewhere outside Iraq 's major cities , including a giant air base at Balad , north of Baghdad , and with the back - up help of U.S. Naval forces in the Persian Gulf , were to serve as the real Iraqi military for the foreseeable future .
Again , it 's necessary to put these facts on the ground in a larger -- in this case , pre-invasion -- geopolitical context .
From the first Gulf War on , Saudi Arabia , the largest producer of energy on the planet , was being groomed as the American military bastion in the heart of the Middle East .
But the Saudis grew uncomfortable -- think here , the claims of Osama bin Laden and Co. that U.S. troops were defiling the Kingdom and its holy places -- with the Pentagon 's elaborate enduring camps on its territory .
Something had to give -- and it was n't going to be the American military presence in the Middle East .
The answer undoubtedly seemed clear enough to top Bush administration officials .
As an anonymous American diplomat told the Sunday Herald of Scotland back in October 2002 , " A rehabilitated Iraq is the only sound long - term strategic alternative to Saudi Arabia .
It 's not just a case of swopping horses in mid-stream , the impending U.S. regime change in Baghdad is a strategic necessity . "
As those officials imagined it -- and as Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz predicted -- by the fall of 2003 , major American military operations in the region would have been re-organized around Iraq , even as American forces there would be drawn down to perhaps 30,000 - 40,000 troops stationed eternally at those " enduring camps . "
In addition , a group of Iraqi secular exiles , friendly to the United States , would be in power in Baghdad , backed by the occupation and ready to open up the Iraqi economy , especially its oil industry to Western ( particularly American ) multinationals .
Americans and their allies and private contractors would , quite literally , have free run of the country , the equivalent of nineteenth century colonial extraterritoriality ( something " legally " institutionalized in June 2004 , thanks to Order 17 , issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority , just before it officially turned over " sovereignty " to the Iraqis ) ; and , sooner or later , a Status of Forces Agreement or SOFA would be " negotiated " that would define the rights of American troops garrisoned in that country .
At that point , the U.S. would have successfully repositioned itself militarily in relation to the oil heartlands of the planet .
It would also have essentially encircled a second member of the " axis of evil , " Iran ( once you included the numerous new U.S. bases that had been built and were being expanded in occupied Afghanistan as part of the ongoing war against the Taliban ) .
It would be triumphant and dominant and , with its Israeli ally , militarily beyond challenge in the region .
The cowing of , collapse of , or destruction of the Syrian and Iranian regimes would surely follow in short order .
Of course , much of this never came about as planned .
It turned out that , once the Sunni insurgency gained traction , the Bush administration had little choice but to reconstitute a sizeable , if still relatively lightly armed , Iraqi military ( as a largely Shiite force ) and then , more recently , arm Sunni militias as well , possibly opening the way for future clashes of a major nature .
It had to accept a Shiite regime locked inside the highly fortified Green Zone of the Iraqi capital that was religious , sectarian , largely powerless , and allied to some degree with Iran .
It had to accept chaos , significant and unexpected casualties , continual urban warfare , and an enormous strain and drain on its armed forces ( as well as a black hole of distraction from other global issues ) .
None of this had been predicted , or imagined , by Bush 's top officials .
On the other hand , the Bush administration has demonstrated significant " endurance " of its own , especially when it came to the linked issues of oil and bases .
In a recent report for Harper 's Magazine , " The Black Box , Inside Iraq 's Oil Machine , " Luke Mitchell describes traveling the southern Iraqi oil field of Rumaila with a petroleum engineer working for Foster Wheeler , a Houston engineering firm hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers " to oversee much of the oilfield reconstruction , " and protected by private guards employed by the British security company Erinys .
He describes what 's left of the Iraqi oil industry after decades of war , sanctions , civil war , sabotage , and black - market theft -- a run-down industrial plant with a rusting delivery system that , at a technical level , is now largely in the hands of the Army Corps of Engineers , the Department of Energy , the State Department , and private contractors like KBR , the former division of Halliburton .
At the most basic level , he reports that many of " Iraq 's native oil professionals , " who heroically patched up and held together a broken system in the years after the first Gulf War , have ( along with so many other Iraqi professionals ) fled the country .
He writes :
" The Wall Street Journal in 2006 called this flight a ' petroleum exodus ' and reported that about a hundred oil workers had been murdered since the war began and that 'of the top hundred of so managers running the Iraqi oil ministry and its branches in 2003 , about two - thirds are no longer at their jobs . '
Now most of the [ oil ] engineers in Iraq are from Texas and Oklahoma . "
Similarly , in Baghdad , the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not expected to handle the crucial energy problems of its country alone .
Here 's a relevant ( if well - buried ) passage from a recent New York Times piece on the subject : " Earlier this month , the White House dispatched several senior aides to Baghdad to work with the Iraqis on specific legislative areas .
They include the under secretary of state for economic , energy and agricultural affairs , Reuben Jeffery III , who is working on the budget and oil law "
This is what passes for " sovereignty " in present - day Iraq .
In this context , the following line of text about agreed - upon subjects for negotiation in last week 's Bush / Maliki " declaration " caused eyebrows to be raised ( at least abroad ) : " Facilitating and encouraging the flow of foreign investments to Iraq , especially American investments , to contribute to the reconstruction and rebuilding of Iraq . "
As the British Guardian put the matter : " The promise was immediately seen as a potential bonanza for American oil companies . "
A BBC report commented , " Correspondents say US investors benefiting from preferential treatment could earn huge profits from Iraq 's vast oil reserves , causing widespread resentment among Iraqis . "
( American coverage regularly ignores or plays down the oil aspect of the Bush administration 's Iraq policies , even though that country has the third largest reserves on the planet . )
Bases , Bases Everywhere
Among the most tenacious and enduring Bush administration facts on the ground are those giant bases , still largely ignored -- with honorable exceptions -- by the mainstream media .
Thom Shanker and Cara Buckley of the New York Times , to give but one example , managed to write that paper 's major piece about the joint " declaration " without mentioning the word " base , " no less " permanent , " and only Gen .
Lute 's slip made the permanence of bases a minor note in other mainstream reports .
And yet it 's not just that the building of bases did go on -- and on a remarkable scale -- but that it continues today .
Whatever the descriptive labels , the Pentagon , throughout this whole period , has continued to create , base by base , the sort of " facts " that any negotiations , no matter who engages in them , will need to take into account .
And the ramping up of the already gigantic " mega - bases " in Iraq proceeds apace .
Recent reports indicate that the Pentagon will call on Congress to pony up another billion dollars soon enough for further upgrades and " improvements . "
We also know that frantic construction has been under way on three new bases of varying sizes .
The most obvious of these -- though it 's seldom thought of this way -- is the gigantic new U.S. Embassy , possibly the largest in the world , being built on an almost Vatican - sized plot of land inside Baghdad 's Green Zone .
It is meant to be a citadel , a hardened universe of its own , in , but not of , the Iraqi capital .
In recent months , it has also turned into a construction nightmare , soaking up another $ 144 million in American taxpayer monies , bringing its price tag to three - quarters of a billion dollars and still climbing .
It is to house 1,000 or so " diplomats , " with perhaps a few thousand extra security guards and hired hands of every sort .
When , in the future , you read in the papers about administration plans to withdraw American forces to bases " outside of Iraqi urban areas , " note that there will continue to be a major base in the heart of the Iraqi capital for who knows how long to come .
As the Washington Post 's Glenn Kessler put it , the 21 - building compound " is viewed by some officials as a key element of building a sustainable , long - term diplomatic presence in Baghdad . "
Presence , yes , but diplomatic ?
In the meantime , a relatively small base , " Combat Outpost Shocker , " provocatively placed within a few kilometers of the Iranian border , has been rushed to completion this fall on a mere $ 5 million construction contract .
And only in the last weeks , reports have emerged on the latest U.S. base under construction , uniquely being built on a key oil - exporting platform in the waters off the southern Iraqi port of Basra and meant for the U.S. Navy and allies .
Such a base gives meaning to this passage in the Bush / Maliki declaration : " Providing security assurances and commitments to the Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression against Iraq that violates its sovereignty and integrity of its territories , waters , or airspace . "
As the British Telegraph described this multi-million dollar project : " The US - led coalition is building a permanent security base on Iraq 's oil pumping platforms in the Gulf to act as the ' nerve centre ' of efforts to protect the country 's most vital strategic asset . "
Chip Cummins of the Wall Street Journal summed up the project this way in a piece headlined , " U.S. Digs In to Guard Iraq Oil Exports -- Long - Term Presence Planned at Persian Gulf Terminals Viewed as Vulnerable " : " [ T ] he new construction suggests that one footprint of U.S. military power in Iraq is n't shrinking anytime soon : American officials are girding for an open - ended commitment to protect the country 's oil industry . "
Though you 'd never know it from mainstream reporting , the single enduring fact of the Iraq War may be this constant building and upgrading of U.S. bases .
Since the Times revealed those base - building plans back in the spring of 2003 , Iraq has essentially been a vast construction site for the Pentagon .
The American media did , in the end , come to focus on the civilian " reconstruction " of Iraq which , from the rebuilding of electricity - production facilities to the construction of a new police academy has proved a catastrophic mixture of crony capitalism , graft , corruption , theft , inefficiency , and sabotage .
But there has been next to no focus on the construction success story of the Iraq War and occupation : those bases .
In this way , whatever the disasters of its misbegotten war , the Bush administration has , in a sense , itself " endured " in Iraq .
Now , with only a year left , its officials clearly hope to write that endurance and those " enduring camps " into the genetic code of both countries -- an " enduring relationship " meant to outlast January 2009 and to outflank any future administration .
In fact , by some official projections , the bases are meant to be occupied for up to 50 to 60 years without ever becoming " permanent . "
You can , of course , claim that the Iraqis " asked for " this new , " enduring relationship , " as the declaration so politely suggests .
It is certainly true that , as part of the bargain , the Bush administration is offering to defend its " boys " to the hilt against almost any conceivable eventuality , including the sort of internal coup that it has , these last years , been rumored to have considered launching itself .
In an attempt to make an end - run around Congress , administration officials continue to present what is to be negotiated as merely a typical SOFA - style agreement .
" There are about a hundred countries around the world with which we have [ such ] bilateral defense or security cooperation agreements , " Gen .
Lute said reassuringly , indicating that this matter would be handled by the executive branch without significant input from Congress .
The guarantees the Bush administration seems ready to offer the Maliki government , however , clearly rise to treaty level and , if we had even a faintly assertive Congress , would surely require the advice and consent of the Senate .
Iraqi officials have already made clear that such an agreement will have to pass through their parliament in a country where the idea of " enduring " U.S. bases in an " enduring " relationship is bound to be exceedingly unpopular .
Still , a formula for the future is obviously being put in place and , after more than four years of frenzied construction , the housing for it , so to speak , is more than ready .
As the Washington Post described the plan , " Iraqi officials said that under the proposed formula , Iraq would get full responsibility for internal security and U.S. troops would relocate to bases outside the cities .
Iraqi officials foresee a long - term presence of about 50,000 U.S. troops "
No matter what comes out of the mouths of Iraqi officials , though , what 's " enduring " in all this is deeply Pentagonish and has emerged from the Bush administration 's earliest dreams about reshaping the Middle East and achieving global domination of an unprecedented sort .
It 's a case , as the old Joni Mitchell song put it , of going " round and round and round in the circle game . "

Doctors Not Concerned by US FDA Probing Safety of Merck 's Singulair Singulair is under review after suicidal thinking was reported in patients .
March 27 , 2008  --
The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) announced an investigation Wednesday examining a link between suicide and Merck 's popular allergy and asthma drug , Singulair .
Concerns over " behavioral issues " with Singulair developed over the past year .
Merck periodically updated the drug 's labels to include warnings for tremors , depression and anxiety .
FDA spokesperson Susan Cruzan said reports of suicides by " three or four " people who were taking Singulair prompted Merck to clarify suicide warnings on labels and patient information sheets in October 2007 .
" When the company does that and we think there 's a reason to look at it , we 'll go back and analyze the data , " said Cruzan , who stressed that the FDA cannot prove a link between the Singulair and the reported suicides .
" We are going back to review all of the data to determine whether there is a cause - and - effect relationship . "
Merck spokesperson Ronald Rogers said the company did update its labels after receiving reports of suicide among consumers who were taking Singulair .
Because of the nature of these self reports , the company cannot determine whether there was any link to the drug , he said .
However , neither the FDA nor Merck recommended that patients stop taking Singulair , a drug that has proven very effective against seasonal allergies and asthma .
Doctors also see no cause for concern over the FDA 's warning .
" We have hundreds of children on Singulair and have never heard parents make complaints about psychiatric side effects , " said Leslie Hendeles , professor of pharmacy and pediatrics at the University of Florida Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine .
" Moreover , there is no mechanism for this reaction …
We will be telling our patients not to worry about this . "
Multibillion - Dollar Drug
IMS Health , a Web site that tracks drug sales , reported 28 million prescriptions for Singulair in 2006 .
Sales of the drug , which goes by the generic name montelukast sodium , climbed to $ 3.4 last year , up from $ 3.0 billion in 2006 .
The FDA announcement falls in line with a new focus on suicide and drug use , according to reporting in the New York Times .
Since January , makers of drugs for depression , obesity and epilepsy have been asked to include data on suicide in their clinical trial reports .
But the FDA does not anticipate completing the review evaluation for Singulair for at least nine months .
" [ The investigation ] will take some time because we 're going back to all of the information from the studies and reviewing them , " Cruzan said .
Following the updates , the Merck label for Singulair currently reads : " The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in post - marketing use : Psychiatric disorders : agitation including aggressive behavior , anxiousness , dream abnormalities and hallucinations , depression , insomnia , irritability , restlessness , suicidal thinking and behavior ( including suicide ) , tremor . "
However , some of the label changes Merck made are based on post - marketing data , information that the company receives directly from consumers , without any contextual evidence to back up the consumers ' claims .
" If we feel it is important enough , we 'll add it to the post - marketing portion of the label , " said Merck spokesperson Ronald Rogers .
" But the information is limited and is of limited value . "
Rogers added that no suicides were observed in any of the clinical trials involving the drug .
" There is no cause for alarm , " Cruzan said .

Until not long ago , Christopher Hitchens , the British - born journalist , was a valued asset of the American left : an intellectual willing to show his teeth in the cause of righteousness .
Today , Hitchens supports the Iraq war and is contemptuous of those who do not — a turn that has confused and dismayed former comrades , and brought him into odd new alliances .
But his life looks much the same .
He still writes a great deal , at a speed at which most people read .
And , at fifty - seven , he still has an arrest - photograph air about him — looking like someone who , with as much dignity as possible , has smoothed his hair and straightened his collar after knocking the helmet off a policeman .
At a dinner a few months ago in San Francisco with his wife , Carol Blue , and some others , Hitchens wore a pale jacket and a shirt unbuttoned far enough to hint at what one ex-girlfriend has called “ the pelt of the Hitch . ”
Hitchens , who only recently gave up the habit of smoking in the shower , was working through a pack of cigarettes while talking to two women at his end of the table : a Stanford doctor in her early thirties whom he ’d met once before , and a friend of hers , a librarian .
He spoke with wit and eloquence about Iranian politics and what he saw as the unnecessary handsomeness of Gavin Newsom , the mayor of San Francisco .
Hitchens writes on politics and literature ; and in both lines of work he tends to start from textual readings of a subtle and suspicious - minded kind .
When he is not writing , he talks in the same measured , ironic voice as his prose , with the same fluency and intellectual momentum , as if he were troubled by the thought that he might never find another audience .
Hitchens likes to have his say : he takes his arguments to the cable - news channels , to West Point cadets , to panel discussions in windowless hotel conference rooms .
He stays at public meetings until the crowd — dehydrated and faint — has no more questions to ask , and then he gives out his e-mail address .
He is a fine , funny orator , with the mock - heroic manner of an English barrister sure of his ground ( “ by all means , ” “ if you will ” ) , using derision , a grand diction , and looping subclauses that always carry him back to the main path .
He also has the politician ’s trick of eliding the last word of one sentence to the first of the next , while stressing both words , in order to close a gate against interruption .
In more private settings , the rhetoric is the same — except that there are filthy jokes drawn out to twenty minutes , and longer quotations from his vast stock of remembered English poetry .
He seems to be perpetually auditioning for the role of best man .
Ian McEwan , the novelist , recently said of Hitchens , “ It all seems instantly , neurologically available : everything he ’s ever read , everyone he ’s ever met , every story he ’s ever heard . ”
In the noisy front room of the North Beach restaurant where the friends had met , Hitchens made a toast : “ To the Constitution of the United States , and confusion to its enemies ! ”
The conversation was amiable and boozy ;
Hitchens might be said to care more for history than for individual humans , but he was in an easy mood , after a drive , in beautiful early - evening light , from Menlo Park .
( He and Blue , a writer working on a novel , live with their thirteen - year - old daughter in Washington , D.C. , but spend the summer in California , where her parents live . )
During the ride , he had discussed with the Pakistani - born taxi - driver the virtues and vices of Benazir Bhutto , while surreptitiously using a bottle of Evian to put out a small but smoky fire that he had set in the ashtray .
And then the young doctor to his left made a passing but sympathetic remark about Howard Dean , the 2004 Presidential candidate ; she said that he had been unfairly treated in the American media .
Hitchens , in the clear , helpful voice one might use to give street directions , replied that Dean was “ a raving nut bag , ” and then corrected himself : “ A raving , sinister , demagogic nut bag . ”
He said , “ I and a few other people saw he should be destroyed . ”
He noted that , in 2003 , Dean had given a speech at an abortion - rights gathering in which he recalled being visited , as a doctor , by a twelve - year - old who was pregnant by her father .
( “ You explain that to the American people who think that parental notification is a good idea , ” Dean said , to applause . )
Dean appeared not to have referred the alleged rape to the police ; he also , when pressed , admitted that the story was not , in all details , true .
For Hitchens , this established that Dean was a “ pathological liar . ”
“ All politicians lie ! ” the women said .
“ He ’s a doctor , ” Hitchens said .
“ But he ’s a politician . ”
“ No , excuse me , ” Hitchens said .
His tone tightened , and his mouth shrunk like a sea anemone poked with a stick ; the Hitchens face can , at moments of dialectical urgency , or when seen in an unkindly lit Fox News studio , transform from roguish to sour .
( Hitchens ’s friend Martin Amis , the novelist , has chided Hitchens for “ doing that horrible thing with your lips . ” )
“ Fine , ” Hitchens said .
“ Now that I know that , to you , medical ethics are nothing , you ’ve told me all I need to know .
I ’m not trying to persuade you .
Do you think I care whether you agree with me ?
No .
I ’m telling you why I disagree with you .
That I do care about .
I have no further interest in any of your opinions .
There ’s nothing you would n’t make an excuse for . ”
“ That ’s wrong ! ” they said .
“ You know what ?
I would n’t want you on my side . ”
His tone was businesslike ; the laughing protests died away .
“ I was telling you why I knew that Howard Dean was a psycho and a fraud , and you say , ‘ That ’s O.K . ’
Fuck off .
No , I mean it : fuck off .
I ’m telling you what I think are standards , and you say , ‘ What standards ?
It ’s fine , he ’s against the Iraq war . ’
Fuck .
Off .
You ’re MoveOn.org .
‘ Any liar will do .
He ’s anti-Bush , he can say what he likes . ’
Fuck off .
You think a doctor can lie in front of an audience of women on a major question , and claim to have suppressed evidence on rape and incest and then to have said he made it up ? ”
“ But Christopher . . . ”
“ Save it , sweetie , for someone who cares .
It will not be me .
You love it , you suck on it .
I now know what your standards are , and now you know what mine are , and that ’s all the difference — I hope — in the world . ”
What happened to Christopher Hitchens ?
How did a longtime columnist at The Nation become a contributor to the Weekly Standard , a supporter of President Bush in the 2004 election , and an invited speaker at the conservative activist David Horowitz ’s forthcoming Restoration Weekend , along with Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh ?
Or , to put it another way , how did Hitchens come to be a “ Lying , Self - Serving , Fat - Assed , Chain - Smoking , Drunken , Opportunistic , Cynical Contrarian ” ?
( This is from the title of an essay posted on CounterPunch , a Web site co-edited by Hitchens ’s former friend and Nation colleague Alexander Cockburn . )
The question , in polite and impolite forms , goes around and around at Washington dinner parties : did Hitchens maintain high principles while the left drifted from him , or did he lose himself in vanity and ambition ?
The matter has even inspired a forthcoming anthology of attack and counterattack , “ Terror , Iraq , and the Left : Christopher Hitchens and His Critics . ”
The global food crisis reached the United States yesterday as big retailers began to ration sales of rice in response to bulk purchases by customers alarmed by rocketing prices of staples .
Wal - Mart 's cash and carry division , Sam's Club , announced it would sell a maximum of four bags of rice per person to prevent supplies from running short .
Its decision followed sporadic caps placed on purchases of rice and flour by some store managers at a rival bulk chain , Costco , in parts of California .
The world price of rice has risen 68 % since the start of 2008 , but in some US shops the price has doubled in weeks .
Retail experts said there was little evidence of panic hoarding by the public but that restaurants and smaller retailers were buying up stocks at wholesalers in the expectation that the cost would go even higher .
Shops said Filipino residents in the US were also making large purchases to send to relatives in the Philippines , where a shortage of supplies is causing concern .
" What you 're seeing is people who buy in larger quantities , who have a restaurant or a corner store , stocking up because of media reports that prices could go higher , " said Dave Heylen , a spokesman for the California Grocers Association .
The price of staple foods has been rising at an accelerating rate across the world , driven by what the United Nations has called a " perfect storm " of rising demand from developing countries such as China and India , the impact of climate change and policy responses by governments .
Since the beginning of the year , rice - producing countries including China , India , Vietnam and Egypt have imposed limits on exports to keep domestic prices down .
This week , a top World Bank official predicted that Thailand , the world 's largest rice exporter , might follow in restricting shipments .
The EU trade commissioner , Peter Mandelson , yesterday called on the World Trade Organisation to put pressure on food - producing countries to maintain exports .
" If we restrict trade , we 're simply going to add food scarcity to the already large problems of food shortages that exist in different countries , " he told Reuters news agency .
The director of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation , Jacques Diouf , said the crisis had been building for decades .
" The situation we are in is the result of inappropriate policies over the past 20 years , " Diouf told journalists in Paris , pointing to a halving of aid to agriculture in developing countries between 1990 and 2000 , while the industrialised world maintained generous farm subsidies .
British officials say they hope the food price shock will provide impetus for a long - delayed deal on liberalising world trade , known as the Doha round .
They predict a possible breakthrough in the next few weeks .
They also point out that the price rise could bring much - needed income to rural areas in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world if farmers are given enough support to respond .
Diouf said : " This is not Greek tragedy where fate is decided by the gods and humans can do nothing about it .
No , we have the ability to influence our futures . "
In Venezuela , President Hugo Chávez yesterday announced a $ 100 m " food security fund " , at a regional summit to agree policy as the crisis spreads instability across Latin America and the Caribbean .
Looting and riots in Haiti left at least six dead and forced the resignation of the prime minister this month , leaving the hemisphere 's poorest country tense and edgy .
In Guyana an 80 % rise in the price of rice and 50 % in the cost of chicken triggered protests and a strike by sugarcane workers .
The government promised to issue seeds and urged people to cultivate idle land .
Surinam set up an emergency cabinet committee to seek ways to dampen food prices .
Citigroup Barrs Investors From Selling Their Hedge Fund Shares Posted by Pile ( 8242 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Citigroup has barred investors in one of its hedge funds from withdrawing their money , and a new leveraged fund lost 52 percent in its first three months , the Wall Street Journal reported Friday .
The largest U.S. bank suspended redemptions in CSO Partners , a fund specializing in corporate debt , after investors tried to pull more than 30 percent of its roughly $ 500 million of assets , the newspaper said .
Citigroup injected $ 100 million to stabilize the fund , which lost 10.9 percent last year , the newspaper said .
The fund 's manager , John Pickett , left following a dispute with Citigroup executives and complaints from investors after he tried to back out from committing more than half the fund 's assets to buy leveraged loans tied to a German media company , the newspaper said .
That matter was settled when CSO agreed to buy $ 746 million of the loans at face value , though they were trading at 86 percent to 93 percent of face value , it said .
Since June , Citigroup has disclosed some $ 30 billion of write - downs and losses tied to subprime mortgages , complex debt and deteriorating credit .
The problems contributed to a record 9.83 billion fourth - quarter loss .
Profit that quarter in the alternative investments unit fell 89 percent to $ 61 million .

Dramatic surveillance video footage of a man repeatedly firing a handgun that left one man dead and five others injured was released by Toronto police Monday in the hopes of finding the gunman .
Two security cameras captured the shooting last Friday just before 10 p.m. at 87 Amaranth Crt. , near Lawrence Ave. and Dufferin St .
Det. Sgt. Brian Borg warned members of the media that the footage was violent .
As it was played at police headquarters on Monday , the video drew gasps from seasoned crime reporters .
Although police often obtain video footage of the events in the area of a shooting , it is extremely rare for the video to include an actual shooting , Borg said .
The video shows the gunman and another person , believed to be an associate , walking on a path and approach the group of six men between the ages of 18 and 21 .
The gunman is not seen speaking to his associate or the group of six men between the ages of 18 and 21 .
" He simply walked up within 10 feet of the group , got their attention , and without warning opened fire while walking backwards , " said Borg .
" His actions are very discriminate and it is obvious he intended to inflict maximum damage . "
The lone gunman and his associate then fled the area in different directions .
Abdikarim Ahmed Abdikarim , 18 , died of a gunshot wound to the head .
The other five victims are expected to survive their injuries and are co-operating with police , Borg said .
" Our investigation to date shows that these young men ( the victims ) at the time of the incident were not engaged in any criminal conduct or behaviour that would explain what you are about to see .
Simply put , they were there to socialize as they often did at this very location every Friday night , " said Borg .
Although the victims were the intended targets , Borg would not speculate on a possible motive .
There is one gunman and one handgun involved in the shooting , he said .
Police patrols have increased in the Lawrence Heights area since the shooting .

Prompted by Comcast 's traffic management practices , which use TCP reset packets that seem to come from elsewhere on the Internet , and Comcast 's initial denial of same , the makers of peer - to - peer application Vuze ( previously known as Azureus ) decided to investigate how widespread this practice is .
They did this by creating a plugin for the popular BitTorrent client that monitors and reports TCP resets — from any application running at the time .
They then ranked ISPs by how many attempted TCP connections were interrupted by reset packets .
And guess who is at the top of the list .
If you said " Comcast , " you guessed correctly .
According to the Vuze people 's initial results , the number of reset connections was 20 percent for that ISP 's subscribers .
For AOL it 's only 15 percent , 11 for RoadRunner and less than 3 percent for Euronet Orange in the Netherlands , to name just a few of the ISPs in the report .
Based on these results , Vuze sent letters asking for traffic management transparency to four ISPs with " irregular percentages " : Cablevision , Cogeco in Canada , BellSouth ( now owned by AT&T ) , and AOL .
But what , if anything , do these measurements tell us ?
The Vuze people carefully avoid drawing hard and fast ( or any ) conclusions , and rightly so .
Their methodology appears unable to discern the difference between a TCP reset that came from the peer or server on the other side of a TCP connection and one generated by an ISP in the middle .
What TCP resets do
The function of TCP resets is twofold : first of all , they serve as a mechanism to indicate that there 's no server process running on a certain port number .
If a user is running a peer - to - peer application , the application opens up one or more port numbers for incoming sessions so that other peers can connect .
When the user stops the program , the port is closed , but peers may still try to connect for some time .
If they do , they 'll get a reset .
The second function of resets is to clean up stale sessions .
For instance , if a computer crashes in the middle of a download , the server will probably still be sending packets after the client reboots .
The client then sees packets that belong to a session that it does n't recognize , so it sends a reset to make the session disappear on the server side .
Something similar happens when a session has been idle for a while and there is a home router in the middle that performs NAT ( network address translation ) .
NAT boxes remove idle TCP sessions after a while .
When there are subsequently more packets , those can't be translated properly , so the session will end in a reset .
On top of all of this , it seems that Microsoft is playing fast and loose with the TCP specification .
Normally , TCP sessions end after an exchange of " fin " packets .
But according to an analysis by researchers from the University of Calgary , both Microsoft 's IIS web server and Internet Explorer use resets rather than fins to end HTTP sessions .
This can easily generate the levels of resets seen by the Vuze plug -in .
The differences in numbers of resets between ISPs are still curious .
It 's entirely possible that some of them use the same traffic management method as Comcast .
But there are other possible explanations as well .
For instance , some ISPs use HTTP proxies or even transparent HTTP proxies ( that intercept all HTTP traffic ) .
If these proxies end TCP sessions with resets rather than fins , this could easily explain a high number of resets .
Vuze tells
Ars that it can't fully explain the results .
" We can not say what is normal or irregular RST levels , we can only compare the data to itself , " a company spokesperson told Ars .
" What the data shows is that there is a significant discrepancy between those ISPs on the high end and those on the low , indicating that further research and explanations are necessary . "
If two peers both have the plug - in , it should n't be too hard to see if incoming resets at one end match outgoing ones at the other end , but the company tells
Ars that the plug - in was " developed to simply observe the network connections being made " and that matching incoming and outgoing resets would " require further development . "
Without that additional development , we can't know what percentage of the resets are generated by someone in the middle .

Panasonic has developed a recycling technique that uses titanium oxide to convert unrecoverable plastic and other organic compounds to a " harmless " gas .
The key focus is on separating wires from their coatings and extract the other rubbers and plastics that make up the non-recyclable 20 % of home - appliance waste .
Panasonic 's stated goal is to " completely eliminate mixed plastic waste . "
And if that ain't bold enough , the process reduces CO2 emissions , too , because the gasification process itself does n't require much energy .
Here 's how it works :
The mixed materials are bathed in titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) , jostled about by machinery to ensure an even distribution of the good stuff .
The chemicals react to the plastics and other organics , generating tremendous heat .
Water is used to maintain a 500 °C temperature , ideal for the gasification .
One by - product of the gasification of vinyl chloride is hydrogen chloride ; that is " neutralized " with lime .
Advertisement
Panasonic does n't mention any other by - products .
In fact , the company insists that the output consists of " harmless gases , " and that there are no " hazardous side - effects . "
If this is all true , then maybe Panasonic should think about building a compact one for every kitchen in the world .
What do you think ?
Ten years ?
Press Release :
Panasonic Uses Catalytic Reaction to Decompose Plastics Into Harmless Gas for E - Waste Recycling - Eliminating need for incinerating or dumping plastic waste in landfill - Osaka , Japan - Panasonic , by which Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. , Ltd. is known , today announced that the company has developed together with Kusatsu Electric Co. , Ltd. a recycling technology that enables the recovery of metals from plastic - coated wires and plastics used in electric and electronic equipment without causing hazardous side - effects .
Using the catalytic properties of titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) , the innovative technology facilitates recovery of inorganic substances such as metals by transforming organic substances such as plastics into harmless gases .
Panasonic is successfully using the new technology at the Matsushita Eco Technology Center ( METEC ) to recover copper from degaussing coils covered with vinyl chloride tape found in CRT TVs .
In addition , mixed plastic waste destined for incineration or landfill is treated and changed into non-toxic gases at METEC .
The method not only contributes to " zero waste , " but also helps reduce CO2 emissions as little external energy source is required in the gasification process .
Today , about 80 percent , by weight , of all collected home appliances is recycled into metallic and plastic materials .
The remaining 20 percent is currently regarded as non-recyclable waste e.g. rubber , mixed glass and mixed plastic waste which is difficult to sort further as it is comprised of many different types of resins or contains metals .
Although some mixed plastic waste can be used as fuel in general , the waste containing certain chemicals such as vinyl chloride needs to be treated in a high - temperature incinerator to avoid dioxin emissions .
The new recycling method combines Kusatsu Electric 's non-incineration plastic disposal technology using TiO2 and Panasonic 's high grade materials recovery technology that is used by Panasonic to recycle old home appliances .
The method uses unique mixing and carrier systems that allow plastics to contact the catalyst efficiently for gasification , leaving the valuable metals .
As the catalytic reaction of TiO2 generates heat to promote gasification , an additional heating source is not required in the process .
The method uses cooling water to maintain temperature ( 500 °C ) for optimal catalytic reaction .
The subsequent heated water from the process can be used for other purposes .
Hydrogen chloride produced during the gasification process of vinyl chloride is neutralized with lime .
Panasonic aims to completely eliminate mixed plastic waste and spread the use of this environment - friendly technology to recycling - related facilities and further to production facilities in and out of the Panasonic group .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The price of gasoline rose to an all - time high Wednesday , according to the widely followed survey conducted for the motorist group AAA .
The average price of regular rose overnight to $ 3.246 a gallon , according to AAA 's Web site .
That 's nearly 2 cents higher than the previous record of $ 3.227 , which was first set last May and matched Tuesday .
Regular was $ 2.953 on average at this time last month and $ 2.543 a year ago .
Hawaii and California fetched the highest prices at the pump , as consumers had to shell out an average of $ 3.61 and $ 3.59 respectively for a gallon of gas .
But New Jersey and Missouri drivers found gas prices to be nearly 60 cents a gallon cheaper , paying $ 3.02 and $ 3.04 respectively .
When adjusted for inflation , gas prices are still below their peak .
The record on that basis was $ 3.405 and set in March 1981 , according to the Energy Information Administration .
The fuel price survey was conducted for AAA by Oil Price Information Service .

Congratulations , you 've just designed the U.S. " War on Drugs . "
The failures of this " war " are so monumental that they beggar description .
Not only are illegal drugs still readily available , the " war " has spawned a global Mafia which reaps billions of dollars in profits , enabling it to extend its reach into other businesses .
Here at home , inner cities are riven by endless drug- centric turf wars and murders .
Pushers are the " big men " in the ghetto , the ones young men and women respect and hope to emulate .
In an attempt to render the consequences of dealing drugs so horrendous that people would forsake the immense wealth and prestige to be gained , the penalties for drug dealing and possession have been ramped up to insane " minimum sentences " which exceed those for rape and manslaughter .
How doomed - to - fail is this " war " ?
Let 's start with geography .
Take a nation with thousands of miles of unguardable coastline and borders , then toss in the fact that small , low - flying aircraft ensure its airspace is porous as well .
Now guarantee an immense cash reward to anyone who successfully penetrates these thousands of miles of coast and border with a small shipment of drugs .
Gee , do you think somebody will try , and succeed ?
Let 's move onto lethality .
Have you seen those headlines about 15,000 traffic deaths caused by drivers smoking marijuana ?
Strangely enough , there are no such headlines , even though millions of people routinely use marijuana .
The 15,000 people killed every year by drug - addled drivers are killed by alcohol - addled drivers , not marijuana - addled drivers .
Yet nobody seems to make this simple observation .
Every decade , 150,000 Americans are senselessly , needlessly murdered by alcoholic - impaired drivers .
Hundreds of thousands more are injured .
And marijuana is so dangerous that we have to imprison you for years if you deal it ?
Next , let 's ask : if cocaine and heroin were legalized tomorrow , would you run right out and become a junkie ?
It 's really not that appealing , is it , and so what are we so frightened of ?
Research suggests that a small percentage of any human population has a genetic propensity for addiction ; these people seem to find a way to become addicted to alcohol , prescription medication or an illegal drug regardless of the restraints , and perhaps they would be better served by a policy of legalized drugs prescribed by doctors , out in the open , where they could be encouraged to seek treatment .
Contrary to movieland depictions of certain overdose and death , many junkies ( heroin addicts ) function in " day jobs " much like many prescription drug addicts .
From a public health point of view stripped of ideological panic and fear , the legal drugs ( alcohol , nicotine , and dozens of powerful prescription drugs ) kill , maim and cripple more people than do illegal drugs -- so what exactly is the criteria for distinguishing legal from illegal if harm , addictiveness and secondary effects such as 15,000 deaths due to alcohol - impaired drivers are not counted ?
A more rational policy would be :
1. the U.S. government would buy the entire poppy crop in Afghanistan and the Golden Triangle , and the entire coca crop of South America by outbidding the current buyers .
This makes perfect economic sense ; why spend $ 100 billion on a worthless " war on drugs " when $ 100 million would buy the entire global crop of heroin poppies and coca leaves ?
2. all drugs would be legalized and the price dropped to a few dollars per month for all current addicts who registered and obtained their " prescription " from a doctor or clinic .
Marijuana would be equivalent to tobacco , controlled for quality and limited to those 21 years of age and older .
It would be taxed and sold by the same retailers who sell cigarettes and alcohol now .
3. with the cost for heroin , cocaine and marijuana dropped to a few dollars , the illegal drug trade and its panoply of crime , murder and other ills would vanish overnight .
The crimes associated with controlling turf and dealers would vanish too , along with the countless property crimes committed by addicts seeking money for their fix .
4. " Big Pharma " and the tobacco companies would be invited to enter the marijuana trade , ensuring quality and heavy lobbying to keep the product " safe and available to responsible consumers . "
5. all the Mexican drug cartels ' secret fields of marijuana in national forests would be rendered worthless as commercial growers were licensed .
6. with addicts to all drugs registered and coming to clinics for their supplies , the possibility of weaning them from addiction would increase .
7. law enforcement could stop wasting money and staff on the senseless , worthless , grossly ineffective " war on drugs " and focus on violent criminals .
8. a drug - crimes amnesty would clear nonviolent drug users and petty dealers out of prison , enabling major cost savings which could be applied to teaching the released prisoners some useful skills .
9. the " cool factor " in illegal drugs would vanish , as the appealing " forbidden " aspect of drugs would quickly fade .
Once anyone can get drugs at a clinic , it 's just not cool .
10 . Crystal meth addicts could be switched over to " safer " marijuana or cocaine .
I know some of this will be a stretch to those of you who have absorbed decades of propaganda about how awful and horrible illegal drugs are , while hundreds of thousands of innocents have been killed by drunk drivers with nary a whisper of official recognition of the dangers of alcohol .
And let 's not forget the millions killed by incredibly addictive , fully legal cigarettes .
Meanwhile , unbeknownst to those around him , a heroin junkie goes about his daily job , his supposedly horrific addiction bothering no one .
Yes , marijuana is harmful , and heroin and cocaine are dangerous drugs which can kill when abused .
So are prescription " legal " drugs .
Sadly , the hundreds of thousands of dead killed by drunk drivers and cigarettes attest to how " safe " and " harmless " these legal drugs are .
And let 's not forget the thousands who die in overdoses , planned and unplanned , of perfectly legal prescription drugs .
Setting aside the propaganda , on strictly public health and financial metrics , legalizing and controlling all drugs equally is the only rational policy .
As the U.S. slides into recession / depression / financial cataclysm , perhaps the propaganda will give way to this one unavoidable reality : we can no longer afford the $ 100 billion prison complex / gulag and the failed " war on drugs , " regardless of what fantasies / insanities have held sway for decades .
Addiction and drugs are not pretty , but better to have them in the open and low - cost ; an immense burden of crime would disappear overnight .
That alone has value almost beyond a price tag .
Disclosure : I do n't partake of any drugs but wine and beer , which in modest quantities have long been considered either part of a meal or medicinal in nature .
If abused , both become as deadly as any illegal drug .

The next TR is TR 0 .
This is just like OT TR 0 except now you do it with your eyes open .
It ’s been a while and I can’t remember all the numbers .
Anyway the next thing is a TR something or other bull bait .
In this one you tromp on your partners buttons .
Button is scienospeak for an area of embarrassment or discomfort .
So if you partner has acne you would say something like , “ Hey pimple face ! ”
Then when he reacts to that you say , “ flunk ” for whatever reason and you start in again , “ Hey pimple face ! ”
Eventually he gets to a point where “ Hey pimple face ! ” no longer bothers him .
There ’s a benefit to doing this , but I would recommend you stay away from it .
Learn to control your negative responses to things on your own .
You ’ll be better off .
This is a difficult drill to get started on .
I had a hard time with it at first .
Many others do , as well .
Eventually you figure it out .
Then you do several drills in which you use phrases from Alice in Wonderland .
After that come the upper indocs .
Indoc being scienospeak for indoctrination .
I want to put a quote here from 1984 from the essay in the appendix called “ The Principals of Newspeak . ”
“ Even in the early decades of the twentieth century , telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language ; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian organizations .
Examples were such words as Nazi , Gestapo , Comintern , Inprecor , Agitprop .
In the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively , but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose .
It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning , by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it .
The words Communist International , for instance , call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood , red flags , barricades , Karl Marx and the Paris Commune .
The word Comintern , on the other hand , suggest merely a tightly - knit organization and a well - defined body of doctrine .
It refers to something almost as easily recognized , and as limited in purpose , as a chair or table .
Comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought , whereas Communist International is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily . ”
In scienospeak , organization becomes org ; distribution secretary becomes dist sec ; executive director becomes ED ( most people say “ ee dee . ” Hubbard himself used Ed as in Ed Sullivan ) ; in charge becomes I/C ; counter intention is CI ; facsimile becomes fac .
This brief selection of examples is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg as it were .
A major upper indoc TR occurs when you go into a sound proof room and yell at an ash tray .
I was paired up with a young blonde skinny guy with glasses – and pimples .
We went into the furnace room of the org .
( What an ugly word – org . )
The idea behind this drill is to become skilled at giving an order that will bypass any and all intermediary barriers and be obeyed without question or hesitation .
These drills , by the way are done both ways , so you also become skilled at obeying an order without question or hesitation .
What you are doing in this drill is only occupying your space and the space of the ash tray .
Then you give it commands to “ stand up ” and “ sit down in that chair . ”
So that ’s what we did .
First you yell the commands as loud as you can .
Then when your throat wears out you speak them in a normal voice .
So you tell the ash tray to stand up and then you raise it up off the seat of the chair and into the air above your head .
Then you tell it to sit down in the chair and you lower it onto the chair .
You repeat this until you have a win .
We repeated it until we thought we had a win .
We were new at all this so we were n’t exactly sure if we had had a win or not .
But we knew when we had had enough .
The next drill is one where you get another person to look at a wall and then go over to it and touch it .
The person you do this to is supposed to give you as much grief and resistance as possible to prevent you from having your orders carried out and you by using intention get the other person to obey the commands .
This is actually quite a lot of fun .
So is bull baiting by the way .
I finished the course in about a week as I was doing it twelve hours a day .
Sometime during all this I let it slip to Norma Staunton that I had a $ 1000 bond saved up .
Back then university tuition for the year was $ 800 and a place to live was $ 500 for six months .
When I had finished the course Norma comes up and says , “ I have a great idea . ”
And her great idea was that I cash in my bond and buy word clearing method 1 .
“ Just a suggestion , ” says Norma and walks away .
I went into agreement with this very quickly .
I went home , handled my parents ’ antagonism , cashed my $ 1000 bond , found some more money and took the whole lot back to the org and gave it to Norma .
I think that without the conditioning of the course I had just completed I would n’t have been so easy to handle .
( Norma being a public registrar got something like a ten percent commission , which more than made up for her cigarettes that I smoked .
Regular registrars get a one percent commission with bonuses for high stats . )
I have more to tell about this period of time but while we ’re on the subject of money , I have this observation .
Hardly a day goes by where someone involved with the org does n’t ask you for money for something .
Just about every time you go to the org you come away with less money than you went with .
The image that comes to mind is of an African Massai tribe shooting an arrow into a bull ’s neck so they can harvest his blood , mix it with milk and drink it .
The only thing is I ’m the bull with the arrow in the neck .
But it is n't just about me .
Just about anyone in scientology is the bull with the arrow in their neck .
Yesterday the Fed cut US interest rates by 0.75 % , on top of the 2.25 % of cuts since last summer and hot on the heels of last week ’s measures to stimulate liquidity and address funding problems through a new USD 200 billion lending facility for the banking system .
These measures have been particularly aimed at helping the increasingly distressed mortgage market .
But despite the Fed ’s efforts , credit markets remain blocked and investors are still looking for an answer to the ongoing and seemingly unquenchable market volatility .
However , perhaps investors and the Fed alike have been seeking the answer to the wrong , or at least different , questions .
Let ’s look first at the average investor “ on the street ” .
They cannot help but feel bombarded at the moment by a constant flow of bad news regarding the economy ( the majority of financial analysts and journalists are now apparently in agreement that the US economy is actually in recession ) , and regarding the subprime crisis , where rumours andannouncements of financial company writedowns continue to undermine confidence .
Perhaps then the Fed ’s willingness to act , while warmly receivedat first , is on reflection being perceived as confirmation of the darkest rumours and predictionsabout the US housing and mortgage markets currently doing the rounds .
Why else would the Fed so deliberately seek to promote the orderly functioning of the mortgage market ?
READ
This theory could be borne out by the reaction of equity markets ( and the USD ) to the Fed ’s creative actions over the last few months , with the S&P 500 downmore than 10 % since the beginning of the year .
Part of the problem is that the Fed , unlike the ECB and Bank of England , has the dual responsibility of promoting macroeconomic and financial stability .
To this end the Fed has aggressively hacked interest rates , but so far this has not produced the desired effects of lower interbank lending rates or improved liquidity .
For the average home owning American , the Fed ’s policies are n’t working because banks are not passing low Fed funds rates on in the form of lower mortgagerates .
Instead they are keeping the increased spread for themselves in a bid to shore upcash reserves , and particularly in the US and the UK this is having a real impact on the finances of ordinary investors .
The ineffectiveness of monetary policy , at least on its own , to bring stability to the credit markets has led the Fed to be increasingly creative in its use of other measures , such as last week ’s USD 200 billion coordinated effort with other central banks to improve liquidity .
However , each successive measure has produced little other than short - term relief for investors .
Perhaps , then , in targeting liquidity , the Fed is trying to answer the wrong question .
Instead , perhaps the real problem is now one of solvency , rather than liquidity .
If so , then some commentators are now suggesting the Fed should go one step further than its current measures that will already take up to USD 400 billion of mortgage assets onto its balance sheet , and provide real support for asset values throughthe outright purchase of non-government securities .
But any outright purchase of US mortgageswould be a very difficult and messy business –for example , how much should the Fed pay , and which mortgages would qualify ?
It would be a very brave step indeed .
The man with the largest hand in the world will be looking forward to a normal life after undergoing radical plastic surgery at Shanghai No. 9 People ’s Hospital .
Liu Hua , a 24 - year - old Jiangsu Province native , was born with a left thumb , index and middle finger much larger than normal .
Liu was suffering from a rare disease called Macrodactyly , a birth defect in which toes or fingers are abnormally large .
The cause of the disease is unknown but bone and soft tissue grows at an extraordinary rate .
On July 20 surgeons began a seven - hour operation to reduce the size of Liu ’s fingers and thumb .
Doctors removed 5.1 kg of flesh and bone in the procedure .
A second operation is scheduled in six months to reshape his left arm and shoulder .
Mr Bernanke is testifying to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke has warned that US gross domestic product ( GDP ) could contract in the first six months of 2008 .
" It now appears likely that real GDP will not grow much , if at all , over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly , " he told Congress .
Two consecutive three - month periods of negative growth is generally accepted as the definition of a recession .
He did not say " recession " , but it is the closest he has come to doing so .
Mr Bernanke is beginning two days of testimony to the US Congress , where he is likely to quizzed on the Fed 's rescue of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns , which got into trouble because of its exposure to sub - prime loans .
Significant strains
The Fed chairman said that despite the rescue , " financial markets remain under considerable stress " .
" The capacity and willingness of some large institutions to extend new credit remains limited ,  he added .
When asked by the committee whether he thought there would be a recession , he said , " recession is possible " .
But he added that it would take as much as two years to determine whether the economy technically was in recession , based on an the judgement by the non-profit economic research institute , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) .
The NBER defines a recession as " a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months " .
Optimism on future growth Mr Bernanke predicted that the tricky first half of 2008 would be followed by an upturn in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 .
That will be helped by the cuts in interest rates that have already been made and the government 's $ 168bn ( £ 85 bn ) stimulus package , which will give tax rebates to individuals and tax breaks to businesses in the summer .
The Federal Reserve 's interest - rate setters begin their next two - day meeting on 29 April .
Rates have already been reduced to 2.25 % , a drop of more than half since August 2007 .
Bear Stearns Asked about the treatment of Bear Stearns , Mr Bernanke said that the Federal Reserve had helped JPMorgan Chase buy its struggling rival in order to avert a " chaotic " situation .
" We did what we did because we felt it was necessary to preserve the integrity and viability of the American financial system , which in turn is critical for the health of the economy , " he said .
Members of the committee questioned why a big financial institution should be helped more than struggling homeowners .
" We did not bail out Bear Stearns , " he said .
" Bear Stearns shareholders took a very significant loss .
" I do n't think any company is interested in repeating the experience of Bear Stearns . "

( CNN ) -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama defended himself and his wife Sunday against suggestions that they are insufficiently patriotic .
Sen .
Barack Obama defended himself and his wife against recent suggestions that they are not patriotic .
After a town hall meeting in Lorain , Ohio , a reporter asked Obama about " an attempt by conservatives and Republicans to paint you as unpatriotic . "
The reporter cited the fact that Obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem .
Obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that " would disqualify about three - quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game . "
The reporter also noted that the Illinois senator does not wear an American flag lapel pin , has met with former members of the radical anti-Vietnam War group , Weather Underground , and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the United States until recently .
Asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic , Obama said , " There 's always some nonsense going on in general elections .
Right ?
If it was n't this , it would be something else .
If you recall , first it was my name .
Right ?
That was a problem .
And then there was the Muslim e-mail thing and that has n't worked out so well , and now it 's the patriotism thing .
" The way I will respond to it is with the truth : that I owe everything I am to this country , " he said .
The first - term senator from Illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a Muslim , that he took his oath of office on a copy of the Quran and that he attended a radical Islamic school while living in Indonesia as a boy .
" You will recall that the reason I came to national attention was a speech in which I spoke of my love of this country , " said Obama .
He and his wife , Michelle , had already explained her comments .
" She simply misspoke , " he said .
" What she was referring to was [ that ] this was the first time she has been proud of politics in America .
Watch what Michelle Obama said »
" That 's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted .
And she 's spoken about how she has been cynical about American politics for a very long time , but she 's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they have n't in a very long time . "
About not wearing an American flag lapel pin , Obama said Republicans have no lock on patriotism .
" A party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed , or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning , or are not fulfilling the veterans ' benefits that these troops need when they come home , or are undermining our Constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary ?
" That is a debate I am very happy to have .
We 'll see what the American people think is the true definition of patriotism . "
Obama did not respond to the question about the Weather Underground , a group whose members bombed the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon during the 1970s .
Last week , the New York Sun reported that as an Illinois state senator in 2001 , Obama accepted a $ 200 contribution from William Ayers , a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
But the paper said that , in a statement , a spokesman for the Obama campaign , William Burton , said , " Sen . Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group , as he does all acts of violence ...
But he was an 8 - year - old child when Ayers and the Weathermen were active , and any attempt to connect Obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous . "
Former first lady Sen. Hillary Clinton has said repeatedly that she is a stronger candidate because she has already shown she can withstand conservative attacks .

HARRISBURG ( MarketWatch ) -- Pennsylvania has long been a key state for presidential hopefuls to win in November , but because of the tightness of this election 's Democratic race for the nomination and the state 's relatively late primary , voters in the Keystone State are already enjoying a place in the political sun .
In the final days before next Tuesday 's primary , Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a close contest , with the latest polls showing Clinton leading Obama in the state by a narrow 47 % to 44 % .
That three - point lead was down from a 15 - point advantage in early March .
“ Economic issues are at the forefront of voters ' minds , but finding a message to appeal to Pennsylvanians as a whole is no easy task . ”
With 188 delegates at stake for the Democrats - and with every delegate counting as Obama 's delegate count of 1,645 is just edging out Clinton 's tally of 1,504 - the two Democratic senators have been canvassing the state for weeks , hoping to hook into the concerns of the voters , who put the economy at the top of their worry lists .
Pennsylvania also will loom large in November .
If David Black has his way , Pennsylvania will go Republican - red in November .
Democrat Audra Traynham , though , wants to see the Keystone State go blue .
Now , with its primary just days away , this so - called " purple " state appears to be leaning blue , raising the possibility that the Democratic nominee could take home this important swing state in the general election .
Until recently , Sen. John McCain had stacked up about evenly compared to Clinton and Obama here .
But presumptive Republican nominee McCain has lost his standing against both Democrats and is now trailing Obama by 8 percentage points and Clinton by 9 points , according to a Rasmussen Reports poll .
Pennsylvania 's status as a " purple " state -- closely split between Republicans and Democrats -- makes it a key battleground , and this year appears to be no exception , guaranteeing that candidates will have to craft highly strategic appeals to capture the state .
The Keystone State holds 21 electoral votes and has the sixth largest population in the U.S. Democrats outnumber Republicans , but not by much .
However , Democrats ' ranks have been swelling in Pennsylvania thanks to the pivotal importance of the state 's April 22 primary .
Recently , their number topped four million for the first time .
A state in play
" Pennsylvania generally is in play , " says Black , 54 , the president and chief executive of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber and Capital Region Economic Development Corporation .
Now , as Democrats Clinton and Obama take the race for their party 's nomination down to the wire , the Pennsylvania primary is getting some unaccustomed national attention .
" I am so excited that Pennsylvania is finally counting , " says Traynham , a 41 - year - old janitor in Philadelphia .
Polls and interviews across the state indicate that economic issues are at the forefront of voters ' minds here .
In the April Franklin & Marshall College poll , the economy again outpaced the Iraq war as the single most important issue in the presidential election .
But with Democrats clustered in Philadelphia , Pittsburgh and other urban areas , and Republicans generally huddling in the rural stretches in between the state 's eastern and western borders , appealing to Pennsylvanians as a whole is no easy task .
" It 's a little bit of a chess game , " says Prof. Terry Madonna , director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall .
Talking trade
As a long - time manufacturing state , jobs and trade are of key importance to Pennsylvania .
The state has lost more than 207,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000 , or about a quarter of all Pennsylvania factory jobs , according to figures provided by the Alliance for American Manufacturing .
Bitterness about those job losses runs through places like Reading , a city of about 83,000 in Berks County , to the northwest of Philadelphia .
Citing plant closures in her area , residents like Ruth Mathews say the next resident of the White House must come up with trade policies that work for U.S. workers .
" There 's a whole raft of things that need , I believe , to be revisited , " says Mathews , 70 , the executive director of United Community Services .
Manufacturers , she says , go where their profit margin is the highest , hiring workers in China or Mexico or the Philippines .
But , the Democrat says , " somewhere along the line , we 've got to ask the central question of how much profit are you allowed ? "
" There are n't any jobs like I used to have , " chimes in Carl Ramich , a 67 - year - old retiree who worked in fabrication for Dana Corp. in Reading and sat down to be interviewed with Mathews .
Democrats ' appeals
Clinton and Obama are both actively courting voters like Mathews and Ramich .
Clinton spent part of the week of March 31 on a swing through Pennsylvania cities including Harrisburg , Wilkes - Barre and Philadelphia , talking up her plans on the economy , including creating manufacturing jobs and pushing through tax cuts for the middle class .
" I believe our government should get out of the business of rewarding companies for shipping jobs overseas , and get back into the business of rewarding companies that create good , high - wage jobs -- with good benefits -- right here in America , " Clinton said in Pittsburgh on April 2 .
Talk like that sounds good to 57 - year - old Greg Bowers , president of the United Steelworkers of America 's local union 1688 in Steelton .
" We 're getting our butts kicked because of trade , " says Bowers .
" We 've got to get back to making and not just buying . "
The only trouble for Clinton is that Bowers , like fellow union members Jim Roberts and Jim Laws , is backing Obama .
" I think he makes more sense , " says Roberts , who is 60 .
" He is not displaying a measure of desperation , as she is , and people pick up on that . "
Obama also canvassed Pennsylvania around the same time Clinton did , and polls show the Illinois senator 's stock rising in the Keystone State .
On Friday , a Rasmussen Reports poll showed Clinton leading Obama in Pennsylvania 47 % to 44 % , closing a 15 - point lead in early March .
The poll was conducted after Wednesday night 's debate between the two Democrats in Philadelphia , where the candidates addressed taxes , energy and the Iraq war .
See Election Notebook .
" His numbers typically surge , I think , when he comes into a state , " says Marty Santalucia , 19 , the vice president of Penn State Harrisburg 's student government and president of that school 's students for Obama organization .
Obama has also won the support of 22 - year - old Lebanon Valley College senior Lauren Woodring , who believes she has a better chance of retaining health insurance if a Democrat wins the White House .
But , says the history and political science major , " if [ Clinton ] turns out to be the nominee , I 'd be fine with that . "
Red center
Pennsylvania 's recent history would suggest that a Democrat will win the state in November : voters here have n't gone for a Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988 .
But Tammy Shearer and David Black want to change that .
" People want somebody that 's going to look out for them , " says Shearer , who is vice president of The Camera Box in Camp Hill , near Harrisburg .
" They want somebody that 's going to take care of their taxes , that 's going to think about the gas price issue .
And people are thinking ... they want their streets safe , they want the country safe . "
For Shearer and many of her neighbors , that somebody is John McCain .
" Central Pennsylvania is die - hard Republican and it has been as long as I can remember , " said Shearer in an interview at the Silver Spring Diner in Mechanicsburg .
The 37 - year - old cites spiraling energy and health care costs as her chief economic concerns .
But a heavy - handed approach to issues like those by government wo n't play well in this part of the state , suggests Black of the Chamber .
" The biggest fear of the business community is that we 're going to get too much government , " says Black , a former Republican county commissioner in Clarion County .
He worries about higher taxes and more regulation if a Democrat is elected to the White House .
Black acknowledges that there are " fundamental problems " with the delivery of health care in the U.S. but says " let 's try to fix it before we start to have government paying for it . "
McCain says he 'll address bringing health care costs under control to save affordable health insurance , Medicare and Medicaid .
Bringing those costs under control , McCain says , is the only way to protect private health benefits for retirees and allow U.S. companies " to effectively compete around the world . "
The Arizona senator will probably win the votes of conservatives in the central part of the state .
But the Republican nominee - in - waiting will have a tougher time in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , and certain suburbs can go either way .
Swing county in a swing state
McCain will have to fine - tune his message in places like Doylestown , Bucks County , just above Philadelphia .
The county is home to moderate Republicans and has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in the last four elections .
In this relatively prosperous county , Republicans like John Soffronoff , the president and chief executive of Monument Bank , are weary of the Iraq war and argue that there need to be tighter rules on mortgage brokers in order to shield borrowers from getting into risky loans .
" Consumers need to be protected , " says Soffronoff , 61 .
Both Soffronoff and Peter Thompson , a 66 - year - old lawyer and Democrat , acknowledge that the economy has slowed down , even in their county .
" I do n't think there 's any question growth has slowed , " says Soffronoff .
Thompson says he sees empty storefronts in Doylestown , an unusual sight over the last 15 to 20 years .
Still , the county 's politically diverse demographics suggest it'll go for a Democrat in the general election , says Binny Silverman , a Hillary Clinton supporter who helps to run a real estate development and management company .
Silverman says that the middle - class needs help and praises Clinton for reaching out to it .
" I think you can't help the economy if you do n't help the middle class .
The middle class is really struggling , " says Silverman .
Despite Obama 's recent surge in popularity , it 's economic concerns like those that suggest Clinton may bag Pennsylvania 's primary .
In the April Franklin & Marshall poll , more voters said the economy came to mind when they heard Clinton 's name versus Obama's .

Systems Made by Diebold , Sequoia and Hart InterCivic Are ' Still Going to Have Same Viral Vulnerabilities Found ' During California 's 2007 Study ...

A bunch of world - class computer scientists testified publicly this week that " U.S. Presidential Election Can Be Hacked " .
As stunning as that sounds , there 's nothing new here necessarily to readers of The BRAD BLOG , other than the fact that outlets like the IDG News Service and PCWorld are reporting it --- out loud --- and that the computer scientist community , specifically those who have been studying these systems , are now out and out saying it --- in public ... and out loud .
" The three systems we looked at are three of the most widely used around the nation , " warned professor David Wagner of the University of California , " They 're going to be using them in the 2008 elections ; they 're still going to have the same vulnerabilities we found . "
Wagner was speaking about e-voting system made by Diebold , Sequoia Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic which he examined during CA Sec. of State Debra Bowen 's independent " Top to Bottom " review last year .
He " and his team found that they could introduce a computer virus to any of the three systems , which would then spread throughout the county and ultimately skew the vote count , " the IDG News Service reports .
While our readers may be familiar with the above , our friend " DHinMI " and his fellow misinformed Daily Kos front pagers may want to give this short article a quick look sometime soon .
Particularly the part about paper ballots , and that simply having them is not enough ... if nobody bothers to actually count them .
Here 's the key grafs from the article ... Along with a special clip for the dangerously misinformed / misleading dKos boys and girls ...
U.S. Presidential Election Can Be Hacked
Robert McMillan , IDG News Service
This year , the U.S. will pick a new president using electronic voting machines that can be hacked , security experts said Thursday
...
As the November election approaches , the question before officials is not how to fix known bugs in their e-voting systems , but rather , how best to check them for fraud , said David Wagner , an associate professor with the University of California , Berkeley 's computer science department .
Wagner was part of the team that audited California 's voting systems during the state 's review of electronic voting , and the problems his team found affect counties across the U.S.
" The three systems we looked at are three of the most widely used around the nation , " he said during an e-voting panel discussion at the show .
" They 're going to be using them in the 2008 elections ; they 're still going to have the same vulnerabilities we found . "
...
The California audit examined systems from Diebold Elections Systems , Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems , ultimately permitting their use in 2008 , but only under certain conditions .
In testing , Wagner and his team found that they could introduce a computer virus to any of the three systems , which would then spread throughout the county and ultimately skew the vote count .
And in case yutzes like disinfo specialist and DailyKos front pager , Dana " DHinMI " Houle , do n't bother to read the full piece linked above , here 's a special clipping just for him / them ...
Wagner said ... even the states that keep paper records are not necessarily checking their results .
Only about a third of all states have records that are regularly audited .
( Never mind that none of those states actually does much of a legitimate public " audit " , of those paper ballots and / or records , but you get the drift . )
So , how does that square with your embarrassingly inaccurate dKos front page article written after the New Hampshire primary , Mr. Houle ?
We 're guessing you 've yet to apologize to your readers for dangerously and wholly misleading them about key issues of Election Integrity , right ?
Of course , right .
In the early 1980s , George C. was IT support on a team overseeing a large installation of workstations .
At the time , this was a pretty novel concept .
Several
Unix site managers applied to help out but wanted " too much money , " according to management .
Instead , the IT manager rounded up a bunch of recent college graduates ( who were much cheaper ) .
Problem solved .
There were roughly 80 workstations that were being installed , each with two 70 MB drives .
One drive kept the operating system files ( which the users could n't modify ) , the other was the user drive for work files .
Each system was backed up and updated nightly with a three step process :
Back up all files that have changed on each client 's user drive .
Replace old files on each client 's system drive .
Delete files that are no longer needed from each client 's system drive .
For this step it'd just remove any files from the system drive on the client 's machine that did n't exist on the server so everyone had a consistent system drive .
The tech writers on the staff were working overtime on the 5 - year funding plan ; a huge document that spanned several hundreds of pages .
The file was growing in size quickly , and the machine the document was stored on was running out of space .
The ops team did n't want to see any delays in getting the document submitted , so they bought a gigantic 150MB hard drive and installed it on the key machine and proceeded to load the file from backup .
Except the file was n't in the backup .
In fact , none of the user files had been backed up .
Ever .
The user drive , in order to be seamlessly integrated into what appeared to be a uniform file system , was a " softlink " from the root partition .
And I 'll let you guess whether the backup system was configured to follow softlinks .
( Hint : no . )
As a result , the backup was only running against the system partition , and all of the system partitions in the organization were the same .
User files were untouched by the backup .
But wait , you 're probably thinking , they still had the 70 MB drive that the file was on , right ?
I 'll let you guess again .
( Hint : no . )
No one knew where the drive was .
Including , strangely , the guy who pulled the drive in the first place .
They had just lost their only computer - readable copy of the document they 'd been working on for months .
Thank god they 'd printed out a copy a week before and had some early OCR technology at their disposal .
They started scanning the document like crazy , and by " like crazy , " I mean pretty slowly .
The OCR technology was n't terribly accurate or fast .
And they only had a few days before they had to deliver the report .
They needed another solution .
Desperate times called for desperate measures .
Every employee in the building was ordered to put whatever they were working on on hold .
Instead of their normal work , they 'd each be given a stack of pages from the last printout of the budget plan to retype .
The documentation team was tasked with collecting everyone 's files , reassembling , styling , and formatting the document .
Meanwhile , the backup administrators took action to correct their embarrassing and costly mistake .
They updated the configuration of the backup plan to follow softlinks .
The staff was stressed out and overextended ; most people were working late and doing tasks they hated .
One of the programmers was nodding off at his desk around 2:00 AM one night , and when he went to open a file he'd been working on , it was gone .
In fact , all his files were gone .
His user drive was empty .
Remembering that the backups were kicked off at 2:00 , he sprinted to the backup server to kill the process .
Remember the final step of the backup plan ?
It 'd try to synchronize the user 's system drive with the server 's so everyone had a consistent image .
Well , it extended this to user drives .
Since the server 's version of the user drive did n't have any files , it 'd delete all of the files in the client 's user drive .
I guess the good news is that the synchronization was working .
The programmer killed the backup process in time to save half of the machines , but the other half had their user data wiped clean .
The irony of this issue is that George was on vacation and came back better off than any of the employees that 'd been working overtime for the last week .
The other employees could n't do their regular work because they were tasked with retyping pages of the budget plan , only to have them lost by the backup system 's destructive rampage .
George was on a DOS system that he backed up on his own , so all he lost in the shuffle were a few emails .
In the end , the IT manager was able to keep his job and his team managed to finally get the backup system running correctly , or at least to the point that it was n't deleting everything .
A new civil war is threatening to explode in Iraq as American - backed Iraqi government forces fight Shia militiamen for control of Basra and parts of Baghdad .
Heavy fighting engulfed Iraq 's two largest cities and spread to other towns yesterday as the Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , gave fighters of the Mehdi Army , led by the radical cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , 72 hours to surrender their weapons .
The gun battles between soldiers and militiamen , who are all Shia Muslims , show that Iraq 's majority Shia community – which replaced Saddam Hussein 's Sunni regime – is splitting apart for the first time .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Sadr 's followers believe the government is trying to eliminate them before elections in southern Iraq later this year , which they are expected to win .
Mortars and rockets launched from Mehdi Army - controlled districts of Baghdad struck the Green Zone , the seat of American power in Iraq , for the third day yesterday , seriously wounding three Americans .
Two rockets hit the parking lot of the Iraqi cabinet .
The mixed area of al - Mansur in west Baghdad , where shops had begun to reopen in recent months , was deserted yesterday as Mehdi Army fighters were rumoured among local people to be moving in from the nearby Shia stronghold of Washash .
" We expect an attack by the Shia in spite of the Americans being spread over Sunni districts to defend them , " said a Sunni resident .
Forty people have been killed and at least 200 injured in Basra in the last two days of violence .
In the town of Hilla , south of Baghdad , 11 people were killed and 18 injured yesterday by a US air strike called in support of Iraqi forces following street battles with Shia militia members in the city 's Thawra neighbourhood .
In Baghdad , 14 have been killed and 140 wounded .
The supporters of Mr Sadr , who form the largest political movement in Iraq , blame the Americans for giving the go - ahead for Mr Maliki 's offensive against them and supporting it with helicopters and bomber aircraft .
US troops have sealed off Sadr City , the close - packed slum in the capital with a population that is the main bastion of the Sadrists , while the Mehdi Army has taken over its streets , establishing checkpoints , each manned by about 20 heavily armed men .
It is unlikely that the militiamen in Basra will surrender as demanded by the government .
Sadiq al - Rikabi , an adviser to Mr Maliki , said those who kept their weapons would be arrested .
" Any gunman who does not do that within three days will be an outlaw . "
Streets were empty in Basra and Baghdad as people stayed at home to avoid the fighting .
The Mehdi Army is enforcing a strike in Baghdad with mosques calling for the closure of shops , businesses and schools .
In the Shia city of Kut , on the Tigris south of Baghdad , local residents say that black - clad Mehdi Army militiamen have taken over five districts and expelled the police .
At the same time , Mr Sadr is clearly eager to continue the truce which he declared on 29 August last year after bloody clashes in Kerbala with Iraqi police controlled by the rival Shia political movement , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , and their well - organised militia , the Badr organisation .

He renewed this ceasefire in February , saying he wanted to purge its ranks of criminals .
" The freeze that Sadr has ordered is still ongoing , " said one of his chief lieutenants , Luwaa Smaism .
Mr Sadr has sought to avoid an all - out military confrontation with American troops or Badr backed by American forces since he fought two ferocious battles for Najaf against US marines in 2004 .
Mr Sadr has sent emissaries to Mr Maliki asking him to remove his troops , numbering some 15,000 men from Basra , and to resolve problems peacefully .
But his aides say there will be no talks until the Iraqi army reinforcements are withdrawn .
The offer of talks is in keeping with Mr Sadr 's past behaviour , which is to appear conciliatory but in practice to make few real concessions .
The US is claiming that the Sadrists are not being singled out , only Iran - supported militia factions , but this will find few believers in Iraq .
" This is not a battle against the [ Mehdi Army ] nor is it a proxy war between the United States and Iran , " said a US military spokesman , Major General Kevin Bergner .
" It is [ the ] government of Iraq taking the necessary action to deal with criminals on the streets . "
The Sunni population is pleased to see the government and the Americans attacking the Mehdi Army , which they see as a Shia death squad .
" Before , the Shia were arresting and killing us and forcing us to leave Iraq for Jordan and Syria where we lived in misery , " said Osama Sabr , a Sunni in west Baghdad .
The fighting is threatening to disrupt Iraq 's oil production , most of which comes from the Basra area , because workers in the oilfields dare not leave their homes .
The militia
The Mehdi Army
Armed wing of the Sadr movement .
Muqtada al - Sadr 's militia is divided , with one wing supporting the radical cleric 's ceasefire while another has rejected it and continued attacks on Iraqi government forces and the British base at Basra aiport .
The Badr Brigade
Armed wing of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council .
The Badr Brigade has been involved in numerous clashes with the Mehdi Army and appears not to be the target of the current offensive by the Iraqi government forces .
The group has organised " spontaneous " demonstrations against General Mohan and General Jalil .
The Fadhila
A political party and armed group with a localised powerbase .
The governor of Basra is a member of the party , and it controls a significant proportion of the region 's oil supply .
Secret Cells
Said to be armed and trained by Iran and allegedly carrying out attacks ordered by Tehran .

White people have always been renowned for having ridiculously large music collections .
So when file sharing gave white people a chance to acquire all the music they ever wanted , it felt as though it was an earned right and not a privilege .
When ( not if ) you see a white male with a full iPod , ask him if all of his music is legal .
If he does not immediately launch into a diatribe about his right to pirate music , you might have to nudge him a bit by saying “ do you think that ’s right ? ”
The response will be immediate and uniform .
He will likely rattle off statistics about how most musicians do n’t make any money from albums , it all comes from touring and merchandise .
So by attending shows , he is able to support the musicians while simultaneously striking a blow against multinational corporations .
He will proceed to walk you through the process of how record labels are set up to reward the corporation and fundamentally rob the artist of their rights , royalties and creativity .
Prepare to hear the name Steve Albini a lot .
Advanced white people will also talk about how their constant downloading of music makes them an expert who can properly recommend bands to friends and co-workers , thus increasing revenues and exposure .
So in fact , their “ illegal ” activities are the new lifeblood of the industry .
When they have finished talking , you must choose your next words wisely .
It is considered rude to point out the simple fact that they are still getting music for free .
Instead you should say : “ Wow , I never thought of it like that .
You know a lot about the music industry .
What bands are you listening to right now ?
Who is good ? ”
This sentence serves two functions : it helps to reassure the white person that they are your local “ music expert , ” something they prize .
Also , it lets them feel as though they have convinced you that their activities are part of a greater social cause and not simple piracy .
If you bring up this issue with white person who says “ nah bro , I do n’t give a shit , Dave Matthews has enough money as it is . ”
You are likely dealing with wrong kind of white person .
In the even more rare situation where someone says “ it ’s all paid for , and it ’s all transferred from vinyl . ”
You have found an expert level white person and must treat the situation carefully .
Because of the availability of music online , a very strict social hierarchy has been created within white culture whereby someone with a large MP3 collection is considered “ normal , ” a large CD collection is considered to be “ better , ” and a person with a large vinyl collection is recognized as “ elite . ”
These elite white people abhor the fact that music piracy has made their B - sides , live performances , and bootlegs available to the masses .
Their entire life ’s work has been stripped of its rarity in terms of both object and sound on the record .
The best thing you can say to them is : “ vinyl still sounds better . ”
However , it is recommended that you do not let this conversation drag much longer .
If you let them continue talking to you they are likely to spend hours talking to you about bands you ’ve never heard of and providing you with a weekly mix CD of rarities that you do not want .

His most popular creation is a curvaceous side table , and even though he has sold only two copies of it , he has already turned a profit .
He did it without so much as setting foot in a wood shop .
And he is not alone .
Wegesin is one of 5,000 merchants who have established accounts with Ponoko , a year - old on - demand manufacturing service in New Zealand .
Designers upload their blueprints to Ponoko 's servers ; when a customer places an order , Ponoko 's laser cutters automatically trim wood and plastic to create the product on the spot .
Wegesin , a Web designer , sells the tables through the site for $ 250 , not including shipping .
He then pays Ponoko $ 124 for each table to cover the cost of materials and cutting fees .
The $ 252 he 's brought in so far may not be much , but because he incurred no up - front costs it comes as pure profit .
Welcome to the age of the instapreneur .
With nothing more than a design , amateurs can manufacture jewelry , robots , T - shirts , furniture — anything .
No warehouses .
No minimum orders .
And no money down .
The digital economy is n't just digital ; the same market forces that allowed midlist musicians to make a living distributing their songs online now give amateur clothiers the chance to sell their wares without having to persuade Barney 's buyers to carry them .
Thousands are launching instant businesses .
Zazzle , of Redwood City , California , offers a dizzying array of user - designed products from posters to tennis shoes .
StyleShake , a custom - clothing site in London , received 25,000 dress designs in its first three months .
Spreadshirt , founded in Leipzig , Germany , hosts 500,000 individual T - shirt shops .
" These companies significantly lower the threshold for someone to bring anything to market , " says Neil Gershenfeld , director of MIT 's Center for Bits and Atoms .
" There 's an industrial - age bias that you need volume to support a factory ; but with this , much - more - creative low - volume businesses become viable . "
These are not just CaféPress - style in - jokes — T - shirts and mugs meant to appeal to a small circle of friends .
According to Spreadshirt CEO Jana Eggers , her site saw a 30 percent increase last year in the number of North American shop partners that sold more than 1,000 shirts annually .
Even CaféPress has become a bona fide business platform .
Jim Gamble , a Bay Area entrepreneur , uses the site to sell 50,000 of his T - shirts and bumper stickers — all emblazoned with conservative political slogans — every year , giving him an income " well into the six figures , " he says .
Large brands are starting to see the appeal of manufacturing - as - a - service , too .
Lexus recently used Blurb , an on - demand publisher , to print 1,800 copies of a book promoting the automaker 's green practices .
Franchises from Dilbert to the Discovery Channel sell licensed merchandise on CaféPress .
Disney has uploaded more than 3,500 of its designs to Zazzle , allowing the company to sell a wider range of products than just the blockbuster Mickey Mouse T - shirts favored by conventional retailers .
The service also gives the Disney machine unprecedented agility .
" Here , I can see that Hannah Montana is taking off , we can upload a design right into Zazzle 's system , and in a day or two it's a product , " says Patrick Haley , senior manager of customization for DisneyShopping.com .
As everyone gains the ability to create and sell anything , the long tail will apply to making things as well as to selling them .
Amazon.com may be able to offer near - infinite inventory , but only as long as the products exist .
On - demand manufacturing could eliminate that constraint , leading to a world where products are always available , nothing ever gets discontinued , and the virtual shelves are always stocked .

The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research has a couple of interesting things in the works , the first being next generation media storage .
Dutch researcher Alexander le Fèbre has demonstrated that a field - emission current signal can be used to arrange the position of thousands of nanometre - sharp needles .
These probes can be applied to write and read in new storage media with an extremely high density , using bits on a nanometre scale .
The development of the hard disk is reaching its technical limits because the entire disk is served by just a single head so the capacity of the disk and the reading and writing speed cannot expand much more in the future .
Research into a memory based on probes from the University of Twente ’s MESA + research institute means able to control the position of each separate probe - essential for realizing a system with extremely high densities .
Le Fèbre 's measurements show that a field - emission current signal can be used to adjust the position of the probes without these making direct contact with the storage medium .
If a constant current is maintained and the applied voltage is varied , the distance between the probe apex and the storage medium can be adjusted from several nanometres to about 100 nanometres .
The resolution is sufficient for a probe - based storage system .
However for practical applications , the current stability and the lifetime of the probes will need to be improved further so that the accuracy and reproducibility of positioning can be increased .
Dutch mathematician Anne Fey has been examining self - organization using probability calculations in mathematical sandpile models .
Practical applications are , for example , movements in the Earth 's crust , stock market fluctuations and the formation of traffic jams .
These mathematical models are defined on a grid .
Each grid point has a height , or quantity of sand , that must be below a limiting value .
With each time interval , the height of one of the points increases .
If a height exceeds a limiting value the sand must be moved to nearby points until all points are once again under the limiting value .
Although the rules of the model are simple , the wide - ranging behaviour that emerges from these is fascinating .
Sandpile models exhibit various forms of self - organisation and patterns are formed which are stable over the course of time .
That is seen most clearly in the case where only the height of the mid-point increases .
The sand then spreads out symmetrically in highly angulated forms , in which fractal patterns develop .
Fractal patterns have an infinite quantity of details in which designs are repeated on an increasingly smaller scale – this is comparable to ice crystals and certain corals .
In the other situations , the choice of the point where the height increases is random .
Then ' self - organised criticality ' occurs , a deeper form of self - organisation that is also studied in diverse research areas such as movements in the Earth 's crust , stock market fluctuations and the formation of traffic jams .
Portal was offered to XBLA , but rejected Multi award - winning title unsuitable for download platform due to size , and other reasons

GamesIndustry.biz has learnt that Valve asked Microsoft if it was possible to place its award - winning Orange Box title , Portal , on Xbox Live Arcade for download , but that it was rejected .
" We 'd love to do that .
Right now it 's something we 'd love to do .
I 'd love to sell Portal on Xbox live , " said Doug Lombardi , VP of marketing at Valve . " [ But ] the platform holders are n't doing that right now .
There 's a size limit and all kinds of other things .
" We 've asked them , we said we were open to it .
So it 's a decision for the platform holder and how they want to make the games available and how much bandwidth they want to [ allow ] . "
But Lombardi did hint that something might be possible in the future : " I think it 's a trade - off , we 'll see it one day .
" It always happens once it 's been proven and I think it 's been proven now on Steam , so I 'm sure it'll migrate back to the consoles just like everything else does . "
Portal was one of five titles available as part of last year 's acclaimed Orange Box release , and won three awards - including Game of the Year - at this year 's GDC event in San Francisco .
Microsoft increased the size limit for Xbox Live Arcade titles last March to 150MB , up from its previous limit of 50MB .

Marc uploaded a new revision of the Python DB - API 2.0 Specification yesterday that documents the new two phase commit extension that I helped develop on the db-sig mailing list .
My interest in this started from the desire to support two phase commit in Storm – without that feature there are far fewer occasions where its ability to talk to multiple databases can be put to use .
As I was doing some work on psycopg2 for Launchpad , I initially put together a PostgreSQL specific patch , which was ( rightly ) rejected by Federico .
He suggested that it would be better to try and standardise on an API on the db-sig list , so that ’s what I did .
I looked over the API exposed by other database adapters that supported 2PC , and the 2PC APIs of the major free databases that did not have support in their Python adapters ( MySQL and PostgreSQL ) .
The resulting API is a bit more complicated than my original PostgreSQL - only but has the advantage of being implementable on other databases such as MySQL .
Below is a simple example of using the API directly ( missing some of the error handling ) :
# begin transactions for each database connection conn1.tpc_begin(conn1.xid( 42 , ' transaction ID ' , ' connection 1 ' ) ) conn2.tpc_begin(conn2.xid( 42 , ' transaction ID ' , ' connection 2 ' ) ) #
Do stuff with both connections ... try : conn1.tpc_prepare( ) conn2.tpc_prepare ( ) except DatabaseError : conn1.tpc_rollback ( ) conn2.tpc_rollback ( ) else : conn1.tpc_commit( ) conn2.tpc_commit ( )
Or alternatively , if you ’ve got one connection supporting 2PC and the other only supporting one - phase commit , it could be structured as follows :
# begin transactions for each database connection conn1.tpc_begin(conn1.xid( 42 , ' transaction ID ' , ' connection 1 ' ) ) #
Do stuff with both connections ... try : conn1.tpc_prepare( ) conn2.commit( ) except DatabaseError : conn1.tpc_rollback ( ) conn2.rollback ( ) else : conn1.tpc_commit ( )
While it is possible to use the 2PC API directly , it is expected that most applications will rely on a transaction manager to coordinate global transactions , such as Zope ’s transaction module .
The hope is that by offering a consistent API , Python application frameworks will be more likely to bother supporting this feature of databases .
Hopefully you ’ll be able to use the API with PostgreSQL and Storm soon .

Muslim prisoners held in Iraq�s Abu Ghraib prison were submerged in water - filled garbage cans with ice or put naked under cold showers in near - freezing rooms until they went into shock , Sgt. Javal Davis , who served with the 372nd Military Police Company there , has told a national magazine .
Davis , from the Roselle , N.J. , area , said while stationed at the prison he also saw an incinerator with " bones in it " that he believed to be a crematorium and said some prisoners were starved prior to their interrogation .
Another soldier that had been stationed at Abu Ghraib , M.P. Sabrina Harman --- who gained dubious fame for making a thumbs - up sign posing over the body of a prisoner she believed tortured to death --- said the U.S. had imprisoned " women and children " on Tier 1B , including one child was as young as ten .
" Like a number of the other kids and of the women there , he was being held as a pawn in the military�s effort to capture or break his father , " write co-authors Philip Gourevitch and Errol Morris in the March 24th issue of The New Yorker magazine , which describes Abu Ghraib in a 14 - page article titled " Exposure . "
They assert " the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib was de facto United States policy .
The authorization of torture and the decriminalization of cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment of captives in wartime have been among the defining legacies of the current Administration . "
They add that the rules of interrogation that produced the abuses documented in the prison " were the direct expression of the hostility toward international law and military doctrine that was found in the White House , the Vice - President�s office , and at the highest levels of the Justice and Defense Departments . "
( President Bush has insisted " We do not torture , " The Associated Press reported on November 7 , 2005 . )
Imprisoning suspects in a war zone , torturing and / or murdering them , and holding their wives and children as hostages , are all banned practices under international law .
Some prisoners died from rocket attacks on the compound .
Harman said she didn�t like taking away naked prisoners � blankets when it was really cold .
" Because if I �m freezing and I �m wearing a jacket and a hat and gloves , and these people don�t have anything on and no blanket , no mattress , that �s kind of hard to see and do to somebody --- even if they are a terrorist . "
( Note : the prisoners were suspects , not terrorists , being held without due process on charges of which they were often ignorant and without legal representation . )
Harman said the corpse she posed with likely was murdered during interrogation although a platoon commander said he had died of a heart attack .
Harman and another soldier , Corporal Charles Graner unzipped his body bag and took photos of him and " kind of realized right away that there was no way he died of a heart attack because of all the cuts and blood coming out of his nose . "
Harman added , " His knees were bruised , his thighs were bruised by his genitals .
He had restraint marks on his wrists . "
Asked why she posed making a " thumbs up " gesture over the corpse , Harman said she thought , " Hey , it �s a dead guy , it�d be cool to get a photo next to a dead person .
I know it looks bad .
I mean , even when I look at them ( the photos ) I go , ' Oh Jesus , that does look pretty bad . � "
The corpse , said to have died under interrogation by a CIA agent , was identified as that of Manadel al - Jamadi .
An autopsy found he had succumbed to " blunt force injuries " and " compromised respiration " and his death was classified as a homicide , The New Yorker article said .
The dead man was removed from the tier disguised as a sick prisoner , his arm taped to an IV , and rolled away on a gurney , apparently as authorities " didn�t want any of the prisoners thinking we were in there killing folks , " Sergeant Hydrue Joyner , Harman�s team leader , told the magazine .
Harman said she saw one naked prisoner with his hands bound behind his back raised higher than his shoulders .
This forced him to bend forward with his head bowed and his weight suspended from his wrists and is known as a " Palestinian hanging " as it is said to be used in Israeli prisons , Gourevitch and Morris write .
In a letter to a friend Harman described " sleep deprivation " used on the prisoners : " They sleep one hour then we yell and wake them --- make them stay up for one hour , then sleep one hour --- then up etc .
This goes on for 72 hours while we fuck with them .
Most have been so scared they piss on themselves .
Its sad . "
On one occasion , she wrote , sandbags soaked in hot sauce were put over the prisoners� heads .
The CIA agent that interrogated al - Jamadi at the time of his " heart attack " was never charged with a crime but Harman was convicted by court - martial in May , 2005 , of conspiracy to maltreat prisoners , dereliction of duty and sentenced to six months in prison , reduced in rank , and given a bad - conduct discharge .
Five other soldiers involved in taking pictures were sentenced to terms of up to ten years in prison .
Gourevitch and Morris write , " The only person ranked above staff sergeant to face a court - martial was cleared of criminal wrongdoing . "
Sergeant Javal Davis , describing Abu Ghraib generally , said the prison reminded him of something out of a " Mad Max " movie , explaining , " The encampment they were in when we saw it at first looked like one of those Hitler things , like a concentration camp , almost . "
The inside , he said , is " nothing but rubble , blown - up buildings , dogs running all over the place , rabid dogs , burnt remains .
The stench was unbearable : urine , feces , body rot .
Their ( prisoners � ) rest rooms was running over .
It was just disgusting .
You didn�t want to touch anything .
Whatever the worst thing that comes to your mind , that was it --- the place you would never ever , ever , ever send your worst enemy . "
When a delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross visited the prison in October , 2003 , they were denied full access ( contrary to international law ) and , The New Yorker said , " what they were permitted to see and hear did not please them : men held naked in bare , lightless cells , paraded naked down the hallways , verbally and physically threatened , and so forth . "
The ICRC reported the prison was plagued by gross and systematic violations of the Geneva Conventions , including physical abuses that left prisoners suffering from " incoherent speech , acute anxiety reactions �suicidal ideas . "

It was here in the rainforests of the Owen Stanley Range that he would return , much older , to honour a grim promise that would take him 26 years and 400 million yen in life savings and pension payments to carry out .
" I can never forget that pledge to my comrades , " recalled the 88 - year - old veteran , whose failing strength has forced him to abandon his one - man mission and return to Tokyo .
" It was January 12 [ 1943 ] , and our food had run out .
By then I weighed less than 30 kilograms and , like the other troops , I was eating the flesh of dead enemy soldiers just to stay alive .
" Those who were strong enough were evacuating from the coast , deserting the weak and ordering them to keep the Australians and Americans at bay .
So I said to the soldiers left behind : ' No matter what happens , if you die in this land I will come back for you , and I 'll return you to Japan to rest with your families .
This is my promise to you ' . "
Such was the old soldier 's determination to make good on his word that he walked out on his wife and two sons in 1979 to do so .
As he reflects in a book to be released next week - The Bone Man of Kokoda , by the Australian journalist Charles Happell - he did not stop to think about them once in the 2 decades he subsequently devoted to digging up and repatriating the remains of almost 350 Japanese soldiers .
" Why waste thoughts on something like that ? " he told the Herald from his home north of Tokyo .
" I do n't know if they 're even alive any more .
They did n't approve of what I was doing , and nor did the rest of Japan .
But I gave a pledge .
How could I sit here in Tokyo while my comrades were lying forgotten beneath the dirt , so far away from the families that grieved for them every day ? "
So 37 years after the troops in his battalion became the first members of the Japanese army to reach New Guinea , the 60 - year - old retired mechanical engineer made his way back .
This time he was armed with a landmine detector , a mattock and a shovel .
His solo quest consumed almost a third of his life - but he says he would still be digging if he had the strength .
With his savings he bought a hectare of land at Kakandetta , between Giruwa on the coast and Kokoda inland , built himself a two - storey house out of local hardwoods , and planted a vegetable plot beside it to supplement his simple diet .
Then he set to work .
" I felt like this was my life mission , " explained the proud nationalist , who says his family crest links him directly to Japan 's imperial family and the Shinto gods who fashioned Japan from the elements .
The Australians and Americans had shown respect for their war dead , he said .
Their remains were carefully interred at cemeteries across the countryside .
The Japanese government , on the other hand , had " literally left thousands of Japanese soldiers to rot , as if they were an embarrassment that they preferred to forget about .
So I took it on as my own duty .
No one else would . "
Not least among his objectives was a yearning to recover the bodies of close friends from his own platoon , all 55 of whom were killed on the Kokoda Track .
Most of these soldiers , from Kochi or Ehime on the island of Shikoku , were killed by Australian machineguns in the Battle of Brigade Hill , on September 8 , 1942 .
Seventeen days later , the Japanese retreated .
It was a turning point in the Pacific War .
Despite being shot three times in the shoulder from almost point blank range during the battle , Nishimura survived - even chasing and killing his assailant , an Australian soldier who " looked to me just like a teenager " .
" Every day for many , many years I could hear the scream he made when I ran my sword through him .
It was a horrible thing , " he recalls .
On his return , he took his old diary and detailed notes he had smuggled out - against strict military orders - in the evacuation .
By using those to supplement his fading memory of the year he spent in tropical hell , he mapped out land he thought most likely to yield the remains of fallen comrades .
First he searched for deviations in the earth that looked like the imprints of old foxholes - small pits dug by soldiers to hide themselves in battle .
He would test the ground for mines , then use a stake to gauge how soft the soil was and therefore how likely it was to conceal decomposed human remains .
Finally , Happell writes in his account of Nishimura 's mission , he would go to work with his shovel and garden hoe removing sand and soil that had built up over 40 years .
" The bodies were rarely buried deeper than a metre .
Often , soldiers just dropped where they were shot ; occasionally they were spreadeagled on top of each other . "
At Giruwa beach he found 120 bodies and at Buna and Gona , two small coastal towns not far away , 60 skeletons .
At Waju he recovered a further 30 to 35 bodies .
After just a few years of digging , his house became an ossuary for the forgotten Japanese soldiers of New Guinea .
As his work took him further afield , Nishimura was saddened to discover that in several places opportunists had assembled Japanese skulls and war effects in morbid displays to attract passing tourists .
The Japanese government knew of this but had done nothing to stop it .
A Japanese professor of humanities , Utsumi Aiko , on a recent visit to the Indonesian island of Biak , was equally appalled to discover the amount of unclaimed Japanese remains being shown by small - time entrepreneurs .
Of the 2.4 million Japanese military dead , she wrote , " 1,160,000 of them are still not repatriated .
With close to half of the dead in overseas battle zones , we greeted the 50th , then the 60th year after the war .
" Even now some 600,000 , it is said , are retrievable .
Why in the world do n't we retrieve them ?
Why are n't the bereaved families urgently concerned about the bones of their relatives ? "
Nishimura was sure the families did care .
But he knew most felt helpless to do anything without government assistance .
That was where he planned to make a difference .
Occasionally dog tags , dental work and other unusual markers let him identify remains .
Bones he could not identify he hoped to one day submit for DNA analysis - a fledgling science in the middle years of his work .
On frequent trips back to Japan , Nishimura would spend days tracking down relatives of soldiers whose effects he had found .
" I can't describe the feeling I had at seeing tears of relief .
They were finally reunited with the sons who had never come home from war , " he said .
Among the haul was a lunch box he had inscribed for his training instructor , Lieutenant Yoshiyuki Morimoto , 40 years earlier , which he had dug up in an empty field .
As the maverick crusader 's reputation spread in Japan , he received more requests for help from families to recover their loved ones .
One man , Kokichi Morimoto , travelled to New Guinea to search for his lost father Toshio and , when excavating a vegetable field , uncovered the remains of more than 100 Japanese soldiers .
" The skeletons appearing from the soil just broke my heart , " Morimoto said afterwards .
" Just imagine how it must have been to be abandoned for so many years in the middle of nowhere so far away from home . "
It was not until 1988 that Nishimura finally returned to Efogi , the site of the Battle of Brigade Hill , where his battalion had been wiped out in some of the fiercest fighting of the Pacific War .
With the help of curious locals , he spent several days digging the sticky , red Kokoda Track battleground .
" Finally I struck black soil and then I found some charred bones nearby .
Then I realised what had happened ; the Australians had burnt hundreds of bodies to stop the unbearable stench , " he says .
" It was devastating .
This had been a special mission for me .
All I could do was to take some of the ash away in tins .
Now it is at the Gokoku Shrine at Kochi , so at least I know my old friends are resting safely back at their home with their families . "
In 1994 , Japan 's ambassador to Papua New Guinea , Tadashi Masui , told Nishimura that while his government appreciated his work , it wanted him to hand over his collection of bones as a symbolic gesture to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the war the next year .
Nishimura agreed , only because he felt the ambassador implicitly assured him Japan would make every effort to identify the remains , which amounted to more than 200 bodies .
Instead it cremated and interred them at Chidorigafuchi Cemetery in Tokyo .
" Throughout all these years , there were many setbacks , " Nishimura said .
" But the biggest obstacles were put in my way by Japan , which showed either neglect for the thousands of young men who died in its name , or deceit .
It brought tears to my eyes to think that my country could do this . "
Eventually , after he became ill and returned to Tokyo in late 2005 , the government cremated the rest of the skeletons he had retrieved and sent the ashes to Chidorigafuchi .
As Happell sees it , many Australians will still feel the Japanese were a " barbaric enemy , and they were .
They had an uncommon bloodlust and their treatment of POWs was appalling .
I 'm not trying to dress them up as anything else .
But , in Nishimura , they may possibly find a Japanese soldier to empathise with .
If nothing else , he certainly took the concept of ' mateship ' to another level . "
The Japanese lost about 13,000 soldiers on the Kokoda Track and the beaches to the north .
That was more than three times the number of casualties suffered by the Allies , who lost 3095 Australian and American soldiers between them .
But monuments to the Japanese dead are few and most are in disrepair .
So in 1989 , Nishimura erected his own at Efogi - to all soldiers killed at New Guinea .
The stone , in Japanese kanji characters inscribed by monks from Tokyo's Zenshoan Temple , reads : " To The Loyal War Dead . "
Strangely , it was this tribute that prompted the Kochi - New Guinea Association of war veterans to eject Nishimura from its ranks , for acting without authority .
As his lifelong friend and fellow New Guinea veteran Sadashige Imanishi said before his death last year : " We do n't tolerate unique people very well in Japan . "
Nor does Nishimura have much time for Japan : he feels the country that he loved has lost its soul , and is " a country in name only " .
Foreigners might see a nation with a profound sense of its own distinctive culture , he said , but that impression was " merely a facade " .
Young Japanese thought more about Western fashion , phones and iPods than their own history : " Soon I will be gone , and others like me too .
Who will be left to remember ? "
The Bone Man Of Kokoda , by Charles Happell ( Macmillan Australia , $ 32.95 ) is in bookstores from Tuesday .
One of my big fears while I was researching Bait and Switch was that I would never find a job .
The other , which I hesitate to admit , was that I would find a job and that I would be forced to work in some kind of soul - crushing physical environment -- a cubicle or a windowless office .
I ’ve been in offices -- insurance companies , title companies , or just to visit working friends -- and felt this terrible weight of blankness and despair .
Sure , I work in my own “ office , ” but it looks out on trees and my desk faces a poster - sized image of Eagle Nebula as seen through the Hubble telescope , which is space enough for me .
I felt my aversion was more than a little neurotic .
After all , people work in standard - issue offices every day , and very few of them take up automatic weapons against their colleagues .
A visitor to the forum on this website mentions the horror of his physical work environment , but only as seen through the eyes of his more free - ranging wife :
. . . my wife visited me at my work a few years ago , so I gave her a brief tour and then we went for lunch .
She was honestly horrified at the environment -- a maze of cubicles -- she is of course used to being in an open classroom -- she felt sorry for me .
She did not understand how I could ever put up with it .
( The cubicles were actually nicer than most of my career ) .
But a recent article in the new pop-science magazine , Seed , makes me think that our office environments may be more damaging than I suspected .
The article is about neurogenesis , the generation of new neurons within adult brains .
According to longstanding neuroscientific belief , this is impossible : Neurons cannot regenerate , and we are stuck with the number we were born with , minus those lost to alcohol or Alzheimer ’s .
Princeton psychologist Elizabeth Gould has shown otherwise : Neurons can regenerate .
The reason this had n’t been observed before is that the animals studied lived out their short lives in plain laboratory metal cages .
Gould studies little rat - sized monkeys called marmosets .
Put them in metal cages , kill them , and slice their brains for microscopy , and you find very little neurogenesis .
But if you let them live in an “ enriched enclosure ” -- the marmoset equivalent of Versailles , featuring “ branches , hidden food , and a rotation of toys ” -- neurogenesis kicks in , along with an increase in the number and strength of synaptic connections .
Another scientist , Fernando Nottebohm , working at my alma mater , Rockefeller University , has found a similar effect in birds .
Keep finches and canaries in metal cages and you get listless , tuneless , birds with equally dull brain tissue .
Only when studied in the wild do the birds sing and , not coincidentally , generate a profusion of new brain cells .
Stress also inhibits neurogenesis , and the Seed article emphasizes the possible implications for the effects of poverty on human brain structure .
Early trauma from , for example , separation from parents , could lead to lasting neurological deprivation .
But the article leaves hanging the social implications of the effects of “ boring ” environments .
Boredom may constitute a form of stress , but it is not the same thing .
In fact , the home environments of the poor are often overly “ enriched ” through sheer crowding , at least compared to the spotless , largely empty , motel - like , interiors of the upper middle class .
My guess is that boring , nature - free , environments take their toll on well - paid office - dwellers and minimum - wage factory workers alike .
Add stress to boredom -- the deadline is at midnight !
lay - offs are coming ! -- and you have a recipe for rapid brain shrinkage .
I think I can prove this too , if only a few office - workers will step forward and offer up their brains to science .
