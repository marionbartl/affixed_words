I ’ve been in the market for a new computer case for quite some time .
My little Antec Aria has served me well , but I ’ve been experiencing a growing need for something with more flexibility .
I ’ve actually been on the search for the right case for over a year now , but the need has n’t been pressing enough to rush me .
Thus , I ’ve been able to take my time and select one that fits all of my needs .
These needs are , in no particular order : mATX , full - size PSU , lots of ventilation , small footprint , many cooling options , easy to work in , super stylish , and reasonably priced .
When the NZXT Vulcan was offered up for review , after looking over specs and photos for a few days , I realized this may be just what I ’d been looking for .
First , let me say I ’m not a huge case guy , and when I ’m not actively looking to purchase one , I do n’t keep up with the latest styles and trends .
As such , when I am in the market for a new case , only the big names I recall seeing from my most recent case purchasing experience .
In this instance , NZXT was not one of the first names that came to mind , but after looking around on the internet a bit , I quickly came to realize NZXT actually has been around for a while , and with quite a bit of notoriety .
Packaging and Specifications
Packed only in the retail packaging and shipped to me , the case received no damage whatsoever due to a thorough , effective packaging job by NZXT .
Although it ’s a pretty standard case packing method , it ’s still appreciated quite a bit .
I ’d also like to thank FedEX for keeping the box reasonably undamaged on their end .
On first glance , there does n’t seem to be much going on with this case .
As I began to explore it a little more , I found more and more unexpected goodies .
First , here are the features of this case listed on NZXT ’s website .
Durable Non-slip finished top handle for portability
Black Interior
Dual 5.25 ″ slots and four 3.5 ″ slots ( internal and external )
Wire routing holes + extruded side panel provides extra space for cable management
Dual 8 W channel fan control
Fits at least 350 mm video cards like the ATI 5970
ATX PSU with removable filter + anti-vibration rubber support
Dual external watercooling cutouts
Dual top 120 mm exhaust for optimal cooling
Top mounted ( 2x ) USB , E SATA , External HD Audio + Mic
Fan LED on / off function :
Turn off lights during night time use
CPU heatsink cut - out + 170 mm heatsink support
Supports 200 mm fan intake on side mesh ( NZXT only guarantees fitment with NZXT ’s FN - 200 )
Extra large mesh holes for optimal airflow
Removable Hard drive cage
Included thumbscrews for all drives
The Vulcan ’s Exterior
Most “ mATX gaming cases ” on the market are so far beyond ugly it makes you wonder what kind of weirdos design them , as well as what kind of weirdos buy them .
Looking at pictures of this case both online and printed on the box when it arrived , I figured this case could be hit or miss .
What I found when I unwrapped the case was a thing of beauty .
Clean lines , a nice flat black finish , a mesh front , and a mesh window instead of some played out ugly plastic window .
Out back we see this case appears to be water cooling friendly , with two holes ready for water lines .
There are also thumb screws for both side panels .
The next thing I noticed is all of the panel buttons and plugs are located on the top of the case , both giving the front a cleaner look , and providing easier access for the user .
NZXT also included a fan controller with two fan speed dials .
Case handles are generally ugly , so I was planning on leaving the handle off .
After seeing the case both ways , I decided the handle actually completes the case ’s stylish look .
I ’m using mixed pictures so you can decide for yourself , some with the handle on , some with it off .
Under the handle , we find a space for 2×120 mm fans , or a 2×120 radiator ( externally ) for a water loop .
As we ’ll see in a bit , a radiator will not fit on the inside of the case in this location .
In addition for the water line holes in the back of this section , there is also an LED on / off switch .
Inside The Case
In addition to the upper drive cage , which holds 2×5.25 ″ drives and 2×3.5 ″ drives , the Vulcan has a second drive cage located behind the front 120 mm fan for two additional 3.5 ″ drives .
Since I ’m using two hard drives , this lower cage is where I ’ll be mounting them .
In addition to being a cooler location due to the fan , it ’ll allow for better cable management .
The lower cage is removable , but the 3.5 ″ part of the upper cage is not .
The reason I mention this is the upper one may prevent you from installing a full size graphics card like the HD 5870 , depending on the PCI - E slot placement on your motherboard , as we ’ll see in the installation section .
This case has room for a standard size PSU , and should even fit an extended length unit , definitely if you remove the lower drive cage .
The case has screw holes for mounting a power supply normally or upside down , so if you ’ve got a fan on your PSU you want blowing in a certain direction , you wo n’t have any issues here .
There are also anti-vibration rubber grommets .
NZXT made the back side of the Vulcan very user friendly , and included features for cable management as well as a cutout in the motherboard tray for accessing the back of the CPU area on an installed motherboard .
This is extremely useful for anyone using a heatsink that utilizes a back plate or thumb screws , especially if you frequently change your CPU or cooling .
As you can see above , the Vulcan comes with all of the front panel connectors running to their appropriate locations in nice bundles .
Let ’s take a look at those cables .
Bringing Everything Together
Since I do n’t do much PC gaming ( that ’s what my XBox is for ) the Clarkdale iGPU is enough for my needs once some decent clock speeds are applied .
What I actually use this computer for is media playback , photo editing , internet surfing , and [ email protected ]
That noted , the list of components I ’ll be installing is as follows :
Core i3 530
MSI H55M -ED55
CoolIT ECO A.L.C. CPU Cooler
2×2 GB Crucial Valueram
2×1 TB Samsung HDDs
Samsung SATA DVD RW
Sivlerstone 450 W fanless PSU ( on loan from MIAHALLEN .
Thanks ! )
Installation was a breeze .
The only hitch I ran into was mounting the radiator for the CoolIT ECO unit , but as we ’ll see below that problem was easily solved .
I started out using my trusty old Thermalright Ultra 120 original to cool the CPU .
I was more interested in seeing if it would fit in this mATX case but as I found out , there is more than enough room to accommodate an even taller heatsink if needed .
I also tried installing my HD5870 , but it did n’t fit in the upper PCI - E slot .
This is why I mentioned above that you may or may not be able to use a full size GPU depending on your motherboard layout .
If I install in the lower slot on this board , the graphics card nearly rests against the power supply .
NZXT ’s website does have pictures of a setup where even two of these larger cards will fit .
Since I made my own bolt through kit for mounting my Ultra 120 to an LGA1156 board using the LGA775 mounting bracket , the cutout for the CPU socket area behind the motherboard came in especially handy .
In proved to be extremely useful again when mounting up the CoolIT ECO unit , because I neither had to install the CPU cooler before mounting the motherboard , nor stick the back plate to the motherboard before installation .
And here ’s the final installation before switching CPU cooling methods a few hours later .
And the back will look the same regardless .
This is when I wish I had a black I/O shield and a black PSU .
A few hours after getting everything installed , I decided I wanted to switch over to the CoolIT ECO A.L.C. for cooling the CPU instead of the Thermalright Ultra 120 .
I do n’t remember why I did this , I think I needed the Ultra 120 for something else .
I can get better CPU temps from the CoolIT unit with less noise anyway , and it looks a little neater .
I first tried mounting the radiator to the unused 120 mm fan bay in the top of the case , but it would n’t fit .
Actually , any fans thicker than the stock ones that come with this case will not work either .
I started looking around the case for somewhere , anywhere to mount this , and realized there was a 120 mm fan in the front I could swap out .
I had to remove the drive cage ( just to get it mounted ) and mount the fan for it on the outside ( behind the front panel ) but after some jimmying around it finally went in .
I moved the old fan from the front to the top position so now there are two matching fans there .
Really , I ’d say everything came together perfectly .
My final result is nothing short of a miraculous improvement .
Final Thoughts and Conclusion
This is a fantastic case .
It ’s light , stylish , and fits all of my components very efficiently .
I have so many more good things to say about this case than bad .
This will most likely be the new case I hang on to for years and years , but this time because it ’s absolutely ideal for me , not because nothing better pops up on it ’s own .
Pros
Flat black finish , inside and out .
Tons of cooling options , and great case airflow .
Mesh side , no plastic window .
Included fan controller .
Full size PSU .
Lightweight .
WC friendly .
Back of motherboard CPU area is accessible .
Good cable management .
Cons
Larger graphics cards may or may not fit .
Thicker fans will not fit internally up top .
Scratches easily .
Mounting options for self - contained water cooling units are n’t immediately apparent .
I ’d like to thank NZXT and Overclockers.com for making this review possible .

A new report from the Frontier Centre for Public Policy compared ticket prices in E.U. and North America and found that protectionist policies on this side of the Atlantic lead to higher prices and fewer flights .
The study compared the cost of five domestic American , Canadian , and European flights and found that a traveler could :
Book all five U.S. flights , travel a total ( return ) distance of 3,334 miles and pay $ 934.72 , all taxes and fees included ( which constitute 14 per cent of the cost ) .
Book all five European flights , travel a total ( return ) distance of 3,358 miles and pay $ 525.72 , all taxes and fees included ( which constitute 52 per cent of the cost ) .
Similar results were found for cross - border flights :
Flights from five Canadian cities to five U.S. destinations with a total ( return ) distance of 6,004 miles cost $ 2,034.21 if the return trips originated in Canada and $ 1,971.99 if those same return flights originated in the United States .
However , five European cross - border flights ( Munich - Rome , Dublin - Berlin , Vienna - Athens , Prague - Barcelona and London - Paris ) would generate a total ( return ) distance of 6,212 miles and are significantly cheaper at $ 941.93 .
Moreover , the Europeans pay lower prices even though they have significantly higher taxes .
The trend toward cheaper E.U. flights started with glimmers of liberalization in 1987 .
The reforms continued in the '90s with the opening of domestic markets to both European and American carriers .
By 1997 , any airline operating in the E.U. gained the right to pick up and drop off passengers within another member country .
The EU department responsible for overseeing the open market in airline competition , the European Commission — Mobility and Transport notes that subsequent developments included a 120 per cent increase in intra-EU routes between 1992 ( before full liberalization ) and 2008 ; a 400 per cent increase in the number of routes with more than two competitors on it between 1992 and 2008 ; the emergence of low - cost carriers , which now constitute one - third of all intra-EU scheduled capacity ; and , not surprisingly , because of the above , lower fares . …
The European market contrasts sharply with the airline market in North America .
Presently , Air France can fly a passenger from Paris and drop her off in New York City or Los Angeles ( or any other U.S. destination to which the airline flies ) , but Air France cannot pick up a New York passenger and fly him to Los Angeles .
The same is true in Canada .

92 Prozent der befragten Führungsspitzen in Wirtschaft , Politik und Verwaltung erklärten in dem am Dienstag veröffentlichten „ Capital - Elite - Panel “ des Instituts für Demoskopie Allensbach , sie seien mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung unzufrieden .
Mehr als drei Viertel der Befragten halten die Koalition für zu schwach , um die anstehenden Probleme zu lösen .
Unter dem anhaltenden Streit in der Koalition hat auch das Image von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel gelitten .
Die Hälfte der Befragten hält sie mittlerweile für eine schwache Kanzlerin – das ist ein Anstieg von 25 Punkten gegenüber der Umfrage im Dezember 2009 .
Aufschwung erwartet
Für das halbjährlich veröffentlichte Panel hatten die Allensbacher Meinungsforscher vom 20 .
Mai bis zum 7 .
Juni 750 repräsentativ ausgewählte Führungskräfte befragt , darunter 138 Vorstände , 21 Ministerpräsidenten und Minister von Bund und Ländern sowie 32 Leiter von Bundes - und Landesbehörden .
Die Umfrage wird seit 1987 für die Zeitschrift „ Capital “ erhoben .
Das Urteil der Elite fällt umso verheerender aus , als sie mit einem anhaltenden Aufschwung rechnet .
So beurteilen 81 Prozent der befragten Wirtschaftsführer ihre Auftragslage als gut oder sehr gut .
Im Dezember waren es nur 61 Prozent .
Allensbach - Chefin Renate Köcher sagte , normalerweise liefen die Auftragsbeurteilung und die Bewertung der Wirtschaftspolitik im Gleichschritt .
Davon ist in der aktuellen Umfrage keine Spur : 69 Prozent sind mit der Wirtschaftspolitik unzufrieden , im Dezember gaben nur 37 Prozent der Befragten ein negatives Urteil ab .
Eighteen Republican members of the Colorado State Legislature Monday sent a letter ( pdf ) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) demanding the federal agency refrain from regulating the natural gas drilling practice of hydraulic fracturing , or “ fracking , ” no matter what a two - year EPA study of the process reveals .
Landowners and environmentalists around the country are increasingly concerned about instances in which they claim fracking has contaminated streams and drinking water sources .
Oil and gas industry officials mostly resist attempts to further regulate the process , which was granted an exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act during the Bush administration .
“ The EPA should n’t stick its nose into the regulation of fracking or other oil and gas industry practices in states , ” state Sen .
Scott Renfroe , R - Greeley , said in a release .
“ Once the EPA completes its study , states should maintain jurisdiction over oil and gas operations . ”
While the letter was addressed to the EPA , the matter is actually up to Congress , where U.S. Reps .
Diana DeGette , D - Denver , and Jared Polis , D - Boulder , introduced the FRAC ( Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals )
Act in 2009 .
The bill requires full public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracking process , which industry officials say amount to trade secrets .
Still , a growing number of companies are offering up some form of disclosure in order to head off looming federal regulation .
“ Oil and gas employers have already been barraged by new regulations in Colorado , making it harder for them to do business in the state , particularly during these tough economic times , ” Renfroe added , referring to amended drilling rules that went into effect last year and provide higher levels of public safety and environmental protection .
“ The last thing we need are further industry - crushing regulations out of Washington , D.C. , that will cause even more lost jobs in Colorado . ”
Proponents of those new regulations say the industry has actually gained greater regulatory certainty through the new drilling regs and that other states are all moving toward models similar to Colorado’s .
Republican state Rep. Randy Baumgardner , whose House District 57 includes heavily drilled Garfield County , also signed Monday ’s letter .
Recently by Gary North : Is Profit Un-Christian ?
When someone at last discovers that some conspiracy has taken over this or that institution , he gets into a mentality that sees conspiracies everywhere .
Anyone who finally accepts the fact that one or more conspiracies have been operating for one or more centuries to control the affairs of his nation , or even the whole world , has a tendency to see everything in terms of conspiracies .
He begins to attribute to this or that conspiracy the ability to forecast the future almost perfectly , to control the future almost perfectly , and to thwart all attempts of critics to deflect the conspiracy from its agenda .
Over 40 years ago , the man who would later be my father - in - law , R. J. Rushdoony , warned me about this attitude .
He called these people “ gravediggers . ”
This was before Phyllis Schlafly used the phrase .
He called them gravediggers because he equated them with people who are required by their executioners to dig their own graves before the executioners execute them .
This saves work for the executioners .
Rushdoony ’s point was that conservatives tend to dig their own graves , with the result that their enemies have much less trouble disposing of them .
I have found over the years that his assessment was accurate .
The gravedigger gives up hope .
He works diligently , but he has no future .
He is not going to be able to escape the plans of the executioners .
This is how thousands of conspiracy theorists view their own efforts .
They give up any thought of reforming the system that has been infiltrated .
They offer no plans to replace it .
They just wring their hands and cry , “ The Conspiracy !
The Conspiracy ! ”
I recall one man who spent his life clipping newspapers and photocopying items about how conspirators have done this or that .
I never heard him offer a solution .
I never heard him offer a theory of civil government or economics that would serve as an alternative .
Yet he spent 35 years in the presence of the libertarian activists and conservative leaders .
I never heard him quote an idea from Mises , Rothbard , Hayek , or anyone else .
He was completely devoid of ideas .
His entire life was spent with no theory of God , man , law , sanctions , and the future .
He had no theory of conspiracies and causation .
He only had clippings .
He was not alone .
Rushdoony also made the point that people who are looking for ways to avoid personal responsibility for working to change the infiltrated system have a tendency to blame the conspiracy for having infiltrated any organization that might plausibly produce significant social change .
In other words , they dismiss the activities of individuals who really are working diligently to transform the system .
They do so on the basis that these people are simply dupes of the conspirators .
( For an example , click here . )
In this sense , Rushdoony said , the conspiracy theorists attribute to the conspiracy what Christianity has historically attributed only to God .
They see the conspiracy as an almost sovereign , almost omniscient , almost omnipotent collective group that has the power to direct history as if the group were God .
He warned me that whenever I found myself surrounded by people who attribute most of what takes place in life to a single conspiracy , I would be wise to disassociate myself from that group .
He was convinced that it does no good to participate as a gravedigger .
The goal is to transform society , and the way to do this is through religious and intellectual evangelism .
He was also convinced that individuals should attempt to work out their salvation with fear and trembling , in the language of the Apostle Paul ( Philippians 2:12 ) .
He believed that word and deed evangelism is a system .
He was convinced that any form of evangelism , for whatever perspective , that does not include programs for transforming the world is simply spinning its wheels .
He called this pietism .
He also called it Neoplatonism .
He was convinced that both pietism and Neoplatonism were basic to 20th - century Christianity .
If he were alive today , he would say that both are basic to 21st - century Christianity .
I have adopted a slogan that I believe represents his view .
“ You ca n’t beat something with nothing . ”
This slogan emphasizes the fact that we need good ideas .
We also need plans to implement these ideas if we are to be taken seriously .
Anyone who has good ideas but has no good ideas about implementing his good ideas is wasting his time .
He is also wasting everybody else ’s time .
This does not mean that every plan is going to work .
Pareto ’s law being what it is , 80 % of the plans will not work .
The point is , however , that without the 80 % of the plans that fail , the 20 % of the plans that succeed would not succeed .
We have to be willing to face failures in many of the projects we attempt , in the hope and belief that in the long run , our efforts will not be in vain .
To think that our efforts will be in vain , no matter what we do , is what Rushdoony called gravedigging .
Rushdoony was a great believer in multiple conspiracies in history .
He believed that there has always been a confrontation between God and Satan , and this confrontation manifests itself in rival approaches for transforming the world .
He believed that the appropriate course of action is to proclaim the truth of whatever position you are attempting to defend , and to work diligently to implement the principles that you say you believe in .
You are to attempt to implement these principles in every area of life .
You should be forthright in your proclamation of your first principles , so that people will be able to understand what you ’re telling them to do when it comes to implementation .
In contrast , a conspiratorial group is not open with respect to its plan .
It is not open with respect to its first principles .
It works behind the scenes , constantly attempting to subvert the present social order , so that the conspiracy can more easily capture the institutions of power in society .
THE SECRET OF SUCCESSFUL CONSPIRACIES
Rushdoony was convinced that conspiracies can gain long - term power only when their principles are in conformity with the general beliefs of the general population .
He did not believe it is possible to control society from behind the scenes in terms of a set of presuppositions totally at odds with the beliefs of the general public .
Anyone who attempts to implement a worldview totally at odds with the first principles of the general population will find himself isolated .
He will find himself regarded as a crackpot .
Nobody will pay any attention to him .
It is only when an individual conspires with other individuals to take over the institutions of power in society by means of a secret plan to implement the fundamental principles of that society that you find successful conspiracies .
You do not see successful conspiracies that are totally in opposition to what most of the population wants .
So , he concluded , we see all kinds of special - interest groups jockeying for position to control Federal spending .
There are many conspiracies out there , he said , that would like to get in control of the Federal government .
The reason they want to get into control of the Federal government is because the Federal government has power and money to implement their plans for society .
The reason why the Federal government has so much money and power to implement these plans is because the general population a century ago surrendered such power to the Federal government , and did it on principle .
The reason why so many socialist plans get funded by the Federal government is because the public really does like socialism .
The public likes the idea of being able to take money from one group and transfer it to another group .
The voters think that they will be members of the group that receives the money , not members of the group that has it stolen from them .
They are fools , he said , but only in believing that they will not ultimately pay the price .
They are not fools in desiring to get the money , given the fact that they believe in the legitimacy of coercive wealth distribution by state power .
If you believe in the coercive power of the state , you ’re a fool if you do n’t attempt to get in control of it .
I learned very early that the conservative movement is mostly about getting in control of state power .
It has been a movement devoted to getting its hands into the public trough .
It wants its wars , not the liberals ’ wars .
The liberals say that they do n’t want war at all , but they always wind up supporting some Democrat President who takes us into an undeclared war .
The conservatives want the same right for Republican Presidents to take us into an undeclared war .
So , there is true bipartisanship .
Whenever a President takes us into an undeclared war , members of the other political party in Congress openly and vociferously support his action .
The result , Rushdoony said , has been that the United States has been involved in a constant series of wars that were unnecessary and liabilities .
I was fortunate in the fact that I first discovered about conspiracies from my study of America ’s entry into World War II .
I wrote a high school term paper in 1958 on how Roosevelt maneuvered the United States into the war by pressuring the Japanese government to attack us .
I have not changed my mind .
This alerted me to the fact that wars are major means of expanding the power of the Federal government .
I understood early that Presidents maneuver the country into war in order to expand their own power and the government ’s power over the general population .
Presidents find that the public does not oppose the entry into war , once we ’ve gone into war .
All resistance ceases .
The expansion of the government then can go on without resistance .
This is beneficial for the groups that are associated with weaponry .
It is also beneficial to all the groups associated with the banking system , which funds the expansion of the arms industry .
In graduate school in 1965 , this suggestion was considered a form of lunacy .
Later , this began to change when Johnson pushed deeper into Vietnam , and the Gulf of Tonkin attack turned out to be a myth .
In graduate school , Franklin Delano Roosevelt was untouchable .
He was retroactively the great saint of the 20th century .
Any suggestion that Franklin Roosevelt deliberately lured the country into war was considered conspiratorial crackpotism .
I was one of the crackpots , so I generally kept my mouth shut on this issue , except in an upper division course on revisionist histories of World War I and World War II — the only such class in the United States in 1962 .
This attitude has not changed today .
The difference is , today more historians are willing to admit that Roosevelt did maneuver the Japanese into war .
What we find , however , is that these historians say that Roosevelt ’s action was wise .
They applaud the fact that he used conspiratorial tactics to get the country into war .
Anyone who says it was wrong for Roosevelt to have done this is regarded as a crackpot , but at least these days you can say that Roosevelt did it .
You just are not supposed to say that was a bad thing that he did .
However , in the textbooks , the story that prevailed in 1942 in Washington DC still prevails .
Some conspiracy theories are accurate ( mine ) .
Not all conspiracy theories are accurate ( theirs . . . and maybe yours ) .
Most conspiracy theories are inaccurate .
The reason why I say this is that there are a lot of conspiracies that are in conflict with each other , and they ca n’t all be equally successful .
Some of them were , and others lost .
But anyone who says that special - interest groups do not connive behind the scenes in order to persuade the public to accept new laws that infringe on the finances and liberties of the public is naïve beyond belief .
Such conspiracies do exist , and they have been successful in history .
Nevertheless , Rushdoony ’s point is correct .
Conspiracies have not been successful in opposition to the general ethical principles that prevail in the voting population .
The conspirators use a kind of institutional jujitsu in order to gain what they want .
They are able to overthrow the general population only because the general population is already off balance because of its commitment to the same sorts of wealth distribution and power expansion that the conspirators are secretly pursuing .
CONSPIRATORS WITH CLAY FEET
This makes it difficult for those of us who do believe in conspiracies to avoid the constant pressure from newcomers that we should get involved in the pursuit of a dozen other conspiracies .
There is no agreement among the conspiracy theorists about which is the major conspiracy .
There are a lot of conspiracies .
They cooperate , as the Bilderbergers do , but they cooperate as alliances of criminal conspiracies cooperate .
They cooperate in the way that various gangs of the Mafia cooperate .
They cooperate at the expense of the general public , but they are always maneuvering for greater power and greater influence at the top .
So , when we go off to research our favorite conspiracy , we had better do so on the assumption that these people are richer than we are , more influential than we are , smarter than we are , but just as blind to the realities of the world as the rest of us .
The old line about every man putting on his pants one leg at a time is correct .
These people hit brick walls the same way we do .
They are thwarted by the same kinds of unpredictable change that we are .
Think about the World Wide Web .
The establishments of the world did not think in 1990 that anything like this would be possible .
The basic communications technology existed , but until Tim Berners - Lee developed a system for setting up addresses on the Internet , the World Wide Web did not exist .
The Web now is undermining establishments all over the world .
Yet there are people who are convinced that the Web is itself a conspiracy , and the conspirators are somehow using the Web to gain control over the population .
I realize that there are not many of these people , but I do get e-mails from time to time telling me that the Web is capable of being used effectively by the conspiracies against defenders of truth , justice , and the American way .
The conspirators are very rich , and they associate with other conspirators who are also very rich .
There are various levels of conspiracy , and there are lots of conspiracies out there trying to get their hands into the till .
We should not expect to see some centralized plan being implemented in front of our eyes , because there is no centralized plan , because the conspirators do n’t trust each other .
The various local gangs of the Mafia know that some other gang leader is always ready to send hit men out to kill them .
They cooperate , but they do n’t trust each other .
WHY EXPOSING CONSPIRACIES CHANGES NOTHING
Rushdoony ’s main point was this .
Any attempt to expose a conspiracy on the assumption that once there is a successful exposé , the American public will throw out the conspirators , is naïve .
Even if we were successful in exposing conspiracies in this way , the public would not change the system .
The best that we could hope for would be to get a new set of conspirators running the show .
The problem is not the conspiracies ; the problem is the corruption in the hearts of the people .
The fact that the voters would allow and even promote the creation of the modern welfare state is indicative of the fact that larceny is in their hearts .
It does no good to replace one conspiracy with another conspiracy if you leave the system intact that enables the conspiracies to gain power .
This goes back to the famous chapter 10 in F.
A. Hayek ’s book , The Road to Serfdom .
The chapter is titled , “ Why the Worst Get on Top . ”
Hayek argued that the modern socialist state , meaning the modern welfare state , encourages the worst people to get on top , because the worst people are the most successful in seeking and maintaining power .
Because central economic planning centralizes power , it grants to the state the right to confiscate the wealth of the public .
We should not expect kindly people to be successful in the pursuit of power within such a system .
We will find , and what we have found , is that the most ruthless people seek out the levers of power , precisely because the levers of power enable them to achieve their goal : control over other people .
THREE THINGS TO MONITOR
Rushdoony warned me about all of this in the mid-1960s .
Nothing that I have seen since then has indicated to me that anything fundamental in the United States has changed .
The same conspiratorial groups are still dominant in structuring the agenda that the politicians and intellectuals promote .
Nothing has changed in the hearts of the people , because they ’re still fanatically committed to gaining their benefits from the welfare state .
( You can read his chapter , “ The Conspiracy View of History , ” in his book , The Nature of the American System [ 1965 ] ) .
Rushdoony ’s position was that it is a moral obligation to preach and teach against the welfare state , because the welfare state is based on the principle of theft .
It is based on the principle of the right of one group legally to extract wealth from another group .
The moral foundation of the welfare state is corrupt .
This is why he was always opposed to the public school system .
He wrote one of the early books against public education : Intellectual Schizophrenia .
He wrote it in 1961 , and I read it in 1962 .
I was convinced .
He also came up with a slogan regarding people who were opposed to higher taxes .
“ They have tithed their children to the state , and then they expect us to take seriously their demand for lower taxes . ”
He knew this position was intellectually unsustainable .
He also knew there was no hope that the United States will ever reverse its course and go back to limited civil government for as long as the public school system is being funded by local governments .
He had no illusions about any reform of the public schools .
He understood that this would mean simply substituting one group of educational conspirators for another group .
This is why I have little confidence that the Tea Party movement will be a positive tool for reforming the Federal government .
When the Tea Party movement comes out foursquare against Social Security and Medicare , I will begin to take it seriously .
I do not expect this .
On the other hand , young people who have come into the movement , who are not committed to Social Security and Medicare , and who would jolly well like it if those two programs were abolished , are the political hope of the nation .
If these people become consistent in their opposition to welfare for the aged , we may convince them to become fanatical in their opposition to welfare for the young , namely , the public school system and tax supported education at the collegiate level .
When individuals are willing to give up their own share of the loot , or their own age group ’s share of the loot , then I will begin to take seriously the Tea Party movement .
LOCAL RESISTANCE
At the local level , there is reason for optimism .
At the local level , the conspiracies are not well developed .
The benefits for taking over local government are too limited .
The amount of loot available to redistribute is too limited .
So , at the local level , I think it is possible to begin to establish spearheads of political reform .
I think lots of voters will be willing to vote for politicians who say that there should be no increase in taxes .
I believe it is possible to restrict the expansion of the public school system if local school boards are adamant in not increasing the amount of money allocated to the schools .
In this sense , the schools can be starved to death , especially in a period of price inflation .
I believe that people are willing to vote today in favor of candidates who call for a freeze on taxes .
This is not the same as rolling back the welfare state , but it at least draws a line in the sand .
If it is successful , and if the Federal Reserve System inflates the money supply , rising prices , when coupled with a freeze on local spending , will shrink the state .
Anyway , it will shrink the county government .
One of the great failures of the conservative movement over the last 40 years has been its unwillingness to focus on local government .
The conservative movement has raised its money inside the Beltway .
The fund - raising letters have gone out to stop this or that boondoggle , this or that expansion of Federal power .
The money rolls in , but the Federal government does not change .
It is still huge .
It is still gobbling up tax money , and it is surely gobbling up borrowed money .
What the conservative movement should have done , beginning in the mid-1960s , was to focus on county government .
Here , it would have been possible to train people to get themselves elected , or get people they believed in elected .
It would have been possible for conservatives in 1,000 rural counties out of over 3,000 counties to develop institutional barriers against the extension of Federal money and Federal power .
But no conservative organization systematically pursued the idea of creating a true grassroots political movement .
( The Eagle Forum came close . )
Some of them talked a good line , but none of them followed through with money , time , and training materials .
The focus has always been on Washington , and especially the next presidential election .
Because so much money flows into Washington , and so much power flows out of Washington , the name of the conservative game has been to gain influence in Washington .
We have lost the game .
It is difficult to prove the conservative movement in any systematic way restricted the expansion of Federal power .
It is interesting that the deregulation of Federal agencies took place under the Carter Administration , not under the Reagan Administration .
That is rarely discussed in conservative circles .
RESISTANCE TO TAXES AND DEFICITS
There is no question that Ronald Reagan destroyed Republican resistance to the expansion of the Federal deficit .
He oversaw the complete destruction of effective resistance to the Federal debt .
As it turned out , Bill Clinton was more successful in balancing the budget than Reagan , Bush I , and especially Bush II .
If deficit spending is the great evil today , and if political resistance to deficit spending by the Tea Party movement is the heart , mind , and soul of the political transformation of America , then the great enemy of the Tea Party movement ought to be Ronald Reagan .
Yet Republicans and conservatives during the Reagan administration applauded his administration , and almost nobody systematically called attention to the fact that his deficits were undermining the future of the country .
The one person who really fought him on this was David Stockman , who was the director of the budget .
Reagan was disappointed with Stockman , and Stockman finally resigned .
Stockman was right , and Reagan was wrong .
Stockman was right , and Art Laffer was wrong .
Reagan never vetoed a spending bill for years .
He made no attempt to stop the expansion of Federal spending .
If Federal spending is the great problem today , then Ronald Reagan is the grandfather of it in the era after Franklin Roosevelt .
Roosevelt at least had a justification : World War II .
Reagan had no similar justification .
He just oversaw the destruction of the principle of the balanced budget .
All of this should be obvious .
All of this has been in front of us for almost 30 years , yet the conservative movement still venerates Reagan .
Reagan did do a good job in cutting top marginal tax rates .
I have to give him credit for that .
He also bankrupted the Soviet Union .
But his unwillingness to veto Congressional spending measures has led to the disaster that we are facing today .
It does no good to expose the conspirators .
Hardly anyone will believe you , and even if the person does believe you , there ’s not a thing you or he can do about it .
The public has finally figured out that the system at the top is structured against them , because they saw what happened to the banks in 2008 .
They saw the banks get the bailout money , not the man in the street .
This upsets them , because they wanted the bailout money .
They wanted their snouts in the trough .
They deeply resent the fact that the bankers got their snouts in the trough first and deeper .
They have only come to this conclusion recently .
The far Left and the far Right have known about it since 1913 .
But who took them seriously ?
I enjoy reading books about conspiracies .
I especially enjoy reading heavily footnoted , carefully documented books about conspiracies .
I enjoy books that do three things .
First , they follow the money .
Second , they follow the confession of faith .
Third , they follow the media .
If you show me what leaders believed , how they financed their beliefs , and how they got out their message to the general public , you have shown me what I really need to know about the history of any organization , any society , and any government .
I do n’t care whether you ’re talking about conspiracies or the good old boys who were aboveboard about everything .
You have to show me what they believed , how they financed what they believed , and how they got their message out to the voters .
Almost no book does this .
You can look at the anti-conspiracy books , and they may follow the money , but they do n’t usually concentrate on what the fundamental ideas were all about .
And they almost never talk about media , except after 1930 .
So , I am a conspiracy theorist .
I believe there are lots of conspiracies , and most of them fail .
The biggest and most powerful of the conspiracies are those that have been closest to the dark side of the general population .
Conspirators appeal publicly to the good side of people , but they implement their programs by means of the dark side .
They say that they want to help the poor , but they will help themselves .
The voters say they want to help the poor , when in fact they help themselves .
If you want to talk about money that is not really helping the poor , take a look at college scholarship programs .
The poor do n’t make much use of those scholarships and loans , but middle - class Americans surely do .
Higher education absorbs close to a half a trillion dollars a year in the United States , and most of this is government money .
If you think most of that money is going to people whose families make under $ 20,000 a year , you have not been on campus recently .
The problem is not the conspiracies .
The problem is the widespread acceptance by the voting populations around the world that it is legitimate for the government to send out tax collectors and extract wealth from certain groups of society in order to fund the favored boondoggles of some other group in society .
The moment people think that they can make a living by voting instead of making a living by producing , they turn the government and the social order over to one or another conspiracy .
If there were no power and no money from organizing to capture the government , conspiracies would have to raise their own funds .
They would have to get their projects implemented by persuasion rather than power .
They would just be another special interest group .
Secret or not , they could not get into our wallets unless we allowed them to .
It is the essence of the conspiracy to persuade the public that the right and moral thing to do is to allow the state to help some group .
As soon as the conspiracy persuades the public of this , the game switches from persuasion to power .
It switches from donations to taxation .
It switches from liberty to tyranny .
What I ’m waiting for is a march on Washington with young people caring signs that say “ I ’ll give up college if you ’ll give up Medicare . ”
I want to see old people carrying a sign saying “ I ’ll give up Medicare if you ’ll give up college . ”
That would be a real threat to the conspirators .
I cannot imagine anything that would be a greater threat to the conspirators .
Take away their control over the education system , and the game is just about over .
To get rid of that control over education , Social Security and Medicare recipients will have to accept a quid pro quo .
They ’re going to have to get off the dole .
They are not willing to get off the dole .
So , the conspirators will continue to exercise power , the bankers will continue to get bailed out , and the deficit will continue to grow .
REPLACEMENT , NOT CAPTURE
Then what is the hope ?
The hope is for people of principle to educate their own children and other children who may want to come along for the ride .
Educate them in the principles of persuasion rather than power .
Parents are going to have to fund their own children ’s educations , and to keep those children away from the public school textbooks .
They are going to have to develop new curriculum materials .
They are going to have to teach , or find reliable people on the Web to teach , in order to help their children avoid the indoctrination by all tax - funded education .
That is the minimum place that we have to begin .
Anything beyond this is gravy .
Show me a person who has a plan to reform the public education system , other than by de-funding the public education system , and I ’ll show you a problem , not a solution .
Our goal should not be to capture the public schools .
Our goal should be to de-fund the public schools .
This is our principle of action : replacement , not capture .
We should not attempt to take over the existing systems of power and influence ; we should attempt to create alternatives that are more reliable , more efficient , and more beneficial to the general public .
We ca n’t beat something with nothing .
We also ca n’t beat the system by capturing the system and maintaining the system .
We are not smart enough to do this , and in any case , we are not ruthless enough to do it .
What I have outlined here I was taught almost 50 years ago .
Rushdoony understood this .
Leonard E. Reed understood it , and so did the editor of The Freeman , Paul Poirot .
These men persuaded me that the quest for power in today ’s society is the devil ’s own quest .
This is why I do n’t have much faith in the Tea Party movement .
I do have a sense of optimism about the younger members of the movement , who follow Ron Paul rather than Sarah Palin .
Paul understands these principles .
He is the only politician in my generation at the national level who has understood this position .
This is why he is now known to millions of people , and no other congressman is .
( Pelosi is , of course . )
He stood alone when it paid nothing to stand alone , and he is now the representative of a movement that could turn into an effective political force at the local level .
He exercises this influence precisely because he has not sought to extend power to the Federal government .
He has not been involved in a quest for power ; he has been in a quest for the decentralization of power , and the de-funding of power .
We ca n’t beat something with nothing .
We can create problems for the government .
We can scare Congressman into not voting for another round of stimulus deficits .
But we can not roll back the existing spending .
We can not roll back the Federal debt .
We cannot do this , because the public does not want it done .
We can , however , prepare for the day when the capital markets will not pony up any more money to the United States Treasury to fund the boondoggles , especially the boondoggles of Social Security and Medicare .
When the Soviet Union proved that communism could no longer maintain power , Western Marxists lost their faith .
They had been Marxists only because they believed in power , and they somehow believed that they , as intellectuals , would be powerful people in a Communist society .
They had not read carefully what Stalin did to intellectuals .
They had not read what the Pol Pot did to intellectuals in Cambodia .
He sent them to the farms or had them executed , if they had hands without calluses or if they wore glasses .
He knew an intellectual when he saw one .
They died .
I think the same is true of the welfare state in the West .
I think the only way that you ’re going to see intellectuals abandon faith in the welfare state is when it goes belly up , and they are 70 years old , and the checks do n’t come .
Then they will finally figure out that the system was not a good thing .
But , for as long as the welfare state continues to exercise power and can continue to send out checks , intellectuals are going to be as committed to the welfare state as millions and millions of old people are committed to Social Security and Medicare .
You do n’t change the system from the inside .
You create an alternative system , and you wait for the existing system to go belly up .
That is how you change people ’s minds .
CONCLUSION
You ca n’t beat something with nothing .
This is why people do n’t really want to change it .
It costs too much money , too much commitment , and too much time .
That is why we face a crisis .
That is why the Tea Party movement is probably not going to succeed in anything except being a spoiler .
But , if individuals at the local level begin to organize , this may change .
When the checks stop coming from Washington , it is going to be politically acceptable to resist the extension of Federal power .
The main reason why local politicians are willing to accept the extension of Federal power is because they fear the withdrawal of Federal money .
When there is no more Federal money coming out of Washington , you will see organized resistance to the extension of Federal power .
That will be a great day .
Until then , we ’ve got to spend time , money , and trouble to develop systematically anti-welfare state ideas .
We also have to develop institutions that are based on persuasion rather than power .
If we are not willing to do this , it will do no good to go to Washington and carry a sign , like the one that was seen recently at a Tea Party rally : Keep the Guvmint Out of My Medicare .
If it was a joke , it was a clever one .

Aspects of Kanban
Karl Scotland , https://availagility.co.uk
Introduction
The Kanban software development community can be traced back to Agile2007 in Washington DC .
At that conference a number of people were talking about their different approaches to development that they were using .
Chris Matts was talking about Real Options and Feature Injection , Arlo Belshee was talking about Naked Planning , and David Anderson was talking about Kanban .
All three had some similarities , which inspired a group of people to go away and experiment themselves and share their experiences .
The name which emerged as an identity for the group was " Kanban " .
Kanban is the Japanese word for visual card , and can have a number of interpretations with respect to software development .
Firstly , it could be used to refer to the index card commonly used by Agile teams .
Secondly , it could be used to refer to an Agile team 's task board , or story board .
Finally , it could be used to refer to the whole system within which an Agile team works .
In his book " Toyota Production System " [ 1 ] , Taiichi Ohno says , " The two pillars of the Toyota production system are just - in - time and automation with a human touch , or autonomation .
The tool used to operate the system is kanban . "
With this perspective , a Kanban System for Software Development refers to the whole system , and not simply the tool or the board .
The community chose to name the systemic approach after the tool that inspired much of the thinking .
Viewing Kanban as a systemic approach leads to Systems Thinking .
John Seddon , in his Vanguard Method [ 2 ] , says that management thinking defines the system which defines performance .
In order to improve the system , we should first understand the purpose of the system , create measures which help to determine whether the system is meeting that purpose , and then put a method in place to enable the system to meet that purpose .
Kanban is a way of creating a method , and generating metrics , in order to improve capability to meet a purpose .
The remainder of this article discusses five aspects of a Kanban System ; workflow , visualisation , work in process , cadence and continuous improvement .
These aspects are not practices to be followed , but key areas to consider when thinking about the method used to change and improve an organisations delivery capability .
Workflow
Workflow is the understanding of how business or customer value travels through the Kanban System .
The Agile community recognised that software development is a knowledge creation activity which includes randomness and variation and the " Inspect and Adapt " mantra is the response which makes the impact visible such that the feedback can be used to learn and respond accordingly .
We can take this further by understanding the mathematics and science behind the randomness and variation and exploiting this to our advantage .
Recognising the workflow through an activity such as Value Stream Mapping can give us this additional transparency which we can use to influence our process .
Value Stream Mapping is so called because its focus is on understanding how units of value flow through a system .
For software development , this can be generalised into how units of value expand into smaller units of work , which then collapse back to deliver the original value .
For example , a specific Benefit to a customer may expand into a number of Features , which may expand into various User Stories , which may then each expand into Tasks .
The Tasks subsequently collapse back together to realise the User Stories , which realise the Features , which ultimately realise the Benefit .
Understanding the workflow thus consists of knowing what we consider to be of value and what expand and collapse points there are to deliver that value through the system .
Making the expand / collapse patterns explicit helps us to deliver the value more effectively across the whole value stream .
It could be argued that the value often goes through a typical " waterfall " workflow .
This usually has baggage associated with it , however , so instead we can generalise the following workflow :
Incubate > Illustrate > Instantiate > Demonstrate > Liquidate
Incubation is when something is still an idea .
It may grow and evolve on its own , but without significant investment .
Illustration is when the idea starts to take shape into something which can be described more concretely , typically with user stories and examples ( or tests ) .
Instantiation is when the idea is built and tested .
Demonstration is when it is completed and ready to be accepted by the business .
Liquidation is when the idea is released and realising its value .
Another way of thinking about discovering a workflow is to view it as process archaeology .
A process often has many layers , and by digging through those layers we can surface what is really going on .
This will typically involve talking to the team members about how they really work , and it will often result in something other than what was expected , as problems that were previously hidden are surfaced .
Common items to look for in a workflow include queues and batches , and failure demand .
Queues and batches are points in the workflow where the work is being processed .
Queues are where work is building up because there is not enough capacity to process it and batches are where work is being held to be handed over and processed in a large volume .
Failure demand is where is work the result of not doing some , or not doing something right .
Rather than optimising a value stream for failure demand , the failure demand itself should be avoided .
It is important to remember that workflow stages are not equivalent to people or roles , and that having transparency of stages in a workflow does not imply having silos or specialisation .
Instead , by focussing on letting the work flow across the stages , we can move towards a one piece flow , where a multi-skilled , cross functional team can work as a single cell to progress the value through the system .
A generalised - specialist approach means that team members can both focus on one particular stage , while still being involved across the whole process , in the same way the " Type C " development is described in the " New New Product Development Game " [ 3 ] .
Visualisation
Visualisation is the means by which we can understand the work and the workflow by using a kanban board to create a powerful visual management tool that shares a mental model which is visual , interactive and persistent .
In a recent TED Talk [ 4 ] , Tom Wujec explains how this works when he talks about three ways that the brain creates meaning .
Firstly , visualisation creates a mental model because of the way that different areas of the brain process different visual inputs such as shape , size , and location .
Secondly , interaction enriches the mental model further through engagement .
Finally , persistence allows the mental model to be part of an augmented memory which can evolve over time .
This leads to the idea of boundary objects .
Brian Marick wrote an introductory paper [ 5 ] in which he talks about communities and practice and interest .
A community of practice is formed around a work discipline , while a community of interest is formed around a common problem or concern .
Communities of interest are made up of members of different communities of practice .
A boundary object provides a means for communities of interest to communicate across their different practices .
Marick lists several properties of a boundary object which can be useful to bear in mind when building a kanban board ; it should be a common point of reference for the community of interest , represent different meaning to different members of the community and help translation between the meanings , support coordination and alignment of the work within the community , be a plastic working agreement which evolves as the community learns , and address different concerns of the community members simultaneously .
A kanban board can be considered to be a boundary object when it is a social artefact which is a focal point for a team .
By visualising a team 's work , it becomes a common point of reference .
The representation of the work , and its status , enables communication and coordination between all team members , as well as visualising the workflow and policies that are the team 's working agreements .
The kanban board should be able to evolve with workflow and policies over time .
Thus a kanban board represents the shared mental model which is created collectively and collaboratively , and helps clarify the meaning of what the board is representing .
Another relevant set of ideas to visual management are those raised by Dan Pink when he talks about the surprising science of motivation .
In his book " Drive " [ 6 ] , he says that rather than the carrot and stick approach of extrinsic motivation , a better approach is intrinsic motivation , which consists of three elements ; autonomy , mastery and purpose .
Autonomy , or the " desire to direct our own lives " , is achieved when team members can see what needs doing , understand the working agreements , and choose themselves what they should do .
Mastery or " the urge to get better and better at something that matters " is achieved through being able to interact with the kanban board to evolve and improve it .
Purpose , or " the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves " , is achieved when the persistence of the kanban board makes it clear what the value of the work is and why it is being done .
A kanban board is a visualisation multiple pieces of data .
In his classic book " The Visual Display of Quantitative Information " [ 7 ] , Edward Tufte introduces a set of principles for the effective display of data and it is insightful to review some of these ideas .
Tufte talks about a number of different types of graphical designs .
Time series is probably the most common , where time is along the horizontal axis , and another data type along the vertical .
This is probably the least relevant design , because a kanban board is typically a snapshot of the current status .
Similarly , a space time narrative , which tells a story in a spatial dimension over time , may not be the most obvious choice .
It does raise the question of visualising the narrative of the work over time though , which could be interesting .
Maps also introduce some different ideas .
What would a kanban board look like it showed the terrain of a project , and where each piece of work was on that terrain ?
The most common form kanban board is probably a relational one , where the two axes show different types of information , such as scope and status .
Most of Tufte 's book is spent discussing ways of improving the way that data is presented ; specifically , maximising data ink , reducing chart junk , and improving data density .
Data ink is the ink that actually represents data .
While kanban boards generally use more than just ink , the principle holds true for making sure that as far as possible , anything on the board should hold information .
The corollary to this is that anything which is n't data ink is chart junk .
Grids , redundant data , or decorations and embellishments for aesthetics may create noise which masks the real story .
Finally , data density is the amount of data within the given space .
The eye can take in a high precision of detail , so by maximising the data ink and being clever with multi-functioning graphical elements , it is possible to visualise many dimensions in a small space .
A kanban board is what Tufte would call a multi-variant display , with the variants typically being the usual project management details , but also including the concerns of any member of a board 's community of interest .
As a starter , there are the popular " iron triangle " variants of scope , time , resource and quality .
Other common variants are things like priority , status , issues , risks , constraints , dependencies and assumptions .
More recently , teams have been talking in terms of variants such as capacity and demand , not to mention value and other economic aspects .
To visualise all these variants we can use a number of techniques .
Properties such as size , colour , format , location and alignment can all create multi-functioning graphical elements to achieve a high data density , while for a physical board , material and texture can add further depth .
The following examples are from a Visual Management workshop run by Xavier Quesada Allue [ 8 ] at Agile2009 .
They show different solutions to the same problem , using a variety of styles , techniques and materials .
Work In Process
Work in Process ( WIP ) , and the way it is limited , is the means by which we can create a pull system which balances capacity and demand through the value stream .
In a pull system , work is processed through being signalled , rather than being scheduled .
This is what avoids a build up of inventory , and enables work to flow through the system as capacity allows .
Satoshi Kuroiwa , a former Toyota manager , used the analogy of a chain of paperclips in a talk at Agile Japan in 2009 .
Pushing the paperclips will inevitably cause them to pile up , whereas pulling them will result in them moving smoothly .
Applying this to a software development workflow means that upstream work can be made available , but it is the team members ' responsibility to decide when they are able to take it .
The act of taking , or pulling , the work , is a signal for the more upstream work to be processed .
However , when work is available but not being pulled , then production upstream will gradually throttle down to avoid any pile - up .
With a push system on the other hand , work will be scheduled and handed downstream regardless of whether there is capacity to process it or not .
Work in Process ( WIP ) has an impact on productivity , inventory and teamwork , and by being aware of WIP , and reducing and limiting it , we can improve Kanban System .
Productivity can be measured in terms of cycle - time and throughput of valuable units of work .
Cycle time is the length of time to complete a process and throughput is the amount of output from a process in a given period of time .
Cycle time and throughput are both improved by decreasing WIP .
A simple example of this effect is CPU load , where application performance goes down as CPU load increases .
The effect can be explained by looking at Little 's Law for Queuing Theory :
Cycle Time = Number of Things in Process / Average Completion Rate
Little 's
Law tells us that to improve cycle time , there are two options ; reduce the number of things in process or improve the average completion rate .
Of the two , reducing the number of things in process is the easier , and once that is under control , then the more challenging changes to improve completion rate can be applied .
A further understanding can come from Traffic Flow Theory :
Flow = Speed * Density
Traffic jams occur as traffic density increases , and traffic speed decreases .
However , when traffic density decreases , speed only increases to a point ( which should be the speed limit ) .
As a result there is a point at which decreasing WIP below a certain density will reduce throughput .
Another factor in improving cycle time and throughput is that of multitasking .
Reducing multitasking is beneficial for two primary reasons .
Time is lost to context switching per task , so fewer tasks means less time lost .
Gerald Weinberg , in his book " Quality Software Management : Systems Thinking " [ 9 ] suggests that 20 % time is lost per additional task .
Thus 1 task can consume 100 % of time available , 2 tasks will consume 40 % of time available each with 20 % lost to context switching , 3 tasks will consume 20 % of time available each with 40 % lost to context switching etc .
Performing tasks sequentially yields results sooner .
As the diagram below shows , multi- tasking A , B and C ( on the top ) , delivers A much later , and even C slightly later , than sequentially ( on the bottom ) .
Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt introduced the idea of throughput accounting in his business novel The Goal [ 10 ]
Throughput accounting suggests that the business goal is to make a profit , and that this is determined by work in process , operating expense and throughput .
Profit is increased by decreasing work in process , decreasing operating expense and increasing throughput .
Any features we have developed , but not yet released , can be considered inventory .
Therefore , as well as helping to improve cycle time and increase throughput , limiting work in process also helps to increase profit by reducing inventory .
In his keynote at Agile2009 , Alistair Cockburn also introduced the idea that for software development , the unit of inventory is the unvalidated decision [ 11 ] .
By limiting WIP we are focussing on getting feedback on fewer decisions sooner .
Finally , by having fewer work items in process , then the team is able to focus more on the larger goals , and less on individual tasks , thus encouraging a swarming effect , and enhancing teamwork .
Limiting WIP like this can seem unusual for teams , and there is often a worry that team members will be idle because they having no work to do , but are unable to pull any new work .
The following guidelines , in priority order , can be useful to help in this situation .
Work directly on existing work to progress it Collaborate with team members on existing work to remove a bottleneck Begin working on new work if capacity is available Find some other useful work
When team members have to find some other useful work then " bubbles of slack " are formed around the work .
This creates opportunities for improvement without needing to schedule them with techniques such as Gold Cards .
This can be work which wo n't create any work downstream , but will improve future productivity and can be paused as soon as existing kanban slots become available .
Investigative work such as technology spikes , refactoring or tool automation , and personal development or innovation work , are all activities which might help the team in the future .
Cadence
Cadence is the mechanism that teams use to establish a reliable and dependable capability .
A consistent cadence demonstrates a predictable capacity and gives some confidence in coordinating the upcoming work when it is being triggered rather than scheduled .
Vanilla Agile time - boxing is one specialised form of cadence .
It is a metronomic cadence with a single tick .
All the main process events are based around this single tick which occurs on the time - box boundaries .
In addition , the unit of work , commonly User Stories , should be small enough to be scheduled into the time - box , and subsequently completed in the same time - box .
However , while User Stories in process can be limited within a time - box , they do n't always fit into one exactly .
Additionally , while releases can occur at the end of each time - box , User Stories are only potentially shippable product increments , but may not be coherent product increments .
The various events can be decoupled , however , such that they happen separately at different rhythms .
This creates a polyrhythmic cadence , more like a Drum Circle , where each drum represents a different event .
The rhythm is more complex than the single tick of a metronome , and can be more varied .
Units of work can be larger Minimal Marketable Features ( MMFs ) , which while needing to be as small as possible , are not constrained be being required to fit into a time - box .
Instead , an MMF is able to flow over a number of process events while it delivers a releasable coherent product increment .
Prioritising , planning , reviewing , retrospection and releasing all still happen regularly , but because they are de-coupled , they can happen independently , at differing rates , which may provide more freedom in creating a natural process .
A cadence is usually ' harmonic ' , in that there is a neat overlap between the different rhythms , and generally keeps a regular ' time signature ' to create consistency .
However , it does not have to be , and a look at some definitions of cadence from dictionary .com can show why .
In music , the ending of a phrase , perceived as a rhythmic or melodic articulation or a harmonic change or all of these ; in a larger sense , a cadence may be a demarcation of a half - phrase , of a section of music , or of an entire movement
Music .
A progression of chords moving to a harmonic close , point of rest , or sense of resolution .
The flow or rhythm of events , esp. the pattern in which something is experienced : the frenetic cadence of modern life .
Thus cadence is what gives a team a feeling of demarcation , progression , resolution or flow .
It is a pattern which allows the team to know what they are doing and when it will be done .
For very small or mature teams , this cadence could by complex , arrhythmic or syncopated .
However , it is enough to allow a team to make reliable commitments because recognising their cadence allows them to understand their capability or capacity .
The appropriate cadence for a team will be influenced by their transaction and coordination costs .
Transaction costs are those associated with performing an activity .
For example , the cost of making a release is a transaction cost .
Coordination costs are those associated with the logistics of an activity .
For example , the cost of getting people together to manage a release is a coordination cost .
Thinking in terms of transaction and coordination costs can provide the basis for establishing an appropriate cadence for the various events such as prioritisation , planning , reviewing , retrospection and releasing .
Focussing on reducing these costs can subsequently allow the cadence to change as delivery capability improves .
The end goal of reducing costs and improve cadence is to be able to quickly , reliably and frequently release valuable software .
In doing so , we can help to further reduce costs .
David Anderson uses the example of over - ground and under - ground trains .
Over - ground trains , which run less frequently , tend to require more planning by looking at a timetable and travelling to the station at the right time to avoid unnecessary waiting .
Under - ground trains , which run more frequently , tend to require less planning because it is safe to turn up and catch a train quickly .
Thus by releasing quickly , reliably and frequently , we can reduce the need for much of the planning overhead .
Once a cadence has been established , and a delivery capability understood through measuring cycle - time and throughput , then predictability can be achieved through setting Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) .
A SLA is not a promise , or a target , but a way of providing information about when deliverables can be expected .
It is a gentleman 's agreement , rather than a contract , that when a team accepts a piece of work , it should be delivered with a known time period .
By releasing frequently , to a known cadence , with an agreed SLA , a team can build trust that it is delivering to its full capacity
Continuous Improvement
Continuous Improvement is how a team constantly develops a Kanban System 's capability to meet its purpose .
A Kanban System should create an economy of flow , rather than an economy of scale , and the ultimate goal is to eliminate the Kanban System .
In their book " Learning to See " [ 12 ] , Mike Rother and John Shook use the phrase " Flow where you can , pull when you must " .
A Kanban System allows the work to be pulled , but in order to really achieve flow the team members should be always looking for ways to keep the work moving , rather than keeping themselves busy .
One approach to continuous improvement is to reduce WIP limits .
When a Kanban System appears to be working smoothly , lowering a WIP limit is analogous to lowering the waterline .
It will expose the rocks , and new bottlenecks and constraints will be discovered .
As a result teams can work to remove the new bottlenecks and constraints until work is flowing through the system smoothly again .
Another approach to continuous improvement is through retrospectives and other spontaneous change events ( sometimes known as kaizen ) .
When teams naturally refine and grow their capability , they often discover that they consistently have free space on their Kanban Board .
This is a sign that they can retrospectively lower their WIP limits as a result of an improvement .
These two approaches can be related to the states described by Mihalyi Czikszentmihalyi in his book " Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience " [ 13 ] .
Pre-emptively reducing a WIP limit is equivalent to moving a team through a state of anxiety , where the skills required are greater the current ability .
Retrospectively reducing a WIP limit is equivalent to moving a team through a state of boredom , where the ability becomes greater that the skills required .
Both paths are valid and can be used in context .
Implications
Viewing Kanban Systems from these aspects creates a meta - language to help describe and think about any process .
Kanban is not a methodology , but something which can be applied to an existing way of working to understand it from the perspectives of workflow , visualisation , work in process , cadence and continuous improvement .
As a simple example , it is possible to describe the typical Agile time - box in terms of limiting work in process .
Don Reinertsen gave me the analogy of a bucket of water as being a container for work in process .
If the bucket is being continuously filled with water , then there are two approaches to avoiding the bucket from overflowing .
The first is the equivalent of a time - box .
If we understand the rate at which the water fills the bucket , then we can set a cadence to empty it before it overflows .
The second is the equivalent of setting explicit WIP limits .
If we have mechanism to signal when the bucket is nearly full , then we use that to empty it before it overflows .
These aspects can be used as levers , adjustable in either way , to tune a process .
This is a different approach to describing a process in terms of practices which are more like knobs to be dialled up to ten ( or eleven ) .
The current configuration of the levers can be used to describe the current location of a team 's process on its journey of continuous improvement , a bit like a trail marker identifies a location on a forest path .
Having a wide range of configurations of processes , using these aspects of a Kanban System , means that we can employ different processes in different contexts .
We then work to improve those processes as we improve the underlying contexts .
Using a ski slope metaphor , we can begin with a " Nursery Slope " process for an immature team or organisation which requires lots of safeguards in place due to low skill level , and over time move the team towards an " Off Piste " process when the team or organisation are very mature and require much less safety due to their high skill level .
Being able to begin with a " Nursery Slope " process and move towards an " Off Piste " process creates an evolutionary style of introducing change .
This is on contrast to a revolutionary style of jumping straight into the implementation of a new process .
An evolutionary approach is appropriate for contexts where there is strong resistance , or where a revolutionary change will highlight more issues than it is possible to resolve effectively .
Large enterprises , with legacy technologies , complex architectures and political silos , may struggle to make the leap to a having multi-skilled , cross functional teams delivering production code every few weeks .
Whatever approach is taken , it should be remembered that method is only a means to achieving purpose , and measuring capability towards that purpose .
Rather than focusing on being Lean or Agile which may ( and should ) lead to being successful , we should focuses on becoming successful , which will probably involve being Lean or Agile .
The end goal is to be successful and a Kanban System is a means to that end , not an end in itself .
To finish with a quote from " The Toyota Way " [ 14 ] by Jeffery Liker , " kanban is something you strive to get rid of , not to be proud of " .

Add to that jitters over Europe 's debts , an edgy stock market and cautious consumer spending , and the result is an economy essentially moving sideways .
It 's no surprise that businesses are reviewing their orders and seeing no reason to add to payrolls .
Even among Americans with secure jobs , confidence is fading .
One gauge of consumer confidence fell in June to about 53 , down nearly 10 points in a single month .
And it 's well below the reading of 90 typically seen in a healthy economy .
The jobless rate did come down in June from 9.7 percent the month before .
But that was mainly because 652,000 people abandoned their job searches .
Unemployment is expected to stay above 9 percent through the midterm elections in November .
And the Fed predicts joblessness could still be as high as 7.5 percent two years from now .
Normal is considered closer to 6 percent , and economists say it will probably take until the middle of this decade to achieve that .
Benchmark interest rates , which at low levels can encourage borrowing to spur economic growth , are already near zero .
Republicans in Congress object to additional stimulus spending .
Nobody , from Obama to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to private economists , expects that anytime soon .
And the government has mostly exhausted its realistic options for nudging the economy along faster .
The 83,000 jobs added by the private sector was a better performance than in May , when private job creation nearly stalled .
But it fell far short of what the economy needs -- at least 200,000 jobs a month -- to bring down the unemployment rate .
Overall , the nation 's total payroll actually shrank last month by 125,000 , the first decline in six months , the Labor Department said Friday .
The loss reflected the end of 225,000 temporary jobs helping the U.S. Census Bureau complete its 10 - year head count .
" We 're not headed there fast enough for a lot of Americans , " the president said .
" We 're not headed there fast enough for me , either . "
The fate of the economy will hinge on whether it can stand on its own .
President Barack Obama acknowledged the slow pace of the recovery and used the new jobs figures to argue for more stimulus spending and extended unemployment benefits .
The private sector added just 83,000 jobs for the month .
Looked at from that angle or almost any other , from a teetering housing market to falling factory orders , the recovery is limping along as it enters the year 's second half .
And that is when the benefits of most of the government 's stimulus spending will begin to wear off .
The jobless rate fell to 9.5 percent in June , still far too high to signal a healthy economy .
It came in slightly lower than the month before only because more than a half - million people gave up looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed .
WASHINGTON — A second straight month of lackluster hiring by American businesses is sapping strength from the economic rebound .
Few big companies say they plan to step up hiring in the second half of the year .
Most auto , airline and railroad companies , for example , say they expect little or no job growth , blaming weak demand .
One that does plan to hire , Chrysler Group LLC , expects to add engineers and other workers as it updates its aging line of cars and trucks .
The company has announced 1,000 factory jobs in Detroit to meet demand for the new Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV .
But other companies , like American Airlines , have no plans to significantly boost hiring this year .
And major railroads , which have furloughed thousands since the recession , say they have no plans to add employees in the coming months .
In June , manufacturers , the leisure and hospitality industries , temporary staffing agencies , and education and health services providers all added jobs .
Retailers , construction firms and financial service providers cut payrolls .
So did state and local governments , which are wrestling with budget shortfalls .
On Wall Street , stocks sagged yet again on the news .
The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 46 points , its seventh consecutive losing session .
The Dow lost more than 10 percent of its value in the second quarter .
Trying to put a positive outlook on the report , Obama said it showed that " we are headed in the right direction . "
At the same time , he acknowledged there is a " great deal of work to do to repair the economy and get the American people back to work . "
His options are limited .
Senate Republicans concerned about record budget deficits this week blocked his efforts to extend unemployment benefits for millions of out - of - work Americans .
" The two things that are growing fastest in this Democrat economy are the size of the federal government and the crushing burden of the national debt , " said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , who led opposition to the extension .
All told , 14.6 million people were unemployed in June .
An additional 11.2 million have given up their job searches or are working part - time but would prefer full - time work .
That adds up to nearly 26 million Americans , and an " underemployment " rate of 16.5 percent .
Among the 225,000 census workers who lost their temporary jobs in June are people who had been unemployed before and now are again .
One of them is Michael Stein , who worked for the census in Phoenix on and off since April 2009 , after losing his job with an architectural firm .
It all ended for good two weeks ago .
Jobless again , Stein , 49 , at least feels better off with the census experience on his resume .
" I was told the State of Arizona is hiring again , " he said .
" Because of the people I met at the census , there 's a possibility if they could find the right position , they 'll put in a good word for me . "
Eric Model , co-owner of Seal & Co. , a shop in Summit , N.J. , that sells accessories and toys , said he has not replaced the two back - office workers he let go two years ago .
Not including a summer hire , Model has four employees , plus himself .
" It would be nice to get some support , " Model said .
" But I do n't want to go out on a limb and hire somebody , anticipating things will improve .
I would rather run with low expenses . "
Those Americans who still have jobs drew smaller paychecks last month .
Average hourly wages fell 2 cents to $ 22.53 .
Workers ' hours were cut , too .
Those factors could dampen consumer spending in the months ahead and further weaken the recovery .
It all threatens to perpetuate a vicious cycle for the economy .
" It is a Catch - 22 situation , " said Sung Won Sohn , professor at California State University , Channel Islands .
" Businesses are reluctant to hire for fear of a ' double - dip ' recession .
Without jobs , people are watchful of their spending , a danger to the recovery . "

WASHINGTON , Jul 6 , 2010 ( IPS ) – The follow - up investigation of a botched Special Operations Forces ( SOF ) raid in Gardez Feb. 12 that killed two government officials and three women , ordered by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal Apr. 5 , was ostensibly aimed at reconciling divergent Afghan and U.S. accounts of what happened during and after the raid .
ADVERTISEMENT
That implied that the U.S. investigators would finally do what they had failed to do in the original investigation – interview the eyewitnesses .
But three eyewitnesses who had claimed to see U.S. troops digging bullets out of the bodies of three women told IPS they were never contacted by U.S. investigators .
The failure to interview key eyewitnesses , along with the refusal to make public any of the investigation ’s findings , continued a pattern of behaviour by McChrystal ’s command of denying that the SOF unit had begun a cover -up of the killings immediately after the raid .
Both the original report of the U.S. investigation and initial NATO report on the Feb. 12 night raid in Gardez remain classified , according to Lt. Col .
Todd Breasseale , the officer who was spokesman for McChrystal on the issue before the general was relieved of his command Jun. 23 .
Casting further doubt on the integrity of the investigation , the officer who carried out the follow - up investigation was under McChrystal ’s direct command after completing the investigation .
As a member of the SOF community who had promoted night raids as a privileged tactic in his strategy in Afghanistan , McChrystal had an obvious personal and political interest in keeping evidence of an SOF cover - up of the killings out of any official U.S. report on the Gardez raid .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even while claiming that he could not reveal anything about the conclusions of the report , Breasseale told IPS , “ Based on the findings of this investigation , I can reaffirm what I wrote on 5 April – there is no evidence of a cover - up . ”
Breasseale had said in an e-mail to IPS before McChrystal was relieved of command that “ many ” survivors of the raid were interviewed , “ depending on whether they were available to speak to the investigating officer ” .
But the father and mother of an 18 - year - old girl who died from wounds inflicted by the raiders and the brother of the police officer and the prosecutor killed in the raid all said in interviews with IPS last week that they had never been contacted by U.S. investigators about what they had seen that night .
All three gave testimony to the Afghan investigators .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an interview with IPS , Mohammed Tahir , the father of Gulalai , the 18 - year old girl who was killed in the raid , said , “ I saw them taking out the bullets from bodies of my daughter and others . ”
Tahir said that he and as many as seven other eyewitnesses had told interior ministry investigators about the attempted cover - up they had seen .
But he insisted , “ We have never been interviewed by the U.S. military . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Mohammed Saber , the brother of the two men killed in the raid – Commander Dawood , the head of intelligence for a district in Paktia province , and Saranwal Zahir , a prosecutor – said he had not been interviewed by any U.S. investigator either .
Saber told IPS , “ The Americans were taking out the bullets from the bodies of the dead with knives and with other equipment that they always have . ”
Saber said the U.S. soldiers refused to let relatives of the victims go to help them as they lay bleeding to death .
Saber said he and other eyewitnesses were taken to a U.S. base and detained for three nights and four days .
Sabz Paree , the 18 - year - old woman ’s mother , also denied being interviewed by U.S. investigators .
“ I saw everything , ” she told IPS .
“ The Americans had knives and were taking out the bullets from her . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In response to a request for comment on the denials by the three family members that they or other eyewitnesses had been interviewed by the U.S. investigator , Breasseale wrote in an e-mail , “ All available family members who offered themselves up to take part in the investigator ’s questions when he was there were interviewed during his visit ( s ) . ”
Breasseale said the name of the Army colonel in charge of the investigation would not be made public for reasons of “ privacy ” .
He acknowledged in an e-mail before McChrystal was relieved of duty , however , that the officer was under McChrystal ’s “ operational control ” , although he was not at the time he was appointed and during the investigation .
The target of the raid was a young man who had been at the celebration at the compound but had not even been detained , according to Mohammed Saber , who was shown pictures of the target while being held in detention for four days .
The man turned himself in for questioning a few days later but was then released without charge , according to Saber .
The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , the combined U.S. - NATO command then headed by McChrystal , issued a statement within hours of the Feb. 12 raid declaring that the two men who died in the raid were “ insurgents ” who had fired on the raiding party , and that the troops had found the bodies of three women “ tied up , gagged and killed ” and hidden in a room .
ADVERTISEMENT
Military officials later suggested that the women – who among them had 16 children – had all been stabbed to death or had died by other means before the raid .
The officials told reporters the bodies had shown signs of puncture and slashing wounds from a knife Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a claim that appears to support the eyewitness accounts by family members of the use of knives by SOF members to dig bullets out of the dead bodies .
The New York Times quoted a family member , Abdul Ghafar , as recalling that he had seen bullet entry wounds on the bodies of the three dead women that appeared to have been scraped out to remove bullets .
“ The holes were bigger than they were supposed to be , ” Gafar was quoted as saying .
When Jerome Starkey of The Times of London reported Mar. 13 that more than a dozen people interviewed at or near the scene of the attack had said the three women were killed by the U.S. - NATO gunmen , McChrystal ’s spokesman , Rear Adm .
Gregory Smith , tried to challenge the accuracy of Starkey ’s reporting .
ADVERTISEMENT
On Apr. 4 , ISAF admitted for the first time that the woman had been killed as a result of the SOF raiders firing on the two men .
However , the ISAF statement suggested that the U.S. and Afghan investigators had conducted a “ thorough joint investigation ” and maintained that there was no evidence of a cover - up .
It explained the earlier statement about the women being found bound and gagged as the result of “ an initial report by the international members of the joint force who were not familiar with Islamic burial customs ” .
But the head of the Afghan Interior Ministry ’s Criminal Investigation Department , Mirza Mohammed Yarmand , publicly contradicted to the ISAF statement , telling the New York Times Apr. 4 that his investigators had gotten eyewitness accounts from survivors of tampering with the bodies of the dead .
Yarmand told the Times that his investigation had concluded that “ there was evidence of tampering in the corridor inside the compound by the members ” of the SOF raiding unit .
Within 24 hours of the publication of Yarmand ’s revelations , McChrystal ’s spokesman was telling reporters that McChrystal had ordered a new U.S. investigation , even as he was continuing to deny that there any evidence of SOF tampering with the evidence .

And the factories are important , for China and everyone else .
Someday China may matter internationally mainly for the nature of its political system or for its strategic ambitions .
Those are significant even now , of course , but China ’s success in manufacturing is what has determined its place in the world .
Most of what has been good about China over the past generation has come directly or indirectly from its factories .
The country has public money with which to build roads , houses , and schools — especially roads .
The vast population in the countryside has what their forebears acutely lacked , and peasants elsewhere today still do : a chance at paying jobs , which means a chance to escape rural poverty .
Americans complain about cheap junk pouring out of Chinese mills , but they rely on China for a lot that is not junk , and whose cheap price is important to American industrial and domestic life .
Modern consumer culture rests on the assumption that the nicest , most advanced goods — computers , audio systems , wall - sized TVs — will get cheaper year by year .
Moore ’s Law , which in one version says that the price of computing power will be cut in half every 18 months or so , is part of the reason , but China ’s factories are a big part too .
Much of what is threatening about today ’s China also comes from its factories .
Many people inside China , and nearly everyone outside , can avoid the direct effects of the country ’s political controls .
It is much harder to avoid its pollution .
The air in Chinese cities is worse than I expected , and because the pollution affects so many people in such a wide range of places , it is more damaging than London ’s , Manchester ’s , or Pittsburgh ’s in their worst , rapidly industrializing days .
The air pollution comes directly from the steel works , cement plants , and other heavy - industry facilities that are helping the country prosper , and indirectly from the electric power plants that keep everything running .
( Plus more and more cars , though China still has barely one - thirtieth as many per capita as the United States . )
The sheer speed and volume with which factories and power plants across China increase their output of soot and gases make the country ’s air - pollution problems the world ’s .
The heightened competition for oil , ore , and other commodities to feed the factories affects other nations , as do slapdash standards of food purity and safety , which may have led to tainted worldwide supplies of animal food .
The ultimate fear in the developed world , of course , is that as China creates millions of new factory jobs unknown millions will lose such jobs in America , Canada , Germany , even Japan .
But these factories are both surprising and important in a less obvious , though also fundamental , way .
Almost nothing about the way they work corresponds to the way they are discussed in the United States .
America ’s political debates about the “ China opportunity ” and , even more , the “ China threat ” seem distant , theoretical , and imprecise from the perspective of the factories where the outsourcing and exporting occur .
The industrialists from the United States , Europe , or Japan who are deciding how much of their production to move to China talk about the process in very different terms from those used in American political discussion .
One illustration :
The artificially low value of China ’s currency , relative to the dollar , comes near the top of American complaints about Chinese trade policy .
( The currency is the yuan renminbi— literally , “ people ’s money ” — or RMB ) .
This is more like the eighth or tenth issue that comes up when business officials discuss the factories they are opening in one country and closing in another .
And when it does come up , the context is usually whether the RMB ’s rise will force a company to put its next factory not in China ’s crowded coastal region but someplace with even lower costs , like the remote interior provinces , where salaries are lower and commercial space is cheaper — or perhaps Vietnam or Cambodia .
Fiji 's interim prime Minister Frank Bainimarama says he has the backing of a several Pacific Island leaders , despite a rift with Vanuatu over his leadership of the Melanesian Spearhead Group .
Commodore Bainimarama just hosted a two - day meeting to reassure his Pacific neighbours there will be elections in Fiji in 2014 .
Commodore Bainimarama says his " Engaging with the Pacific " meeting has been a success , despite only three prime ministers from the region attending .
He says it was all about telling the world he is reforming Fiji 's electoral system .
" Nothing is going to change the way we do things in Fiji .
We have a roadmap to work towards elections in 2014 , " he said .
Papua New Guinea 's prime minister Sir Michael Somare says he thinks Commodore Bainimarama is doing a good job .
Sir Michael says it is not the Melanesian way to criticise Fiji like Australia has done .
" He 's running the country , the country is surviving .
He 's looking at the economic base , how can he sustain the development of Fiji .
The tourist industry is booming , " he said .
Solomon Islands prime minister Dr Derek Sekua has also given his support to Commodore Bainimarama .
The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration today released Actions Are Needed to Protect Taxpayers ’ Rights During the Lien Due Process ( 2010-30-072 ) :
The IRS is not always following statutory requirements regarding the timely notification of taxpayers when liens are filed and does not always follow its own regulations for notifying taxpayers ’ representatives of the filing of lien notices .
...
A Federal tax lien is created on balance - due cases in which the taxpayer has received a notice demanding payment and has neglected or refused to pay .
The IRS files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien ( lien notice ) to protect its claims against taxpayers who owe delinquent taxes .
These lien notices establish the IRS ’s priority among secured creditors for the taxpayers ’ property .
The IRS must notify the affected taxpayers in writing , at their last known address , within five business days of the lien filings .
However , as noted in previous TIGTA audits , the IRS has not always complied with this statutory requirement and it does not always follow its own internal guidelines for timely notifying taxpayer representatives of the filing of lien notices .
“ This is a serious matter , ” said J. Russell George , Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration .
“ Because of this problem , some taxpayers ’ rights to appeal the lien filings may have been jeopardized , and others may have had their rights violated when the IRS did not notify their representatives of the lien filings , ” he added .
No Double Down here , KFC Canada said Monday .
After months of maximum hype , the Colonel ’s chicken empire introduced its latest “ sandwich , ” the Double Down , which uses two slabs of fried chicken in place of the bun .
In between are bacon , cheese and sauce .
All for just 540 calories , 32 grams of fat and 1,380 milligrams of sodium .
But while the buildup to Monday ’s DD debut “ generated more buzz than any test market item in KFC history , ” according to the U.S. company , KFC Canada is n’t biting .
“ It is not going to be launched in Canada , ” said a spokesman here .
“ KFC Canada is a very separate company ” with the philosophy of “ let them test it first and see how it is doing . ”
For months , part of the speculation online and elsewhere was that the Double Down was a hoax .
Indeed , food industry consultant Darren Tristano was called on Monday to explain what KFC was thinking by creating a sandwich with practically a full day ’s dose of sodium in one serving .
“ They ’re targeting working - class consumers that have less discretionary income .
It ’s about quantity .
Whether we like it or not , this product will appeal to a signficant portion of the consumer base , ” he told salon.com .
“ It appears to be achieving the goal , which is to get people interested .
Freak shows are disgusting but everyone seems to want to go to them anyway .
I ’m probably going to try one . ”
Calling it a “ legendary sandwich , ” KFC vice president of marketing Javier Benito explained the advance publicity blitz by saying , “ We want fans to have time to arrange their scheduled in advance . ”
Monday ’s splash included a defensive note from KFC , which pointed out how wrong speculation was about its calorie whack .
At 540 per sandwich , DD is “ similar to many of the burgers available at fast food restaurants . ”
Plus , the grilled DD is a scant 460 calories .
Since the 240 - gram fried Double Down has only 30 more calories than the 176 - gram EC Chicken Breast and only 130 more milligrams of sodium , the sandwich is not something Canadians can just replicate for themselves with two KFC chicken breasts , a slice of Monterey Jack cheese and another of pepper jack cheese and two slabs of bacon soaked in the Colonel ’s sauce .
The KFC nutrition guide does n’t break down the Colonel ’s top - secret sauce , but does disclose that just 57 grams of its Caesar dressing packs 26 grams of fat and 540 milligrams of sodium by itself .
The grilled Double Down has fewer calories and fat than its fried cousin but more sodium , clocking in at 1,430 milligrams , putting it in the top - 10 saltiest items on the KFC menu , although not the in the same league as the mashed potatoes with gravy ( 2,260 ) and the chicken pot pie ( 1,760 ) .
KFC commands 90 per cent of the fast food fried chicken market in Canada , according to Priszm Income Fund , which holds 60 per cent interest in the company that owns and operated KFC .

So , I thought to make this a really good birthday , and one that I will look forward too , I would start a campaign to rally my friends , family and everyone else that I can to raise enough money to bring clean drinking water to 40 families in need .
Help me make an impact in someone 's life and give whatever you can .
Thank you !
If you can raise $ 20 , or $ 20,000 , the impact of changing even one life can make a world of difference .
100 % of what you raise will still be sent to help fund a water project in a developing nation .
Glurge :
One boy ’s befriending of an outcast new kid at school stops him from committing suicide .
LEGEND
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2000 ]
One day , when I was a freshman in high school , I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school .
His name was Kyle .
It looked like he was carrying all of his books .
I thought to myself , “ Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday ?
He must really be a nerd . ”
I had quite a weekend planned ( parties and a football game with my friend tomorrow afternoon ) , so I shrugged my shoulders and went on .
As I was walking , I saw a bunch of kids running toward him .
They ran at him , knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt .
His glasses went flying , and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him .
He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes .
My heart went out to him .
So , I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses , and I saw a tear in his eye .

So , I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses , and I saw a tear in his eye .
As I handed him his glasses , I said , “ Those guys are jerks .
They really should get lives . ”
He looked at me and said , “ Hey thanks ! ”
There was a big smile on his face .
It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude .
I helped him pick up his books , and asked him where he lived .
As it turned out , he lived near me , so I asked him why I had never seen him before .
He said he had gone to private school before now .
I would have never hung out with a private school kid before .
We talked all the way home , and I carried his books .
He turned out to be a pretty cool kid .
I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with me and my friends .
He said yes .
We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle , the more I liked him .
And my friends thought the same of him .
Monday morning came , and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again .
I stopped him and said , “ Damn boy , you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday ! ”
He just laughed and handed me half the books .
Over the next four years , Kyle and I became best friends .
When we were seniors , began to think about college .
Kyle decided on Georgetown , and I was going to Duke .
I knew that we would always be friends , that the smiles would never be a problem .
He was going to be a doctor , and I was going for business on a football scholarship .
Kyle was valedictorian of our class .
I teased him all the time about being a nerd .
He had to prepare a speech for graduation .
I was so glad it was n’t me having to get up there and speak .
Graduation day , I saw Kyle .
He looked great .
He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school .
He filled out and actually looked good in glasses .
He had more dates than me and all the girls loved him !
Boy , sometimes I was jealous .
Today was one of those days .
I could see that he was nervous about his speech .
So , I smacked him on the back and said , “ Hey , big guy , you ’ll be great ! ”
He looked at me with one of those looks ( the really grateful one ) and smiled .
“ Thanks , ” he said .
As he started his speech , he cleared his throat , and began .
“ Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years .
Your parents , your teachers , your siblings , maybe a coach … but mostly your friends .
I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them .
I am going to tell you a story . ”
I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met .
He had planned to kill himself over the weekend .
He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom would n’t have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home .
He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile .
“ Thankfully , I was saved .
My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable . ”
I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome , popular boy told us all about his weakest moment .
I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile .
Not until that moment did I realize its depth .
Never underestimate the power of your actions .
With one small gesture you can change a person ’s life .
For better or for worse .
God puts us all in each other ’s lives to impact one another in some way .
Look for God in others .
Origins :
This touching story about the nerdy kid who was saved from himself by the intervention of a kindly schoolmate began its Internet life in February 2000 .
It is a rewritten , first - person version of “ A Simple Gesture , ” an inspirational tale penned by John W. Schlatter and published in the 1993 bestseller Chicken Soup for the Soul .
In the original version , the two boys are called “ Mark ” and “ Bill , ” and the tale is related in the third person , not as something that happened to the author ( as the online variant presents it ) .
The key difference between the Schlatter story and what has been passed around on the Internet is the ending : Schlatter ’s “ Bill ” reveals to “ Mark ” that he ’d been planning to kill himself that day , but he does so in a private conversation .
There is no tearjerking valedictory speech , no community just alerted to a selfless life - changing act performed by someone in their presence , no shining - eyed parents just discovering what a marvel they have for a son .
Other differences include :
“ Bill ’s ” books are not knocked out of his arms by a gang of bullies ; he trips all on his own , with the story heavily implying no one other than “ Mark ” is around to see this .
“ Mark ” invites “ Bill ” in for a Coke , and they do spend the rest of the afternoon together , but not the rest of the weekend ( as in the Internet version ) , nor does “ Mark ” work “ Bill ” into his circle of friends .
The boys do n’t become best friends in this tale .
They have sporadic contact with one another throughout their school lives , but they are never more than distantly friendly .
The online version clearly exaggerates each of the story ’s main points : A boy who trips over his own feet becomes a lad beset by bullies ; a boy who helps pick up books then spends an afternoon with the one who tripped becomes someone who takes a less able youngster under his wing by tending to him all throughout a weekend and helping him make new friends by
offering up his own ; two lads who see a bit of eac other throughout their school lives are transformed into best friends ; and a private admission between just the two of them is turned into a public lauding at a well - attended event .
Whoever effected these changes must have thought they made for a better story in much the same way a fisherman looks to magnify his battle with Nature by claiming the fish was bigger , more feisty , and infinitely more crafty than any previously encountered .
The tale is best viewed as a parable meant to encourage acts of compassion by pointing out the consequences of actions and inactions through the power of example .
“ Had this boy not been moved to lend a hand , ” says the story , “ this other lad would have died . ”
In case the knowledge that one has performed a good deed would n’t be seen as reward enough all on its own , this particular Internet moral lesson concludes with the one boy ’s act becoming the subject of the other ’s valedictorian speech , thereby ensuring everyone ( classmates , teachers , parents , and the community at large ) are moved to praise him for it .
In this version of the tale , the warming knowledge that he ’d performed a good work ( even if he did n’t appreciate how key a role he ’d played in someone else ’s life at the time ) comes in a distant second to the public admiration rained down upon him .
Implicit in the revised form of the parable is the suggestion that you too could become a much - praised hometown hero , the object of adulation , if you were to engage in good works .

The PSNI is to suspend stop and search powers
The power of the PSNI to randomly stop and search have been halted following an announcement by the Home Office .
The decision follows a European court ruling that Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 which permitted random stop and search was illegal .
Last year , the PSNI tripled its use of the UK - wide legislation arguing it was necessary following an upsurge in dissident republican activity .
However , Sinn Fein has welcomed suspension of the powers .
Policing Board member Alex Maskey MLA said the use of Section 44 " caused clear concern amongst a wide range of sectors " .
He added that there was a perception in the nationalist community that the powers were being used disproportionately against it .
" Obviously , the PSNI have to work to ensure the safety of everyone within the community and to challenge any threat , regardless of where it comes from , " he said .
" In saying that , they must do so in a way that is transparent and gains the confidence of citizens . "
In 2008 / 9 , the police used the anti-terror legislation almost 10,000 times , compared to 3,234 incidents in 2007 / 8 , according to Policing Board figures .
A PSNI spokesperson said that stop and search " remains an essential tool in countering the terrorist threat " .
" We use stop and search powers differently in Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK both in terms of the proximity of the threat that we face and degree of targeted use that we make of them , " the spokesperson said .
" We will continue to utilise available legislation in protection of the public and will do so in cooperation and consultation with the community we serve . "
Ulster Unionist Policing Board member Basil McCrea MLA said police would now have to rely on other legislation which allows officers to search those they have a reasonable suspicion are involved in illegal activity .
He added that proving reasonable suspicion , which is sometimes based on intelligence , could be difficult .
" I am quite convinced that the PSNI will come back with alternative strategies that will protect all of the citizens of Northern Ireland from people that would do them harm , " Mr McCrea said .
Last week , the Home Office was told it could not appeal against the court 's decision , taken in January .
It followed a case brought by a journalist and an anti-war protestor who were stopped by officers near a London arms fair in 2003 .
The European Court of Human Rights said the pair 's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated .
The court also ruled that the UK 's stop - and - search powers were " not sufficiently circumscribed " and there were not " adequate legal safeguards against abuse " .
It concluded that " the risks of the discriminatory use of the powers " were " a very real consideration " .
I discovered groups have more rights than individuals from my experience in the public school system .
In junior high school , I was required to shower after gym class .
The shower was akin to a lawn sprinkler , a pole around 6 feet high which sprayed water in 360 degrees .
Prepubescent boys forced to shower together in a circle .
My personal modesty made showering after gym class a horrifying experience .
I had no desire to be seen or see my classmates naked .
When I and others challenged the need to shower , we were told it was a health issue and important for hygiene .
There was one kid that was n’t required to shower , because Islam forbids public nudity ; he was not forced to participate in this dehumanizing ritual .
My own individual beliefs were not held in the same regard as his religious beliefs .
Finding the showering akin to being forced to participate in a pedophile ’s daydream was simply irrelevant .
I found the public school ’s Christmas program personally offensive , because I felt it violated the separation of church and state .
I had developed a religious respect for the Constitution at an early age , and deemed the lack of cognitive dissonance from those at school to be hypocritical and disgusting .
My individual view that being forced to participate in the Christmas program was repugnant and immoral fell on deaf ears .
I was fully aware at this point that group rights were protected , so I asked my father , who is Jewish , to get me out of the Christmas program .
Unfortunately , the answer was a swift “ ‘ No , ” because my mother had raised me as a Christian Scientist .
My attempt to religion - shape - shift to a different protected group had failed .
My mother , being a Christian Scientist , did not have a problem with using religious exemptions ; she asked for and received a religious exemption for my vaccinations .
Looking back , I now see how unequal and unfair it was to parents concerned about the safety of vaccinations to have their individual beliefs ignored .
I discussed these issue with my wife , raised as a Jehovah Witness .
Jehovah Witnesses did n’t have to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or participate in holiday activities .
It seems Jehovah Witnesses are more likely to receive an exemption from a school than atheists .
Group belief systems garner more respect than the lack of beliefs .
With the recent healthcare law , I find myself wanting to religion - shape - shift to the Amish faith for the healthcare exemption .
I know that however humiliating and morally repugnant I find being forced to participate in the healthcare program is , my own individual beliefs are yet again moot .
My point here is not an anti-religion rant , it ’s a pro-individual rant .
Individual beliefs are only respected when those beliefs are part of a protected group .
Exceptions made for specific groups by their very nature mean there will be individuals that fall outside that group , therefore having fewer rights .
These laws and rules start with the good intention of not forcing someone to something they find morally repugnant .
When exemptions are only available to certain groups , there is the unintended consequence of evaluating these groups with rights superior to individual rights .

That 's the question Cliff Schuster asked himself before he parked at a Q75 stop in Queens .
The Q75 stop was one of 570 now out of service because of MTA service cuts , and was marked with a sign saying it was " no longer a bus stop . "
But that did n't stop a ticket agent from fining him $ 115 for parking there .
Schuster attempted to fight the ticket in court , telling the judge " I 'm not a scofflaw . "
The court offered to reduce the ticket to $ 99 , but Schuster refused to pay , and has 30 days to appeal the decision .
The judge also ordered the MTA to cover or take down the bus signs , but until that happens , there seems to be come confusion about parking rules .
The NYPD told the Wall Street Journal that as long as the stop is still standing , it is illegal to park in front of it .
However , they are instructing " traffic enforcement agents not to issue summonses to vehicles parked in bus stops where MTA signs indicate they are no longer being used as such . "
The city 's Finance Department said it would dismiss all tickets issued for parking at a discontinued stop , but the recipients must contest the ticket first .
Those stuck circling the block to find parking spaces are n't happy about the tickets .
Max Perlstein noticed some of his neighbors getting ticketed in front of discontinued stops in Borough Park , and called it " idiotic . "
" The sign says it is no longer a bus stop — how in the world can the city say it is a bus stop ? "
Councilman David Greenfield also received his fair share of complaints , and wrote the DOT and NYPD , " It 's bad enough that the MTA has given our community the short - shrift by taking away a vital bus route , but it adds insult to the injury that traffic enforcement agents are issuing tickets at those affected bus stops . "
Sorry , insult to injury is kind of the MTA's M.O .
Happy news for Canadian movie lovers .
Netflix has announced that it 's setting up a new Internet - only service for the Canadian market .
The innovation marks the company 's first experiment with solo streaming .
Here in the US the service 's selling point is DVDs by mail , of course , but lots of Netflix 's 13 million subscribers also watch movies via its website .
And it looks like this is just the beginning of the Netflix international empire , as the company 's co-founder Reed Hastings disclosed in 2009 .
" Looking at next year , " Hastings confided , " given our success to date on streaming with domestic consumers , with global studios and with global CE companies , we are planning our first international effort in the second half of 2010 , which would include streaming but not DVD .
Our basic approach is to start small , prove out our model and then expand into other countries one by one .
For competitive reasons , we wo n't be more specific at this time about which market is first in our expansion . "
Generosity
Unfortunately , one of Canada 's biggest ISPs is welcoming Netflix with some less welcome news for Canadian consumers : lower data caps .
In the case of two tiers , the total drop in allowed monthly data is 25 GB .
At present , Rogers Communications offers the following " generous " monthly data allowances for each of its tier plans :
Ultra Lite - 2GB
Lite - 15GB *
Express - 60 GB
Extreme - 80 GB **
Extreme Plus - 125GB
Ultimate - 175GB
But if consumers follow those asterisks to their reference sources , they 'll discover that some changes have been made as of Thursday .
* Note for Lite customers :
If you signed up for Lite before July 21st , 2010 , your usage allowance remains at 25 GB .
Additionally , if you are a Lite customer living in the Atlantic , your usage allowance remains at 25 GB .
** Note for Extreme customers :
If you signed up for Extreme before July 21st , 2010 , your usage allowance remains at 95 GB .
Additionally , if you are an Extreme customer living in the Atlantic , your usage allowance remains at 95GB .
In other words , the caps on two of Rogers ' key plans have been heavily shaved by 10GB and 15 GB respectively .
At present " Lite " costs CAN$ 35 a month ; " Extreme " costs CAN$ 59.99 a month .
No fair
" Will I be charged if I go beyond my monthly usage allowance ? " Rogers ' FAQ page rhetorically asks .
You betcha , the ISP responds , to the tune of 50 ¢ a GB for " Ultimate " customers down to CAN$ 5.00 a GB for " Ultra Lite " subscribers .
The maximum monthly extra payout is CAN$ 50 , but ironically , the " lighter " you go , the heavier your data allowance plan gets in terms of extra payout .
The FAQ page continues with an imaginary conversation between Rogers and a disgruntled subscriber .
" I do n't think it 's fair that I can be charged for usage when I get spam and pop -up windows , " the consumer protests .
" Although they 're inconvenient , spam and pop-ups accumulate very little usage , " Rogers replies .
" It would take several hundred thousand e-mails , for example , for you to reach your usage allowance .
But we understand your concern .
That 's why Rogers Yahoo !
Mail offers free spam protection .
To access Rogers Yahoo !
Mail ( your @rogers.com email address ) , go to www.rogers.com/begin and register today . "
This prose does n't calculate how many movie downloads or Netflix streams would gobble up the " Lite " plan limit of 15 GB a month .
But if you use Comcast 's measurements to explain its 250 GB / month limit , here 's what the US ISP says you can do with that sum .
Send 50 million e-mails ( at 0.05 KB / email )
Download 62,500 songs ( at 4MB/ song )
Download 125 standard - definition movies ( at 2GB / movie )
Upload 25,000 hi-resolution digital photos ( at 10 MB / photo )
Going by these metrics — 2GB a movie in particular — a Rogers subscriber will get about seven movie downloads per month on the ISP 's Light plan .
The Evdoinfo.com site calculates a one - hour high definition Netflix stream as snarfing up 1.67 GB in data .
So we 're talking about nine hours of Netflix movie watching per month for Lite users .
That assumes a consumer does n't do anything else with her account .
If she does ( and of course she will ) , she 's running into the Lite - $ 4.00 - per - GB overtime zone , and fast .
French over time
Rogers has a reputation for these sort of fun and games .
As we 've reported , back in 2008 it launched an " Unlimited On - Device Mobile Browsing Plan " that turned out to have a cap on text and picture / video messages .
There have been controversies over DNS redirects , injecting content into webpages , and the cost of Rogers ' iPhone 3G packages .
But this sudden lowering of the data allowances on two of its key broadband tiers raises the question of how viable the streaming movie business will be , not only in Canada , but anywhere this sort of pricing strategy becomes the norm .
Netflix says its new " Netflix Canadian service " will start with English movies , but the company " expects to add French language capability over time . "

Who is making this stuff up ?
How is it possible that the first black president of the United States , under pressure for alleged reverse discrimination against whites at the Justice Department , fires a black Agriculture Department official for telling a story of racial redemption ?
How is it possible that such a bright man as the president repeatedly reacts without the facts when it comes to a topic so explosive as race ?
Last summer he spoke out on a racial controversy without the facts and buried himself in political quicksand that ended with a staged “ beer summit . ”
Who is buying the beer this time ?
The questions keep coming .
How is it possible that the once glorious NAACP – the leading name in America ’s fight against racial segregation – has come to the point where it is pushing the first black president to fire anyone – but especially a black woman -- on a charge of racism without checking to be sure she was a hateful racist ?
And the NAACP had the full tape , the full facts before they went after her .
Who can believe that the White House and the NAACP would act on the basis of an Internet video maliciously edited to intentionally distort the woman ’s speech ?
And it is even more incredible that the woman is told that the White House feared Fox News host Glenn Beck might discuss the story and that they wanted her fired before his show went on the air .
Since when is Glenn Beck the czar of White House race relations ?
The answers to these questions say a lot about what happens when America mixes race , lies and videotape .
It all started when the 62 - year - old Shirley Sherrod , gave a heart wrenching speech of racial redemption .
She said while working 24 - years - ago for a rural farmers ’ cooperative a white farmer , Roger Spooner of Iron City , Ga. , asked her for help in avoiding bankruptcy .
But Sherrod felt Spooner was treating her like dirt , talking down to her in a slow cadence as if she were some uneducated black woman lucky to have a job .
Sherrod said she initially did n’t do all she could to help Spooner but when she discovered that white officials she referred him to failed to help him she had a revelation .
She said she realized race was not the issue and dedicated herself to helping poor people of any race .
The second part of the speech was cut out -- creating the appearance of black on white racism .
Sherrod ’s full story is not in doubt .
According to Eloise Spooner , the white farmer ’s wife , Sherrod helped her husband greatly .
“ We probably would n’t have [ our farm ] today if it had n’t been for her leading us in the right direction … she was good to us , I tell you , ” Mrs. Spooner told reporters who bothered to check before writing .
It is also important to know that Sherrod is a black southerner who has revealed that her father was killed by a white farmer .
Despite witnesses and evidence of the crime , she said a southern grand jury refused to indict anyone for murder .
The racial pain , the bitterness inflicted on Sherrod as a child might have created hateful feelings towards white people in her heart but the incredible , redemptive “ Amazing Grace , ” story is that she did not become a racist .
But then someone – still unknown – took Sherrod ’s touching speech and edited it to create the impression that she was a black racist .
The editor made it appear that Sherrod claimed to a black audience that she withheld help from a white man because he is white .
That twisted tape was placed for all to see on a right - wing website , BigGovernment.com , as a two and half minute video clip .
The idea that the black president had a black official who discriminated against white people fit with a recent burst of charges coming from some of the president ’s conservative critics .
In recent days the right has been charging the Obama Justice Department with reverse racial bias for not aggressively pursuing charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation .
Much of that weak charge was stoked by fears among conservatives that the Obama Justice Department might file charges against Bush Justice Department officials for improperly firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons .
( Yesterday the Obama Justice Department declined to press any charges . )
Meanwhile , in the dangerous racial game of tit - for - tat the lefty NAACP then embarrassed the righty Tea Party by demanding that the Party renounce any racist elements in its ranks .
That led some high ranking Obama administration official to a knee jerk response : fire Shirley Sherrod now !
Do it in the name of ‘ zero tolerance ’ for racial discrimination but without giving her a chance to speak .
And never mention that the real reason is creating political cover against any charges , no matter how baseless , that might come from the right - wing .
When the White House execution order of Sherrod reached the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the official there did not stop the bandwagon .
The department has its own history of racial discrimination in failing to help deserving black farmers .
They did not want to stir old ghosts .
Everyone – the White House , the Agriculture Department , the anonymous editor , the website – has political dirt and racial guilt all over their hands .
The little guy , Shirley Sherrod , was just “ collateral damage , ” in a political war .
The usual race - baiters , the Al Sharptons and David Dukes , must be smiling .
But somehow Shirley Sherrod got the true story out because tapes exist of the full speech .
Now the White House has apologized to Sherrod .
And now the Agriculture Department has now offered Sherrod a new position .
But what has been revealed , once again , is the pattern of race - baiting and racial lies that is used by left and right when they convince themselves they have larger , more righteous political goals to reach .

June 30 , 2010  --
It may look like any leafy New England campus , but inside one Massachusetts school for special needs children , the method of teaching at work is anything but ordinary .
The Boston - area 's Judge Rotenberg Center educates and treats enrollees ages 3 to adult , all of whom are struggling with severe emotional , behavior , and psychiatric problems , including autism - like disorders .
And for about half of the 250 students here , undesirable behavior means getting hooked up to a special machine and administered an electric shock .
The skin shock treatment , used only after both a court and the student 's parents have approved , has drawn criticism for years .
But after the release of a recent study by Mental Disability Rights International , Rotenberg has come under the scrutiny of no less than the United Nations , which is calling the school 's practices " torture . "
" To be frank , I was shocked when I was reading the report , " said Manfred Nowak , the UN's Special Rapporteur on Torture .
" What I did , on the 11th of May , was to send an urgent appeal to the U.S. government asking them to investigate . "
Click HERE for the Mental Disability Rights International ( MDRI ) appeal to the United Nations on electric shocks and long - term restraint at the Judge Rotenberg Center .
In a response to ABC News , the Judge Rotenberg Center wrote : " It is just as ridiculous to equate JRC 's aversive therapy ( which is court approved , on a case by case basis ) with torture as it is to call a surgeon 's knife cutting into flesh an 'assault with a dangerous weapon . '
If a two - second shock to the surface of an arm or leg can stop a behaviorally disabled child from blinding himself through eye - gouging , from pulling out all of his own teeth or from starving himself to death , no sensible person would refuse to use such a humane treatment .
The alternative is to be drugged into insensibility , restrained , secluded and warehoused in a state mental hospital -- in effect , a form of living torture . "
Click HERE for the full Judge Rotenberg Center reply to the MDRI report .
In a 2007 interview with ABC , Matthew Israel , the doctor who runs the Rotenberg Center and developed the shock treatment equipment , had his own take on the line between therapy and torture .
" The real torture , " Israel said , " is what these children are subjected to if they do n't have this program .
They 're drugged up to the gills with drugs that cause them to be so sedated that they essentially sleep all day . "
The patients wind up in state institutions or warehoused in jails , Israel said .
For about half of Rotenberg 's students , a mix of adults and children , shock treatment is a regular part of life , meant to help teach them to stop hurting themselves or others .
Their cases are extreme .
Many here can not speak .
And many are real dangers to themselves , such as the child who would bite and bloody himself from his knuckles all the way up his arm , so that it looked as if he had scales , his mother said .
Or another student who gouged out his own eye and blinded himself .
The shock treatment " has no detrimental effects whatsoever , " Israel said in the 2007 interview with ABC .
The treatment works by hooking the students up to electrodes worn on different parts of the body , which communicate with a small device carried around in a backpack or fanny pack .
When the student engages in forbidden behavior , a staff member administers a shock .
Some students wear the electrodes as much as 24 - hours a day , seven days a week .
And sometimes for years .
" The device is simply a device that administers a two - second shock to the surface of the skin that has absolutely no side effects and is extremely effective as a corrective procedure to encourage children not to show violent behavior , not to show self - abusive behavior , " Israel said .
The skin shock is not used until a court and the child 's parents have approved .
Shock Treatment : ' It Has to Hurt Enough '
The treatment is not painless , however .
" And if it did n't hurt it would n't be effective , " said Israel .
" It has to hurt enough so that the student wants to avoid showing that behavior again . "
The skin shock is not used until a court and the child 's parents have approved .
As a compliment to the punishment , Rotenberg houses a reward room , where students can buy prizes with points earned for good behavior .
" I 'm quite confident that the procedures here are all based firmly on the professional literature of behavioral psychology , " said Israel , whose theory of reward and punishment is based on work he did studying under the psychologist B.F. Skinner at Harvard .
The price tag per student at Rotenberg is $ 200,000 a year , and is financed by tax dollars .
Israel and his supporters say the school 's system of reward and punishment is both appropriate and effective .
When one student began his shock therapy , he repeatedly would hit himself over the head .
And he had nearly starved himself to death .
But thanks to the therapy , school officials and his parents believe , he has shown major improvements .
Another student , Mark Doherty started biting himself when he was seven or eight .
Psychiatric drugs had rendered him zombie - like , often comatose and drooling , according to his mother .
And years of other treatments were not effective .
Fifty schools rejected him before he started at Rotenberg .
The shock treatments he has received have made a difference , say his parents .
Mark , now 24 , still lives at the center .
But he is able join his family for picnics and at restaurants , a major success .
And for the first time after the treatment started working , the Dohertys say , they can hug their son .
" When he stopped biting himself , " said Linda Doherty , " when it went from 40 applications [ of the skin shock ] one week to 18 applications the next week , in my heart and soul I know it 's the right thing for my son . "
Mark 's father , Richard , added , " It 's definitely not the end of the rainbow , but it 's the best for our son right now . "
But Eric Rosenthal , an advocate for the disabled , disagrees .
He says there are a wide range of other treatments available .
" A person with a disability is vulnerable , " he said , and should be considered distinctly different from an adult who chooses to undergo the treatment .
" A child with a disability , who has to get this day in and day out ?
The courts have approved it , but did anyone ask the child if they want to be there ? " he said .
Rosenthal 's recent report on the center 's tactics is what spurred a United Nations official into action .
For years after ABC first reported on Rotenberg in 2007 , State Sen .
Brian Joyce tried repeatedly to shut down the school , without success .
" If this same treatment were allowed on terrorists in Guantanamo Bay , there would be worldwide outrage , '' he said .
Now , after Rosenthal released his organization 's report , the United Nations has become interested .
" I 've visited many countries where electric shocks are applied , unfortunately , " said Nowak , the U.N. specialist .
" Of course this is absolutely prohibited . "
Nowak said that when he finished reading Rosenthal 's report , he sent an urgent appeal to the U.S. government , urging an investigation into the school .
" This is torture , '' said Nowak .
" Of course here they might say , but this is for a good purpose because it is for medical treatment .
But even for a good purpose -- because the same is to get from a terrorist information about a future attack , is a good purpose .
To get from a criminal a confession is a good purpose .
To Rosenthal , there are two factors for the Obama administration to consider ; the United States ' international treaty obligations on torture , and President Obama 's own reputation .
" President Obama has staked his international reputation on ending torture and the world is now looking , '' said Rosenthal .
" Are we gonna live up to our obligations and is President Obama gonna live up to his promise to end torture by the United States government ? "
The issue is clear , says Nowak : " You can not balance this .
The prohibition of torture is absolute . "

Another BP safety valve blew last week , and this time Republicans fought among themselves over whether the resulting gusher should be shut down immediately or allowed to flow until the Grand Old Party is turned into a dead zone .
Yesterday , almost buried under the cover of Gen. McChrystal ’s defenestration , they announced they were going with the latter .
Ad Policy
We ’re referring , of course , to Rep . Joe Barton ’s gushing apology to BP CEO Tony Hayward for Obama victimizing the poor little oil giant by pressing it to create a $ 20 billion compensation fund for the real victims of BP ’s disaster .
This sort of Republican Crude — naked , knee - jerk support for corporate profits no matter what — has been poisoning democracy long before Joe Barton explicitly spelled it out .
And the party has always tried to soft - pedal it as the American way , with the aid , naturally , of the corporate media .
But what really sets this episode apart is that it ’s a relatively rare instance in which reason and unthinking emotion are on the same side .
In politics today , they ’re usually in conflict , with “ What ’s the Matter with Kansas ” liberals like me yelling “ Do n’t they seeee ?
They ’re only screwing themselves . ”
But this time the raw populist anger at BP ( and at anyone who ’d actually apologize to it ) is allied with the simple logic that says if you cheat , lie , and destroy , you must pay for it .
Bill O’Reilly is one of the few media figures on the right who knows enough to stick with that good ol ’ mob -inflected outrage even when it ’s shared by libs .
We need a Chicago - style shakedown , he told Michele Bachmann , who knee - jerked that Obama was “ extorting ” BP for the $ 20 bill .
“ Come on ! ” roared Bill .
“ I ’d go in there with a machine gun if I were president and say , hey , you put the money in here or you ’re not getting out of the room .
So , I mean , I ’m okay with it . ”
That is one confused congresswoman !
I ’m all for an escrow fund , but I ’m not .
Obama should pressure BP , but he should n’t .
Bachmann was trying her best to agree with O’Reilly — she assumes , after all , that he ’s with her in yet another us - against - them battle — but she ’s too ideologically brittle to even get his point .
Their confrontation exemplifies a growing split among conservatives .
Not just between fringers and establishment Repubs , but between those who believe extremist statements are the only way to demonstrate they are willing to “ walk the walk ” —
“ No - RINO - me ” types–and those who realize that that walk leads off a plank .
At heart , it ’s a psychological difference .
You can see it on Bachmann ’s face — she ’s sweating severe cognitive dissonance there , neither nimble enough nor knowledgeable enough to distinguish between a corporate - inspired faux populism and an authentic populist rage over the destruction of an invaluable national resource .
This is a disaster that happened on Obama ’s watch , and by God she wants to stick it to him — after all , last week began with people saying he was like a mayor who would get canned for failing to clean the streets after a snowstorm .
The only way to keep that narrative going after he extracted money from the corporation responsible for the disaster is to walk out as far as she can on the plank and scream–hopefully , loud enough that she wo n’t hear herself hit the water .
And there are a lot of Republicans screaming like that right now .
It ai n’t good for the Tea Party , for one thing , as Joshua Green wrote for The Atlantic earlier this month in “ How the Oil Spill is Killing the Tea Party . ”
Rahm Emanuel famously said that Barton committed no gaffe , he merely laid out the GOP philosophy .
And it ’s Barton ’s clear statement of that philosophy in the context of the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history that exposes so many inconvenient truths :
· Most important , that the whole Republican party has a sustainability problem .
The right wo n’t ever admit it , but the environmentalist argument against unregulated industry is now proven .
And with that proof comes a growing conviction that every part of the GOP agenda is as unsustainable as Drill , Baby , Baby : Deregulated capitalism causes devastating crashes , the endless wars ca n’t be won or maintained , the unregulated health insurance system is bankrupting us , and on and on .
Papering over financial , social , and environmental problems only lets them to grow into huge national existential threats .
· The Tea Party ’s populism is hollow .
Rand Paul , Bachmann , Beck , et al. have come out siding with a corporation that ’s executed an eco-attack on America — and a corporation , moreover , that ’s owned by the same furriners that the original Boston Tea Partiers revolted against .
· The old anti-government / smaller government line no longer works :
We need the government to do enormous things now more than ever , and the right has been the first to call Obama inept for not doing more .
( The left has been second . )
· The conveniently late Tea Party / GOP hysteria over the deficit makes no practical sense here .
Republicans are attacking Obama for getting money out of BP and not putting the nation further into deficit .
If the corporation did n’t set aside money to pay those they injured , where was it going to come from — the sale of magic beans ?
· For rightwing Christians ( many of them Tea Partiers ) who see the coming apocalypse in the oil spill — well , they are just deeply confused .
As Lisa Miller points out in Newsweek , this may be the first time they can’t link End Times to the sins of abortionists , homosexuals , and liberal behavior in general .
Logic and emotion dictate that they link the world ’s end to Republican - backed corporate greed — but of course , they ca n’t go there .
Hence , the screaming .
It ’s beginning to sound like lobsters in a pot .
Investing 101 : Start Small and Be Consistent
When the talk turns to investing , many people shut down .
“ I ca n’t invest , I do n’t have enough money , ” is a common refrain .
The good news is that you do n’t need a large chunk of capital to start investing .
Thanks to today ’s resources , it ’s possible to start investing when you have as little as $ 25 .
There are even brokerages that will let you invest what amounts to your pocket change .
For some , the idea that it ’s possible to invest with a small amount of money is n’t enough to get started .
Another regular excuse I hear about investing is this : “ Does investing such a small amount really matter ?
What difference will it make to invest a few dollars a day ? ”
Once you understand the power of compound interest , and what ’s available , you can start to understand that the important thing is getting started — and that consistency over time can lead to a substantial return .
How Much Could You Save Over Time By Investing Now ?
It ’s hard to imagine how a small amount can benefit you over time .
Calculate My Wealth created this infographic that describes what you can expect when you start investing your money early on , even if you do n’t have a lot to invest to start .
Infographic Courtesy of CalculateMyWealth.com
I like this example because it shows how a relatively small amount — $ 6 per day — can turn into turn into more than $ 3 million over the course of 45 years .
Even if you invest conservatively , you can end up with close to $ 1 million without every increase that $ 6 per day investment .
You do n’t even have to give up your daily coffee ( or other pleasure ) in order to make this work .
Instead , consider what you might be spending money on that you do n’t actually care about very much .
Cut that out of your budget and start investing .
The idea is to think about where you are spending your money , and how you use it today , and then devote at least the same amount of money toward your future .
Keep Investing and Increase the Amount You Contribute
Once you start investing , the key is to maintain consistency .
Make it a point to invest regularly .
Most online brokers let you set up an automatic investment plan that allows you to contribute twice a month or once each month .
Take advantage of these plans to help you set your investing on automatic , and earmark the money for investing so you do n’t wind up spending it on other things .
Make investing a priority to start .
After you are comfortable with the amount you are investing , and after your financial situation has improved , start increasing the amount that you set aside .
Make it a habit to boost your investing contribution when you get a raise , or when something else happens to improve your finances .
If you automatically default to boosting your investment amount in relation to a higher amount of money .
If you get a 3 % raise , increase your investing by 3 % .
If you get a windfall , make sure at least part of it is invested .
Consistency over time can change the numbers you see for your nest egg , and it can also change how long you have to keep investing to reach your goals .
Calculate My Wealth based their numbers on 45 years of investing .
If you increase your contributions over time , there is a good chance that you could hit your goal of $ 1 million or $ 2 million without taking nearly so long .

Ferrari was told three times that Fernando Alonso should have let Robert Kubica through during the British Grand Prix , according to the FIA race director Charlie Whiting .
Alonso was given a drive - through at Silverstone after overtaking Renault 's Kubica by going off track .
The penalty , which Ferrari felt was too harsh , ruined Alonso 's chances of a good result , the Spaniard finishing down in 14th position .
Although the penalty was given nine laps after Alonso passed Kubica , Whiting said Ferrari was advised to let Kubica through immediately , but that the team decided against it .
" We told Ferrari three times that in my opinion they should give the position back to Kubica , " Whiting was quoted as saying by Autosprint magazine .
" And we told them that immediately , right after the overtaking manoeuvre .
On the radio , I suggested to them that if they exchange position again , there would be no need for the stewards to intervene .
" But they did n't do that and on the third communication they said that Kubica was by then too far back to let him regain the position .
" It 's not true at all that the stewards took too long to decide .
For us the facts were clear immediately : Alonso had gained an advantage by cutting the track . "
Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali said the team did not ask Alonso to let Kubica through because it did not feel the Spaniard has gained an advantage .
" He tried to be aggressive to overtake , and we complained the drivers not to be aggressive and we complain about the lack of overtaking , and so at that stage , we felt as we normally do at that moment that we need to go on the radio with race control to check what is the position , " Domenicali said .
" And normally , we take the right time to discuss with race control to make the judgement , and the moment when race control give us the instruction to give back the position to Robert , it was clear that Robert had already lost a lot of time - effectively he had a problem and he came back .
That is the situation we analysed .
" You can have a situation where immediately there is a possibility to give back the position to a driver if you feel that there is really an advantage that you gain .
On our side we felt that was not the case otherwise we would have done it . "
Domenicali said that by the time the stewards told them Alonso should let Kubica by , the Pole was already too far behind .
Kubica retired from the race moments later with mechanical problems .
" As soon as we received the information that in the opinion of the stewards , Fernando should have given back the position to Robert , Robert was already very far behind and Robert was really slowing down because he had a problem . "
“ Satire on its own ca n’t get bad actors to act better , but it can attract attention and direct people to those actors and their actions , ” Leroy wrote in a message on Saturday , one of many e-mail correspondences Leroy has had with journalists .
“ A lot of people , especially early on , sent me angry messages thinking the account was legit .
I like to imagine that moment when they realized it was a joke , and they had to think about what the account actually was and why it existed . ”

Knowing who ’s who on Twitter has been a challenge since the beginning : the basketball great Shaquille O’Neal created his own Twitter feed , with the insistent handle The_Real_Shaq , after someone was pretending to be him .
The impersonations had become so problematic that Twitter created “ verified accounts ” last year assuring followers that the person controlling the account was the real deal .
BP_America is one of those verified Twitter accounts , and perhaps for that reason  that , and BPGlobalPR ’s over - the - top sense of humor  there should be little genuine confusion between the two among Twitter users .
Thus far , BP has not filed a complaint against BPGlobalPR .
A Twitter spokeswoman wrote via e-mail that the company favored an “ open exchange of information and ideas between individuals , organizations , corporations and government leaders , ” including parody , for which it suggests guidelines .
( These can seem a bit humorless , however , like including a note saying , “ This is a parody . ” )
“ If a brand or organization feels they are being impersonated or that a parody account does not fall within our guidelines , ” she wrote , “ we respond to impersonation requests within 24 hours . ”

While satire has always been with us , certainly longer than public relations executives have been , the Internet is democratizing the process , said Miriam Meckel , a professor of communications in Switzerland who is a fellow at the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society at Harvard studying the impact of Twitter and social media services on journalism .
“ What the Internet does is that it provides lots of ways for ordinary people to challenge big brands , ” Ms. Meckel said .
“ You can just put up a Twitter stream and talk about BP brand .
If you do it well and in a witty way , you can have 100,000 followers . ”

The photo above shows an outcrop with pegmatite found near Olary , South Australia .
Pegmatite is an igneous deposit that often contains quite large crystals .
The rock around the pegmatite is a mica - schist derived from ancient marine sediments deposited perhaps 1,700 million years ago .
Pegmatite forms as a result of the partial melting of continental crust during mountain belt collapse phases ; in this case probably at the end of the Olarian Orogeny .
Magma that formed during this episode migrated upward in fractures in metamorphic sediments , initially creating linear intrusions .
Then another phase of compression occurred ( most likely during the Delamerian Orogeny ) deforming the previously strained schists and the pegmatite linear intrusion .
The result of this complex history is shown here where the pegmatite rock had been twisted in an anticlockwise rotation .
Note that the rock hammer and backpack ( and my feet ) are used for scale .

LOOKING BACKWARD
Chapter 1
I first saw the light in the city of Boston in the year 1857 .
" What ! " you say , " eighteen fifty - seven ?
That is an odd slip .
He means nineteen fifty - seven , of course . "
I beg pardon , but there is no mistake .
It was about four in the afternoon of December the 26th , one day after Christmas , in the year 1857 , not 1957 , that I first breathed the east wind of Boston , which , I assure the reader , was at that remote period marked by the same penetrating quality characterizing it in the present year of grace , 2000 .
These statements seem so absurd on their face , especially when I add that I am a young man apparently of about thirty years of age , that no person can be blamed for refusing to read another word of what promises to be a mere imposition upon his credulity .
Nevertheless I earnestly assure the reader that no imposition is intended , and will undertake , if he shall follow me a few pages , to entirely convince him of this .
If I may , then , provisionally assume , with the pledge of justifying the assumption , that I know better than the reader when I was born , I will go on with my narrative .
As every schoolboy knows , in the latter part of the nineteenth century the civilization of to - day , or anything like it , did not exist , although the elements which were to develop it were already in ferment .
Nothing had , however , occurred to modify the immemorial division of society into the four classes , or nations , as they may be more fitly called , since the differences between them were far greater than those between any nations nowadays , of the rich and the poor , the educated and the ignorant .
I myself was rich and also educated , and possessed , therefore , all the elements of happiness enjoyed by the most fortunate in that age .
Living in luxury , and occupied only with the pursuit of the pleasures and refinements of life , I derived the means of my support from the labor of others , rendering no sort of service in return .
My parents and grand - parents had lived in the same way , and I expected that my descendants , if I had any , would enjoy a like easy existence .
But how could I live without service to the world ?
you ask .
Why should the world have supported in utter idleness one who was able to render service ?
The answer is that my great - grandfather had accumulated a sum of money on which his descendants had ever since lived .
The sum , you will naturally infer , must have been very large not to have been exhausted in supporting three generations in idleness .
This , however , was not the fact .
The sum had been originally by no means large .
It was , in fact , much larger now that three generations had been supported upon it in idleness , than it was at first .
This mystery of use without consumption , of warmth without combustion , seems like magic , but was merely an ingenious application of the art now happily lost but carried to great perfection by your ancestors , of shifting the burden of one 's support on the shoulders of others .
The man who had accomplished this , and it was the end all sought , was said to live on the income of his investments .
To explain at this point how the ancient methods of industry made this possible would delay us too much .
I shall only stop now to say that interest on investments was a species of tax in perpetuity upon the product of those engaged in industry which a person possessing or inheriting money was able to levy .
It must not be supposed that an arrangement which seems so unnatural and preposterous according to modern notions was never criticized by your ancestors .
It had been the effort of lawgivers and prophets from the earliest ages to abolish interest , or at least to limit it to the smallest possible rate .
All these efforts had , however , failed , as they necessarily must so long as the ancient social organizations prevailed .
At the time of which I write , the latter part of the nineteenth century , governments had generally given up trying to regulate the subject at all .
By way of attempting to give the reader some general impression of the way people lived together in those days , and especially of the relations of the rich and poor to one another , perhaps I cannot do better than to compare society as it then was to a prodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road .
The driver was hunger , and permitted no lagging , though the pace was necessarily very slow .
Despite the difficulty of drawing the coach at all along so hard a road , the top was covered with passengers who never got down , even at the steepest ascents .
These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable .
Well up out of the dust , their occupants could enjoy the scenery at their leisure , or critically discuss the merits of the straining team .
Naturally such places were in great demand and the competition for them was keen , every one seeking as the first end in life to secure a seat on the coach for himself and to leave it to his child after him .
By the rule of the coach a man could leave his seat to whom he wished , but on the other hand there were many accidents by which it might at any time be wholly lost .
For all that they were so easy , the seats were very insecure , and at every sudden jolt of the coach persons were slipping out of them and falling to the ground , where they were instantly compelled to take hold of the rope and help to drag the coach on which they had before ridden so pleasantly .
It was naturally regarded as a terrible misfortune to lose one 's seat , and the apprehension that this might happen to them or their friends was a constant cloud upon the happiness of those who rode .
But did they think only of themselves ?
you ask .
Was not their very luxury rendered intolerable to them by comparison with the lot of their brothers and sisters in the harness , and the knowledge that their own weight added to their toil ?
Had they no compassion for fellow beings from whom fortune only distinguished them ?
Oh , yes ; commiseration was frequently expressed by those who rode for those who had to pull the coach , especially when the vehicle came to a bad place in the road , as it was constantly doing , or to a particularly steep hill .
At such times , the desperate straining of the team , their agonized leaping and plunging under the pitiless lashing of hunger , the many who fainted at the rope and were trampled in the mire , made a very distressing spectacle , which often called forth highly creditable displays of feeling on the top of the coach .
At such times the passengers would call down encouragingly to the toilers of the rope , exhorting them to patience , and holding out hopes of possible compensation in another world for the hardness of their lot , while others contributed to buy salves and liniments for the crippled and injured .
It was agreed that it was a great pity that the coach should be so hard to pull , and there was a sense of general relief when the specially bad piece of road was gotten over .
This relief was not , indeed , wholly on account of the team , for there was always some danger at these bad places of a general overturn in which all would lose their seats .
It must in truth be admitted that the main effect of the spectacle of the misery of the toilers at the rope was to enhance the passengers ' sense of the value of their seats upon the coach , and to cause them to hold on to them more desperately than before .
If the passengers could only have felt assured that neither they nor their friends would ever fall from the top , it is probable that , beyond contributing to the funds for liniments and bandages , they would have troubled themselves extremely little about those who dragged the coach .
I am well aware that this will appear to the men and women of the twentieth century an incredible inhumanity , but there are two facts , both very curious , which partly explain it .
In the first place , it was firmly and sincerely believed that there was no other way in which Society could get along , except the many pulled at the rope and the few rode , and not only this , but that no very radical improvement even was possible , either in the harness , the coach , the roadway , or the distribution of the toil .
It had always been as it was , and it always would be so .
It was a pity , but it could not be helped , and philosophy forbade wasting compassion on what was beyond remedy .
The other fact is yet more curious , consisting in a singular hallucination which those on the top of the coach generally shared , that they were not exactly like their brothers and sisters who pulled at the rope , but of finer clay , in some way belonging to a higher order of beings who might justly expect to be drawn .
This seems unaccountable , but , as I once rode on this very coach and shared that very hallucination , I ought to be believed .
The strangest thing about the hallucination was that those who had but just climbed up from the ground , before they had outgrown the marks of the rope upon their hands , began to fall under its influence .
As for those whose parents and grand - parents before them had been so fortunate as to keep their seats on the top , the conviction they cherished of the essential difference between their sort of humanity and the common article was absolute .
The effect of such a delusion in moderating fellow feeling for the sufferings of the mass of men into a distant and philosophical compassion is obvious .
To it I refer as the only extenuation I can offer for the indifference which , at the period I write of , marked my own attitude toward the misery of my brothers .
In 1887 I came to my thirtieth year .
Although still unmarried , I was engaged to wed Edith Bartlett .
She , like myself , rode on the top of the coach .
That is to say , not to encumber ourselves further with an illustration which has , I hope , served its purpose of giving the reader some general impression of how we lived then , her family was wealthy .
In that age , when money alone commanded all that was agreeable and refined in life , it was enough for a woman to be rich to have suitors ; but Edith Bartlett was beautiful and graceful also .
My lady readers , I am aware , will protest at this .
" Handsome she might have been , " I hear them saying , " but graceful never , in the costumes which were the fashion at that period , when the head covering was a dizzy structure a foot tall , and the almost incredible extension of the skirt behind by means of artificial contrivances more thoroughly dehumanized the form than any former device of dressmakers .
Fancy any one graceful in such a costume ! "
The point is certainly well taken , and I can only reply that while the ladies of the twentieth century are lovely demonstrations of the effect of appropriate drapery in accenting feminine graces , my recollection of their great - grandmothers enables me to maintain that no deformity of costume can wholly disguise them .
Our marriage only waited on the completion of the house which I was building for our occupancy in one of the most desirable parts of the city , that is to say , a part chiefly inhabited by the rich .
For it must be understood that the comparative desirability of different parts of Boston for residence depended then , not on natural features , but on the character of the neighboring population .
Each class or nation lived by itself , in quarters of its own .
A rich man living among the poor , an educated man among the uneducated , was like one living in isolation among a jealous and alien race .
When the house had been begun , its completion by the winter of 1886 had been expected .
The spring of the following year found it , however , yet incomplete , and my marriage still a thing of the future .
The cause of a delay calculated to be particularly exasperating to an ardent lover was a series of strikes , that is to say , concerted refusals to work on the part of the brick - layers , masons , carpenters , painters , plumbers , and other trades concerned in house building .
What the specific causes of these strikes were I do not remember .
Strikes had become so common at that period that people had ceased to inquire into their particular grounds .
In one department of industry or another , they had been nearly incessant ever since the great business crisis of 1873 .
In fact it had come to be the exceptional thing to see any class of laborers pursue their avocation steadily for more than a few months at a time .
The reader who observes the dates alluded to will of course recognize in these disturbances of industry the first and incoherent phase of the great movement which ended in the establishment of the modern industrial system with all its social consequences .
This is all so plain in the retrospect that a child can understand it , but not being prophets , we of that day had no clear idea what was happening to us .
What we did see was that industrially the country was in a very queer way .
The relation between the workingman and the employer , between labor and capital , appeared in some unaccountable manner to have become dislocated .
The working classes had quite suddenly and very generally become infected with a profound discontent with their condition , and an idea that it could be greatly bettered if they only knew how to go about it .
On every side , with one accord , they preferred demands for higher pay , shorter hours , better dwellings , better educational advantages , and a share in the refinements and luxuries of life , demands which it was impossible to see the way to granting unless the world were to become a great deal richer than it then was .
Though they knew something of what they wanted , they knew nothing of how to accomplish it , and the eager enthusiasm with which they thronged about any one who seemed likely to give them any light on the subject lent sudden reputation to many would - be leaders , some of whom had little enough light to give .
However chimerical the aspirations of the laboring classes might be deemed , the devotion with which they supported one another in the strikes , which were their chief weapon , and the sacrifices which they underwent to carry them out left no doubt of their dead earnestness .
As to the final outcome of the labor troubles , which was the phrase by which the movement I have described was most commonly referred to , the opinions of the people of my class differed according to individual temperament .
The sanguine argued very forcibly that it was in the very nature of things impossible that the new hopes of the workingmen could be satisfied , simply because the world had not the wherewithal to satisfy them .
It was only because the masses worked very hard and lived on short commons that the race did not starve outright , and no considerable improvement in their condition was possible while the world , as a whole , remained so poor .
It was not the capitalists whom the laboring men were contending with , these maintained , but the iron - bound environment of humanity , and it was merely a question of the thickness of their skulls when they would discover the fact and make up their minds to endure what they could not cure .
The less sanguine admitted all this .
Of course the workingmen 's aspirations were impossible of fulfillment for natural reasons , but there were grounds to fear that they would not discover this fact until they had made a sad mess of society .
They had the votes and the power to do so if they pleased , and their leaders meant they should .
Some of these desponding observers went so far as to predict an impending social cataclysm .
Humanity , they argued , having climbed to the top round of the ladder of civilization , was about to take a header into chaos , after which it would doubtless pick itself up , turn round , and begin to climb again .
Repeated experiences of this sort in historic and prehistoric times possibly accounted for the puzzling bumps on the human cranium .
Human history , like all great movements , was cyclical , and returned to the point of beginning .
The idea of indefinite progress in a right line was a chimera of the imagination , with no analogue in nature .
The parabola of a comet was perhaps a yet better illustration of the career of humanity .
Tending upward and sunward from the aphelion of barbarism , the race attained the perihelion of civilization only to plunge downward once more to its nether goal in the regions of chaos .
This , of course , was an extreme opinion , but I remember serious men among my acquaintances who , in discussing the signs of the times , adopted a very similar tone .
It was no doubt the common opinion of thoughtful men that society was approaching a critical period which might result in great changes .
The labor troubles , their causes , course , and cure , took lead of all other topics in the public prints , and in serious conversation .
The nervous tension of the public mind could not have been more strikingly illustrated than it was by the alarm resulting from the talk of a small band of men who called themselves anarchists , and proposed to terrify the American people into adopting their ideas by threats of violence , as if a mighty nation which had but just put down a rebellion of half its own numbers , in order to maintain its political system , were likely to adopt a new social system out of fear .
As one of the wealthy , with a large stake in the existing order of things , I naturally shared the apprehensions of my class .
The particular grievance I had against the working classes at the time of which I write , on account of the effect of their strikes in postponing my wedded bliss , no doubt lent a special animosity to my feeling toward them .

Image caption GCHQ said it had tried to improve diversity and equality
Britain 's secret eavesdropping centre , GCHQ , has been criticised for failing to recruit enough ethnic minority staff to help fight terrorism .
An official report , leaked to the Sunday Times , also said black and Asian intelligence officers had complained of discrimination at the complex in Cheltenham , in Gloucestershire .
A GCHQ spokesman told the BBC policies and practices were now being improved .
Much of GCHQ 's work involves monitoring calls and e-mails from terror suspects .
But the report , authorised by the head of the civil service , Sir Gus O'Donnell , says a lack of officers with specialist knowledge of languages like Urdu and Arabic is hampering efforts to spot codes and cultural nuances in intercepted conversations .
" It is critical to have a diverse staff group who are able to profile and recognise certain behaviour patterns and communications , " the document says .
The report recommends better engagement with ethnic minority communities in order to boost recruitment and improve the image of the organisation .
" This is critical to good national security intelligence , " it adds .
The security officers ask questions which are culturally inappropriate , insensitive and offensive Ethnic minority employee , GCHQ
The report says GCHQ has tried to improve its equality and diversity , but " the culture of the organisation has not been receptive to this " and it " is seen as a people issue which only applies to some people " .
It points out that there are no black or Asian senior managers .
Several dozen ethnic minority intelligence officers were interviewed during its preparation , and among the complaints recorded was : " I was n't born here and although I have been security cleared , I am constantly challenged about my loyalty to Britain by my colleagues . "
Another employee said : " The security officers ask questions which are culturally inappropriate , insensitive and offensive . "
A third said they felt that ethnic minority employees had to work harder than white colleagues " and for less reward " .
Targeted recruitment
The director of communications at GCHQ , Chris Marshall , said the organisation had " long recognised that strict nationality and residency requirements for staff , and the specialist nature of our work , have made it challenging to develop a workforce which represents the diversity of the UK population " .
He said the organisation had tried to improve things with a targeted recruitment campaign , but a review in 2009 " reflected that GCHQ continued to fall short in meeting our targets " .
Mr Marshall said that in response to it , GCHQ was " making a number of improvements to our policies and practices " , including employing a dedicated diversity officer and focusing recruitment on specific universities with large ethnic minority populations .
" GCHQ is regularly recognised as a good employer but we aspire to be the best , " he said .
" We recognise that recruiting a diverse range of people , treating them in a non-discriminatory way and supporting them to achieve their full potential is key to that aspiration . "
How we see the world impacts our use of language and our use of language impacts how we see the world .
Cognitive scientists in the vein of Benjamin
Whorf regularly investigate the connections to thought and language use , including how visual perception varies across languages .
Since I use ( authentic ) visual media to assist in foreign language acquisition , my research does have a practical side to the normally impenetrable fields of visual cognition and psycholinguistics .
I use photographs at the earliest stages of language learning to train the brain not only in the use of new words , but literally how to " see " in the new language .
Seeing a language differently embeds that language into a visual cultural context for the learner and makes for more effective recall later .
Let 's look at two aspects of the visual world that provide good examples of how the visual impacts language and vary between languages and cultures : Color & Space .
Color
In order to highlight how color perceptions vary among cultures , I like to use the example of how we linguistically categorize certain colors .
Let 's take the range of colors in what we call " blue " and " red " in English .
When you look at the following colors , typical native English speaking respondents will describe these two colors as existing with the range of colors we call " blue " .
Conversely , the following two colors here represent two distinct color categories in English , namely " red " and " pink "
If one looks at other languages , this same categorization scheme is not evident .
For example , the blues above are distinct color categories in Russian .
Plain or dark blue ( синий , siniy ) is a distinct color from light blue ( го л ÑƒÐ±ой , goluboy ) .
Each of these color categories has its own associated meanings , invoking a specific thought for many Russians .
In Moscow , there are separate blue lines on the city metro system which helped me finally learn the difference between синий & го лÑƒÐ±ой .
Winawer and other at MIT take a close look at this subject in " Russian blues reveal effects of language on color discrimination . " ( 2007 )
For the red & pink example , there is a correlating opposite in Chinese .
The color distinction is not as prevalent as the colors are in the same category linguistically .
Red is çº¢ ( hóng ) and pink as ç²‰çº¢ , ( fÄ›n hóng ) or literally " powder red " , a linguistic derivation similar to ' light - blue ' in English .
Where Russian blues are distinct , so are the Reds in English , but in Chinese , they are linguistically related .
The Winawer study takes this a step further .
What does it mean for the function of our brain when we categorize what we see in different ways ?
They show that Russian concepts of blue affect visual performance , particularly on the language users ' ability to discriminate between colors .
They state
" … our results suggest that language - specific distortions in perceptual performance arise as a function of the interaction of lower level perceptual processing and higher level knowledge systems ( e.g. language ) . "
This insight / observation points towards a direct connection between the language one speaks and the functionality of the visual cortex and the brain .
In other words , the vocabulary you use and how you categorize the world affects the speed at which you brain can recall certain information through your optic nerves .
They also hint that left brain hemisphere tasks may be affected by language and visual perception as this is the hemisphere of the brain where language and logical performance is organized .
Interestingly enough , this is switched in infants as visual perception is not yet attached to a language center .
Apparently , babies see color purely as what they see is not filtered through the lens of language .
I am not sure what it means to see a color " purely " , but the Color label wheel from Dolores Labs provides an interesting look at color perceptions within the English language .
Space
In addition to color , spatial perception varies among cultures according to researchers .
These differences in how we perceive space ( eg. size , distance , depth , and direction , etc ) lead to corresponding linguistic differences manifested in the words we use to describe our surroundings in different language .
This lens of language here affects how we perceive and feel about our surroundings .
One might easily imagine how a phrase like " that is a large house " , " it is within walking distance " , or " it is located off to the right " would vary in meaning between cultures , but there are more subtle and stark differences in how we perceive space differently .
The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics has several examples of cultural variances .
Researcher Steven C. Levinson has interesting insights and states that in
" … many cultures ( as suggested by at least a third of the small sample ) spatial conception is organized in a fundamentally different way than expected on the basis of familiar western languages . "
According to Levinson , a linguistic example can be found in the lack of spatial descriptors as in front of , in back , left of , and right of .
Some languages instead use absolute terms or " fixed " cardinal direction such as north , south , upstream , downstream that are irrelevant of the direction of the speaker .
Perhaps it is that certain languages are less ego - centric , linguistically speaking , and focus more on cardinal directions .
Apparently , the only universal content in regards to spatial perception in language appears to be the direction ' up ' since it is a function of the gravity that we all feel , regardless of our cultural or linguistic background .
Geography , culture , and even technology shape how we view space in our world .
In addition to variance among cultures , there is constant change within languages .
Additionally , it is not solely a function of this ' lens of language ' ; it is both a function of our language and our experiences .
For example , the exposure to mathematics and science has an impact on how we perceive space .
The following figures represent some classic optical illusions to demonstrate examples of how cultures perceive length differently .
In the first image , the question is " which center line is longer ?
In the second image , the question is whether the blue line is longer than the red .
In both cases , the lines are the same length , we only perceive them to be different lengths ; an optical illusion .
Interestingly enough , these optical illusions are only perceptible by members of traditional ' western cultures ' .
Segall , et al. in " The Influence of Culture on Visual Perception " wrote in 1968 that susceptibility to optical illusion is , indeed , a culturally determined factor .
Their experiments conclude that the " European and American samples made significantly more illusions - supported responses than did the non-Western samples . "
I use these examples of visual differences between cultures to highlight the point that the visual impacts language , and if you use media to teach a language , you need to use authentic media .
Clip art and generic stock photography do n't take advantage of the benefits of media in learning .
Many language learning software developers use inauthentic images , stock photos , or clip art simply because of cost issues .
A full description of the design problems in language learning software can be found in my 2003 article : CALL , commercialism and culture : inherent software design conflicts and their results ReCALL , 2003 – Cambridge Univ Press .
In the mean time , I will continue to ponder how what I see affects how I think and how I think in a given language affects how I see .
New light at the end of the carbon tunnel ?
Scientists from UC Berkeley , Stanford Universityand the California Institute of Technology have been given $ 122 million to come up with ways to produce fuels directly from sunlight .
The U.S. Department of Energy announced the grant Thursday to a team led by Caltech in Pasadena , also includiing Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , UC Berkeley and Stanford .
The team 's mission : Develop practical methods of manufacturing " carbon neutral " fuels similar to the way plants create energy via photosynthesis .
" Finding a cost - effective way to produce fuels as plants do - combining sunlight , water and carbon dioxide - would be a game changer , reducing our dependence on oil and enhancing energy security , " said Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman in announcing the grant .
" We 're not talking about solar panels , " said Peidong Yang , a professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley who heads the Bay Area branch of the project .
" We are going to develop technology to convert solar energy directly into chemical fuels like methanol , ethanol or just gasoline , through CO2 reduction . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The five - year project is to be conducted under the auspices of the officially named Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis , or , by its more user - friendly name , the " Fuels from Sunlight Energy Innovation Hub . "
It 's the second " energy innovation hub " set up by the Obama administration to " pursue transformative breakthroughs in technology that can help us meet our energy and climate challenges . "
In May , the DOE announced a nuclear energy hub led by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee .
Third on the DOE 's docket : a hub looking to make advances in energy - efficient buildings .
Nature 's model solution : Scientists have a pretty good handle on how photosynthesis works in the natural world , but only in principle on how it might be adapted artificially and commercially .
The Sunlight hub 's mandate , according to a DOE fact sheet , is " to demonstrate a scalable and cost - effective solar fuels generator that , without the use of rare materials or wires , robustly produces fuel from the sun 10 times more efficiently than current crops " ( links.sfgate.com /ZKAF ) .
In other words , to beat nature at its own game - with all the challenges that entails .
" This is something you can't do today , " said Anders Nilsson , a Stanford University scientist who will be working on the project alongside colleagues at the Stanford - run SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park .
" The idea is to conduct research to see if this can be developed .
If this could work , it would have a huge impact that will change our society . "
" In order to replace fossil fuels , we need to get a lot more proficient at harvesting sunlight and converting it into forms of energy that can be used for transportation and other human needs , " said Paul Alivisatos , director of the Berkeley lab where the Bay Area branch of the project will be headquartered .
" Nature provides a model solution to this problem through photosynthesis .
We want to emulate this process but do it with artificial materials that could be much more efficient and use much less land . "
Pie in the sky ?
To one Berkeley alternative - energy analyst , who did not wish to be quoted by name , " it sounds like another ' breakthrough technology ' Hail Mary pass . "
On the other hand , UC Berkeley energy professor Daniel Kammen , who is not associated with the project , says , " there could be applications for this in a very few years . "
" I really would not put a timeline on the commercialization of such a technology , as it does not exist today , " said Yang .
" What we hope is that through such concentrated large scale research , we 're able to expedite its development and implementation . "
The project , which also involves UC campuses in Santa Barbara , Irvine and San Diego , is scheduled to get off the ground this year , according to the DOE .
" Which means right now , " Yang said .
USA TODAY reporter Judy Keen reports from Cocodrie , La. :
Cocodrie , La. , is at the end of the road - a tiny fishing community where Louisiana 56 dead - ends at the Gulf of Mexico .
Out on the water , oil slicks are spotted so often , it 's old news around here .
The spill has brought many changes to this town of 300 .
Shrimp boats are tied up , unused .
BP has brought hundreds of workers here to load boom and coordinate some of the activities at the spill site .
BP has leased a big marina and rents part of the parking lot at Cocodrie Clubhouse , a restaurant / bar that 's part of the Harbor Light Marina .
At lunchtime today , people ate the daily special - red beans and rice with sausage , salad and brownie for $ 8.54 - and played pool and darts .
The BP workers , wearing badges and radios clipped to their belts , did n't mingle with local residents .
There 's no tension , says Jules Ledet , 50 , the restaurant owner .
Many people here , he says , are n't planning to leave .
" We 'll be here , " he says .
" It 's a way of life . "
Ledet says he 's lost about half his business , but he has n't filed a claim with BP for compensation .
People here are hard - working and tough , he says , and accustomed to hard times .
Hurricane Katrina did n't do a lot of damage here , but Hurricane Rita slammed the area in September 2005 .
Zeke Foret , 63 , who is itching to get his shrimp boat , The Cajun Critter , in the water , says he 's worried that the spill will change this place forever .
" A lot of the younger people are going to have to move and find a new way of life , " he says .
" It 's sad . "
His friend Elton LeCompte Sr. , 73 , has worked on boats and in the oil fields .
" It ca n't be all bad , " he says .
" You do all you want and have enough for a six - pack on Saturday . "

I do n't think the location of the stonesense folder itself matters much .
But I keep the stonesense folder in the DF root for organizations sake , and it seems to work there .
I do appear to have discovered some odd behavior though .
Different sprites for different castes no longer seems to function , or at least the method to identify them in the init has changed .
No matter what individual in my fortress I mouseover , if always identifies them as caste 1 or 2 , and seems to completely ignore all others .
I copied my sprites and init directly over from the last version , which worked fine , so I do n't think there are any problems there .
And using the key to look through all the spritesheets , stonesense seems to locate them all just fine .
Here 's a screencap if it helps understand what I 'm talking about .
Naturally if the feature was just decided to be more trouble than it 's worth and was removed , I understand .
Just seems unintentional since there was no mention of it being removed .
And figured I would throw out a heads up .
Since I seem to be the only one who actually uses that function currently , I was thinking if it is a mistake it could go unnoticed for quite some time if I do n't mention it .
Uranium Mining in Eastern Germany :
The WISMUT Legacy
by Peter Diehl
( last updated 17 Apr 2011 )
Contents
Immediately after the end of World War II , the Soviets started exploration and mining of uranium in the historic mining provinces in the Ore Mountains .
Subsequently , the Wismut company developed the third - largest uranium mining province of the world ( after the US and Canada ) in the Southern part of the German Democratic Republic .
Information on this huge operation was not publicly accessible until the young peace and environmental activist Michael Beleites published his famous underground report " Pechblende - Der Uranbergbau in der DDR und seine Folgen " ( Pitchblend - Uranium Mining in the GDR and its Impacts ) in 1988 [ Beleites 1988 ] .
With the political changes in 1989 , it came to light to the larger public that in Eastern Germany large areas had been devastated for the production of the source material for the nuclear bomb .
With the unification of Germany in 1990 , uranium production was terminated .
What is left over , are the huge shut - down uranium mines , hundreds of millions of tonnes of radiating waste rock and uranium mill tailings , presenting health risks through release of radon gas and contaminated seepage .
This legacy does not only present an immediate hazard , but also endangers future generations for tens of thousands of years .
Reclamation is underway to contain the hazards , but questions remain concerning the long - term effectiveness of the measures being taken .
Between 1946 and 1990 , Wismut produced a total of around 220,000 tonnes of uranium .
During peak times , production exceeded 7000 tonnes per year .
For subsequent processing , all uranium produced was delivered to the Soviet Union .
Initially , the uranium produced was exclusively used for nuclear weapons ; later it was also used for nuclear power plants .
" Wismut " is the short name of the company .
From 1946 to 1953 , it was a Soviet stock corporation ; so the complete name was " SAG Wismut " , where SAG stands for Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaft , and Wismut is the German name for bismuth - it was used to conceal the true purpose of the enterprise .
From 1954 to 1991 , it was a joint Soviet - German stock corporation ( 50 % / 50 % ) ; so the complete name was " SDAG Wismut " , where SDAG stands for Sowjetisch - Deutsche Aktiengesellschaft .
In December 1991 , the company was completely taken over by the government of then united Germany and was converted to a limited company ; the name thus is now " Wismut GmbH " , where GmbH stands for Ltd .
But during all these years , the company was usually referred to as simply " Wismut " .
Wismut 's staff in the early years is estimated to have been up to 130,000 , among them many in forced labour .
In the mid-eighties , the staff figures were around 27,000 .
More than 400,000 people have been working with Wismut at one time or another .
At the end of 1990 , uranium mining was discontinued as a consequence of the German unification .
Since 1991 , Wismut carries out the work necessary for shut down and reclamation with drastically reduced numbers of employees ( mid-1998 : 3500 ) .
The government estimates the clean - up period at 10 - 15 years , at costs of DM 13 billion ( US$ 9.3 billion ) .
Since no reserves were saved by the former operators , the clean - up has to be funded from the Federal budget .
Until end -1998 , DM 5.7 billion ( 44 % ) have been spent already .
In the beginning , Wismut 's uranium mining focused on the locations Johanngeorgenstadt / Aue / Schlema in the Saxonian part of the Ore Mountains , later also on Ronneburg in Eastern Thuringia , and Freital / Dresden - Gittersee and Königstein near Dresden .
In addition to these major sites , there exist many other places where uranium was explored or temporarily mined .
Map of locations
The contents of uranium of the ore extracted by Wismut was 251,000 tonnes ; the amount of uranium produced in concentrate form from the ore was lower , due to production losses .
The production figures of the various regions are shown in the following table [ Hähne1993 ] :
Uranium Production of Wismut ( 1946-1990 ) Location
Ore deposit type Uranium produced ( in ore ) Ore Mountains / Vogtland Hydrothermal 103,000 t 41.0 % Ronneburg Sedimentary metamorphose Paleozoic 113,000 t 45.0 % Culmitzsch Carbonate Zechstein 12,000 t 4.8 % Dresden / Freital Lower Permian coal 4,000 t 1.6 % Königstein Cretaceous sedimentary 19,000 t 7.6 % TOTAL 251,000 t 100 %
The uranium was mined in open pits and in underground mines .
The largest open pit called " Lichtenberg " is located near Ronneburg .
Its initial depth was 240 meters ; after being partly refilled , the depth was still 160 meters at an open volume of 80 million m3 in 1990 .
After depletion of the ore deposits located near the surface , mining continued at this place to depths of 500 meters .
In the Ore Mountains , depths of 2000 meters were even reached ; due to the high temperatures at these depths , the mines had to be air conditioned at high cost .
During the early years , the ore extracted was processed in small mechanical processing plants located near the mines .
From the 1950's , processing was concentrated in two large uranium mills including chemical treatment in Crossen near Zwickau and Seelingstädt near Gera / Ronneburg .
In addition , two smaller mills were in operation in Freital and Dresden - Gittersee until 1962 .
A special case is the Königstein mine .
This underground mine was switched to in - situ leaching in the early eighties : the ore was no longer removed from the deposit , but sulfuric acid was injected into the ore deposit to leach the uranium on site .
The grade of the ores produced by Wismut in the last years was only around 0.07 % uranium , a comparatively low value .
Correspondingly , mining cost and amounts of waste and tailings produced were rather high .
In 1990 , Wismut 's production cost of DM 380.50 per kg of uranium was nearly ten times the world market price of then 10 $ / lb U3O8 .
During the early " wild " years of uranium mining , protective measures for the miners were very poor .
Miners in these early years thus took the highest risk of contracting lung cancer .
In the year 1955 , radon concentrations in Wismut 's mines typically were approximately 100,000 Bq / m3 , with peaks of 1.5 million Bq / m3 [ Jacobi1992 ] .
Detailed information about the early years of Wismut mining can be found in [ Beleites 1992 ] , [ Paul1991 ] , or [ Karlsch1993 ] , for example .
From the end of the fifties , the ore was kept wet during drilling to avoid generation of dust , and the mines were intensively ventilated to lower the radon concentrations .
The doses received from radon decay products thus decreased from 150 WLM to 4 WLM per year ( WLM = Working Level Month is a unit for the dose from radon decay products , which are causative for cancer development ) .
According to [ Jacobi1992 ] , the doses received in Wismut 's mines in the early years should not be estimated at 150 WLM , but at 200 WLM per year .
The true value can hardly be determined , since Wismut never performed direct individual monitoring of the doses received by the miners .
Before 1955 , no monitoring was performed at all - only estimates can be made for this early period .
Later , radon decay product concentrations were sampled at representative locations within the mines for short periods of time .
The doses received by the miners were calculated from these sampling results .
While this method allows a certain overview on the doses received , its results cannot be compared with those of continuous individual monitoring .
Between 1946 and 1990 , 7163 uranium miners who had been employed with Wismut died from lung cancer .
For 5237 of them , the occupational exposure was recognized as the cause of the disease .
At present , still approx .
200 lung cancers of former Wismut miners per year are recognized as occupationally caused [ AKURA2000 ] .
Until mid-1990 , the limit for recognition was 450 WLM ; then it was lowered to 200 WLM .
One year of work in the uranium mines during the early years is therefore already sufficient to attribute an observed lung cancer to the occupational exposure .
An assessment of international studies on lung cancer incidences with uranium miners showed that with reference to age at exposure and age at cancer incidence , even a total exposure of only 40 WLM can be sufficient to be regarded causative .
Such a dose could also be obtained by work exclusively during the mine 's later years , while the recognition was so far granted only for work during the mine 's early years .
At exposures of 150 WLM and higher , an observed lung cancer can be attributed to the work in the uranium mines , practically independent of the exposure history .
[ Jacobi1992 ] ( view details )
Further studies showed that also the risk of contracting cancers other than lung cancer is elevated for uranium miners , in particular for cancer of the mouth region , pharynx , and larynx , bone cancer , leukemia , and liver cancer [ Jacobi1995 ] [ Jacobi1997 ] ( view details , see also Uranium Miner Health Risk Calculator ) .
The employers ' liability insurance association ( Berufsgenossenschaft ) , however , does not recognize these studies as sufficient to prove that exposure in the mines may have been causative for any such non-lung cancer contracted [ AKURA2000 ] [ Eigenwillig2011 ] .
Radon and dust , blown out by the mine 's ventilation , do not only cause direct dose loads for the residents by inhalation : an investigation of various food samples grown in the Ronneburg ( Thuringia ) uranium mining district showed that by the consumption of local food the highest dose by far of 0.33 mSv ( 33 mrem ) per year is caused from wheat grown near a ventilation shaft [ Schmidt1994 ] .
Large amounts of groundwater were pumped out of the mines , to keep them dry during mining operations .
The water was released into rivers and creeks .
In the sediments of rivers in the Ronneburg area , concentrations of radium and uranium around 3000 Bq/ kg were found , indicating up to 100 - fold increases over natural background [ Hanisch1994 ] .
In the old mining areas in the Ore Mountains , the problems resulting from uranium mining are commingled with those resulting from historic mining - mining haven taken place in the medieval age .
In Schneeberg for example , extremely high concentrations of radon are found in homes : in living rooms , 20,000 Bq / m3 are not uncommon , while up to 100,000 Bq / m3 are found in basements [ Keller1991 ] .
These levels are , in part , caused by the direct access to former underground mine workings existing in the basements of many houses , or by other radon pathways from the mines to the basements .
Since there is no scientific consensus on the lung cancer risk from such elevated radon levels in homes , a number of epidemiologic studies are being performed worldwide on this subject at present .
First preliminary investigations in the East German uranium mining province show elevated lung cancer incidences with men in several towns ; they are attributed to occupational exposure in the uranium industry .
But , in Schlema and Schneeberg , elevated incidence rates of lung cancer were also found with women [ Heinemann1992 ] .
In the Dresden - Freital area , hard coal containing uranium was mined for fuel use from 1542 .
From 1952 - 1955 and 1967-1989 , the same coal was mined by Wismut for uranium .
Consequently , there is also a problem of both wastes from uranium mining , and from historic mining in this area , especially from the coal ashes .
All these piles present hazards to residents and the environment , even after the shutdown of the mines , due to their release of radon gas into the air , and to their release of toxic and radioactive contaminants by seepage into groundwater .
The waste rock piles of the uranium mines in the Schlema / Aue area contain a volume of 47 million m3 and cover an area of 343 hectares .
The waste rock often was dumped on the valley 's slopes .
In many instances , they are located in the immediate neighbourhood of residential areas .
Consequently , high radon concentrations in free air around 100 Bq / m3 are found in large areas of Schlema , in some quarters even above 300 Bq / m3 .
The independent Ecology Institute has calculated a lifetime excess lung cancer risk of 20 cases ( and 60 cases respectively ) per 1000 inhabitants from these concentrations [ Küppers1994 ] .
This is the extra risk caused from radiation , in addition to the risk caused from natural background or other sources .
Moreover , much higher peak concentrations of radon may result from climatic inversion conditions in the narrow valleys .
View Waste rock piles at the valley slopes of Schlema ( before application of cover - May 1991 ) ( 19 k )
For the southern parts of the town of Ronneburg , the Ecology Institute calculated a lifetime excess lung cancer risk of 15 cases per 1000 inhabitants .
Since radon spreads rapidly with the wind , the risk must also be considered for the residents in the wider surroundings : the Ecology Institute calculated an excess lung cancer incidence of 6 cases per year within a radius of 400 km . [ Küppers1994 ]

Seepage is another problem presented by the waste rock piles ; in some cases , even creeks were simply buried under the piles .
The seepage releases of the waste rock piles in the Schlema / Aue area are estimated at 2 million m3 per year , half of which flows into groundwater .
Only a small fraction of the other half is captured at the foot of the piles .
So - called waste rock was often processed into gravel or cement for use in road and railroad construction .
The Saxonian Hartsteinwerke Oelsnitz alone , for example , have processed 7.58 million tonnes at uranium concentrations of up to 100 g per tonne .
Baukombinat Zwickau used 14.4 million tonnes of material from the waste rock pile of the Crossen uranium mill for road construction , at uranium concentrations of up to 150 g per tonne and radium concentrations of up to 1.3 Bq / g .
The radioactivity thereby was dispersed over large areas .
For some part of the material , a follow - up of the use is not possible .
Heap leaching of low grade ores with sulfuric acid was performed on a large scale at Wismut 's Gessental - pile at Ronneburg ( 7 million tonnes ) and in Königstein ( 2 million tonnes ) .
During operation , these heap - leaching piles present hazards due to the release of dust , radon gas and , possibly , leaching liquid seepage .
After termination of the operation , a permanent hazard may persist due to natural leaching processes taking place , if the material piled up contains the mineral of pyrite ( FeS 2 ) - as is the case for the Thuringian ores :
Then , precipitation together with inflow of air can cause the continuous formation of sulfuric acid within the pile , leading to a permanent leaching of uranium and other contaminants , presenting a groundwater hazard for centuries .
In Saxony , an underground mine converted to an in - situ leaching facility was in operation at Königstein near Dresden until end 1990 .
On a small scale , in - situ leaching was also used in the Ronneburg ( Thuringia ) uranium province .
In the case of Königstein , a total of 100,000 tonnes of sulfuric acid was injected with the leaching liquid into the ore deposit .
At present , 1.9 million m3 of leaching liquid are still locked in the pores of the rock leached so far ; a further 0.85 million m3 are circulating between the leaching zone and the recovery plant .
The liquid contains high contaminant concentrations , for example , expressed as multiples of the drinking water standards : cadmium 400x , arsenic 280x , nickel 130x , uranium 83x , etc .
This liquid presents a potential hazard to an aquifer that is of importance for the drinking water supply of the region .
The largest such settling ponds in Europe are the Culmitzsch tailings dam near Seelingstädt ( Thuringia ) , containing 90 million tonnes of solids , and the Helmsdorf tailings dam in Oberrothenbach near Zwickau ( Saxony ) , containing 50 million tonnes of solids .
The Culmitzsch dam was erected on the site of a mined - out open pit uranium mine , the capacity of which was enlarged by additional dams .
The Helmsdorf dam was erected as a barrier on the place of the village by the same name , which was completely destroyed for the dam .

Apart from the uranium , the tailings contain all constituents of the uranium ore .
This also implies that the tailings still contain 85 % of the radioactivity contained in the ore , as the long - lived decay products of uranium , thorium - 230 and radium - 226 are not removed .
Since the uranium cannot be recovered completely from the ore during the milling process due to technological constraints , the tailings , moreover , contain 5 - 10 % of the uranium initially present in the ore .
The radium - 226 contained in the ore decays to the radioactive gas radon - 222 .
A part of this radon escapes from the tailings deposit into the atmosphere .
Although radon - 222 has a comparatively short half - life of 3.8 days , it presents a long - term hazard , since the decay of radium - 226 - with its half - life of 1600 years - constantly produces new radon - 222 .
In addition , the tailings also contain the predecessor of radium - 226 in the decay chain , thorium - 230 .
It decays at a half - life of 80,000 years , constantly producing new radium - 226 .
Apart from the radioactive constituents , the tailings also contain other contaminants that were present in the ore , for example , arsenic , or various other heavy metals .
The Helmsdorf tailings dam alone , for example , contains 7590 tonnes (! ) of arsenic .
All these hazardous substances have been removed from their safe underground disposal and have been brought to the form of a fine sand or slurry .
The contaminants thus are now much more mobile and susceptible to release into the environment .
In addition , the mineral pyrite ( FeS 2 ) - as contained in Thuringian ores - forms sulfuric acid inside the deposit when accessed by precipitation and oxygen .
This acid causes a continuous automatic leaching and subsequent release of contaminants .
The sky darkened over the villages in the neighbourhood of Wismut 's uranium mill tailings dams , when storms blew the sands from the dry tailings beach .
Consequently , elevated concentrations of radium - 226 and arsenic were found in dust samples from these villages .
Meanwhile , the dry tailings beaches have been covered with neutral material to prevent further wind erosion .
The dams of uranium mill tailings deposits are often not of a stable construction : in most cases , they are not built as engineered structures , but by piling up of the coarse fraction of the tailings slurries themselves .
An assessment of dam stability thus is subject to great uncertainties .
Moreover , the dams are raised sequentially , following the rising elevation of the impounded tailings during the filling process .
( view details on tailings dam safety )
Some dams ( among them those of Culmitzsch and Trünzig in Thuringia ) are built on geological faults and are located close to the center of seismic activity in the Eastern part of Germany .
They are therefore at a specific risk during earthquakes .
The main dam of the Helmsdorf tailings deposit , with its height of 59 m , does not even meet the safety margins of the German dam safety standards .
In the case of a dam failure , large parts of the village of Oberrothenbach would be flooded by the slurries .
1000 people are living in the immediately threatened area , 6500 more are living in the potential flooding area .
View Dam of Helmsdorf uranium mill tailings deposit ( 24 k )
Dam failures can also be caused by heavy precipitation events with excessive rises in the level of the water ponding above the slurries in the impoundment .
In May 1994 , the water level in the Helmsdorf dam approached the limit with 6 cm to spare .
For this reason , an additional protection dam was built on the deposit in Spring 1995 , to prevent water from reaching the main dam .
Moreover , a water treatment plant was taken into operation in 1995 , allowing for the lowering of the water level and thus for a decrease of the risk of dam failure .
Toxic waste was dumped on the surface of the Trünzig A uranium mill tailings pile in Thuringia before the political changes .
It was intended to cover this toxic waste by another 5 m layer of domestic waste ; but this was prevented by residents ' protests .
1 million m 3 of domestic waste and ash was dumped on the top of the tailings deposit of the Dresden - Gittersee uranium mill , which was shut down in 1962 .
of domestic waste and ash was dumped on the top of the tailings deposit of the Dresden - Gittersee uranium mill , which was shut down in 1962 .
Liquids presenting a hazard to water were dumped on the top of a waste rock pile at Ronneburg ( Thuringia ) after the political changes .
These liquids must now be removed and disposed of at high cost to allow for reclamation of the pile .
Radioactively contaminated metal scrap from the decommissioning of the Crossen ( Saxony ) uranium mill is to be dumped in the Helmsdorf tailings dam .
Correspondingly , a standardized concept for the reclamation tasks to be done in Eastern Germany is lacking .
Reclamation action was started without sufficient analysis and consideration of management alternatives .
There did n't even exist a standardized procedure for hazard assessment at the various sites ; only gamma radiation was monitored systematically .
According to the German Unification Treaty , the West German radiation protection regulations are not adopted for the East German uranium province , but the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) regulations remain in force .
Thus , an annual dose of 1 mSv ( 100 mrem ) instead of 0.6 mSv ( 0.3 for the aquatic and 0.3 for the atmospheric pathway ) is admissible .
The calculation rules of the GDR regulations , moreover , result in much lower radiation doses for a certain amount of activity ingested , and therefore allow for much higher radiation uptake to obtain the same doses [ Küppers1991 ] .
The annual dose limit of 1 mSv means that one lifetime incidence of cancer is regarded acceptable per 286 persons concerned .
Several communities and individuals have filed a suit at the Federal Constitutional Court against this provision of the Unification Treaty .
The suit has been accepted for decision , but judgement is still pending .
For the reuse of contaminated material and areas , various recommendations have been elaborated by the German Radiation Protection Commission ( SSK ) [ BMU1993 ] .
They are based in principle on an excess annual dose of 1 mSv for the public .
But , this limit does not include the dose from drinking water contamination ( another 0.5 mSv ) [ SSK1993t ] , and from radon in homes .
SSK 's recommendations are , moreover , based on different calculation rules for the doses resulting from ingestion with food and water , than used in the West German radiation regulations ; thus , higher radionuclide uptakes are admissible , until the limit is exceeded [ Küppers1994 ] .
For the most problematic issues - the management of the uranium mill tailings and in - situ leaching facilities - there are no recommendations at all .
Wismut is only responsible for the reclamation of those sites that were not returned to the local authorities before 1962 .
The communities are responsible for the other sites , but they are not nearly able to pay for their reclamation .
They do n't receive compensation for their former Wismut sites from the Federal Budget .
( See also : Altstandorte des Uranbergbaus in Sachsen ( 30 k PDF , in German ) )
Another problem is the access to environmental data gathered about the aftermath of uranium mining .
For those sites that are still owned by Wismut , the data is gathered by Wismut itself ; for those sites that were returned to the local authorities before 1962 , the Federal Radiation Protection Agency ( BfS ) performs the monitoring .
For its sites , Wismut only publishes rather general annual reports , while BfS has published summary information only .

The liquid hazardous wastes that were dumped after the political changes on the Absetzerhalde pile in Ronneburg , need to be removed and disposed of separately , before this pile can be reclaimed .
Wismut has built a special toxic waste deposit for this material on its Ronneburg premises .
The deposit went partially into operation in October 1999 .
The waste rock piles in the Saxonian mining district at Schlema are being covered with neutral material .
The slopes of many of these piles are so steep though , that the covers slide in some cases .
The long - term performance of these covers is questionable .
One of the big deals the New Jersey Devils made yesterday was signing Anton Volchenkov to a 6 year , $ 25.5 million contract .
Volchenkov is largely regarded for his defensive skills , most notably his shot blocking .
According to NHL.com 's real - time stats , Volchenkov has been among league leaders in blocked shots for the last 5 seasons with at least 170 per season .
He even led the league in 2006 - 07 with 273 ( and played 78 games that season ) .
Per Kevin 's recent post , Ottawa supporter Ryan Classic noted that he had over 1000 blocks in the last 5 seasons and no one else has over 900 .
However , I do n't believe Volchenkov may get to that 170 mark with the New Jersey Devils .
A Related Digression : I do n't think shot blocking has been a real problem in NJ .
Generally , the goal of a defense is to prevent shots and help the goalie out , not necessarily stop them in flight .
At best , the shot 's blocked and you have possession .
Yet more often than not , the puck gets loose elsewhere or , worse , gets deflected and throws off the goaltender trying to play the shot .
Given that it mostly has been Martin Brodeur in net for the last 5 seasons , you 'd want him to face the shot unimpeded when possible .
It comes of no surprise then , that the Devils have been one of the least prolific shot blocking teams since the lockout .
However , when I looked at how the numbers broke down for New Jersey year - by - year , I 'm inclined to think that the defense may have been blocking more shots at the Rock than what the official numbers show .
In fact , I 'd predict Volchenkov 's blocks could very well go down even if he does n't change how he plays in New Jersey ( and get criticized for it , of course ) .
I 've put the figures together and will explain further after the jump .
Official scorers at each game records not just the basic stats , but also real - time super stats ( RTSS ) such as blocked shots , hits , missed shots , and so forth .
I have n't found a guide or a manual or something that explains how these are supposed recorded , but if one does n't exist , there should be .
Puck Prospectus ' Tom Awad , way back in 2009 , pointed out the differences in shot totals from rink to rink .
He called it rink bias , as each rink tends to have the same scorer .
This logic may also apply to shot blocking .
Check out how the Devils fared since the lockout in this RTSS stat .
Since the discussion revolves around official numbers , all base stats here on out come from NHL.com .
In every one of the last five regular seasons , the Devils blocked at least 95 shots on the road more than they did at the Rock .
The percent difference ( R - H means Road minus Home ) is at least 15 % in every season and has risen in the last few seasons .
Notice how much higher the Devils are ranked on the road in comparison to being in the bottom third or close to last at home .
I can understand that teams may have different tactics on the road than at home .
Without the last change , defensemen may be on the wrong side on a matchup and therefore have to play more desperate .
However , I have difficulty accepting that possibilty for shot blocking given the disparity between road and home blocks .
Especially in the last three seasons where the core of the blueline has remained the same .
The gap only got larger and larger , though .
Can it be possible that Colin White , Bryce Salvador , Paul Martin , and company were told to get in the way of shots more on the road ?
For some games , sure ; but for 41 games in each of the last three seasons ?
I do n't think the Devils became better in blocking shots by virtue of being away from the Rock .
The only reasonable conclusion I can come to is that the scorer (s ) for the Devils ' home games have under - counted Devils blocks .
The numbers certainly suggest that possibility , if nothing else .
Sure , other arenas will over and under count blocks but since the most they 'll play in another team 's arena in a season is 3 times , their effect is mitigated .
3 games will not have the same effect as 41 , which is how many games the Devils are at home .
Just look at the base numbers and the rankings .
What other than home scoring bias can explain the Devils being simultaneously the least prolific shot blockers at home and one of the most prolific on the road ?
Therefore , Anton Volchenkov could very well make more of an effort to block shots , and his numbers may suffer anyway because the Devils scorer wo n't record as many shot blocks as he actually makes .
OK .
Now , here 's where it gets a little weird .
I 've just given you the last 5 years .
NHL.com has RTSS team stats that go all the way back to 1997 - 98 .
I 've put those numbers together and they tell a more complex tale than the last 5 years alone .
Yes , 2002 - 03 should be ignored because for some reason , NHL.com has incredibly low numbers for all RTSS stats .
Since I doubt that even the Devils went from 920 blocks to 303 in a single season , I have to think the numbers are n't complete .
Still , the Devils have actually had a couple seasons where there was n't a giant gap between home and road blocked shots .
In fact , there were a few where the Devils got much more blocks at home than on the road .
Here 's a graphical representation of where the gaps have formed .
It appears that 2003 - 04 was the last season where the base numbers are even enough to accept the outcome as reasonable .
Mind you , the Devils did n't block a lot of shots in total , but at least it 's less likely that it was the result of the scorers not counting blocks .
The Devils definitely peaked in 2006 - 07 , and there was a road - home difference of 95 in that season .
At least the one consistency is that the Devils have n't blocked a ton of shots as a team , save for the one peak season .
Over the seasons , the percent difference between the road and home blocks have risen ; really getting to massive difference from 2005 - 06 through this past season .
At least this makes the pre-lockout numbers less complicated in conjunction with the post - lockout numbers .
While the percent difference definitely shot up after the lockout , there are signs of an upward trend in the pre-lockout numbers .
Even if you include 2002 - 03's numbers , the percent difference would be a little higher than 2003 - 04 .
Still a part of that upward trend .
I think this further suggests that there is home scoring bias against shot blocking .
I openly wonder , did the Devils get a new scorer for their home games after the lockout ?
If not , then did the scorer at Devils home games change his / her methods or criteria for judging blocked shots ?
If personnel did change , would someone ( the Devils ? the NHL ? someone ? ) kindly inform him / her to be more accurate in their shot block counts ?
Admittedly , I doubt those questions will be answered , much less lead to more accurate shot blocking counts .
If it has n't been found out now , then why make any changes ?
It may be more practical for use to prepare to not judge Volchenkov 's effectiveness as a New Jersey Devils in the coming season by how many blocked shots he racks up .
Thanks for reading ; now I want to know what you think .
Do you agree or disagree that there is a scoring bias at Devils home games against blocked shots ?
If not , then why , because I think the numbers speak for themselves .
What do you think needs to happen to fix this - a new scorer , better location for scoring blocks , a standardization of how to record stats , or something else ?
Do you think it will be fixed ?
Most of all , does this change your expectations for Volchenkov in the coming season ?

Peter Orszag , the president ’s outgoing Director of the Office of Management and Budget , released the annual mid-year update to the administration ’s budget projections at 3 pm last Friday afternoon in a conference call with reporters .
That was a dead giveaway that the administration was hoping not to make much news with its latest budget projections , or at least not make news in a way that anyone would notice .
They were n’t entirely successful in burying the report , but it ’s understandable why they tried .
The numbers are eye - popping .
The budget deficit in 2010 is expected to set a record at $ 1.471 trillion – or 10 % of GDP .
In 2011 , the administration projects the deficit will again top $ 1.4 trillion .
From 2010 to 2020 , the Obama budget plan would run up a cumulative deficit of nearly $ 10 trillion , and the nation ’s debt would reach $ 18.5 trillion in 2020 , up from $ 5.8 trillion at the end of 2008 .
Even more ominous for the president is the economic forecast .
It shows unemployment remaining at over 8 % through the 2012 presidential re-election campaign , despite the assumption that relatively normal economic growth would have been underway for more than two years by then .
The primary problem is quite plainly out of control federal spending .
In 2008 , total federal outlays were about $ 2.9 trillion .
President Obama wants to add $ 1 trillion to that total in 2011 , or about a 33 % expansion of governmental activity in just three years .
And that ’s just the beginning of it .
By the end of the decade , federal outlays would reach $ 5.6 trillion , nearly double what they were a little more than a decade earlier , and that ’s assuming a massive and speculative peace dividend after 2011 and cuts in domestic discretionary programs that the president has yet to identify .
Of course , the baby boomers are also now entering their retirement years , and will begin flooding into the Social Security and Medicare program in the next few years , pushing spending on those programs up even more rapidly than they have grown in the past .
By 2030 , there will be 71 million Americans age 65 and older , up from 41 million this year .
All of this building budgetary pressure is now a clear drag on growth and a hindrance to hiring .
Firms are worried that the “ solution ” politicians will ultimately pursue to close the widening gap between federal revenues and spending is more debilitating tax increases .
The latest long - run budget forecast from the Congressional Budget Office wo n’t allay those fears .
In that report , CBO found that a massive tax hike is already in the offing .
Historically , federal taxes have hovered at around 18 to 19 % of GDP .
CBO expects that number to rise to 23 % of GDP by 2035 , even if nothing is done to change current law .
Income taxes will begin to rise automatically next year if Congress lets tax rates revert to their pre-Bush levels .
In addition , the cuts to rates on dividends and other investment earnings from 2003 – cuts that were which instrumental to igniting growth during the post - 9/11 slump – would also vanish .
President Obama has already pushed through Congress one of the largest tax increases on record as part of his health care plan .
The Medicare payroll tax is set to rise by 0.9 % of payroll for individuals with incomes above $ 200,000 per year and couples with incomes exceeding $ 250,000 .
In addition , these same households will now pay an additional 3.8 % tax on “ unearned ” income , such as dividends , rent , and other investment income .
The income thresholds for assessing these taxes are not indexed at all .
Further , the new 40 % excise tax on the premiums of so - called “ high cost ” insurance plans kicks in 2018 , and then begins to hit more and more people as the threshold for determining what constitutes a “ high cost ” plan grows with general consumer inflation and not health costs .
Carter - era bracket creep has now been restored in a big way in the age of Obama .
All told , CBO expects these and other tax hikes in the health bill to raise ever - increasing amounts of revenue , reaching 0.5 % of GDP in 2020 and 1.2 % in 2035 .
The president ’s governing and budget strategy should now be evident to one and all .
He has spent his first two years in office working to secure expansions in the scope and power of the federal government .
Working with very sizeable Democratic majorities in both the House and the Senate , he passed an $ 800 billion - plus “ stimulus ” program , a massive health care entitlement covering tens of millions of new beneficiaries , a full federal takeover of the student loan industry , and sweeping new regulations for the financial sector .
All of these initiatives have increased federal power and spending and have been financed with new tax and regulatory burdens on the private sector of the American economy .
And all were passed entirely on partisan lines , or with just token Republican support .
Now that a vastly expanded federal enterprise has been “ locked in , ” or so the Democrats now hope , the president and his team are looking to “ pivot ” and spend the coming period in the run-up to 2012 as would - be defenders of the U.S. treasury .
The president is now pledging to attack runaway budget deficits starting with consideration of the recommendations of a presidentially - appointed debt commission , set to report – conveniently – just after the mid-term election .
And he wants Republicans on the commission and in Congress to give him cover for the tax increases he is sure to seek to pay for the bloated government he has erected .
Republicans would be fools to go along with this game plan .
If the president wants bipartisan cooperation in governing , then that cooperation should extend to the scope and expanse of the federal government , not just how to pay for it .
That means health care policy , and financial services , and student loans , and everything else in between .
But that ’s not what the president has in mind .
He has spent his first two years in office building a government of the Democrats ’ dreams .
He and his fellow Democrats in Congress should now explain how they plan to pay for it .

WASHINGTON 
When two young State Department officials took a delegation of Silicon Valley executives to Syria recently , they billed it as a chance to use the promise of technology to reach out to a country with which the United States has long had icy relations .
Instead , the visit will be remembered for a series of breezy Twitter messages that the two colleagues sent home , riffing about how visitors can buy an American - style blended iced coffee at a university near Damascus and how one of them had challenged a Syrian communications minister to a cake - eating contest .
The messages raised hackles on Capitol Hill , where some Republicans were already leery of the Obama administration ’s efforts to engage Syria .
They also embarrassed the State Department , which normally conducts its dealings with Damascus behind a veil of diplomatic politesse .
The two staff members , Alec J. Ross and Jared Cohen , were rapped on the knuckles for generating what two State Department officials called “ stray voltage . ”
Yet despite the youthful indiscretion , their broader goal of using technology to further diplomacy enjoys enthusiastic support from the highest levels of the department , notably Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .

French oil firm Total and Spain 's Abengoa Solar will partner with Abu Dhabi 's alternative energy company Masdar to build " the world 's largest " concentrated solar power plant , Masdar announced on Wednesday .
The state - owned firm said it has selected a " consortium of Total and Abengoa Solar as a partner to own , build and operate Shams 1 , the world 's largest concentrated solar power plant and the first of its kind in the Middle East . "
" We are moving on the right path to make Abu Dhabi the main source and the international capital of renewable energy and sustainable development , " Masdar CEO Sultan al - Jaber told a news conference in the oil - rich emirate .
The plant " will offset 170 thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide annually . "
Construction of the plant , which will cover an area of 2.5 square kilometres ( 1 square mile ) and have a 100 megawatt capacity , will begin in the third quarter of 2010 and be completed in approximately two years , Masdar said .
" We expect the cost of this project to be around 600 million dollars ( 504.2 million euros ) , " project manager Mohammed al - Zaabi said .
Masdar will hold a 60 percent stake in the project , while Total and Abengoa Solar will each have 20 percent .
" Shams ( Arabic for sun ) is the first major step for Abu Dhabi to achieve its seven percent target " for renewable energy use by 2020 , Zaabi said .
" It will be followed by the next projects , Shams Two and Three . "
Power demand in Abu Dhabi peaks during the day due to air conditioner use , Zaabi said , making solar power ideal , as sunlight is strongest at the same time .
" This is the first time in the United Arab Emirates where we can provide significant ( power ) capacity that does not rely on fossil fuel , " said Nicholas Carter , head of the Abu Dhabi Regulation and Supervision Bureau , which regulates the water and electricity sectors .
Concentrated solar power ( CSP ) plants use mirrors to heat liquid -- a type of oil , in the case of Shams 1 -- to then heat water to run a steam generator and produce electricity , Zaabi said .
Abengoa Solar CEO
Santiago
Seage said that , compared to other types of solar power plants , " the main advantage of CSP is the fact that it is less intermittent . "
" You have a solar field ... but you also have a boiler where you use natural gas to create the steam if the solar resource is not enough , " he said .
Abengoa Solar has already constructed four CSP plants in Spain , and is building others in Spain , north Africa and the United States , Seage said .
The plant will be located in Madinat Zayed , about 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) southwest of Abu Dhabi .

The 4x4 that can change into a helicopter in less than a minute
This helicopter that changes Transformers - like into a rugged 4x4 may one day be ferrying troops around Iraq and Afghanistan , helping them avoid the constant threat of roadside bombs .
The futuristic design is the latest brainchild of the Texas - based AVX Aircraft Company .
It can carry four fully - equipped soldiers and travel 250 miles by land and air on a single tank of fuel .
An artist 's impression of the new concept that will be able to move from rugged 4x4 vehicle
The company says that almost any soldier could drive and fly it , and that they would not need a pilot 's licence .
Unfolding the rotor blades for flight should convert the vehicle from 4x4 to aircraft in just one minute .
The company says the vehicle would be especially suitable for use in Iraq and Afghanistan where troops face constant danger from roadside bombs , or IED - improvised explosive devices .
The Pentagon is now considering the design .
It is keen to find ways of finding greater protection for troops in hostile areas who have to travel between bases .
The AVX vehicle could travel at 140 mph in the air , 86 mph on the road and 30 mph off road .
It would also carry about 520 kg of fuel .
However , it could be several years before the company has a working prototype .
The Defense Department is unable to properly account for $ 8.7 billion out of $ 9.1 billion in Iraqi oil revenue entrusted to it between 2004 and 2007 , according to a newly released audit that underscores a pattern of poor record - keeping during the war .
Of that amount , the military failed to provide any records at all for $ 2.6 billion in purported reconstruction expenditure , says the report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , which is responsible for monitoring U.S. spending in Iraq .
The rest of the money was not properly deposited in special accounts as required under Treasury Department rules , making it difficult to trace how it was spent .
Though there is no apparent evidence of fraud , the improper accounting practices add to the pattern of mismanagement , reckless spending and , in some instances , corruption uncovered by the agency since 2004 , when it was created to oversee the total of $ 53 billion in U.S. taxpayer money appropriated by Congress for the reconstruction effort .
“ The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss , ” notes the audit report , a copy of which was obtained Monday by the Los Angeles Times .
Special Inspector General Stuart Bowen , who heads the agency , said repeated investigations have shown that “ weak oversight is directly correlated to increased numbers of cases of theft and abuse . ”
In this instance , the audit focused on Iraqi revenue earmarked for reconstruction under a 2004 arrangement granting the Defense Department access to Iraq ’s oil proceeds at a time when the country did not have a fully functioning government and was unable to undertake urgently needed projects .
The revenue was deposited in a special account in New York , called the Development Fund for Iraq .
The report comes as Iraqis are increasingly frustrated with their own government ’s inability to provide basic services , or to explain how tens of billions of dollars ’ worth of oil revenue has been spent since 2007 .
The alleged U.S. mismanagement of Iraqi money is certain to revive grievances against the U.S. for failing to make a big dent in the country ’s reconstruction needs despite massive expenditures .
Iraqis are still angry about the failure to account for a separate $ 8.8 billion in Iraqi oil revenue spent by the U.S. - led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 and 2004 .
If more money is found to be missing , “ Iraq will definitely try to get it back , ” said Ali Musawi , a media advisor to Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
Most of the money covered in the latest audit has been spent , but the study found $ 34.3 million that should legally have been returned to Iraq in 2007 , when Iraq ’s government assumed responsibility for its finances .
The Defense Department has not said what it intends to do with the money , which is “ at risk ” of being spent , the audit said .
In response to the audit findings , the Defense Department concurred with recommendations that it establish better guidelines for managing such funds .
But a letter from U.S. Central Command emphasized that failure to establish deposit accounts for the $ 8.7 billion does not mean it all cannot be accounted for .
The U.S. reconstruction effort is winding down as the military withdraws , and no more new U.S. funds are expected to be allocated .

Seit der Abschaffung der Gewissensprüfung vergangenes Jahr stürmen die Schweizer die Zivildienst - Plätze .
Bis Ende 2010 wird ihre Zahl auf rund 25.000 steigen .
Die Abschaffung der Gewissensprüfung beschert dem Zivildienst auch in der Schweiz einen Ansturm .
Rund 8800 Männer haben sich seither um Aufnahme beworben , wie Zivildienst - Chef Samuel Werenfels am Freitag sagte .
Bis Ende 2010 wird die Gesamtzahl der Zivildiener auf rund 25.000 steigen .
Zum Vergleich : Vor der Abschaffung der Gewissensprüfung im April 2009 gingen bei der Vollzugsstelle für den Zivildienst jährlich zwischen 1200 und 2000 Gesuche ein .
Im Jahr 2009 wurden bereits über 7200 Gesuche verzeichnet .
Einsatzplätze sind knapp
Der Anstieg stellt den obersten Zivildiener vor neue Herausforderungen : " Für Zivis ist es je nachdem schwierig , möglichst rasch einen Einsatzort zu finden " , sagte Werenfels .
Auf dem Papier stünden zwar genügend Einsatzplätze zur Verfügung .
Faktisch genügten sie allerdings nur knapp , denn nicht alle Plätze seien ganzjährig verfügbar .
Zudem bestünden regionale Unterschiede .
Eine neue Online - Plattform soll die Koordinationsprobleme entschärfen .
Zudem sucht die Zivi aktiv neue Einsatzbetriebe .
Ende März standen den Zivildienstleistenden rund 7100 Einsatzplätze zur Verfügung .
Das seien so viele wie noch nie , heißt es auf der Zivi-Internetseite .
Dieses Wachstum könne allerdings mit demjenigen bei den Gesuchen nicht Schritt halten .
" Inhaltliche Neuorientierung " ?
Damit die tausenden neuer Zivis beschäftigt werden können , kann sich Werenfels eine " inhaltliche Neuorientierung " der Einsatzgebiete vorstellen : " Beim Lauberhornrennen ( Ski Alpin , Anm. ) könnten anstelle von Soldaten auch Zivis zum Einsatz kommen . "
Auch für Aufräumarbeiten nach Naturkatastrophen kämen seine Männer in Frage .
Allerdings als Verstärkung des Militärs , " nicht als Konkurrenz " .

The classic definition of a programmer actually rarely exists anymore .
Being a programmer can be a difficult job trying to figure out why the code you have developed is n’t working and if everything is going good according to the specs then he ’s feeling himself a happiest guy around .
It ’s not unusual for them to face dynamically new situations so often while performing their job .
But they are use to with it .
However excitement , enthusiasm , love , horror , frustration and other emotions are the vital part of their professional personality .
Below is a cartoon sequence to find out how programmer reacts on different situations .

Recently disendorsed NSW Liberal candidate , David Barker , expressed concern that Julia Gillard was " anti- God " and that a non-Liberal vote would be a vote for Muslims , thus reintroducing religion , kicking and screaming in protest , to the campaign agenda .
Associated with the NSW Christian right , Mr Barker 's comments raise the question of whether Christians in Australia expect a Christian prime minister .
Before the 2007 Australian federal election , a Victorian Christian minister sent an email to his supporters , in which he claimed that God had told him to anoint Peter Costello as the future prime minister of Australia .
John Howard would win the election , then hand over the leadership to Costello .
He allegedly went to Parliament House to fulfil his God - given mission .
Apparently , it was n't a God - given mission .
Or , at the very least , divine and human wires got crossed .
In my view , there could be a need to revisit this minister 's expectations of how God might communicate with him , but that 's for the theologians to sort out .
However , it highlights a significant problem with the way Christians relate to politics — they are way too ' Old Testament ' about it .
Anyone who is making a claim that God has told him to anoint the future leader is being very B.C. for a Christian minister .
In other words , it is a common Christian mistake when thinking about politics , society and the church to look at things through your Old Testament , rather than your New Testament , glasses .
Nowhere in the New Testament is there any concept that a Christian ' prophet ' might be given word from God on who should govern the land .
The arrival of Jesus changes all of that theocratic language , and the role of ' prophecy ' changes : it becomes a call to recognise the authority of Jesus , and to follow his teachings and his call to turn back to God .
The New Testament famously calls on Christians to " be subject to the governing authorities " ( in Romans 13:1 ) but it certainly does not say , " go and appoint the governing authorities yourself " .
In fact , it says quite the opposite .
The very next verse suggests that if you resist an authority , you are in fact resisting God , because God is in control ultimately of who leads and who does n't .
We sometimes hear Christians saying that only a Christian leader will do , because " righteousness exalts a nation " , but that is an Old Testament idea ( Proverbs 14:43 , to be precise ) .
That was a call to the ancient Jewish nation to obey God 's commands so that the nations around them ( who worshipped other gods ) would see how the worshippers of ' the one true God ' thrived , and perhaps realise he was the living deity , unlike their things of stone and wood .
Righteousness is no doubt a good thing ( it 's good to be good ) , and there is plenty to be learned from the Hebrew Bible in many areas of ethics , character and godliness , but Christian leaders ought to be more reflective in the way they use the various parts of the Bible to push their points .
In short , they need to make sure they are being Christian about it .
Some Christian leaders ( not many , it must be said ) are claiming that Julia Gillard has no right to be Prime Minister because she is an atheist , and the majority of Australians are not .
They are correct to note that Aussies still believe in God ( 67 per cent at least ) , but they are wrong to say that being an atheist disqualifies you — even in the eyes of Christians — from being prime minister .
They may once again be invoking an Old Testament understanding of national leadership , not a New Testament one .
In fact , what they are doing is mistaking the offices of government with the positions of church leadership .
It would indeed be appalling if the leaders of national church bodies were not themselves believers in God .
It happens , and when it does it is horrifying .
Worse than appointing a Collingwood coach as head of the Bombers .
But that is the church we are talking about , not the nation .
For Christians , the difference between the two is of profound importance .
The Christian church has plenty to say and do on behalf of the nation ( I 'm all for social involvement rather than separatism ) , but it was never part of the plan that we should run the place .
Or it should n't be .
In the A.D. period — what Christians call the age of the church — the idea of ' God 's nation ' no longer exists .
When it is invoked , it is always a mistake , be it Constantine 's Europe , King James 's England , or modern America .
Or Australia .
Christians care deeply about the nation , and in their finest moments do all they can to " seek the good of the city " ( even if that is a quote from a book in the Old Testament ! ) .
But the gospel of Jesus transcends and transforms our understanding of the nation , breaking down barriers between people and ( at least in its ideal form ) modelling a different kind of ' nation ' .
Australia is n't the most godless nation on earth , but nor are we God 's nation on earth .
In Christian understanding , that title does n't belong to any nation , but only to the rag - tag collection of God-botherers , who gather together from many nations , many backgrounds and many political persuasions as what we call ' church ' .

UK , US , France may attend Hiroshima bombing anniversary for first time
Tokyo , Wed , 28 Jul 2010 ANI
Tokyo , July 28 ( ANI ) : Britain and the United States are considering sending representatives for the first time to the 65th anniversary ceremony of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima .
The Telegraph quoted Japanese media reports as saying that John Roos , the US ambassador to Japan , is likely to attend this year 's ceremony .
He reports also said that Britain is also considering sending a representative .
A record 67 nations will be sending representatives to Hiroshima for this year 's memorial ceremony .
France has announced that it will be sending an envoy to the Hiroshima ceremony for the first time , while General Ban Ki Moon , the United Nations Secretary General , has also accepted an invitation to this year 's ceremony , making him the first UN chief to attend .
A spokesman from the British Embassy in Tokyo confirmed that an invitation had been received and a formal response would be given in the next few days .
It was on the evening of August 6 , 1945 , that the US dropped the world 's first atomic bomb over Hiroshima city , causing an estimated 166,000 deaths over the subsequent four months .
The Nagasaki bombing took place three days later , before the Japanese announced its surrender to Allied Powers on August 15 , bringing to an end the Second World War . ( ANI )
A month ago , I committed to waking up everyday at 6 am for hot yoga classes at 6:30 am .
As with many commitments , the first week was easy .
By the second week , getting out of bed became a struggle and I had to find ways to get myself up .
I ’m happy to say I still wake up every morning at 6 am – even on days I do n’t have yoga class .
Here are a few morning tricks I discovered that prepares your body and mind for a great day .
1. Drink a giant glass of water .
A morning glass of water can immediately improve concentration and alertness .
Drinking water replenishes the water your body lost during your sleep , particularly if you have heating or air - conditioning on ( we all know how important water is for our bodies ) .
Fill up your glass the night before and leave it on the night table for the morning .
2 . Wake up to your favourite song .
Instead of waking up to an unwelcoming alarm that sounds like a fire drill , try waking up to uplifting music .
If you need a few suggestions , here are my favourite morning songs .
I use an iPhone app called Alarm Tunes Lite ( free ) and are similar apps for BlackBerries .
Jason Marz – Lucky
Owl City – Butterflies
Vitamin String Quartet – Hallelujah
Kna’an – Waving Flags
Natasha Bedingfield – Unwritten
3. Really stretch your body .
Even wiggle your bum , your fingers and toes .
Your blood pools in your limbs while you sleep and a good stretch in the morning helps your blood circulate .
4. Breath deeply .
Be still , take deep breaths and feel your belly rise every time you inhale .
Make each inhale last for five seconds and then exhale for five seconds .
Breathing deeply gets oxygen flowing through you body before you get out of bed .
5.Be grateful for 5 things .
We often wake up dreading what we have to do today or thinking about how we ’d rather stay in bed instead of having to go to work .
To remind yourself that everyday is a gift , start your morning by listing 5 things you are grateful for .
Health , loved ones , inspiring books , sunshine and friends are a few examples .
What do you do to wake up feeling refreshed ?

THEY DO LOVE THEIR LOBBYISTS ….
Last week , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said he could n’t tell anyone what Republicans would do if they won a congressional majority .
Hoping to evade any kind of substantive debate , Boehner said he preferred to wait — his taxpayer - financed “ America Speaking Out ” gimmick would tell GOP candidates what to think .
The next question , then , is who ’ll shape the “ America Speaking Out ” project .
It obviously is n’t the public — GOP leaders are ignoring ideas generated by the initiative that they do n’t already like — but it might be the lobbyists .
( via Alex Seitz - Wald )
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) and Rep. Peter Roskam ( R - Ill . ) have invited senior Republican lobbyists and top officials from several large trade groups to the Capitol next week to provide their suggestions for a new GOP agenda .
The meeting is part of the House leaders ’ initiative called America Speaking Out , which is intended to draw broad input to create a new policy agenda for the party to launch in the fall .
An e-mail invitation sent to more than 20 trade representatives and obtained by Roll Call summoned guests to Boehner ’s second - floor office on July 16 “ to discuss House Republican efforts to produce a new policy agenda with a small group of trade association leaders . ”
Invitees included Dan Danner , head of the National Federation of Independent Business ; Bruce Josten , top lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ; Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers ; and Joe Stanton of the National Association of Home Builders .
Imagine that .
House Republicans do n’t have a policy agenda , but they ’re willing to put one together , just as soon as the lobbyists tell the party what to think .
This seems to fit into a larger pattern .
When the Senate began work on a jobs bill , Republicans huddled with corporate lobbyists .
When the House began work on Wall Street reform , Republicans huddled with industry lobbyists .
When Congress worked on health care reform , Republicans huddled with insurance lobbyists .
When the Senate moved forward on an energy / climate bill , Republicans huddled with energy lobbyists .
This even extends to candidate recruitment .
When Republicans needed a U.S. Senate candidate in Indiana they turned to Dan Coats — a corporate bank lobbyist who lives in D.C .
If I did n’t know better , I might think Republicans ’ “ Tea Party populism ” shtick is just some kind of cheap charade .
That could n’t be , could it ?

Michael Steele fires Rob Bickhart after the RNC suffered through sex scandals and dwindling donors .
Steele fires RNC finance director
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele on Friday fired RNC finance director Rob Bickhart and deputy finance director Debbie LeHardy , both of whom were tied to embarrassing payments made by the party committee .
Bickhart will be replaced by Mary Heitman , a former finance director for the Republican Governors Association .
In a statement , obtained by POLITICO , Steele said Heitman 's " depth of experience in both the private sector and political field will be a tremendous asset to the RNC . "

The departures are the latest in a broad shake - up of the committee since POLITICO disclosed in February a breach between Steele and major Republican donors over the committee 's spending on private jets , limousines and other expenses .
Their anger was only exacerbated by the disclosure that the RNC – under Bickhart ’s authority - had reimbursed a donor for taking a group to Voyeur , a bondage - themed club in West Hollywood .
In the immediate aftermath of the visit , first reported by The Daily Caller , the young aide who directed the RNC ’s Young Eagles program for young donors and put in the reimbursement , was fired .
Since then , Steele has also replaced his chief of staff , his spokesman , and parted ways with a media consultant who had worked with him in his 2006 Senate race in Maryland .
But Steele 's decision to force out a low - level aide rather than Bickhart continued to grate on donors and RNC committee members .
Randy Pullen , the RNC treasurer , initiated an audit of the party books that found " no material weaknesses in accounting controls " but several " significant deficiencies . "
Specifically , Pullen concluded that Bickhart may never have reviewed the night club reimbursement paperwork — and someone else may have put his signature on the it to authorize the payment .
In addition , Pullen noted that the Pennsylvania political consulting firm that Bickhart owns , eCapitol Direct , was on track to collect more than $ 250,000 for RNC fundraising work that lacked adequate performance standards .
" This contract should be cancelled , " Pullen wrote .
Beyond the payments to his firm , Bickhart was receiving an annual salary of $ 196,000 , and he was allowed to split his time between the RNC headquarters and his suburban Philadelphia offices , which RNC sources have said resulted in spotty supervision and leadership in the finance department .
Bickhart also had come under fire recently for a fundraising presentation disclosed by POLITICO that outlined the RNC ’s plans to capitalize on “ fear ” of President Barack Obama and that featured images depicting Obama as the Joker from " Batman . "
LeHardy had also faced her own share of controversies .
As the news media began scouring the RNC ’s regular disclosure reports , a pattern emerged in which clothing , liquor and other items were categorized as office supplies or meals .
For instance , LeHardy received a $ 450 reimbursement for a " meal " at a Manhattan boutique that does n't have a restaurant .
Steele 's new chief of staff , Michael Leavitt , informed RNC members of the forced resignations and the appointment of Heitman .
" While we appreciate their service to the RNC and wish them well in future endeavors , the chairman felt it was important to restructure the department in order to continue to improve our strong fundraising numbers , " Leavitt said .
In addition to the spending irregularities , Steele has been under fire for his spending too lavishly .
Many major donors have complained bitterly about private jets , highly paid consultants , and expensive event fees and are refusing to give to the RNC .
Instead , they have shifted their giving to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the RGA .
As a result , the RNC has lost its historic fundraising advantage over the Democratic National Committee .
According to the latest disclosure reports , the RNC has raised $ 121 million for the 2010 cycle , and spent $ 125 million .
It now has $ 11 million in cash - on - hand .
The DNC has raised less , $ 114 million , but also spent less , $ 105 million , leaving it with $ 15 million in the bank .
In addition , Steele is now competing for donations with a network of new Republican outlets that are being organized by some of the party 's best political operatives , including former Bush adviser Karl Rove and former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie , with an aim of duplicating much of the RNC 's work .
The new groups , which will have a separate voter turnout operation and a media arm that will be used to help House and Senate candidates this fall , and are expected to draw tens of millions of dollars of donations that can be given outside of the campaign finance rules that limit giving to political parties and candidates .
In his e-mail , Leavitt expressed confidence that the shakeup at the RNC will only strengthen the broad effort in the fall .
" We are well positioned for victory this fall and this addition to the team will only help us to provide the necessary resources to defeat Democrats across the country , " he said .
Battle Comp Enterprises was launched Memorial Weekend of 2010 .
Battle Comp became an instant success .
In 2010 , Battle Comp ’s founder , E. Alan Normandy , was working full - time as a Police Lieutenant in the San Francisco Bay Area .
As a former Chief Firearms Instructor , original SWAT Team Member and Consultant on the popular Discovery Channel MythBusters TV program , Alan asked the question : “ Can we develop a device , which performs directly in between a flash hider and a muzzle brake ? ”
With that simple question , Battle Comp Enterprises was born .
Osi Umenyiora tried to
this offseason , as he figured it was simply another flare - up of a lingering injury that pops up annually during spring workouts .
One month into summer , the pain is still there for the Giants ’ beleaguered defensive end .
And one expert says it wo n’t go away without surgery .
Earlier this month , Umenyiora traveled to the Steadman Clinic in Vail , Colo. , to visit noted hip specialist Marc Philippon , according to someone informed of the trip and Philippon ’s diagnosis .
The person , who requested anonymity because neither the Giants nor Umenyiora ’s camp has discussed his condition , said Philippon recommended surgery to repair side effects from a torn hip flexor that kept Umenyiora out of five games in 2006 .
The person said Philippon , who has performed hip surgeries on the Yankees ’ Alex Rodriguez , the Ravens ’ Ed Reed , former Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner and several other high - profile athletes , scheduled Umenyiora ’s operation for the near future .
But Philippon , Umenyiora and the Giants ’ medical staff eventually agreed to pass on surgery for now and try to manage the injury because he wo n’t make it worse by playing through it .
A Giants spokesman declined comment .
Umenyiora ’s agent , Tony Agnone , wrote in a text message he was unavailable to speak on the matter because he was visiting clients Monday .
Umenyiora , who will report to training camp with his teammates on Sunday , could not be reached for comment .
Umenyiora has been able to play through and manage his hip pain the past few seasons .
He led the Giants with seven sacks last season and had 13 in 2007 before missing all of 2008 with a knee injury .
However , this spring the hip injury was worse than it had been during recent offseasons .
The Giants even cited the hip as a reason for his being absent from an organized team activities practice .
The two - time Pro Bowl selection has also been frustrated by being relegated to a part - time role last season and said this offseason he
if he was playing his best football .
With his hip pain refusing to subside , it ’s unclear if he ’ll reach top form at all this season .
NOTES
Newly signed LB Keith Bulluck said he 's " 90 percent " recovered
from surgery performed seven months ago to repair a torn knee ligament that cut short his 2009 season and closed out his career with the Titans .
Bulluck , a 33 - year - old New City , N.Y. , native who signed a one - year deal with the Giants on Saturday , said he ’s been told the team is “ not going to try to kill me with two - a - days ” during training camp , which means he ’ll be among the players who will be limited to one practice during days with double sessions .
As for the switch to the middle after a decade of playing the weak side in the Titans ’ base defense , Bulluck said it will be similar to his role in the Tennessee defense where he was stacked behind a defensive tackle .
Plus , he ’s looking forward to being involved in every play , not just the ones to his side as an outside linebacker .
“ If you just play on one side , you know , and you ’re the dominant defensive player on your team , they ’re usually trying to do things to scheme you up , ” Bulluck said , adding : “ In the middle , you can run at me , but you ca n’t run away from me . ”
Rookie LB Phillip Dillard ceded his No. 53 jersey
to Bulluck and will wear No. 49 — at least until roster cuts make a number in the 50s available .

In adding SSL encryption to its primary search engine , Google is n't just protecting your traffic from anyone sniffing your network .
It 's also preventing third - party webmasters from tracking the search terms you used to find their sites .
That may be a good thing for netizens intent on privacy lockdown .
But for webmasters , it could be a bit of a problem .
Last Friday , Google told the world that an SSL - encrypted version of its core search engine was available at https://www.google.com
( Notice the extra " s " ) .
The company already offered https with several other services — including Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Docs , and Google Sites — but encrypted search is a little different .
As Scroogle founder Daniel Brandt pointed out in response to our story on Google 's announcement , when SSL is turned on , your browser will stop sending referral data to any non-SSL sites you visit through Mountain View 's search engine .
" If you click on a link to some non-SSL page ... then when you arrive at that page you will arrive with your referrer stripped , " Brandt said .
" The webmaster on that site wo n't know that you came from Google , and wo n't know what search terms you used to get there .
He wo n't even know if you used a search engine ( you could have just keyed in the URL in your address bar , which would also cause no referrer ) . "
Google acknowledges this in its " Help Center " article on SSL search , pointing out that it could affect what you see when visiting sites through its search engine .
" Web browsers typically turn off referrers when going from HTTPS to HTTP mode to provide extra privacy , " Google says .
" By clicking on a search result that takes you to an HTTP site , you could disable any customizations that the website provides based on the referrer information . "
A Google spokesperson ( rightly ) points out that this is not specific to Google 's SSL implementation .
" This effect is the result of the way browsers interact with HTTPS generally , " he tells us .
But Google controls a good 60 to 70 per cent of the US search market according to the big - name web research firms — if not much more in reality — and some have complained that with SSL search , the company will destroy web analytics as we know it .
In a blog post following Google 's news , Clicky — a web analytics firm — went so far as to announce the death of analytics .
" Say goodbye to search analytics , " the post reads .
" Google just announced their new secure search beta ... the search term is not passed through the referrer , and hence no analytics tool ( not even a good old log analyzer ) will have any idea of what a visitor searched for to reach your site . "
At the moment , Google 's SSL search is tagged as a " beta " and it 's optional .
Users must explicitly visit https://www.google.com to use it .
But Google has indicated it hopes to expand the service , and Clicky 's knickers are in a twist .
" I really hope Google never considers making this the default , because that would be very irritating for web masters — we would have no idea what people were searching for to get to our site , which is arguably the # 1 reason to run analytics in the first place , " the company says .
" Yes , someone ' snooping ' your connection wo n't be able to tell what you 're searching for , but the sites you click through to will probably have a good idea , based on your landing page —- not to mention they can also see their IP address and every page they have ever viewed on my site , ever .
And yet somehow , not knowing this visitor 's specific search term is protecting their privacy ?
Please .
The only thing it does is make the life of a web master a much bigger pain in the ass than it was before . "
Of course , Google itself will still have access to your search terms , and Clicky questions whether the company will somehow offer this information to webmasters through its Google Analytics service , trumping competitors like Clicky .
But Google indicates it has no plans to do so .
" I would point out that Analytics is no different from other third party services in terms of not receiving referrer information when users come from HTTPS sites , " that company spokesman tells us .
" We have a lot of feedback about our beta feature that we need to gather and interpret before we make any decisions about how next to proceed .
As it stands , this referrer effect applies only to users who elect to use the encrypted search offering each time . " ®
Ousted Agriculture Department official Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she wants to speak directly with President Obama about her firing .
Sherrod said that she does not think Obama has a grasp about her past experiences dealing with racial discrimination and wants assurances from him that things will change at the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , which Secretary Tom Vilsack Thomas James VilsackUSDA : Farm - to - school programs help schools serve healthier meals OVERNIGHT MONEY : House poised to pass debt - ceiling bill MORE acknowledged Wednesday has a long history of racial problems .

” I ca n’t say that the president is fully behind me , ” she said on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” program .
“ I would hope that he is .
I have not had a chance to talk to him ...
I would love to talk to him , but I respect him as the president of this great nation .
He is my president . ”
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs apologized on behalf of the Obama administration Wednesday for Sherrod ’s firing .
Vilsack asked for her resignation this week after video emerged of her making racially charged comments at a Georgia NAACP meeting .
The footage was later found to be taken out of context .
Vilsack held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to take full responsibility for the incident and offered her a new position at the department dealing with civil rights issues .
But Sherrod , who is black , said she was not sure she would accept the offer .
“ I really — I know he talked about discrimination in the agency and after all these years , that ’s still happening , ” she said .
“ I would not want to be the one person in the agency who everyone is looking at to clear up discrimination in the Department of Agriculture . ”
She also said that she wants to speak with the nation ’s first black president about racial discrimination .
“ He ’s not someone who has experienced some of the things I have experienced through life , being a person of color , ” she said .

A cat that had its back feet severed by a combine harvester has been given two prosthetic limbs in a pioneering operation by a UK vet .
The new feet are custom - made implants that " peg " the ankle to the foot .
They are bioengineered to mimic the way deer antler bone grows through the skin .
The operation - a world first - was carried out by Noel Fitzpatrick , a veterinary surgeon based in Surrey .
His work is explored in a BBC documentary called The Bionic Vet .
The cat , named Oscar , was referred to Mr Fitzpatrick by his local vet in Jersey , following the accident last October .
Oscar was struck by the combine harvester whilst dozing in the sun .
The prosthetic pegs , called intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthetics ( Itaps ) were developed by a team from University College London led by Professor Gordon Blunn , who is head of UCL's Centre for Biomedical Engineering .
Professor Blunn and his team have worked in partnership with Mr Fitzpatrick to develop these weight - bearing implants , combining engineering mechanics with biology .
Mr Fitzpatrick explained : " The real revolution with Oscar is [ that ] we have put a piece of metal and a flange into which skin grows into an extremely tight bone . "
" We have managed to get the bone and skin to grow into the implant and we have developed an ' exoprosthesis ' that allows this implant to work as a see - saw on the bottom of an animal 's limbs to give him effectively normal gait . "
Professor Blunn told BBC
News the idea was initially developed for patients with amputations who have a " stump socket " .
" This means they fix their artifical limb with a sock , which fits over the stump .
In a lot of cases this is sucessful , but you [ often ] get rubbing and pressure sores . "
The Itap technology is being tested in humans and has already been used to create a prosthetic for a woman who lost her arm in the July 2005 London bombings .
" The intriguing thing with Oscar was that he had two implants - one in each back leg , and in quite an unusual site , " Professor Blunn told BBC News .
He said that the success of this operation showed the potential of the technology .
" Noel has some brilliant ideas , " he added .
" And we 're continuing to work closely with him to develop new technologies . "

The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association on Tuesday filed a lawsuit seeking to rewrite the ballot description of Proposition 23 , a measure voters will consider in November that would suspend California ’s global warming law .
Saying that state Attorney General Jerry Brown had deliberately written a misleading title and summary aimed at killing the measure , the taxpayers association asked a Sacramento County Superior Court to nullify and change it .
“ Whether intentional or not , it certainly looks as though the attorney general has crafted a description intended to sway voters to vote ‘ no ’ on Prop. 23 , ” said Jon Coupal , president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association .
Opponents of the ballot measure called the lawsuit a desperate strategy .
“ This is a Hail Mary pass from a campaign that is circling the drain , ” said Steve Maviglio , a spokesman for the No on Proposition 23 campaign .
A Field Poll released July 9 found just 36 percent of likely California voters in favor of suspending the global warming law , with 48 opposed and 16 percent undecided .
If approved by a majority of voters , Proposition 23 would suspend AB 32 , California ’s landmark global warming law , until the state unemployment rate drops to 5.5 percent or lower for four consecutive quarters .
In the past 20 years , that has only occurred three times , most recently between October 2005 and June 2007 .
AB 32 was passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006 .
The law requires that California ’s greenhouse gas emissions be cut to 1990 levels by 2020 , a drop of about 15 percent from current levels .
Opponents of the law say it will cost the state jobs — particularly given the current recession — and have little effect on worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases .
Supporters say it will create jobs by boosting the state ’s renewable energy and green technology industries , and will set an example for other states and Congress .
As the California Air Resources Board continues to write the specific rules that will take effect in 2012 , the regulations are expected to fall hardest on the industries that burn the most fossil fuels , including oil refineries , power plants and cement kilns .
Two Texas oil companies , Valero and Tesoro , provided much of the funding to qualify Proposition 23 for the ballot .
The yes campaign has raised roughly $ 3.4 million so far , including a $ 100,000 donation from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association .
The no campaign has raised roughly $ 2.5 million , with contributions from the Natural Resources Defense Council , the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and others .
On Monday , Tom Steyer , founder of Farallon Capital﻿ , a $ 20 billion hedge fund in San Francisco , announced he will donate $ 5 million to the no campaign and co-chair it with former Reagan administration Secretary of State George Shultz .
The official summary of the measure that voters will see on their ballots reads as follows :
“ Suspends air pollution control laws requiring major polluters to report and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming , until unemployment rate drops to 5.5 percent or less for full year . ”
The taxpayers association lawsuit filed Tuesday says that language violates state election laws because it is biased .
Specifically , the lawsuit contends that the measure would not suspend air pollution control “ laws ” because other greenhouse gas laws and smog laws would remain unaffected if it passes .
The lawsuit also alleges that the ballot summary is inaccurate when it says that AB 32 affects “ major polluters , ” because in the view of the taxpayers group , it will affect thousands of businesses .
The lawsuit , which names Brown , Secretary of State Debra Bowen and state printer Kevin Hannah , asks for new language .
It suggests : “ Suspends state law that requires greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020 , until California ’s unemployment drops to 5.5 percent or less for four consecutive calendar quarters . ”
The coalition in favor of the measure includes the California Republican Party , U.S. Rep . Tom McClintock and the California Manufacturers and Technology Association .
Opponents include the Sierra Club , League of Women Voters , PG&E , Google , Applied Materials and SunPower .

NEWARK  Returning to New Jersey for his 30th high school reunion , DeFarra Gaymon had the kind of life one would not mind describing to old friends : he was a C.E.O. , married , father of four .
But Mr. Gaymon , who was in the Chess Club , the French Club , the Italian Club and the student coalition at Montclair High School , never made it to the party on Friday night at the Crowne Plaza Meadowlands .
Instead , as other members of the class of 1980 were collecting their name tags , Mr. Gaymon , known as Dean , lay dying at the University Hospital in Newark , having been shot in the chest by a police officer in Branch Brook Park , a few miles away .
On Tuesday , the acting Essex County prosecutor gave the first detailed , public description of what happened in the wooded park that night , saying that the officer , who had tried to arrest Mr. Gaymon , 48 , over lewd behavior , fired in self - defense .
The prosecutor , Robert D. Laurino , said that Mr. Gaymon assaulted the officer , a 29 - year - old member of the Essex County Sheriff ’s Department , tried to flee and then , when cornered , attempted to disarm the officer .
Mr. Gaymon ’s family released a statement that said , in part , “ We know that the police killed an innocent man , with no history of or disposition towards violence . ”
A man who answered the phone at the family ’s home in Suwanee , Ga. , said no one there had more to say .
STOCKHOLM , Sweden —
As the waters rush together in a torrent , the fresh is drawn toward the salty in a chemical reaction that creates pressure powerful enough to move turbines .
For now , they are little turbines .
But they demonstrate the enormous potential for generating energy where river meets sea .
When researchers at the Norwegian Institute of Technology ( NIT ) started the hunt for new and revolutionary power sources more than a decade ago , they turned to their country ’s 155,000 miles of coastline .
In 2009 , Crown Princess Mette - Marit inaugurated the world ’s first seawater power plant , by drinking a cup of tea boiled in a kettle fuelled by osmosis — or , more precisely , osmotic power .
“ The potential could cover 50 percent of the current energy consumption of the European Union , ” said Stein Erik Skillhagen , director of the seawater power plant that sits on a fjord 37 miles south of Oslo .
The plant uses osmosis to generate electricity : Freshwater and saltwater are guided into separate chambers divided by an artificial membrane , where the freshwater is drawn toward the seawater .
That exerts pressure on the saltwater chamber , and that pressure moves turbines that generate electricity .
“ The seawater draws the freshwater toward it , and reaches balance between the two fluids , ” said Skillhagen .
“ This increases the seawater level , producing pressure . ”
The concept of osmotic power was discovered in the 1970s by American chemical engineer Sidney Loeb of the University of California , Los Angeles .
He died in 2008 , one year before his invention finally was translated into the world ’s first seawater power plant .
NIT has partnered with Statkraft , the Norwegian state - owned energy company .
Statkraft is Scandinavia ’s third - largest energy purveyor , producing 43 terawatt hours a year .
The seawater facility produces a very small amount of power : four kilowatts , enough to power a coffee maker .
But by 2012 the target is 25 megawatts , the same as a small wind farm that can electrify 30,000 households .
The main draw of osmotic power is that there are virtually no side effects from using it to generate electricity — no pollution and no drag on resources .
Proponents claim the seawater energy source has almost unlimited potential .
It just needs a coastline close to a lake or a river .
But all alternative energy solutions bring out skeptics , and seawater power is no exception .
Three criticisms have been raised : seawater power is expensive because of the advanced technology and pricey membranes ; the membranes ( mostly of polyethylene plastic ) remain inefficient ; and the small number of membrane manufacturers poses a business threat .
Statkraft claims it can break even if the electricity price reaches at least $ 100 a megawatt hour , but the current Norwegian price is not more than $ 57 .
Statkraft also admits that the membranes need to be five times more efficient than they are now .
And since the seawater power - plant market still is very limited , there are too few membrane manufacturers to increase quality and decrease price .
Statkraft built the current power plant membranes itself .
But the plant 's boosters said that if Norwegians can successfully develop osmotic energy into a commercial hit , it can be a major breakthrough in the global energy challenge .
“ We really need to increase the speed to bring this technology into the market , ” Skillhagen said .
“ We ought to do this much quicker than we did with solar power and wind power .
“ Seawater power is an energy source that can deliver stable amounts of energy that , for example , wind and waves cannot , because of their variation due to weather conditions .
If you combine these sources , you can get an energy mix that can be of major significance in the future , ” he added .
Following the discovery of large oil deposits in the 1970s , Norway experienced rapid economic growth .
Being the world ’s seventh - largest oil exporter and the second - largest seafood exporter , the Scandinavian kingdom ranked as the wealthiest country in the world with the largest capital reserve per capita , according to the International Monetary Fund ’s World Economic Outlook 2009 report .
But Norwegian oil production reached its peak in 2000 and has since slowly decreased , creating interest in alternative energy sources — such as the sea .

Yulia Privedyonnaya was found guilty of all charges on Wednesday and received the maximum sentence of four and a half years in prison .
MOSCOW , Russia —
In the United States , Yulia Privedyonnaya would probably be called a hippie .
She writes bad poetry and has devoted her life to developing a “ theory of happiness . ”
She believes everyone should smile more .
She shares a communal home with like - minded thinkers .
But Privedyonnaya lives in Russia .
Since she was charged with leading an illegal armed group two years ago , she has spent nearly 80 days in a rat - infested prison , one month in a psychiatric facility and endless days fighting a legal system that seems determined to imprison her .
On Wednesday , she is due to attend court one last time to see whether a judge has found her guilty of leading an illegal militant group , illegal detainment of minors and torture .
Privedyonnaya and her supporters call the charges “ ridiculous . ”
She risks up to four and a half years in prison if found guilty .
If precedent is anything to go by , she likely will be .
Less than 1 percent of all people on trial in Russia walk free .
Last year , according to Supreme Court head Vyacheslav Lebedev , 920,000 people were convicted while just 9,000 were acquitted .
Critics say that Privedyonnaya ’s case is a damning illustration that , despite President Dmitry Medvedev ’s rhetorical commitment to reforming Russia ’s notoriously corrupt and politicized court system , little has changed on the ground .
In May 2008 , six officers from the Federal Security Service , the powerful main successor agency to the Soviet - era KGB , arrived at Privedyonnaya ’s doorstep in Odintsovo , a small town on Moscow ’s outskirts .
They threw her into a van .
“ I asked them why they were taking me , the charges made no sense .
One of them said : ' To us , ideas are scarier than criminals , ' ” she said during a recent interview .
It ’s hard to imagine an FSB officer being so eloquent , but Privedyonnaya is one of the hundreds of opposition activists in Russia who speak as if the Soviet Union still existed , comparing their cases to those of prominent Soviet dissidents like Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov .
“ It ’s like in the ‘ Gulag Archipelago , ’ ” Privedyonnaya said , referring to Solzhenitsyn ’s most famous book , which exposed the vast network of Soviet labor camps .
“ Criminals were seen as in with the guards , while political prisoners were more dangerous .
The same principle exists today . ”
Privedyonnaya was thrown into prison , and kept there , without court sanction , for 77 days .
During that time , she was let outside twice for 10 minutes each time .
“ I was given a nickname — ‘ the terrorist , ’ ” she said .
“ Even the prison guards called me that and would laugh and say , “ Ah , so they thought up some charges ! ”
If you ask Privedyonnaya , she was arrested because of her increasing presence in Russia ’s opposition circles .
She had begun attending anti-Putin rallies .
She likes to point out that President Dmitry Medvedev was inaugurated days before her arrest .
Yet often in Russia , the case is more complicated .
Privedyonnaya , 36 , belongs to a group called — in all seriousness — the Poetical Association for the Elaboration for a Theory of Happiness , known by its Russian initials , PORTOS .
She joined the group in the wake of the Soviet Union ’s collapse after meeting some members and taking advantage of the classes they offered in Esperanto , the universal language that Privedyonnaya still believes will one day tie the world together .
By 2000 , the group was involved in various kinds of community service , delivering food to old people and tutoring underprivileged youth .
To fund their activities , they started a business , using trucks to deliver grocery cargo to shops .
They moved to a 3.7 acre plot of land in the village of Lyubertsy , outside Moscow .
Less than one year later , organized crime police and FSB officers raided the grounds , seizing computers and arresting four people , including the group ’s founder .
They were accused of the same three charges Privedyonnaya faces , and were all found guilty , each being sentenced to four to five and a half years in jail .
The land was confiscated .
Privedyonnaya and her supporters believe that case was linked to a new law inaugurated in the wake of the deadly terrorist bombings on four apartment blocks in Russia in 1999 that provided the premise for a newly elected president , Vladimir Putin , to launch a second war against separatists in Chechnya .
“ They needed to find a case that showed the fight against terrorism was happening , ” said Mikhail Trepashkin , Privedyonnaya ’s lawyer and former FSB officer who was imprisoned for four years after investigating the bombings and finding FSB involvement .
Privedyonnaya agrees : “ They need to fulfill a plan to ‘ catch bandits . ’
To catch real ones is dangerous — they tend to shoot — and this way they show they ’re fighting terrorism . ”
It is unclear what promoted Privedyonnaya ’s arrest eight years later .
Her captors said she had been on the country ’s wanted list since the 2000 raid .
“ They said they had been searching for me and could n’t find me , but that ’s impossible — I was on TV , on the radio , all the time . ”
Her trial began in September 2008 and has been marked by delays and what her lawyer says are procedural violations .
A first judge refused to try it , saying there was n’t enough evidence .
The prosecution called 42 witnesses , including police and FSB officers , but not one has showed up to the trial .
Several months into the hearings , prosecutors asked the judge to order a psychiatric check , arguing that the “ theory of happiness makes no sense , ” Privedyonnaya said .
She was interred at Moscow ’s Serbsky Institute , a notorious psychiatric ward that was used in Soviet times to imprison political prisoners , for 21 days .
“ They asked what books I read .
One doctor asked what I thought of Stalin , what I thought of Putin , ” she said .
Privedyonnaya ’s supporters launched an international outcry .
Amnesty International began a letter - writing campaign .
The psychiatric hospital eventually found that she was sane .
Privedyonnaya thinks only similar public pressure could help her at Wednesday ’s hearing , yet she fully understands that a guilty verdict is the most likely outcome .
“ There are lots of guilty verdicts in Russia , so as not to shame the investigation , ” she said .
“ I will bring a suitcase with me to the court . ”
Supporters held a rally in central Moscow on Monday .
Privedyonnaya ’s case also speaks to the wide - reaching authority of the FSB , an organization headed by Putin before he acceded to the presidency ( a post he held for eight years before becoming prime minister ) .
Earlier this month , Putin ’s successor , Medvedev , came under harsh criticism for approving a law that increases the FSB ’s powers , allowing it , in the style of Hollywood blockbuster " Minority Report , " to warn citizens when they are suspect of having the intention to commit an unspecified crime at an unspecified future date .
Many commentators have likened the new law to a return of Soviet - era practice .
Yet Privedyonnaya ’s case illustrates just how powerful the FSB was even without such a law , which was first proposed in the wake of the Moscow metro bombings in March .
“ When federal authorities want to get at somebody , it ’s not the absence of a pertinent law that would stop them , ” said Masha Lipman , an analyst at Moscow ’s Carnegie Center .
“ Russia is not a country that is ruled by law — there is discretionary implementation of the laws . ”
Analysts worry the law may add to the FSB ’s arsenal in its fight to crack down on Russia ’s opposition .
“ This is a carte blanche for people with influence who want to persecute people for crimes of thought , ” Lipman said .
Lately I have been saving water .
I do n’t let the water run while I ’m doing dishes .
I turn off the shower when I soap up .
I do n’t pour water down the drain when I can use it for feeding my plants .
If I save a gallon a day , that ’s 1 percent of my monthly usage .
Americans use more water per capita than any other nation .
Every time we flush the toilet , we use as much water as the average person in the developing world employs for an entire day ’s cooking , cleaning , and drinking .
In parts of our own country , water shortages are an increasing problem .
Maybe I can learn new habits to reduce my daily water usage , and make a personal contribution to a national problem .
But I also have been wasting water .
I forget to turn off my sprinkler .
I put a small load into the washing machine .
Probably I squander 10 gallons for every gallon I save .
Besides , most water usage in the US goes for the production of electricity and agricultural irrigation .
Only about 10 percent of the water used in the U.S. goes to our homes .
Now my attempt to save water seems like a drop in the bucket .
How can my puny efforts to save a few drops make any difference in the global problems of resource shortages ?
It ’s easy to fall into the trap of believing that saving a few drops of water , or gasoline , is a waste of time .
But that ’s the wrong way to think about the bigger issue of conserving resources .
Just because I have n’t figured out how to stop wasting water , is no reason not to reduce where I can .
We cannot demand that industries and farmers reduce their usage unless we also are prepared to make changes in our lifestyles .
It ’s not just a question of fairness — we need to understand how our daily lives are based on the consumption of resources at a level which can not be sustained .
Whether we are considering water or petroleum or electricity , we will not be able to keep using the world ’s resources as we do today .
If we do n’t find ways to reduce consumption gradually , our children and grandchildren might be faced with critical shortages .
We do n’t know how to do this .
In fact , American per capita usage of both water and gasoline has declined very slightly since 2000 .
But it ’s not enough to just stop increasing , we have to begin serious reductions .
My experiences with water usage show me that it ’s not easy .
Our use of resources is a set of daily habits :
How we wash dishes , how we buy vehicles and drive them , how we turn lights on and off .
It ’s also about how we consume products .
It takes twice as much water to produce the food for a meat diet as for a vegetarian diet .
Every pound of beef requires over 1,000 gallons of water to produce , while a pound of potatoes or apples needs less than 100 gallons .
I ’m not suggesting that we all become vegetarians .
I do n’t want to give up my morning shower .
But if we learn more about water usage and begin to change our habits , we will be better able to figure out how to bring our consumption in line with our resources .
Meanwhile , a few simple steps can make a difference :
Turn off the tap while brushing teeth ; wash fruits and vegetables in a bowl , instead of running the water ; sweep , rather than spraying down , the driveway and sidewalk ; wash only full loads .
If we begin to think about what we pour down the drain , what we toss into the trash , we can gradually develop less wasteful habits , as families and as a nation .
Then our grandchildren will still have fresh water and we ’ll be better stewards of our beautiful earth .

There are two standard systems for determining a prescription for eyeglasses to correct refractive errors such as nearsightedness , farsightedness and astigmatism .
One is to have the patient look through a large device called a phoropter , fitted with dozens of different lenses that can be swung into place in front of each eye in various combinations , while the patient tries to read a standard eye chart on the wall ahead .
The other uses a more expensive system called an aberrometer that shines a laser into the eye and uses an array of tiny lenses to measure its characteristics , with no interaction from the patient .
Now , a team at MIT 's Media Lab has come up with a much quicker , simpler and cheaper way to get the same information — a method that is especially suitable for remote , developing - world locations that lack these expensive systems .
Two billion people have refractive errors , and according to the World Health Organization , uncorrected refractive errors are the world 's second - highest cause of blindness , affecting some 2 percent of the world 's population ; all these people are potential beneficiaries of the new system .
The team is preparing to conduct clinical trials , but preliminary testing with about 20 people , and objective tests using camera lenses , have shown that it can achieve results comparable to the standard aberrometer test .
In its simplest form , the test can be carried out using a small , plastic device clipped onto the front of a cell phone 's screen .
The patient looks into a small lens , and presses the phone 's arrow keys until sets of parallel green and red lines just overlap .
This is repeated eight times , with the lines at different angles , for each eye .
The whole process takes less than two minutes , at which point software loaded onto the phone provides the prescription data .
The device is described in a paper by MIT Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar , Visiting Professor Manuel Oliveira , and Media Lab student Vitor Pamplona ( lead author of the paper ) and postdoctoral research associate Ankit Mohan , that will be presented in late July at the annual computer - graphics conference SIGGRAPH .
" Our device has the potential to make routine refractive eye exams simpler and cheaper , and , therefore , more accessible to millions of people in developing countries , " Oliveira says .
" People have tried all kinds of things , some very clever , " as possible replacements for the heavy and expensive conventional eye - testing systems , says Mohan .
" The key thing that differentiates ours is that it does n't require any moving parts . "
The technology takes advantage of the huge improvements over the last few years in the resolution of digital displays and their widespread proliferation on cell phones , even in some of the world 's poorest countries — there are now some 4 billion cell phones in the world .
Apart from the software to run on the phone , all that 's needed is the snap - on plastic device , which Mohan says can be produced at a cost of about $ 1 to $ 2 today but could cost only a few cents in large quantities .
The device uses an optical system derived from one some team members developed last year as a way of producing tiny barcodes ( called Bokode ) that could provide a large amount of information .
Raskar explains that he had demonstrated that barcode device to many people , but when he showed it to his wife she had trouble seeing its patterns .
He quickly realized that others he had shown it to had been wearing their glasses or contact lenses , but his wife had been looking into it directly and it had revealed the imperfections in her vision .
" I said , ' Wow , maybe you do n't need such an expensive device ' " as those presently being used to test people 's vision , Raskar recalls .
The prototype system Raskar and his group developed as a result of that insight has an array of tiny lenses and a grid of pinholes that , combined with the software on the phone , " forces the user to focus at different depths " so the eye 's focusing ability can be measured .
Essentially , Raskar explains , the test works by transforming any blurriness produced by aberrations in the eye into an array of separate lines or dots instead of a fuzzy blob , which makes it easier for the user to identify the discrepancy clearly .
Rather than estimating which of two views looks sharper , as in conventional eye tests , the user adjusts the display to make the separate lines or dots come together and overlap , which corresponds to bringing the view into sharp focus .
The underlying principle is similar to that used by new " adaptive optics " systems that have recently allowed ground - based telescopes to exceed the performance of the Hubble Space Telescope ; these sometimes use the same kind of Shack - Hartmann sensors used in eye testing aberrometers .
The team will be field - testing the device in the Boston area this summer and will later test it in developing countries .
The team already has applied for a patent on the system , named NETRA ( Near - Eye Tool for Refractive Assessment ) , and team members won a prize this year in MIT 's annual IDEAS competition — a contest for inventions and business ideas that have a potential to make a significant impact in the developing world — and were semi-finalists in the 2010 student - run MIT $ 100 K Business Plan Competition .
Chika Ekeji , a student at the MIT Sloan School of Management who joined the team to help with commercialization of the system , says the group plans to launch production of the device as a for - profit company called PerfectSight , initially targeting parts of Africa and Asia .
Ultimately , they also hope to produce a more advanced version that can incorporate its own higher - resolution display and be able to detect other conditions such as cataracts , which could be sold in the developed world as well .
IT consultant Margaret McKenna is also assisting the team .
Mohan says the way new technology has made such a simple , inexpensive and portable eye - testing device possible is analogous to what has happened in the field of photography .
A century ago , he says , to have a picture taken you would go to a special studio that had large , expensive equipment , and then you would wait days to see the resulting photograph .
" Today , it 's something everyone has in their pocket , " he says .
By using high - resolution LCD displays with this system , it is potentially not only much faster than today 's standard methods , but also " potentially more accurate , " Raskar says , although that has n't yet been demonstrated .
" I 've tried it myself , and found it to be very impressive , " says Ken Perlin , professor of computer science at NYU 's Media Research Lab , who is not connected with the project .
" I think they found a real sweet spot where the right software can allow a consumer device to perform an accurate measurement of optical acuity that formerly required extremely expensive equipment . "
And ophthalmologist Francis D'Ambrosio of Massachusetts - based D'Ambrosio Eye Care says that once it is proven though clinical trials , " I feel that this type of technology could go a long way to helping people who otherwise would n't have access to eye doctors and refractive eye exams . "

Internet Privacy : Is Your Right to Privacy Threatened ?
At WordStream , we recognize that retaining privacy on the internet has become an increasingly difficult task .
We made this infographic to provide information and illustrate the internet privacy issues that continue to be a concern for online users .
Online privacy is continuously threatened , as evidenced by Facebook 's constant changes to its online privacy policies .
The default for Facebook privacy settings is no privacy at all : your data is available for all the world to see .
You can change the settings , but Facebook buries these settings and makes it difficult for users to protect their personal information .
As illustrated by our infographic , Facebook 's altering of the default privacy setting results in serious internet privacy issues as more users end up sharing more of their private information , often without realizing the changes that have taken place .
Google and Privacy : Does Street View Help Burglars ?
Google 's Street View project has also brought up an array of privacy concerns .
In one report , 57 % of people surveyed considered Google Street View a privacy intrusion on their personal rights .
Numerous photos were captured of people involved in personal or intimate moments and unsavory activities ( examples include people picking up prostitutes and couples engaging in sex ) .
Many also worry about the potential security threat that results from Google Street View .
Street View offers burglars a potential opportunity to scout out a home 's defenses and surroundings before a break - in .
Similar security issues also originally arose in regards to the protection of military bases , although Google complied with the Department of Defense 's request that Google take down content of bases .
While some European countries have laws prohibiting filming individuals on public property without consent , the law of the United States claims that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place , enabling Google Street View to continue unquestioned .
One of Google 's answers to privacy concerns has been an agreement to blur the face visibility of people appearing in Street View , allowing for some anonymity .
Privacy and Google : The Failure of Google Buzz
Google Buzz served as an example of Google privacy settings at their worst – Google Buzz , without asking , would publish personal networks for users based on the people they seemed to interact with most .
This allowed users to see who was e-mailing who and showed personal email addresses , bringing up serious Google privacy issues .
Google Privacy Concerns : The New Privacy Policy of 2012
In January 2012 , the historic search engine Google announced that it would combine the separate Google privacy policies for each of Google 's services into one , all encompassing new internet privacy policy .
This declaration was met with plenty of scrutiny by those of the general " Google is evil " mindset , bringing up numerous Google privacy issues .
While the new Google privacy policy does not allow the search engine to collect more information about users than before , it allows Google to do more with the private information collected across various Google services .
The merging of personal data allows Google to develop more comprehensive and informed results for users by taking into account their activities on YouTube , Google+ , Gmail , Web Search History , and analyzing keyword search sessions .
Many might not be bothered by this practice , and Google asserts that the collected data allows Google to deliver a more simple and accurate experience for users , such as implementing keyword analysis into the auto - complete Google suggestion tool .
However , others are fearful of threatened anonymity and do n't appreciate their personal data being used for advertising purposes .
Privacy on Google : Data is Worth Big Money
Data is extremely valuable in the advertising world , and the compiled , comprehensive user data Google will have access to under the new Google privacy settings is as good as gold because the new privacy policy allows for more targeted advertising and a better Google keyword suggestion tool .
Before the Google privacy policy change , a user 's search experience would not be influenced by the user 's previous videos watched in YouTube , and vice versa .
With the new Google privacy settings , if Google knows that a user has searched for cooking instruction keywords on the web , YouTube might display cooking videos next time a user visits YouTube .
The pay - per-click advertising implications of this could be huge .
Google privacy issues become particularly problematic in that Google is not allowing for users to refuse the new privacy mandate .
Starting March 1st , 2012 , all Google users are subject to having their data collected and compiled , whether they agree with this practice or not .
Google Privacy Online : Protecting Your Personal Data
If you are displeased with Google , the best way you can still retain some anonymity is by not logging into Google services .
You can also erase your browsing history and block Google from collecting keyword research data about your search queries .
The other problem with Google 's new privacy policy is that Google often sets the standard for other internet power players and social media platforms .
If Google is demanding collection of compiled data from users , others will do the same , making protecting your personal data and retaining internet privacy increasingly difficult .
SOPA and PIPA : Internet Privacy Under Attack
Preserving privacy on the internet has become a increasingly difficult task as users grow more comfortable with giving out their personal information , and accept the increasingly large role the internet and social media platforms play in their lives .
Thankfully , lack of privacy and rights on the internet is not a complete given – in January 2012 there was a tremendous backlash against two bills , SOPA and PIPA , which greatly threatened internet privacy and garnered tremendous news attention .
SOPA and PIPA were dangerous bills for a number of reasons , but one major internet privacy issue was that the bills would require internet service providers to check customers '
IP addresses if the customers was found to be engaged with infringing websites .
Many feared that this would eventually lead to invasive practices in which users would have all of their internet activity monitored .
Facebook vs Google Privacy
Facebook has slowly over the years opened up private user data to advertisers as a means to better monetize .
While it is possible to obfuscate personally identifiable information , the default setting of your Facebook Profile is public .
As a result , Facebook related crimes have become more and more common as criminals gain access of personal information on their targets , ranging from their home address , phone number , to even where they are based on how recent their wall posts are .
Similarly , Google has also received backlash for the invasion of privacy caused by Google Street View .
It was found that in addition to taking photographs of private property , data from unencrypted wifi connections were also collected by Google 's cars .
In both of these cases , the biggest privacy watchdogs have been government agencies and privacy advocate groups .
When the biggest names on the internet are both failing to protect its users privacy , it 's not a matter of comparing Facebook vs Google - who 's doing it better at protecting your privacy - but a matter of how you can best protect yourself .
Japanese efficiency trumps disorganised Danes : World Cup 2010
Japan used an orthodox 4 - 3 - 3 formation perfectly to beat a Danish side 3 - 1 , and won a deserved spot in the Second Round of this World Cup .
The Japanese team played a very efficient counter - attacking game , using the ball well when they had it , scoring two wonderful free kicks , and an even more wonderful team goal .
In contrast Denmark lacked invention and had little to say for themselves except a good spell of possession at the beginning of the first half , and a few shots .
Hard working Japan
Workrate and organisation were the two key differences between the two sides , something starkly shown in the stats .
The Japanese players ran further , faster and kept their shape .
Denmark seemed to fall apart after the shock Honda free kick , and in the second half their formation collapsed .
Almost every outfield Japanese player ran over 10 km during the match , whereas the Danes had very few players covering that sort of distance , indeed Nicklas Bendtner covered only 8900 m .
Pressing
The Japanese really compressed the space available , and Denmark did n’t always have that much to work with , whilst the central midfielders created congestion in the centre of the pitch .
Endo was a key man in pressing the Danish midfield , and he ran a mammoth 5 km without the ball , chasing the central midfield whenever they were in possession .
In addition Honda is not an out and out striker , more an attacking midfielder , played as front man , and his natural inclination was to get behind the ball too .
The fullbacks Nagatomo and Komano ( yellow ) played very narrow , forcing Denmark to play wider , not allowing Rommedahl and Tomasson as much freedom to cut inside as they would have liked .
Matsui and Okubo ( pink ) dropped very deep at times creating a 5 man midfield , and protecting the flanks from overloading by the Danish fullbacks .
However the Japanese fullbacks still came forward on the overlap when Japan were in attack .
Again and again there are examples of the exceptional Japanese workrate , which meant that they really covered the whole pitch .
Here they are in yellow , while the forwards are in pink .
The Danes had more possession and passed well , but to no avail .
They could not penetrate the Japanese defence , as the team was well organised .
At the other end of the pitch Japan used the ball well , attacking through their main outlet , Honda , and Matsui , who moved out further to the touchline on the right wing .
It was here that the majority of the Japanese attacks occurred ( 63 % ) .
Japan actually took the lead through a good free kick from Honda , and furthered it through a second free kick from Endo .
This put Denmark on the back foot , and made them chase the game which played into the Japanese hands .
This allowed them to play on the break and hit the Danish high line .
Danish Tactics
In the first half Denmark played a clear 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation which seemed very balanced and served them well in their previous group game , winning 2 - 1 against Cameroon .
In the second half the Danish full - backs actually played deeper than the first , whilst the two centre backs pushed up , looking to overload the centre of the park .
Denmark switched to three up front , but this only further congested the front line , and there was little movement .
The movement was poor from the Danish front three , Bendtner , Tomasson and the substitute Larsen all playing very central , in a small area of the pitch , allowing the Japanese centre backs , and defensive midfielder to pick them up easily .
The very narrow back four of Japan nullified much of the threat in the narrow front three of Denmark in the second half .
The fullbacks were pinned back because of the Japanese wide men , Matsui and Honda both working on the right flank at times .
They were also more exposed as Agger played up the field .
The front three of Larsen , Bendtner and Tomasson ( pink ) were almost helpless , waiting in attack for lofted crosses from the flanks .
It really was hit and hope at times for Denmark .
As such Denmark never looked like they were really threatening , and the hard working Japanese scored a wonderful third goal after Jon Dahl Tomasson had seen his penalty saved , but scored on the rebound .
Organisation and Workrate
The Japanese stuck to an organised defensive system , giving the Danish players no room to move , and pressuring up the pitch , constantly running and harrying .
They played with a clear front three of Honda , Matsui and Okubo , who spent a lot of time in the Danish half , and were inventive , whilst using their set piece opportunities very well .
Denmark lacked any invention , and although they changed their shape in order to push for goals this did n’t assist them , in the fact that they seemed to become more disorganised over the duration of the game , the front three becoming isolated and congested in the second half .
This Jose Mourinho - esque 4 - 3 - 3 worked for Japan , and follows a growing trend in football ; that possession is n’t everything , efficiency and workrate are also key attributes .
The Japanese team had both of these in abundance , as well as technical ability in players like Honda .

Comedian James Corden and Sir Patrick Stewart became involved in a bizarre on - stage spat at the Glamour Awards on Tuesday .
Sir Patrick criticised Corden - host of the event - for standing with his hands in his pockets , adding : " From where I was sitting , I could see your belly . "
Corden responded : " You could see my belly .
I can see you dying right now . "
The pair continued to trade insults , and several prize - winners remarked on the quarrel as they accepted awards .
After the show , Corden said : " I found it quite disappointing .
You should ask him about it but I 'm certain he 's left . "
Sir Patrick presented the film actress of the year prize to Avatar star Zoe Saldana .
Accepting her award , she said to Corden : " I like your belly but I 'd like to see Sir Patrick Stewart dying on stage any day . "
Corden then said : " I feel bad for people who have n't seen my belly . "
To huge applause , the Gavin and Stacey star lifted his T - shirt , revealing his tummy .
Referring to Sir Patrick , he said : " OK can we get a taxi really quickly please .
There 's an old man going home . "
Several stars commented on the verbal tussle .
" Entertaining "
Nowhere Boy actor Aaron Johnson said : " I love your belly .
That was intense .
I did n't know where to look . "
Singer Duffy told the crowd she thought Corden was doing a " wonderful job " and called him " highly entertaining " .
Meanwhile , Girls Aloud singer and X Factor judge Cheryl Cole was named woman of the year at the event , which took place in central London .
The star , who recently announced she was divorcing her footballer husband Ashley Cole , said : " Four or five years ago , I 'd never dreamt I 'd be here amongst so many glamorous women .
" One person I definitely have to thank is my dentist .
So thank you very much . "
Among the other winners were The One Show host Christine Bleakley , who won presenter of the year , best TV personality went to Dannii Minogue and Florence and the Machine took band of the year .
There were also trophies for Lily Allen , Ruth Jones , Billie Piper , Nicole Richie , Fearne Cotton , Alexandra Burke and Yoko Ono who won an outstanding contribution award .
The winners were voted for by readers of Glamour magazine .
So where will the work come from ?
Perhaps a better question : ...
AMAZING !
I joked about an idea like this with people … bags that could protect my camera when needed , disappear to nearly nothing when i’m using the camera ?
Inflatableness to the rescue ?!?!
Kata ABS - HD inflatable protective casing comes folded up in a pouch .
I love that they say “ When on board with your camcorder it takes approximately 1 minute to inflate , wrap up your camcorder and stow it in the over head bin . ”
So you can basically sneak on seeming like you have very little , then poof you fill the bin ?
Slightly shady .
But then again , perhaps you can use it as a flotation device in case or emergency ?
I also wonder how it handles the air pressure ?
Sadly they also say “ This is inflatable protection not a camcorder bag , so while on the go use the camcorders strap or handle to carry and upon arriving at your destination it should be deflated and packed away in your working bag . ”
I ’d love a purse / messenger bag fitting version for my dslr for those emergencies if i had to pack it in my check in , or let someone else handle my bags … see more images on the next page !

Any experienced homeowner can regale you with stories of hiring contractors .
The stories almost always seem to fall into two neat categories " Look at what a great job they did ! " and " Let me tell you about the time the guy put the back hoe through my garage .... "
We 've experienced both ourselves , so here 's our handy guide to hiring help around the house so that all your stories can begin like " You need a new roof ?
Let me tell you about this fantastic roofer I hired ! "

A Cheap Checkup Is Better Than a Costly Repair
Everything fails .
From your air conditioner to refrigerator to the mortar holding the bricks of your front walk together , everything has a failure point — Great Pyramids of Giza ?
Not looking so new anymore , are they ?— and the more aware of this you are the less likely you are to be caught off guard with a huge repair .
Photo by somegeekintn .
You do n't want to be forced to pick a contractor or repair man hastily just because an emergency repair is breathing down your neck , so your best defense is to check for problems before they crop up .
You 'll have time to carefully pick someone to do the work instead of saying " You can repair the septic tank tomorrow ?
Oh thank God ! " and hoping for the best .

Now would be a great time to get out a piece of paper and make a list of all the " systems " in your house and how old they are .
When was your roof installed ?
How old is your furnace ?
When was the AC unit last serviced ?
That 25 year old furnace might still be going strong today but it 's well into its end of life .
A checkup from a qualified professional on the major parts of your home like the roof and the heating / cooling system is radically cheaper than an emergency visit when they fail .
Although the guide below is lengthy , if you start early and take it one step at a time , you 'll be rewarded with dependable contractors and great work .
That 's a much preferable situation to furiously calling people in the Yellow Pages and hoping somebody can get out and fix things up that day .

Research , Research , and Research Some More

If you 've heeded the advice above and identified a problem area that could use some work , you 've got a nice big window of time to start researching contractors .
Even if you 're dealing with a looming problem there are still quite a few resources and methods you can use to find a good contractor .

Get Recommendations : Start with friends , family , and local businesses that would have contact with the contractors in the field you need work in .
Ask family members in the area if they know a good contractor in the field .
Ask your neighbors — they likely have similarly constructed homes of a similar age and are dealing with the same things you 're dealing with .
Stop by local businesses and ask for a few references .
If you need an electrician , for example , stop by the local electrical supply shop and ask around .
One of the best ways to get a good reference from a local business is to ask in a way that allows the person to respond in a positive way without having to bad mouth anyone .
Do n't ask who to avoid , ask instead " I need an electrician to rewire my garage .
You know a lot of electricians in the area , would you mind giving me the name of a couple you 'd hire to work on your own home ? "
A question phrased like that personalizes it and gives the person you 're asking a metric to rank the contractors against .

Check for Complaints :
The list of recommendations you compile is just a starting point .
Recommendations in hand , next you 'll want to hit up the Better Business Bureau .
Search for the local Bureau and check to see if there are any outstanding complaints against the contractor .
While you 're at it , check your local Chamber of Commerce and Department of Consumer Affairs — the two prior links will take you to search engines for local divisions of the respective groups .
Ideally you 'll find no complaints lodged against the contractor you want to hire .

Check Licensing and Permit Requirements :
Before you start calling contractors , you need a little background information .
Call your city or municipality and check what a contractor needs to work in your area .
Even if city employees have a reputation for being a little gruff , they 're more than happy to help someone who is taking the time to make sure things are done right .
Ask simply " I 'm going to hire someone to rewire my garage .
What are the requirements for an electrician working in this city and what permits will we need ? "
You 'll know what to ask the contractor , and you 'll get a sense of who is trying to pull a fast one when they say " Nahhhh , we do n't need to worry about that . "
Contacting the Contractors and Getting Quotes

Once you 've done your research , you 'll have a list of contractors who passed the recommendation / checkup stage .
Now 's the time to start calling .
Do n't be afraid to ask lots and lots of questions .
Most of the issues that could blow up in your face later in the game can be prevented altogether by asking lots of questions early on .

Getting Background Information : Ask about insurance .
You can't afford to have someone doing work on your home without insurance .
If they get injured or destroy your property and they are n't insured , the bill comes to you .
Do n't feel bad being firm on a request for proof of insurance .
Ask how many employees they have , ask about who will be doing the work .
Depending on the field and the kind of work being done , it 's possible the supervisor has all the credentials but the workers do n't .
Advertisement
Meet with the Contractor :
Have multiple contractors come out and see where the work will be done and what you expect .
Communicate what you need as clearly as possible to the contractor to decrease any chance of miscommunication and wasted time and money .
Pay close attention to how the contractor conducts himself .
For example , I was meeting with a contractor just last week and when I told him I needed a quote for my insurance company , his immediate reply was " So are you actually going to get the work done or what ? "
He did n't even let me finish and say " ... because I want to get the quote to them today to start the work . "
That one comment cost him the job because I do n't have time to deal with that kind of attitude , especially when the person will be doing expensive work on my home .
If you get a bad feeling about any part of the process , get a new contractor .

Get Quotes : Always get quotes and detailed estimates in writing .
Never accept anything like " Yeah it should run you about X... " because verbal contracts are worthless in court should things go terribly wrong .
Insist on detailed estimates and that even the gray areas of the pricing are detailed .
In some fields it 's impossible to perfectly estimate cost , especially if the contractor wo n't be able to get a better look at it until work has started .
But it 's not unreasonable to get an over - run percentage in writing where the contractor states that while the job may run over it wo n't be more than 15 % of the estimate he 's given you .

It 's enormously helpful during the quote - gathering stage of the game to use a spreadsheet to keep track of everything .
The larger the job the larger number of items to track and different styles of quoting and quote sheets can be confusing .
A simple spreadsheet that lists things like parts , labor , and time estimates can help you easily compare apples to apples when you 're reviewing quotes and help you ask important questions like " Why are you using 50 % less materials than the other three contractors I 've gotten quotes from ? "
Make sure to be consistent when talking to each contractor so that each set of quotes is consistent in regard to what you want done and what materials you want .
Ask for References :
If a contractor can't give you at least three people to vouch for the quality of his work you 're in trouble .
If applicable to the kind of work you 're having done — landscaping , large - scale remodeling — ask to see photos of past work .
Contact the references and if the size and cost of the job merits it , ask if you can see the work in person .

Avoiding Scams and Outright Ripoffs :
At this point in the game if you 've done all the research , checked up on the contractor , gotten references , and so on , the chances of you getting scammed are nearly zero .
Still it pays to be aware of the big danger signs when it comes to home - repair scams .
If you 're talking to contractors and the pricing seems too good to be true , it probably is .
Either you 're about to get ripped off or they 're going to use such sub - par materials that you 'll wish they 'd just taken the money instead .
Never hire anyone who uses high pressure sales techniques , like insisting that a special for new siding is only good for the next 24 hours .
Never hire someone who will only accept cash and does n't want to use a contract .
Finally , never hire someone who insists you get the permit for them .
In nearly every area the person who takes out the permit is the one responsible for compliance .
If your name is on the permit and the work crew totally screws up , you 're the one who will be slapped with all the fines .
Never take out a permit for a contractor .

What to Do While the Work Is in Progress

Once you 've found a contractor that checks out and you feel good about , it 's time to get the work started .
There are several key things you can do during the actual getting - things - done phase of the process to make life easier and protect yourself if things go wrong .
Photo by Frerieke .
Communicate :
You know when the wrong time to tell the construction crew that the stone is the wrong color is ?
Right after they 've tapped in the keystone and come up to you with the final bill .
Stay on top of the project .
When something does n't look right , bring it up as soon as you notice it .
There is n't a construction process around that is easier to fix later rather than sooner .
Frequent check - ins will ensure the work is done just the way you want it .
Advertisement
Keep a Log and Photograph Frequently :
Make a note every day of the work that is done — or not done !— and take photographs .
Not only is it fun to have pictures of a big project as it unfolds , but should things sour between you and the contractor it will be invaluable to have a clear record of the work being done and photographs of any damage or poor construction materials / techniques being used .
Photo by Mike Baird .
Advertisement
Get Any Changes in Writing :
If any major changes are made to your project , ask to get the new changes in writing .
Little things like moving some outlets or changing the type of sealant used usually do n't merit a new contract .
Adding a new level to a deck definitely merits one .
Pay as You Go : Reputable contractors do not demand all the money up front .
If a contractor insists that you pay a large deposit or the total bill before the work even starts , then she or he is not a good contractor .
A 10 - 15 % deposit to start the job is reasonable , but you should never be asked to pay for raw materials .
A reputable contractor will have good credit and an account with his suppliers .
Advertisement
Do n't Be Afraid to Fire Your Contractor : People have a strong aversion to firing contractors .
Do n't be afraid to fire a contractor who is n't listening to you or is doing a poor job .
Once they are totally done with the work and they 've sent you the bill , it 's a huge pain to get everything fixed .
It 's OK to cut your losses when things are still salvageable and get someone better qualified out there .
Keep in mind that once you 've signed a contract for work you can't simply stop paying someone and insist they leave , but dismissing a contractor because the work is not satisfactory , they 've damaged your property , or they 've shown up to do the work inconsistently are all perfectly acceptable reasons for firing your contractor .

A Happy Contractor
Is an Efficient Contractor :
If you 're a great client , you 'll be the one your contractor wants to work the hardest for and take the best care of .
If you 're courteous , ask questions while still respecting the wisdom and experience he 's brought to the job , and make sure the workers are comfortable , that effort will go a long way towards everyone putting in 110 % on your job site .
Two years ago I had a new roof put on my house in searing 90 F + heat .
I made sure there was a cooler with water and sports drinks out on the driveway every day packed to the top .
The guys on the roofing crew said I was the first homeowner that had ever even asked if they were thirsty , let alone made sure they had anything to drink .
Sure you could argue that it's their job to make sure they 're well hydrated but the cooler and the sports drinks cost me next to nothing and showed I cared about them and a safe work environment .

Research newly published lists the most overpopulated countries .
When we talk about " overpopulation " ( as opposed to population size ) , we are referring to the link between the human population and its environment .
Therefore , it 's not just the size or density of the population that matters , but how that population relates to sustainable resources .
The Overpopulation Index is thought to be the first to rank countries by these criteria -- looking at how dependent they are on other countries , and whether they consume more than they produce .
Here 's the top ten :
According to these figures , the world as a whole is overpopulated by two billion .
The geographical location of countries deemed overpopulated is interesting -- there are nine Middle Eastern countries in the top 20 , and eight European .
Despite popular perceptions of China and India , these countries come in much lower , at 29th and 33rd , respectively .
This shows , again , that population size or density is not the key measure .
The UK comes in at a slightly less respectable 17th .
Its self - sufficiency rating is 25.8 per cent , meaning that Britain could only support a quarter of its population -- about 15 million -- if it had to rely on its own resources .
It 's worth noting at this point that overpopulation is a hotly contested issue .
The index was compiled by the Optimum Population Trust , which advocates a voluntary " stop at two " policy on children in the UK , and has lobbied for stricter controls on immigration , saying that " immigration has brought no overall benefit to the UK " .
I wo n't get into these debates here -- you can read Philippe Legrain 's excellent critique of the " Britain is full up " argument if you want the other side of the story on that particular point .
The key point here is sustainability .
Even if population growth were to level off in the UK , we would still , by these measures , be unable to support ourselves unless the population shrank drastically , or food production grew .
A situation where all imports disintegrate is unlikely , but improving food sustainability can only be a good thing .

I had a ham radio license as a kid .
I would spend hours with a pair of headphones on listening for weak signals from around the world .
It was exciting to have the chance to have a brief conversation with someone in Europe or Asia or the Middle East .
Picking out the faint signals from among the static made the world feel like a big and mysterious place .
The world seems smaller now .
The internet allows you to email , chat , and converse face - to - face with people all over the world with little more than a computer and some free software .
Cheap air travel makes it easy to fly almost anywhere in the world .
At first , chatting with someone from another country is just an interesting experience .
Even beyond language barriers , there are huge cultural differences that are immediately evident .
If you have to do more than just have a brief conversation with someone , then these cultural differences can be very difficult to overcome .
This is a particular problem for people who have to do business with people all over the world .
A paper by Lynn Imai and Michele Gelfand in the May , 2010 issue of Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes examines the skills people need to succeed in negotiations with people from other cultures .
They explore the concept of cultural intelligence .
Over the past 20 years , it has become clear that people have lots of different types of skills .
There is no single .
There is fluid intelligence that seems related to people 's ability to succeed in school .
There is , which relates to people 's ability to discern and understand other people 's emotional state .
Cultural intelligence involves a few key factors .
One important factor is people 's to want to acknowledge the differences between people from other cultures .
Some people want others to adapt to them , while other people really want to understand how people from other cultures think differently than they do .
Another key element is the set of behavioral skills that people have that allow them to interact with people from other cultures effectively .
The authors do two interesting things in this paper .
First , they use a variety of measures to demonstrate that cultural intelligence is distinct from other things like emotional intelligence or the basic personality of ( which measures how strongly people are open to new experiences ) .
Second , they demonstrate that this cultural intelligence matters .
In particular , cultural intelligence can influence people 's effectiveness when negotiating with people from another culture .
They paired up Americans and East Asians to participate in a negotiation task .
In this setting , the participants played the role of individuals trying to set up a business venture that combined two stores into one location .
Performing this negotiation successfully meant that the pair needed to find some compromises and also to find some outcomes that would be to the mutual benefit of the people negotiating .
Of interest , cultural intelligence did influence how well people did in the negotiation .
When both members of the pair were low in cultural intelligence , they tended to do quite poorly .
The performance of the pair improved with the lower cultural intelligence score of the participants .
That is , it was not enough to have one person in the pair who had high cultural intelligence .
Negotiations were most effective when both members of a pair were both high in cultural intelligence .
Of interest , people 's motivation to understand other cultures was particularly important for success in negotiation .
An open question from this paper is whether cultural intelligence is a relatively fixed trait of people or whether it is something that can be learned .
It seems likely that people can improve their cultural intelligence .
As they spend more time with members of other cultures , people 's motivation to learn about other cultures will increase and their base of skills for conversing with people from other cultures will also improve .
The world has become a smaller place , but that creates a tremendous opportunity to learn .

Longevity of cells could be linked to levels of cellular pumps that get rid of toxic cell products .
Yeast cells that lack multidrug resistance proteins produce fewer daughters .
Carolyn Larabell , University of California , San Francisco , and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
A family of proteins that pump molecules across the cell membrane may help to explain why yeast cells , and perhaps the cells of other organisms , are not able to go on producing copies of themselves forever .
The same proteins may also partly explain how stem and cancer cells keep dividing .
Yeast cells , much like our own cells , have a finite ability to reproduce themselves .
A ' mother ' cell can only produce 20 - 30 ' daughters ' before it loses the ability to replicate and dies .
Scientists have proposed a number of explanations for why this might be , but they have yet to pin down the exact mechanism .
The latest study , published today in Nature Cell Biology , implicates a family of proteins called multidrug resistance proteins1 .
The authors say the finding may also help to explain stem cells ' ability to keep replicating .
Multidrug resistance ( MDR ) proteins are best known for helping cancer cells expel anticancer drugs — hence their name — but they also ferry compounds in and out of normal cells .
Rong Li and colleagues at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City , Missouri , found that yeast lacking certain MDR proteins have a shorter reproductive lifespan ; they produce fewer daughter cells .
Yeast engineered to contain more of these pumps , however , can produce more daughters .
Scientists have long used the single - celled baker 's yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) as a model for studying ageing .
Its cells do n't divide like skin cells or gut cells , however .
Division is asymmetric and small new cells ' bud ' off the mother cell , giving rise to a ' mother ' and a ' daughter ' that are n't identical .
Previous studies have shown that , during division , the mother conserves damaged proteins and other cellular components that could prove harmful to the bud .
" The mother is very altruistic and keeps all this bad stuff to herself , " Li says .
Indeed , some research groups have posited that the mother 's finite reproductive capability is the result of accumulating these damaged and toxic compounds .
Pump action
Li and her colleagues , however , had another hypothesis .
They found that yeast division also results in an unequal distribution of MDR proteins .
The mother cell retains the original MDR proteins while the bud gets young , newly formed MDR proteins .
Because the mother 's supply is never replenished , she has to rely on the pool of MDR proteins that she 's born with , Li says .
“ The mother is very altruistic and keeps all this bad stuff to herself . ”
Over time these proteins decay .
Some lose only part of their function ; others may stop working altogether .
Li and her colleagues measured the decay rate and developed a model to better understand the dynamics of MDR proteins during a cell 's life .
The model suggested that these proteins lose most of their function just as the cell is coming to the end of its reproductive life .
We started to get the idea that " maybe these proteins are what 's limiting the lifespan of these cells , " Li says .
If the loss of MDR proteins does contribute to ageing , then cells that can't make these proteins should have shorter lifespans .
To test this idea , the researchers created three mutant strains of yeast .
Each one lacked a gene coding for a particular MDR protein .
Losing one MDR gene reduced the number of daughters a cell could produce by between 11 and 66 % , depending on which gene the researchers turned off .
Next the researchers added an extra copy of each gene .
" This is really a very small variation in expression level , " Li says .
Still it had an effect .
The researchers saw a 10 - 20 % increase in lifespan .
Stem - cell link
The new mechanism does n't necessarily preclude other pathways that have been linked to ageing , such as the build - up of toxins .
MDR proteins help rid cells of toxins , so as they begin to fail , toxins could accumulate even faster .
" It 's really two sides of the same coin , " Li says .
The MDR pathway might also be tied to the effects of calorie restriction .
Restricting dietary calorie intake seems to be a sure - fire way of increasing longevity in many organisms .
If you limit metabolism , that could reduce " the generation of a lot of the toxic compounds , " Li says .
" Ageing is not just a single thing .
It 's a combination of processes that affect each other , " she adds .

Brian Kennedy , chief executive of the Buck Institute for Age Research in Novato , California , says the study " raises a new and compelling hypothesis for what 's causing ageing in yeast " .
What 's more , he adds , this family of proteins is conserved in other organisms so may be involved in the ageing process more generally .
" There 's a lot of compelling data to support the model , " he says .
Just how this finding might translate to humans , however , is not yet clear .
Stem cells also undergo asymmetric division .
The study " raises the intriguing possibility that a similar mode of regulation could influence stem - cell senescence during human ageing , " says Matt Kaeberlein , at the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle , who investigates longevity in yeast , worms and mice .
Li says the MDR mechanism might also help explain why cancer cells , many of which are stuffed with MDRs , are seemingly immortal .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The Big Bang theory has formed the basis of our understanding of the universe 's origins since it was first proposed in 1927 by Georges Lemaitre .
And for good reason : the theory is supported by scientists ' latest observations and experiments , and is based on Einstein 's widely accepted theory of general relativity .
But scientists are always on the lookout for any evidence that might suggest an alternative to the Big Bang .
The latest in this area of research comes from astrophysicists Maximo Banados and Pedro Ferreira , who have resurrected a theory of gravity from the early 20th century and discovered that a modified version of the theory may hold some surprises .
In a recent study published in Physical Review Letters , Banados and Ferreira have reconsidered the theory of gravity proposed by Arthur Eddington , a contemporary of Einstein .
Eddington is perhaps best known for his trip to the Island of Principe on the west coast of Africa in 1919 , where during a solar eclipse he observed that the Sun 's gravity does indeed bend starlight , providing one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity .
Although Eddington played a significant role in developing general relativity , during the following decades he became more interested in finding a theory to unify gravity and quantum mechanics - a task that is still being studied today .
In 1924 , Eddington proposed a new “ gravitational action ” as an alternative to the Einstein - Hilbert action , which could serve as an alternative starting point to general relativity .
In astrophysics , a gravitational action is the mechanism that describes how gravity can emerge from space - time being curved by matter and energy .
However , Eddington ’s theory of gravity only worked for empty space and did n’t include any source of energy such as matter , making it an incomplete theory .
Since Eddington ’s proposal , scientists have attempted various ways of including matter into the theory , although they have run into problems .
In this study , Banados and Ferreira have tried a new way to extend the theory to include matter by using a gravitational action called the Born - Infeld action .
In their analysis , the scientists found that a key characteristic of Eddington ’s revised theory of gravity is that it reproduces Einstein gravity precisely in the vacuum conditions ( with no matter ) , but it produces new effects when matter is added .
Due to this characteristic , the revised theory has implications especially for high - density regions , such as in the very early Universe or within a black hole .
For instance , the theory predicts a maximum density of homogeneous and isotropic space - time , which could have implications for black hole formation .
More intriguingly , the theory could lead to an entirely new view of the Universe that does n't include a Big Bang .
In Big Bang theory , the state of the Universe is a singularity in early times , meaning that the Universe was once infinitely small .
However , Eddington ’s revised theory requires a minimum length of space - time at early times , which means that the Universe could not have been a singularity .
The theory predicts that , depending on the Universe ’s initial density , it may have loitered for a long time at a relatively small size before growing large enough to be controlled by standard cosmological evolution .
Another possibility , depending on the initial conditions , is that the Universe could have undergone a bounce , resulting from the collapse of a previous Universe .
Any kind of singularity - free Universe would solve the singularity problem that has bothered scientists about general relativity , since a singularity cannot be mathematically defined .
“ Taking as a starting point what is a very old idea , we have ended up with a theory that has this very interesting property of not having singularities , ” Ferreira , a professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford , told PhysOrg.com .
“ It was unexpected and definitely not what we were looking for . ”
In the future , Banados and Ferreira hope to perform a more detailed analysis of the gravitational Born - Infeld action .
While the current study only looks at the classical behavior of the theory , there could also be quantum behavior , such as with the bounce concept .
In addition , the scientists plan to look at the possible effects of a cosmological constant , which they did not investigate here .
However , they note that the theory is still in the early conceptual stages , and has a long way to go before they know how accurate it is .
“ The alternatives to Einstein 's theory are all hypothetical possibilities , ” Ferreira said .
“ The goal is to try and find some key observational test that may distinguish between Einstein 's theory and the one we have stumbled upon . ”

NASA Finds Super - Hot Planet with Unique Comet - Like Tail
› Larger image Illustration Credit : NASA , ESA , and G. Bacon ( STScI )
Astronomers using NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed the existence of a baked object that could be called a " cometary planet . "
The gas giant planet , named HD 209458 b , is orbiting so close to its star that its heated atmosphere is escaping into space .
Observations taken with Hubble 's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) suggest powerful stellar winds are sweeping the cast - off atmospheric material behind the scorched planet and shaping it into a comet - like tail .
" Since 2003 scientists have theorized the lost mass is being pushed back into a tail , and they have even calculated what it looks like , " said astronomer Jeffrey Linsky of the University of Colorado in Boulder , leader of the COS study .
" We think we have the best observational evidence to support that theory .
We have measured gas coming off the planet at specific speeds , some coming toward Earth .
The most likely interpretation is that we have measured the velocity of material in a tail .
"
The planet , located 153 light - years from Earth , weighs slightly less than Jupiter but orbits 100 times closer to its star than the Jovian giant .
The roasted planet zips around its star in a short 3.5 days .
In contrast , our solar system 's fastest planet , Mercury , orbits the Sun in 88 days .
The extrasolar planet is one of the most intensely scrutinized , because it is the first of the few known alien worlds that can be seen passing in front of , or transiting , its star .
Linsky and his team used COS to analyze the planet 's atmosphere during transiting events .
During a transit , astronomers study the structure and chemical makeup of a planet 's atmosphere by sampling the starlight that passes through it .
The dip in starlight because of the planet 's passage , excluding the atmosphere , is very small , only about 1.5 percent .
When the atmosphere is added , the dip jumps to 8 percent , indicating a bloated atmosphere .
COS detected the heavy elements carbon and silicon in the planet 's super - hot , 2,000 - degree - Fahrenheit atmosphere .
This detection revealed the parent star is heating the entire atmosphere , dredging up the heavier elements and allowing them to escape the planet .
The COS data also showed the material leaving the planet was not all traveling at the same speed .
" We found gas escaping at high velocities , with a large amount of this gas flowing toward us at 22,000 miles per hour , " Linsky said .
" This large gas flow is likely gas swept up by the stellar wind to form the comet - like tail trailing the planet .
" Hubble 's newest spectrograph has the ability to probe a planet 's chemistry at ultraviolet wavelengths not accessible to ground - based telescopes .
COS is proving to be an important instrument for probing the atmospheres of " hot Jupiters " like HD 209458 b .
Another Hubble instrument , the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) , observed the planet in 2003 .
The STIS data showed an active , evaporating atmosphere , and a comet - tail - like structure was suggested as a possibility .
But STIS was n't able to obtain the spectroscopic detail necessary to show a tail , or an Earthward - moving component of the gas , during transits .
The tail was detected for the first time because of the unique combination of very high ultraviolet sensitivity and good spectral resolution provided by COS .
Although this extreme planet is being roasted by its star , it wo n't be destroyed anytime soon .
" It will take about a trillion years for the planet to evaporate , " Linsky said .
The results appeared in the July 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency .
NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center manages the telescope .
The Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) conducts Hubble science operations .
STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy , Inc. in Washington , D.C.
TO HELL AND BACK : Shooting victim
Been the dog is self - appointed dad to four motherless kittens , bathing them and putting them to bed .
A dog who survived being shot in the head three times has fully recovered , and now spends much of his time playing doting dad to a litter of kittens .
When Been was found , he was 10 kilograms underweight , but now the mongrel weighs a healthy 27kg and enjoys tending to four kittens who are being bottle - fed after being rejected by their mother .
After the three - week - old kittens are fed , Been licks them clean .
If they are not locked up at night , he picks them up and puts them in his basket .
" He 's just a big sook , " says his new owner Jaine Reynolds , a Nelson SPCA administrator .
Been may have been alone for days before being found in Marlborough 's Wairau Valley by a pig hunter in February with bullet holes in his head .
The only thing that reflects his sad past is a small pink scar .
Ms Reynolds said she fell in love with Been after taking him home to recover from an operation to fix the large wound .
He quickly slotted into life with his new family , becoming great mates with Ms Reynolds ' other dog Max and her two adult cats .
" He 's just a big gentle boy and does n't do anything wrong .
I was surprised with how quickly he bounced back and how trusting he is . "
Been is deaf , but Ms Reynolds believes he was born with the impairment .
She said nobody had contacted the SPCA to claim him , and he had no microchip .
It is unclear what the circumstances around the shooting were , but Ms Reynolds said it was likely that Been was shot after his previous owner got sick of him or their circumstances had changed .
After he was found and taken to the Nelson SPCA , the obedient pooch gained his name because he had " been very lucky " .
Ms Reynolds said Been was a beautiful pet with a very gentle nature .
He loved chasing rabbits , playing , sleeping in his basket and going for walks .
The flash crash on May 6 that transfixed investors — and has been the source of finger - pointing ever since — may not have originated in the canyons of Wall Street or a hedge fund manager ’s European lair .
How about Kansas ?
Futures trades by Waddell & Reed , a conservative 70 - year - old mutual fund based in Overland Park , Kan. , have been linked to the plunge , during which the Dow dropped hundreds of points in a matter of minutes .
The company was identified in a Chicago Mercantile Exchange document , according to Reuters .
In a statement , Waddell & Reed said it was among the firms that traded the stock index futures contract suspected of being a crucial link in the cascade of events leading up to the plunge that began shortly after 2:30 p.m .
“ On May 6 , as on many trading days , Waddell & Reed executed several trading strategies , including index futures contracts , as part of the normal operation of our flexible portfolio funds , ” the firm said .
“ Like many market participants , Waddell & Reed was affected negatively by the market activity of May 6 . ”
Holy hell !
The Chinese have built a life size version of Optimus Prime , the leader of the Autobots !
The statue is about 33 feet tall , and was made entirely from junk car parts .
This looks pretty freakin ' cool for being built out of junk .

Biography
Comic Book
Guy is an obese and socially incompetent man who is perhaps best known for his sarcastic quips .
He holds a master 's degree in folklore and mythology ( he translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his thesis ) .
[ 2 ]
He exhibits geeky behavior to an extraordinary and deliberately unrealistic degree , and often also makes references to obscure subjects or internet culture .
His catchphrase is the declaration , " Worst ... ( episode ) ... ever " .
He states that he is a 45 year - old virgin who lives with his parents .
[ 3 ]
Comic Book
Guy is extremely obese , to the point where his clothes barely fit over his huge stomach .
He also at one point suffered from lumbago .
Appropriate to his nickname , Comic Book Guy is obsessed with comic books , pop culture , and science fiction .
Comic Book Guy has a bumper sticker that reads " My Other Car Is The Millennium Falcon , " given to him by a Harrison Ford lookalike .
The license plate on his AMC Gremlin is NCC - 1701 , the registry number of Star Trek 's USS Enterprise .
The contents of his display case include , among other oddities , a photo of Sean Connery signed by Roger Moore and a very rare Mary Worth in which she advised a friend to commit suicide .
He also owns a T - shirt that says " C:/ DOS C:/ DOS / RUN RUN / DOS / RUN " ( Notice the incorrect usage of the forward slash .
DOS directories are listed with a backslash , so it would be " C: \DOS C : \DOS\RUN RUN\DOS\RUN " ) .
He is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa , along with Principal Skinner , Dr. Hibbert , Lisa Simpson , Professor Frink , and Lindsey Naegle .
In the episode " Beware My Cheating Bart " , he says he is a cyber bully .
In the episode Large Marge , Comic Book Guy had liposuction performed on him , so he would fit in a Superman costume .
Personality
Comic Book
Guy is a middle - aged , obese , almost fanatical comic buff and displays deep passion regarding all fictional memorabilia in general , especially science fiction to the point of complete monomania .
Sarcastic , irate and proudly geeky , Comic Book Guy does not treat anyone with kindness unless they are as passionate about comics as he is .
Most of the character 's infamy and trademarks are derived from his constant sarcastic observations , quips and distinct accent .
Comic Book Guy 's Obsessive - Compulsive fixation with comics is such that when somebody placed a Spider - Man comic inside The Spectacular Spider - Man slot , it was enough to make him angry .
He is so stressed about people 's comic book ignorance around him that it caused him to have a heart attack , while Dr. Hibbert later calls his profession as owner of a comic book store one of the most stressful jobs in the world , referring to it as the " widow - maker " ( if any [ comic book store owners ] had wives ) .
Aside from following Radioactive Man , the ongoing Hollywood movies and fast - paced internet nudity , Comic Book Guy is also a fan of Marvel and DC Comics such as Superman , Spider - Man , Batman , Fantastic Four , Hulk and many more .
He also enjoys Star Wars , Lord of the Rings , Star Trek , Game of Thrones and Japanese anime .
Comic Book
Guy owns , amongst his vast collectibles , a Hulk melon baller ( which he originally intended as a wedding gift to Skinner and Krabapel ) , a Spider - Man , The Flash , Batman , Spock and Klingon Warrior costume , several life - sized cardboard cut-outs of various Star Wars characters , Star Wars sheets and a Jar - Jar Binks figure which he sleeps with .
Comic Book Guy speaks fluent Klingon , Mordor Black Speech , has set his life on routine of the Vulcan mating ritual Pon Farr , has a restraining order on Lynda Carter and has a crush on Nichelle Nichols , Batman 's Catwoman and Get Smart 's Agent 99 .
Comic Book Guy has a massive collection of bootlegs of stolen movies , police interrogations and even ones regarding homeland security in his basement .
Comic Book Guy has a habit of stating his emotions and what is occurring or how he is feeling as it happens .
When he was having a heart attack he yelled out the symptoms ; " breath short , left arm numb " before he collapsed and yelled " ca n't go on describing symptoms any longer " .
Comic Book
Guy often states what he thinks in a matter - of - factual way such as the method listing " A , B " and using words like " correction " or " false " whenever he corrects somebody .
In addition , Comic Book Guy refers to comic books as if they were actuality , for example when Stan Lee entered the Android 's Dungeon , he proclaims " my heart is pounding like Thor 's hammer against Doctor Doom 's titanium breastplate " .
He has shown to be one of the few characters who non-directly break the fourth wall in his canon appearances .
For example in season 11 when Marge asks if the Simpsons should get a horse when Bart wanted to adopt Duncan , Comic Book Guy noted that the Simpsons already had a horse in season 3 ( even though he was not involved in that situation and did n't appear in that episode at all ) .
Comic Book
Guy treats most of his patrons cruelly and usually extorts his customers out of expensive collectibles or tricks them altogether into buying something .
For example , claiming to Milhouse , who desperately needed it , that the bathroom was only for paying customers tricks him into buying a comic before allowing him to be taken away by his father , paying five dollars for priceless unseen Star Wars memorabilia and selling Fantastic Floors under Fantastic Four .
Comic Book
Guy is quite bitter , keeping a banned list of Milhouse , Bart ( with those two being banned solely because they stopped Martha Price from unknowingly selling the aforementioned priceless unseen Star Wars memorabilia ) , Sideshow Bob , Nelson and Matt Groening in his store ( although the first two he lifted the ban on after they saved his life upon having a heart attack ) , and after being made a fool of by Tom Savini during the latter 's comic act , just prior to his heart attack , he angrily declared all the audience to be banned from his store for laughing at him .
Although he lives a solitary lifestyle and his lack of social skills prevent him from ever making headway in a relationship with a woman , Comic Book Guy proclaims before his near - certain death that a life of collecting comics and other fictions was a " life well spent ' .
Although onerous , he has had some positive elements to him .
For one thing , he willingly allowed Marge Simpson to access his recording of Abe 's breakdown at church so she could transcribe what exactly Abe said , in exchange for Homer 's long pajamas , and even attempted to aid Marge in figuring out what Grampa meant by " Epa! Epa ! " to the best of his ability .
Early life
Comic Book Guy lived in his parents ' basement in the 1980s .
He had a dog named Chewbacca ( now deceased ) .
He also went to a fat camp , which , judging by his current appearance , was unsuccessful . [ 4]
He was Moe Szyslak 's [ 1 ] first kiss .
The Android 's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop
Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android 's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop , a local comic book store .
Many of the comics and toys he sells are of very poor - quality , and often sell for very high prices .
His store is his sanctuary , where he holds some level of self - esteem , imperiously lording over pre-teen kids , like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten , using a heavily sarcastic tone .
When he was the target of mockery while trying to return the Ultimate Belt , he sighed , " I must get back to my comic book store , where I dispense the insults rather than absorb them " .
His store contains a section full of illegal videos , which include Mr. Rogers drunk , Alien Autopsy , Illegal Alien Autopsy , a top secret American nuclear war strategy session , a " good version " of The Godfather Part III , Kent Brockman picking his nose , and Ned Flanders in a police informant video , wherein he claims that Homer released a radioactive ape in his house ( although , according to Bart , Homer only let the ape into the house because the ape tricked Homer , and not out of malicious intent ) .
He later was arrested and had his store shut down temporarily because of this .
He once had to give up the Ultimate Belt ( which he won as a door prize at a Star Trek Convention ) because , as he pointed out , " the average Trekker has no use for a medium - sized belt " .
Unemployment
At a small point in the episode " Husbands and Knives " , due to a better comic book store opening across the street , it caused Comic Book Guy to go out of business , getting him to stoop to selling pretentious martial arts merchandise to children , but soon backfired after also having attempted to assassinate his competitor with his weapons .
After that , Comic Book Guy was forced to close down his comic book store and became unemployed ( which his place later turned into a females orientated gym ) .
It 's unclear how Comic Book Guy got his comic book store back as future episodes shows The Android 's Dungeon again . [ 5 ]
Similar stores
In North Haverbrook , there is a comic book shop named " Mylar Baggins " and the proprietor bears a striking resemblance to Comic Book Guy with the exception that his skin and hair are slightly darker .
He also has a deep - rooted rivalry with a store similar to his : " Frodo's of Shelbyville " .
These shops could have had the same owner , as both rival store names refer to The Lord of the Rings character Frodo Baggins .
During the Trappuccino crisis , Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting is a " life well spent " .
[ 6 ]
In the episode " Husband and Knives " a bigger and better comic book store by the name of " Coolsville Comics & Toys " is placed right across the street from The Androids Dungeon .
The store is run by a man named Milo , who is the exact opposite of Comic Book Guy .
Brief Fame
In " Homer the Whopper " , Comic Book Guy created the comic book series Everyman .
He apparently created 278 issues , including the controversial issue with the death of Marmaduke .
However , he was reluctant to self - publish them initially because he feared that he'd be mocked by the internet community for his comics .
While trying to exasperate Comic Book Guy by feigning complete ignorance on the history of Spiderman , Bart and Milhouse stumbled upon a draft of an issue of Everyman that he was working on .
Comic Book
Guy then learned that Bart and Milhouse actually liked the comic , and after a bit of convincing , he decided to self - publish .
The comic 's popularity started to soar as a result , with a movie project starting for the Summer Market .
Some movie executives requested to make Everyman into a movie .
Comic Book
Guy was reluctant to allow them to work with the movie , especially as the same movie company apparently ruined the Stratego movie for him .
He eventually relented , but only under the condition that he picked the person who will portray Everyman .
When they refused that condition , he opened the door to the store , implying that he wanted them to leave , until they agreed to that condition , commenting that being " hard - balled by Hollywood " is the closest thing to a physical sport that he could ever do .
He later explains that he wants a " complete loser " to portray Everyman .
He then picks Homer Simpson for the part , after the latter accidentally walked into the store , not realizing it was closed for auditioning .
He then spent his time talking to people at his new , Hollywood - style house about what it is like to be a producer , and adopting a Cambodian Orphan named Prius .
However , when the movie was going over budget and Homer ended up gaining an eating disorder due to his fitness coach abandoning him for Turtle ( to the extent that he could n't even get out of his trailer without it being sawed off ) , he tried to end production of the film , but ended up being thrown out by security into a dumpster with disgraced executives .
He later ended up sacrificing any chance at another Everyman movie being made by voicing his honest opinion that the Everyman movie was the worst movie ever .
It is unknown if he still worked on his comics after this .
Relationships
Comic Book Guy was once married — in an online role - playing game .
He and his Internet wife contemplated having children , but that would have severely drained his power crystals .
He was shown paired with Mindy Simmons , the woman who had briefly tempted Homer , during a mass - marriage that occurred when a cult took over Springfield , and presumably the two were wed in the mass ceremony . [ 7 ]
While part of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield , he proposed plans to limit breeding to once every seven years ( a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating , called Pon Farr ) , commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most , but for him , " much , much more " .
Comic Book Guy also has a gay cousin named Comic Book Gay .
Comic Book Gay is interested in " certain types of comics " and sounds just like Comic Book Guy .
Agnes Skinner
He was a virgin well into his forties when he became romantically involved with Principal Skinner 's mother Agnes .
Chief Wiggum and Eddie were notably repulsed when he and his officers stumbled upon the couple " in the act , " ( having sex ) with the former even quickly offering when arresting him for pirated videos that he 'll reduce his sentence if he " puts on some pants , fast ! "
Edna Krabappel
He later dated Edna Krabappel [ 8 ] and was shown with the Superman logo tattooed on his upper right buttock ( which is interesting , as in the Comic Book Guy 's Book of Pop Culture , he states that he hates Superman ; it 's possible that considering the location he does n't consider this to be a compliment ) .
While at the Springfield Bi-Mon - Sci-Fi-Con , Comic Book Guy meets a woman to whom he is attracted and asks , " How do you feel about forty - five year old virgins who still live with their parents ? "
However , this relationship does not progress any further when he refuses to comb the Sweet Tarts out of his beard .
Kumiko
In the episode " Married to the Blob " , he met Kumiko , a Japanese mangaka , and later married her .
Non-Canon Appearances
The contents of this article or section are considered to be non-canon and therefore may not have actually happened / existed .
The Simpsons Road Rage
Comic Book Guy has a voice only cameo during the credits , where he , predictably , makes scathing comments about the people who worked on the game .
The Simpsons Hit and Run
Comic Book Guy appears in a few missions .
He first appears in the first mission of the third level , " Nerd Race Queen . "
Lisa , trying to find Bart , tries to ask whether he had seen him .
Comic Book Guy , however , is unwilling to answer her question , as he's more concerned with trying to get the last issue of the Itchy & Scratchy Adventures comic ( which , according to him , is a very controversial issue as the two finally kiss ) , and promises that he 'll aid her in her dilemma if she can assist him .
After getting it , Lisa asks whether he can tell her Bart 's location now , but he insists that they return to the The Android 's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop in order to put the issue in a mylar bag before it " deteriorates into near - mint condition . "
Upon doing so , she then pressed the issue further , with Comic Book Guy then stating that he may have seen Bart at the Noise Land Video Arcade , and then states that video games are a waste of money , while he considers bidding $ 1,000 Itchy and Scratchy corn cob holders online to be a " terrific , terrific expense . "
He also appears as the bonus mission for the fourth level .
In it , he asks for Marge 's help in retrieving his gifts to Agnes Skinner from Springfield Elementary School due to Principal Skinner intercepting the gifts and locking them away there , presumably in an attempt to keep them apart , due to her refusing to go out to mock schoolchildren for this reason .
He reluctantly admits that he can't do it by himself because his obvious lack of mobility due to his immense weight .
When Marge , sympathizing with his being husky , asks for a favor from him in return for her helping him , he enthusiastically agrees to it .
After retrieving her belongings ( Two heart boxes that presumably contained chocolate , two sets of false teeth , two sets of heart underwear , a tombstone , and a pair of slippers ) , and after returning the " laundry " , he then , after expressing joy at hearing Agnes ' sneer again , keeps his end of the bargain by supplying her his phone number if she wants to hear his theories on how Krusty jumped the shark .
Comic Book Guy drives a Gremlin , which can be used if selected .
He later appears in the prelude to the second mission of the seventh level .
When Homer meets up with Comic Book Guy ( whom he refers to as " Smelly Sam " ) and asks what 's going on , Comic Book Guy explains that the alien craft is using a tractor beam to suck up any trespassers to their doom , while maintaining they were horrible special effects despite it being real .
Homer then asks about the black car , with Comic Book Guy explaining that , to his certain knowledge from Sci - fi movies , it is an advanced alien probe , and dismisses Homer since he wants to spend his last hours on Earth doing what he does best : Complain about movies on the internet .
Homer then mutters that the gift of life was wasted on him .
Comic Book
Guy then advises that Homer buy a Zombie Car , as it would protect him from the zombies , although it comes at the cost of needing human brains to operate as a " slight drawback " , with Homer quipping he 's got " plenty of those . "
The Simpsons ' Game
Comic Book
Guy appears throughout the game to point out various video game cliches that the player can unlock by performing certain actions .
Jeff tells
Bart that the cave near the museum is the appropriate setting for a superhero origin story .
He later thanks Bart for saving the museum .
He later says that he wo n't lose in the eating contest especially not to Homer .
He also appears as one of the contestants in the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in the level Around the World in 80 Bites , and sadly deals with his defeat by snacking .
He then tells Bart about The Loggers and tells Bart that it 's cool that he saved the trees but it 's not like they 're Ents .
Later he was playing Grand Theft Scratchy online and is defeated by Lewis .
He says l that Aquaman has prevented dolphins from attacking the pier and gets emailed by LonleyMoe15 that Lard Lad is attacking the city and expects Zombies to attack the mall but it 's aliens .
He also appears in the form of a gang of sumo wrestlers ( also cliched ) in Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game .
One of the Comic Book Guy sumo wrestlers make a final appearance in the Game Over level as one of the icons God uses to defeat the Simpsons as the family destroy his Hii .
The Cleveland Show
He had a cameo appearance in The Cleveland Show episode Hot Cocoa Bang Bang voiced by Hank Azaria , where he simply states " Worst cameo ever " .
In the second segment of " Treehouse of Horror X " , Comic Book Guy kidnaps Lucy Lawless thinking that she is Xena who has styled himself as a villain called " The Collector " , kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate .
Lawless goes to remove the breastplate , but when hundreds of fans raise their cameras to photograph her breasts she stops with a statement of " Maybe later . "
He takes her to his lair , where he puts her in an aluminized Pet film bag for " safekeeping " and imprisons her in a room of other similarly - captured celebrities such as Yasmine Bleeth and Tom Baker .
Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl burst into The Collector 's hideout , but he manages to knock Clobber Girl out with a working phaser gun that was fired only once to prevent William Shatner from releasing another album .
He wastes all his remaining shots on Stretch Dude , who splits in half and does somersaults to avoid the rays .
The Collector hurls his empty raygun at Stretch Dude , hitting him on the forehead and knocking him out as well .
He suspends the drowsy duo over a vat of bubbling Lucite , slowly lowering them towards certain doom and mocks them , saying " Goodnight , Retch Dude and Slobber Girl .
Sweet screams ! "
Lucy Lawless , still in her plastic restraint , lures the Collector over by pretending to be attracted to him .
When he 's close enough she grabs his lips and then attacks him with Kung Fu moves .
Stating that he fell for a " ruse so hackneyed , it would make Stan Lee blush ! " , the Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace and ignites the blades .
Lucy reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging and it is now no longer a collectible .
He backs away in horror and plummets into the Lucite , eventually emerging to strike a dramatic death pose ( imitating a Lorne Greene pose from Battlestar Galactica ) before the plastic hardens around him .
In the second segment of " Treehouse of Horror XIV " , Jonathan Frink Sr. takes his butt , however he somehow survives this .
In the final segment of the " Treehouse of Horror XXIV " , he is seen as a snail during the closing credits .
In " Treehouse of Horror XXVI " , he is listening to Kumiko in " Homerzilla " .
Behind the Laughter
Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok book shop who often " [ sat ] on the high stool , kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam containerful of fried clams with a lot of tartare sauce . "
Matt Groening noted that : " I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and said , ' I know who you based that comic book guy on .
It 's that comic - book guy right down the block . '
And I have to tell them , " No , it 's every comic - bookstore guy in America . "
Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy 's voice on a student who went by the name " F " , and lived in the room next door at his college .
Azaria also " loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they 're his peers . "
A long - running gag on the show was never to reveal the character 's name , with other characters referring to him as " Comic Book Guy " .
Finally , in the February 6 , 2005 episode , " Homer and Ned 's Hail Mary Pass , " Comic Book Guy nonchalantly told Ned Flanders , " My name is Jeff Albertson , but everyone calls me ' Comic Book Guy ' . "
Showrunner Al Jean remarked , " That was specifically done to make people really mad .
We just tried to pick a generic name .
It was also the Super Bowl show , so we did it so the most people possible would see it . "
Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be " obsessed and tormented by " Lois Lane , but was out of the room when the writers named him .
Comic Book Guy has also been seen in quite a few episodes but he has had very few episodes where he is a major character .
He is rarely seen outside The Android 's Dungeon and most of his interactions are with Bart Simpson .

The call of the loon could be drowned out by the click of the keyboard at some provincial parks in Ontario , and possibly at national parks across Canada .
The agency that runs provincial parks in Ontario is experimenting with wireless Internet service at Pinery Provincial Park , near Grand Bend on Lake Huron .
It will consider adding the service in other provincial parks if campers agree it's a good idea .
“ We try to consider our visitors ' needs and wants and things change over the years , ” said John Salo , southwest zone manager for Ontario Parks .
“ It 's not 1950 , and we want to look at what their needs are . ”
The Wi-Fi service was set up on a trial basis this summer after some campers filling out comment cards said they needed to stay connected , even while getting away from it all .
“ We do encourage people to come to the parks and relax and disconnect for a day or week or two weeks , but there are some people that just need ( Internet service ) , and that sometimes is their decision point , ” said Salo .
“ We 've had people call and say they are going to a private campground like KOA because they do have wireless . ”
Parks Canada said last fall it was considering adding wireless service in some areas to help counter a steady drop in the number of visitors to national parks , but the Ontario experiment is believed to be the first to roll out the service in a public park in the country .
Parks Canada did not return calls for comment Thursday .
California has installed wireless service in all 52 state parks and says it 's been receiving praise from many visitors .
The wireless zone in Pinery Provincial Park is limited to a terrace outside the store in the middle of the park , and is not extended to campsites or into wilderness areas .
“ It ’s concentrated in one location , just at the store , which is a fairly busy location as it is , ” said Salo .
The wireless program at Pinery will be reassessed at the end of this summer and if the majority of comments are positive , wireless could be established in some other provincial parks .
“ If it 's a positive response obviously we would want to consider it seriously , but I think we’d be very selective about what parks we ’d do it in and what locations , ” said Salo .
“ Not every park has a situation like Pinery , where we have a park store with a nice flat , open area that is fairly busy and away from the campground . ”
Reaching that delicate balance between those who want to stay connected and those who go to campgrounds to get away from the very devices that connect people online will be a challenge , admitted Salo .
“ There are people that do want it and we understand there ’s people 180 degrees the other side , ” he said .

Some U.S. state and national parks — including Yellowstone National Park — do have cellular phone service , which has prompted complaints from hikers about overhearing telephone conversations on back country trails .
Installing Wi-Fi service in parks will also allow some smart phone users to access phone services in addition to Internet service .
A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland , California , during a confrontation with Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland police , police spokesman Jeff Thomason said .
The incident occurred after Oakland police received a call about 8:15 a.m. ( 11:15 a.m. ET ) of an armed man walking toward the Fruitvale BART station , according to Thomason .
Police notified BART officers , who also responded .
BART officers were the first to reach the suspect , described as a Hispanic male between 30 and 40 years old , Thomason said .
The BART officers chased the man from the station to the street , where Oakland police joined in the pursuit over four blocks in the Fruitvale area .
Thomason said Oakland police tried to Taser the man twice , but to no effect .
The man , armed with two knives , then attempted to charge at one of the officers , a police statement said .

Uh-oh .
Those dreaded “ end - of - life ” rumors are starting back up again .
This time , the original Motorola Droid and Motorola ’s forgotten Devour might be on that list of devices headed out of the mill .
DroidForums caught wind of an internal screen showing both of the devices as “ limited ” or with “ no remaining shipments ” to be had from the vendor .
It would make a lot of sense .
The Motorola Droid 2 is expected to be revealed very soon with its predecessor having been out since early November 2009 .
After 9 months , it ’s to be expected .
That does n’t mean support would completely drop , it just means Verizon will be doing their best to push the latest in the Droid line into the hands of their customers .
Verizon ’s currently holding another one of their famous BOGO promotions for the phone , as well .
We did n’t think anything of it , at first , considering they hold these all the time , but it ’s possible we could be seeing the final hoorah before the torch is passed onto bigger ( and seemingly better ) devices .

This is the book I wish I had when I started making games , and now I want you to have it .
It ’s available in four formats :
I ’m here to help !
Game Programming Patterns is a collection of patterns I found in games that make code cleaner , easier to understand , and faster .
Frequently Asked Questions
Do the different versions have different content ?
Nope !
Each format has every chapter in full , every illustration , and all of the asides you know and love .
Even the free web version .
Which version pays you the most ?
First of all , thank you for caring about this !
Since I self - published , I set the prices so that the royalties are about the same for each format .
( I also get the lion ’s share of the money since there ’s no publisher taking a cut . )
Buy the format you want and I ’ll get paid pretty much the same either way .
If you want to give me money , but do n’t actually want a physical book , consider giving it to a friend or your local library .
I get money , you feel good , and someone gets a free book !
If I buy the print edition , can I get the eBook cheaper ?
Yes , mostly .
I have MatchBook enabled on the Kindle edition .
If you buy the print copy , you can get the Kindle version for just $ 3.00 .
I do n’t have a way to set up anything similar for the other eBook formats , unfortunately .
I am a poor student .
How can I get your book cheaply ?
I had you in mind when I decided to put the entire contents of the book on the web for free .
I put more than five years of my life into this book , and I want as many people to have access to it as possible .
The web version is also a great starting point to see if you like the book before you plunk down cash .
Do the digital editions use DRM ?
Heck no !
If you have been kind enough to pay for the book , I want to give you the most flexibility I can .
You should be able to freely transfer it to all of your devices , archive it , etc .
I ’m in Canada .
How can I get the print edition ?
CreateSpace does not directly ship to Canada which is why you do n’t see it on amazon.ca .
Instead , a kind reader tells me that you can get it from Book Depository .
If that does n’t work , you may be able to buy it from amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com and get it shipped from the US .
Well an octopus is very intelligent .
I have seen videos of them changing color and texture to mimic a rock with coral .
I have seen them use objects like tools .
I have seen a video of one who had learned to walk around with two coconut halves .
If attacked , this octopus would pull the two halves together with itself inside .
The tenticles were so strong that it would be very hard for most creatures to pry the coconut open to get to the octopus .
I have seen videos of octopus learning to get to a piece of food inside a jar or in a hard to reach place .
I think these creatures are very smart and we do n't know exactly the limits of what they think .
Maybe they think with pictures in their minds .
When I try to remember what it was like as a very young child , I remember feeling a lot of emotion .
I knew if I was sad or happy .
If I wanted something I remember looking at it and imaginging how to get it .
It is hard to remember a time when I did n't think with words " I am going to push that chair over and climb up and get that . "
But I if I try , I can kind of imagine what it was like .
Instead of thinking " I am going to stack some things up until I can reach that . "
I would instead just kind of see myself doing that , or there was just this sudden awareness that it would work .
It was thinking without words .
It was a sort of knowing .
And once I learned to do something , I remembered it .
I think that is how it is with the octopus .
They may learn a new trick by experimentation with how their bodies move objects around .
Then later they just know from experience that it is going to work .
So the octopus might not think " I am going to use all my tenticles to open this jar .
I have to twist the cap part to the left to get it open . "
But it just kind of experiments first and then later it just knows .
So when it goes to do that again , it may remember or it may see pictures in it 's mind .
I do n't think it has words for things like a human .
But I think it does have a way of transmitting information to another creature .
Some skin colors may mean it is scared or feels threatened , or it is content , or it is ready to fight , or it is aroused .
And one octopus may watch another in motion and maybe it will see a new trick that it will mimic .
The other octopus may not be actively trying to teach a new trick , but we can never tell what it is thinking .
Maybe they do have a way to show each other new things , or maybe it just happens if they mimic each other .
If there were a way to teach the concept of a written language or symbolism to an octopus , maybe there would be a way they could communicate more with us or each other .
It seems like it might be possible for them to at least associate some symbols with a food reward .
If there were a way to teach them new concepts with symbols , maybe they could learn to spell something out for us .
Decoding DNA Evidence Suggests Early Humans Mated with Neanderthals
Researchers in Leipzig have successfully sequenced the genetic code of a Neanderthal , and found some overlap with modern - day Europeans .
The finding provides insight into the evolution of humans -- and could be a blow to racists .

When Kate Monro decided the moment had come to lose her virginity , everything seemed to fall into place perfectly .
She was 15 and on holiday without her parents for the first time .
Every night she and her friends would hit the dance floors of the Costa Brava .
" We would spend all night in proper 1980s discos , drinking piña coladas and being chatted up by hairy Spaniards who looked like members of Wham ! " she says .
One night Monro got lucky .
In walked an exquisitely good - looking French boy – a whole year older than herself and so sophisticated he was holidaying alone .
" I was enthralled , " she says , " like a moth to a flame .
I figured out pretty quickly this was my big opportunity to lose my virginity . "
The pair planned it carefully and on the last night of the holiday he took her up into the hills where they found just the right spot by a swimming pool overlooking the sea .
But in the event , Monro's French Adonis turned out to be a bit of a letdown .
It was mechanical , boring and uncomfortable .
" My absolute first thought was : Oh , this feels like three Tampax instead of one , " she says .
" Nothing more . "
Even so , when it was over , as it was in a flash , Monro skipped back down the hillside feeling euphoric .
" Losing my virginity was absolutely top of my list of things to do , " she says .
" I felt stigmatised by it .
I always thought I was such a maverick with my dyed hair and ripped jeans , but my friends had done it , therefore I wanted to do it , too . "
Despite her own lacklustre experience , virginity loss is a subject Monro , now 42 , has become deeply intrigued by .
For the past five years she has scoured the world , collecting tales of first - time fumblings through her blog the Virginity Project .
She has now amassed hundreds of stories which she plans to turn into a book .
Monro believes sharing your virginity loss story is one of the most exposing things you can do , and all her case studies remain anonymous .
" It 's one of the most vulnerable moments of your life , " she says .
" Nothing can ever prepare you for the reality of it .
It is you at your most unknowing and innocent stepping into the sexual arena for the very first time . "
One of Monro 's subjects is Betty .
She lost her virginity on her wedding night in 1940 .
" I never knew what a man even looked like until I got married , " she told Monro .
" Sex was a forbidden subject .
I was frightened , and when I saw how he looked I laughed . "
And more recently there 's the 16 - year - old whose older brother treated him to a Mancunian prostitute .
" Thoughts swirled in my head , " said the boy .
" Do n't come too soon .
Is £ 35 a fair price ?
What do they do in porn ? "
Monro seems to have an ability to get people to open up to her and there are many who tell her things they can't even tell their own partner .
One of the most candid stories on her blog is the tale of the stay - at - home father of four whose wife , a high - flying lawyer , decided one night to strap on a dildo and take his anal virginity .
" I was , to put it mildly , petrified , " he says .
" The sight of that missile protruding from her , and meant for me , brought everything home . "
She also has tales we would n't usually hear : of a thalidomide boy ( lost his to the most popular girl in school , then moved on to her best friend ) ; an autistic man ( prostitute ) and a 101 - year - old woman ( out of wedlock , scandalous , but a bit hazy ) .
But the story , she says , that always shocks the most , is that of the man who has been married for 15 years yet is still a virgin .
" He had the opportunity to do it but just had an intense feeling he would hurt the woman and could n't do it , " she says .
" I think it has just turned into phobia . "
In many ways Monro 's work is a valuable snapshot of sexual mores from the past 60 years .
Betty , for example , is a product of a time when virginity loss and marriage went hand in hand .
For Monro , meanwhile – a child of the 1980s , in those heady days post - pill , pre-Aids – it 's little wonder she behaved the way she did .
And these days ?
According to the latest National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles ( Natsal ) , which studied more than 11,000 people aged between 16 and 19 , the median age of virginity loss is 16 .
Interestingly , ever since the mid-1990s the proportion of women who lost their virginity before the age of 16 suddenly stopped increasing and along with that use of contraception went right up , too .
Could it be that some messages are filtering through and we , as a nation , are becoming more and more sensible ?
On her blog Monro cites the work of Laura Carpenter , professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville .
Carpenter did a scientific study of 61 people and , in the resulting book Virginity Loss : an Intimate Portrait of our First Sexual Experiences , identifies three distinct categories .
First there are the " gifters " – " People who see virginity as a precious thing and who want to find the perfect person to give it to , " explains Carpenter .
The second are the " stigmatised " – the group to which Monro clearly belongs – and finally there are the " processors " who see virginity loss as just one sexual experience in many , a category which , Carpenter found , many gay and lesbian people fell into .
" One of the things that struck me was that men and women were far more similar than we would expect , " says Carpenter .
" When you find women who talk about virginity as a stigma , the choices they make are really very similar to men – they do n't care who they do it with , they just want it over with .
While the men who saw virginity as a gift were very like women gifters – concerned about finding someone special to give it to . "
American filmmaker Therese Shechter started out as a gifter .
" I was waiting for that special person , " she says .
" I really felt I had this thing that I wanted to bestow on the right person . "
By the time she hit 23 , however , she was the only virgin left in her peer group .
" I eventually realised this special person was not coming , so I needed to do it with someone unspecial .
When I did my first thought was : ' Great , it 's done ' – my second : ' And this was what I had been saving myself for ? ' "
Shechter , who directed the award - winning 2005 documentary I Was a Teenage Feminist , is now working on a follow - up called How to Lose Your Virginity , which is due to open in America in the autumn .
She was inspired to make a film about virginity partly by her horror at the rise of the abstinence movement in America and partly by the experience of planning her own wedding .
" I realised it was a similar ritual to a purity ball – the process of handing your virginity from your father to your new husband , " she says .
" For me that was something pretty ugly and ancient . "
Like Monro's work , Shechter 's film is a series of straightforward tales of real people 's virginity loss .
It 's refreshing to hear such forthright voices in a world where any debate about virginity is often so conflicting or one - sided .
Our current torchbearer seems to be Miley Cyrus who , just like Britney all those years ago , loudly proclaims her own virginity while behaving in a hyper - sexual way .
In the media there are constant stories about women auctioning off their virginity to pay for their education and more troubling is recent news of one Justin Sisely , an Australian TV producer currently looking for young virgins to take part in a new reality show .
" You see all this stuff and you think : ' So this is the extent of the debate we 're having about virginity in the 21st century ? ' " says Shechter .
It 's a sentiment Monro agrees with .
" These days we see sex everywhere , but there 's very little that 's honest about it , " she says .
" I think ultimately what brings people to tell me their stories is that we all have an innate desire to want to compare our experiences with other people .
We all just want some sort of affirmation to know that we are normal . "

Donnie , 31 , lost his virginity in 1998
I was in college , working at a bookstore .
I had a key and often worked late at night and this meant that I and the girl I loved had a place where we could go and be away from our roommates .
To say that I loved her would be a pale word .
I savoured her .
Every angle , every facet of her mind and her words and her eyes seemed to infuse me with an energy that I had never experienced before .
One night , late in the dark store , after talking about Joseph Conrad novels , we kissed more and more deeply , and everything began to spin around me ; all the square angles of the books and shelves blurred like a cartoon as I removed the lace from the curves of her body .
We were laying on the floor between shelves of old books .
I remember how her heat surprised me .
I remember how her legs felt when they moved up around my ribs .
I remember something she whispered to me — a whisper I sometimes still hear at night .
I remember playing with her hair afterwards , as we lay together panting and hot .
And most of all I remember the feeling much later , as the sun was rising and we left the store .
She was wearing my coat .
And everything in the world was different .
I noticed it instantly — as though everyone had been speaking in a foreign accent and now suddenly switched to my own .
Arthur Perks , 86 , lost his virginity in 1943
I had no idea at all about sex .
I never even saw my mum and dad kiss each other .
I did think of going to a prostitute to show me how to do it , before I made a fool of myself , but I did n't have the courage .
In 1942 , when I was 22 , I joined the army so I never had time to go with women because I was a front line soldier .
Then we went into Austria and annexed a couple of hotels on a lake .
It was beautiful and I used to row round the lake and one night , there was this girl standing on the jetty .
She took a fancy to me and I began to get a stir if you know what I mean .
One night we had a nice night of rumpity - pump and it happened .
Just like that .
And the unfortunate part of it was , there was nothing splendid about it at all .
I got the erection and bob 's your uncle .
Away we went .
Of course we were n't so adventurous in those days .
You did n't try positions or anything like that , women are more forward today than they ever were back then .
Mathilde , 20 , lost her virginity in 2009
When I was 17 I was desperate to lose my virginity .
I met him at midnight after a party and we planned to do the deed in someone else 's bed .
I saw him as my golden ticket into the amazing world of sex .
We started kissing .
He was very heavy , we undressed and he pushed and it hurt like hell .
He wanted to stop , but I told him to keep going .
Eventually he got inside me and started thrusting .
I remember that it felt crooked .
Our friends called before he could finish and I do n't think we ever really spoke again .
I was always afraid to have sex after that .
I made out with guys naked on the kitchen table in the common kitchen .
I gave blowjobs to more than I 'd like to recall , but I could n't do it .
I could n't have sex .
I did n't get another boyfriend until I was 20 .
He was a virgin too and eager to do the deed .
I told him I was a virgin , because in my mind I was .
Marcus , 32 , lost his virginity in 2007
At 29 , many years of falling confidence had taken their toll .
I was at a nightclub with friends when a female friend who I had always thought was stunning but out of my league , drunkenly confessed that she really liked me .
I was in total shock .
Before I knew it , we were kissing and she made it clear that she was willing to have sex that night , but I felt wary of her being quite drunk that we left it at that .
We met a few days later and hit it off right where we left off .
Before I knew it we were on her bed , then becoming naked – a new first for me – and then we were doing all those things I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to taste .
And it all felt so natural .
For a first time , I would guess it was pretty good .
As we talked afterwards , I told her that that had been my first time , and she was shocked .
She said she never would have guessed .
Paul Howden , 48 , lost his virginity 1976
I was 15 and had been going out with this girl for a couple of months .
I was going past her house in Edgware one day in the school holidays when suddenly a torrential rain storm came down .
I knocked on her door and my girlfriend 's mum opened the door .
She invited me in and told me to go into the living room and take my wet clothes off while she went off to get some towels .
When she came back I was standing there in my underpants .
She told me to take them off and then she started helping to dry me with the towels .
She started on my chest then did my back .
She was kind of stroking me rather than drying me .
Then she told me to turn round and she basically starting towelling me lower and lower until she was drying my bits and stroking them through the towel .
She got me aroused , which was n't that difficult , and then told me to lie down on the carpet .
She was wearing a lightweight summer dress which came off in seconds and she sat down on me .
I remember feeling a combination of utter embarrassment , elation and fear that my girlfriend would walk through the door .
I was also terrified of getting her pregnant .
It was all over in a minute , if that .
I vividly remember noticing lots of pictures of her daughter , my girlfriend , scattered round the room .
When it was over she got up and we sat there on opposite sofas waiting for my clothes to dry having tea and biscuits .
I just wanted to get out of there .
She told me to come back the next day to do it properly .
At 15 you do n't expect to be pounced on a by a woman in her 40s .
Juliette Robertson , 33 , lost her virginity in 1994
I was 17 and a half and one of the last among my friends to lose my virginity .
I 'd been seeing this guy I 'd met over the summer .
He was three years older than me and had his own car and seemed a lot more grown up than me .
From the off he wanted to have sex but I was totally nervous .
In the end I made him wait four months as I wanted to feel like I had got to know him .
The night we planned to do it I told my mum that I was staying over at my friend 's house .
My boyfriend told me to dress up because he was taking me on a date .
He arrived to pick me up in his car and revealed that he was taking me to the opera to see the Magic Flute .
I was dressed up in a full length gown .
I thought ' this is so grown up and romantic , it 's going to be perfect , perfect . '
It 's hilarious when you think about it now .
I could n't understand a word of the opera and all I could do was sit there thinking over and over again I 'm going to lose my virginity tonight .
Afterwards we went back to his .
He had tried to create an atmosphere with candles , pink flowers and Pink Floyd playing on a loop .
The whole thing must have been over in seconds .
Weirdly , I do n't really remember the details of the act itself , but I do remember having that classic feeling of is this really it ?
And brilliant , I 've done it .

With Sonic the Hedgehog 4 : Episode 1 getting the long - time fans of the franchise in a tizzy , a lot of attention have may been lost to Sonic Colors .
The continuation of the 3D leg of the long - time franchise noted especially for its unpopularity with critics , Colors had to fight against a heavy anchor to overcome the immediate implications of its pedigree .
For what seems like the twentieth time in our history with Sonic , the demo we were given had promises .
This time around , however , Team Sonic was open about its mistakes in previous titles and seemingly keen to give its mascot the edge he had back on the Genesis .
For starters , the game is based on a recent development in the hedgehog ’s lifespan that avoided a lot of the usual fan frigidity , the daylight segments of 2008 ’s Sonic Unleashed , as well as the homing attack and other combat additions made in recent titles .
Sonic races across themed stages , shifting from 2D and 3D perspectives based on the level ’s architecture , and maintaining a sense of frantic speed throughout .
Dr. Eggman ( or as we prefer to know him , Robotink ) has built a massive amusement park in the greater atmosphere above the planet from stray asteroids , capturing a color alien species known as Wisps along the way .
As Sonic races across the park , he will occasionally stumble across said Wisps , whose differing hues give him different abilities to interact with the level and enemies around him ( think , Super Princess Peach on the DS ) .
Our demonstration consisted of two different levels , Tropical Resort and Sweet Mountain .
Both fit their theme as you would imagine , the former boasting a bright and blue Island aesthetic with the latter glowing with giant luminescent candies .
As Sonic ran along both stages , we encountered both a cyan and yellow wisp at different intervals .
Breaking the cage of the cyan one gave us a temporary laser dash offensive ability , with a limited target to target Sonic ’s flight path before launching him TRON - style through the guts of the five or so robotic baddies down the way .
The yellow alien turned Sonic into a hyperactive Dig - Dug , his spin dash transforming into a drill power that sent us through the crust of the level and into a sealed off underground passage loaded with gold coins .
The producer ’s informed us that we were only seeing a fraction of the powers that would be available in the final game , with presumably every color included in the basic rainbow getting its own wisp .
Powers will also have multiple uses , they tell us , but our demo limited us to one per each alien .
Bonus stages and chaos emeralds were also teased , but not shown .
All this attention on secondary abilities may seem like Sega is again loosing track of what makes Sonic “ Sonic , ” but its worth noting that all the powers are optional and only unlocked after a level has been raced through once .
The producers took multiple chances to let us know just how important speed was to the design of the game , and just how deeply the focus was on making Sonic as fast as possible .
To their credit they seem to have succeeded , both stages played out in the linear , loopy fashion we ’d expect of the hedgehog , and the clip we sped along at felt suitably speedy .
While the game was demonstrated mainly on Nintendo ’s Wii platform , Sonic Colors will also receive a DS version near the same time .
The portable iteration will take after the under - appreciated Sonic Rush series , utilizing the touch screen as mainly a secondary ( yet unexplained ) function .
Our time with the time was long enough to determine that the dual - screen mechanic is used much more intuitively than Rush ( and features a much brighter , and user - friendly , color palette ) .
Colors will not be a game taking advantage of Nintendo ’s upcoming 3DS technology , and thus will keep to 2D throughout .
Both the DS and Wii versions will feature exclusive levels and wisp - based powers , although nothing has been announced for either platform as of yet .
While story has never been a central focus of the franchise , Colors is looking to bring it back to basics with a team of American
writers this time around to better focus on Western sensibilities and humor .
More importantly to any long - term Sonic follower , perhaps , is the Sega ’s adamant point of including the blue hedgehog as the game ’s sole playable character , with Tails and Eggman only making non-playable appearances throughout the game .
No other characters from the franchise ’s pantheon will be featured .
The DS version will feature a similar story to its console big brother , but will also have Knuckles and Amy make additional NPC appearances at some point , with Sonic still retaining the sole playable role .
Sonic Colors seems to finally be bringing back Sonic in the right direction : across the screen as fast as possible .
Taking advantage of one of the few positives the company has received in recent Sonic titles and adding flashy supplemental powers to it seems like a solid concept , happily devoid of werehogs and swords .
Both the DS and Wii burst with colorful and multi-tiered levels that are long enough to satisfy but short enough to encourage multiple playthroughs .
Story is calorie - loaded fluff , but hopefully now at least Western audiences will be in on the jokes .
Best of all , it ’ll be just us and Sonic again .
Keep in tuned to Elder - Geek for all Sonic Colors news as its September ( tentative ) release date approaches !
Pirate Party Australia : Moving Forward
[ PDF Version ]
With Julia Gillard calling the election for August 21 it is with some regret that we must announce we will not be able to contest this election as a Party .
Our application to register is before the Australian Electoral Commission ( AEC ) , however a Party can not be registered once an election has been called .
This does not mean that you wo n’t hear from us this election .
We ’ll continue to highlight important issues that have been largely neglected by other political parties , and to lobby and campaign for a better policy direction with respect to transparent governance , the Internet and civil liberties .
We will continue to work to grow the Party , build a stronger base and be better placed to campaign for the next federal election .
You may even see us at a state election .
As with any start - up organisation , we are still finding ourselves , and our first National Congress occurs on July 31 in Sydney , where our members will formally adopt our first statement of platform , and our first manifesto — and discuss the future of the Party , the future of the democracy in Australia , and how we plan to make it better .
In the short time we ’ve begun formally organising the Party , we ’ve created what we believe has been a positive effect on political discourse — we ’ve worked to highlight the issue of Internet censorship to many different community groups through various actions .
We ’ve highlighted the importance of access to information with Exit International , we ’ve worked with other groups to show the ineffectiveness of the proposed mandatory Internet censorship regime of the Australian Labor Party .
The issue of file sharing , and how copyright should function in the digital paradigm , the importance of our civil liberties and network freedom , is increasingly becoming a topic of discussion and we hope to continue in making this a topic of national debate .
Access to information , knowledge and culture , and how we relate to them , is quickly becoming the most important debate .
The information society demands an information party — we are that party .
We will continue to be that voice .
The deceptively named Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) threatens freedom , access to pharmaceuticals and threatens the democratic process .
The prospect of blanket data retention that represents a wholesale invasion of privacy is looming .
These are the issues about which we should be asking lawmakers in this campaign — make them accountable , make them promise they will not marginalise civil liberties , and think about where your vote will go .
It is the most important and powerful mechanism you have as a citizen in a democratic nation such as ours .
We wo n’t tell you how to vote — there are other parties that have some overlap .
We may provide an analysis of other parties and their policies , possibly including some recommendations , however we hope you examine each party ’s formal and written policies before casting your vote .
Choose a party with policies that you are comfortable with , place your own preferences , and use the power that preferential voting provides to direct preference flow .
1
Also , make certain that you are enrolled !
Choose a minor party that you think will do great things for this country .
Our preferential voting system means a vote for a minor party is not a vote wasted !
We regret that we cannot represent you as candidates at the forthcoming federal election , but we will not be giving up , and we will still work to make these issues election issues , and topics of public debate and concern .

In this era of offshore accounts and banking secrecy , you ca n’t turn sideways without hearing someone call for more transparency .
I get it – I believe that transparency is generally a good thing , especially in government .
But how much is too much ?
The Norwegians have made news for their “ skatteliste , ” or “ tax list ” which includes personal income and tax burden for all of its taxpayers as well as where the taxpayers ranks on a list of national averages .
The list has been public since 1863 (! ) and was taken online in 2008 ( it was actually available online since 2002 but was restricted in a controversial move ) .
Despite the potential for unhappy comparisons , a majority of Norwegians actually favor the system .
Their desire for transparency is shared by those in neighboring Sweden , though with a bit less detail .
In the US , the government is prohibited from sharing tax information by law .
But perhaps a little access to information would be a good thing .
We already tend to know our presidential candidate ’s tax info – they release those as a courtesy .
But would we make better choices about what to report on our returns if we knew that they would be subject to publicly scrutiny ?
Would bank and corporate CEOs be as quick to swallow bonuses if everyone knew just how much they were taking ?
Would we feel more comfortable with our choices for mayor and other elected offices if we knew their financial and tax positions ?
With that in mind , here ’s Today ’s Fix the Tax Code Friday question :
Would publicly sharing income and tax burdens in the US be a good thing ?
Why or why not ?
Well it 's not the full 4.1 we were expecting ... but here 's a little tidbit from Apple .
One of the main features ?
The update " improves the formula to determine how many bars of signal strength to display . "
Interesting .
We 're updating some devices right now , and will report back with what we find .
[ Thanks to everyone who sent this in ]
It looks like iOS 3.2.1 for iPad is coming down the tube , as well .
We 'll let you know what changes we 're seeing !
Here 's a quick before - and - after shot of the signal meter .
Clearly , Apple was n't yanking any chains about changing the sizes of those leftmost bars .
The ACLU raised all kinds of hackles the other day from defenders of Arizona 's police - state immigration law , SB1070 , when it issued a travel warning giving all out - of - state Latinos a heads up about the potential problems they face if they travel there :
The nation 's top civil liberties group on Wednesday issued travel alerts for Arizona , saying the state 's new law cracking down on illegal immigrants could lead to racial profiling and warrantless arrests .
American Civil Liberties Union affiliates in Arizona , New Mexico and 26 other states put out the warnings in advance of the Fourth of July weekend .
The Arizona chapter has received reports that law enforcement officers are already targeting some people even though the law does n't take effect until July 29 , its executive director said .
The alerts are designed to teach people about their rights if police stop and question them .
The Arizona law requires police , while enforcing other laws , to question a person 's immigration status if officers have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally .
It also makes it a state crime for legal immigrants to not carry their immigration documents and bans day laborers and people who seek their services from blocking traffic on streets .
Attorneys defending the law against constitutional challenges filed by the ACLU and others argue that the Legislature amended it to strengthen restrictions against using race as the basis for questioning by police .
Five lawsuits are pending in federal court , and the U.S. Justice Department is believed to be preparing a legal challenge .
Despite the legislative action , the ACLU still believes that officers will inappropriately target minorities .
" We have a long history of racial profiling in this state , and this is basically going to really exacerbate that problem , " said Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the ACLU of Arizona .
The story has since been a hot topic at Fox News , where they 've been searching up anybody who will say unkind things about the ACLU .
Stuart Varney , filling in for Neil Cavuto on Your World on Fox yesterday , decided to ask Democratic Rep .
Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona 's 1st District about the advisory .
And though Kirkpatrick opposes SB1070 , she thinks the travel advisory is a " bad idea " -- just like the various boycotts of the state that erupted after the law was passed .
But Kirkpatrick does n't explain why it's a bad idea , except to suggest that it will hurt innocent Arizonans ( her same rationale for opposing the boycotts ) .
What both she and Varney -- and for that matter , the Associated Press story -- neglected to explain to their audiences was that , if and when SB1070 is enacted , Latino American citizens who travel to Arizona will need to produce more than just their drivers licenses to prove their citizenship .
Radio host Mark Levine made this point clearly and succinctly to Laura Ingraham the other night when she was filling in on The O'Reilly Factor :
Levine : Certainly , a month from now , if this law goes into effect , all kinds of Latino American citizens may be in danger and I think what they 're doing is they 're telling people -- Ingraham :
In danger ?
Levine : Absolutely .
Look , Laura , do you have -- Ingraham :
How are they in danger ?
If they 're legally in the United States , how are they in danger ?
Levine : I 'll explain .
SB1070 , the Arizona law , says if you 're not carrying an Arizona drivers license , you can be stopped , and you can be arrested .
Ingraham : No profiling .
Levine : Let 's say you 're from New Mexico , or Utah , or Nevada , or any of the other fifteen states that do n't require you to be a citizen in order to have a drivers license .
I do n't have an Arizona drivers license !
Luckily for me , I do n't look Latino , but if I go to Arizona without a drivers license , they can stop me .
You 'll notice that Ingraham has no reply except to say that the law is popular anyway .
( Yeah , we noticed that .
So what ? )
We explored this point in some depth previously :
Here 's what the text of SB 1070 says : A PERSON IS PRESUMED TO NOT BE AN ALIEN WHO IS UNLAWFULLY PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES IF THE PERSON PROVIDES TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR AGENCY ANY OF THE FOLLOWING : 1 . A VALID ARIZONA DRIVER LICENSE .
2 . A VALID ARIZONA NONOPERATING IDENTIFICATION LICENSE .
3 . A VALID TRIBAL ENROLLMENT CARD OR OTHER FORM OF TRIBAL IDENTIFICATION .
4 . IF THE ENTITY REQUIRES PROOF OF LEGAL PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE ISSUANCE , ANY VALID UNITED STATES FEDERAL , STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION .
But as Stephen Lemon points out , this language is actually pretty startling :
You will be presumed to be an illegal alien in Arizona unless you can produce one of these four kinds of ID .
Now , I have n't been able to find anything in Arizona code requiring citizens to carry one of these forms of ID with them at all times .
But SB1070 certainly does create that requirement .
As Lemons says :
If during any police investigation , a cop has " reasonable suspicion " to think you 're in the country illegally , he or she can presume you 're an undocumented alien unless you provide one of several forms of ID .
...
Subsequently , even U.S. citizens could be held until someone from Immigration and Customs Enforcement is called to sort them out .
Keep in mind that a cop can stop someone and begin the process during the " enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county , city or town or this state . "
That 's so broad as to include weed abatement and barking dogs .
But this also raises a huge question :
What if you 're from another state ?
What if you 're only carrying an out - of - state driver 's license ?
Many states refuse to require proof of citizenship when issuing driver 's licenses : they wisely understand that it 's more important to have people driving their roads with licenses and documentation than not , and requiring citizenship papers is a good way to discourage it .
So if someone -- say , a fourth - generation Latino citizen with an accent -- traveling through Arizona with a California or a Washington driver 's license has the misfortune to be pulled over in a traffic stop -- or maybe just one of Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's roadblocks -- and has the similar misfortune to arouse an officer 's " reasonable suspicion " ( say , he has a heavy accent or looks nervous ) , he could be hauled in and arrested under SB 1070 , until someone back home can fax the birth certificate .
Levine somewhat misstates his case at the end :
He can't be pulled over for looking Latino .
But if he gets pulled over for a traffic infraction and all he has to show the officer is his California driver 's license , he will be presumed to be an illegal alien and subject to arrest .
Pretty nasty state of affairs Arizona is cooking up in the desert .

Thank you for allowing me to do so . "
After the ceremony , Cruise was asked if he was still hungry to make films after such a long career .
" Yeah I am .
I never tire of it .
I feel like a kid working on them , " he said .
Cruise 's action comedy Knight and Day , out in the UK in July , sees him reunited with Cameron Diaz for the first time since 2001 's Vanilla Sky .
" Working with Cameron was incredible .

" On behalf of the Harry Potter family I 'd like to thank Jo Rowling for giving us the books .
Without her we would n't be here , " he said .
An emotional Watson said : " There will be a huge hole in my heart when it 's over . "
Some of the crowd booed when it was announced that Pattinson was unable to attend the event due to filming commitments .
But in a video message played out , the actor said : " It means a lot to me because you the fans decided the winner .
Thanks for voting for me . "
' Throwing tomatoes '

Twilight fans had given Facinelli a noisy welcome as he arrived at the venue .
He told the BBC afterwards : " I 'm always very happily overwhelmed by the response that I get with this movie .
" I really did n't expect that kind of a reaction on the red carpet tonight .
It 's a little nerve - wracking hearing your name screamed over and over , but I guess it 's better than them throwing tomatoes . "

* U.S. lawmakers call for continued ban on biotech alfalfa
* Say USDA has " ignored " regulatory authority
* Say U.S. organic dairy industry threatened
* Related sugarbeet court case delayed
( Releads , Adds details , delay in sugarbeet case , Monsanto comments )
By Carey Gillam
KANSAS CITY , June 23 ( Reuters ) - More than 50 U.S. lawmakers are calling on the U.S. Agriculture Department to keep Monsanto's MON.N biotech alfalfa out of farm fields , despite a Supreme Court ruling this week that cleared the way for limited planting pending environmental reviews .
The lawmakers said the biotech alfalfa presents too great a risk to conventional and organic agriculture to ever allow it .
" We believe that the broad regulatory authority available to you has been ignored , in order to justify deregulation of a biotech crop that has limited utility to anyone except the manufacturer , " the letter addressed to Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack said .
U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont , and Rep. Peter DeFazio , a Democrat from Oregon , were joined by 49 other representatives and five other senators in asking Vilsack to ensure that Monsanto 's genetically engineered alfalfa is not approved for commercial use .
The alfalfa , which has been altered to tolerate Monsanto 's Roundup herbicide , and is known as " Roundup Ready " alfalfa , was approved by USDA in 2005 and was planted in limited quantities around the United States .
But environmental groups and some seed companies sued the USDA in 2006 and successfully forced the agency to rescind its approval after a federal court found USDA had violated environmental law by failing to do a thorough environmental review before approving the product .
That environmental impact statement still has not been completed , and USDA 's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) has said it expects to have one done by spring .
But Monsanto said this week it wanted the agency to accelerate approval .
Still , the lawmakers ' letter to Vilsack said that there is strong evidence the biotech alfalfa will contaminate conventional alfalfa fields , and could spell disaster for the organic dairy industry by contaminating the feed fed to organic dairy cows if USDA approves it .
Organic forage would become harder to find and more expensive .
The lawmakers cited contaminations in several fields during the two years that the biotech alfalfa was grown commercially despite the fact that those conventional fields were far from the biotech fields .
Alfalfa is the fourth - largest U.S. field crop grown on about 23 million acres in the U.S. annually .
It is pollinated largely by honey bees , making it difficult to isolate biotech alfalfa from conventional varieties .
The organic dairy industry , which has about $ 1.4 billion in annual sales , will suffer " significant economic losses " if the USDA approves the product .
Monsanto spokesman Garrett Kasper said there were many benefits to its biotech alfalfa and it wants to be able to start selling the seed soon .
" The farmer and environmental benefits of ag biotech are well established and farmers are anxious to have the choice to grow Roundup Ready alfalfa , " said Kasper .
" USDA has the expertise necessary to evaluate these products and we are hopeful that USDA will issue guidance , following the Supreme Court decision on Monday , which will allow farmers to resume planting Roundup Ready alfalfa this fall . "
On Monday , the Supreme Court ruled that a district court judge in San Francisco had abused his discretion in barring the USDA from pursuing a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of the biotech alfalfa seeds , pending the completion of an environmental review .
[ ID :nN21252613 ]
The ruling , however , did not alter the lower court decision that banned the biotech alfalfa until completion of a full environmental review .
A similar case involving Monsanto's biotech sugarbeets , was slated for a court hearing July 9 , but the judge in that case has postponed the hearing until mid-August to give all parties a chance to study the Supreme Court ruling .
The court has already ruled the sugarbeets were approved by USDA without proper environmental review and is considering a permanent injunction .
Andrew Kimbrell , executive director of the Center for Food Safety , one of the plaintiffs in the alfalfa lawsuit , said USDA needed to focus on the well being of U.S. consumers and agriculture , and not Monsanto .

Former Labor leader Mark Latham has launched a vitriolic attack on Kevin Rudd , accusing him of being the source of the latest leak to hit the Gillard Government .
Mr Latham called the former prime minister a " snake " and said he should " be a man " and own up to the leak , which claimed Prime Minister Julia Gillard was opposed to the Government 's parental leave scheme and questioned the aged pension rise .
" It 's the coward 's way to get on the blower with Laurie Oakes and say , ' I 'll tell you this but you 're not allowed to identify me ' .
It 's the snake 's way , " he said .
" I challenge Kevin Rudd to be a man , to be honest , to have some honour , and actually if he feels this strongly about it , put his name to his words . "
The firebrand former opposition leader told Sky News he was sure Mr Rudd leaked the information to Channel Nine reporter Laurie Oakes .
" When you 're lying in bed at night and hear the pitter - patter sound on the roof you do n't actually have to see the drops to know that it 's raining , " he said .
" So too , you do n't need to have a wire tap on the conversation between Kevin Rudd and Laurie Oakes to know it was Kevin Rudd .
" It too is one of the laws of nature , that Kevin is a serial leaker . "
He said Ms Gillard 's decision to leave Mr Rudd on the backbench would have contributed to the leak .
" I think he was insulted when having lost the prime ministership and wanting to go onto the frontbench he was n't accommodated , " Mr Latham said .
" He was really quite humiliated by being left on the backbench by Julia Gillard . "
Mr Rudd 's spokesman has issued a one - line statement in response : " Mr Rudd has not responded to the substance of anything Mr Latham has said over the past five years .
He does not intend to start now . "
Previously , Mr Rudd issued a statement saying he never comments on private Cabinet discussions .
Ms Gillard has said she thinks Mr Rudd is " honourable " and is welcome on her frontbench if Labor wins the upcoming election .
Ten years ago this past June 28 , Elián González was returned to his father in Cuba , and Alex Penelas 's rising political star imploded .
Miami - Dade 's then - county mayor dug his own grave in 2000 .
Sure he won a second term as mayor , but he double - crossed Al Gore during the presidential election and the recount .
Now the Hialeah boy wonder who once
dreamed of being the next Dante Fascell is making a comeback at county
hall , as -- what else ? -- a lobbyist .
In 2004 , when Penelas ran for U.S. Senate , the Democrats
abandoned the Cuban - American politician .
And Gore put him on blast as a
traitor .
As a result , Penelas came in a distant third in the primary and
faded from the political scene .
For the past six years , Penelas has stayed away from politics other than his gig as a commentator for Univision .
But not anymore .
Earlier this month , Dan Ricker 's the
Watchdog Report noted Penelas
had registered to lobby on behalf of ADA Engineering Inc .

There 's going to be some uncertainty
To the opponents of legalization that want us to prove exactly how many people will use which drugs with legalization , and to the concern trolls that suggest that we ’d do better if we addressed a laundry list of specific questions , the answer is “ forget it . ”
If there ’s anything the recent RAND report demonstrates , it ’s that there ’s a whole lot of uncertainty that comes with legalization .
In part due to the interminable length of time that this drug war has been foisted upon us , and in part due to the ubiquitous global reach of the American drug war machine , we do n’t have a modern day legalization analogue available that does n’t suffer from the potential criticism of being insufficiently similar to our situation .
But unlike what the intellectually dishonest Rosalie Liccardo Pacula ( co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center ) would have you believe , neither a lack of certainty nor a lack of specificity are things to fear .
We will enter into legalization and we will learn from it .
We ’ll tinker and adjust .
If suddenly there ’s an increase in stoned driving crashes ( and there wo n’t be ) , we ’ll address that specifically .
If there ’s an overwhelming increase in pot use by 12 - year - olds ( and there wo n’t be ) , we ’ll address that specifically .
We ’ll be able to operate surgically , because we ’ll no longer be pulverizing the patient from operating by sledgehammer .
Despite the uncertainty , there ’s a lot we do know .
We live in a post - Reefer Madness world , and the same lies that once hoodwinked the people are getting harder to push .
We ’re not going into legalization blind .
We know that our journey is relatively safe ; we just do n’t know exactly where it ’s going .
And Beau Kilmer , Jonathan P. Caulkins , Rosalie Liccardo Pacula , Robert J. MacCoun , Peter H. Reuter and all the other academics who note the lack of certainty in their calculations , should be absolutely ( in private , of course , not betraying their personal biases ) dancing with joy at the notion of legalized pot in California .
Here , at last — a large human laboratory to truly test how a modern legalized cannabis system can work .
And the provisions to let different localities try different options ?
Bonus !
I am thinking that this is more incredible INPUT than even Johnny 5 could handle .
Oh , sure , California ’s not perfect ; what we learn there may not apply exactly to North Dakota .
And results will still be a bit watered down and muddied by the steady rain of federal urinations and defecations .
But there will be knowledge !
And a little less uncertainty .
But is n’t first moving into this uncertainty scary ?
It might be if the current system were nirvana .
If our drug policy was all butterflies and daffodils , instead of death , destruction , incarceration , racism , and corruption , then sure — why would we want to try a different approach whose results were partially unknown ?
But it ’s clear to all who care to look , and who are not blinded by the golden shower of drug war cash , that we are in a world of hurt .
We do n’t need to tinker with prohibition .
We need to burn it and then take the ashes and spread them to the far corners of the universe .
California is a first crack in the fecal façade of prohibition .
The drug warriors are desperately trying to plug that crack to avoid even a glimpse of a different approach .
Well , guess what .
They ’ve had decades of their failed projectile diarrhea , upon which they pathetically dab drops of perfume in an effort to prove that their shit do n’t stink .
After all those years , they ’ve got nothing .
No evidence of a workable system .
And not a leg to stand on when opposing a radically safe alternative to prohibition like regulated legalization .
Their time is finally coming to an end .
We need to hasten it and reduce the damage as much as we can by speaking out and bringing the truth to the people , and letting them know that yes , there will be some uncertainties in the journey , but that the alternative — keeping things as they are now — is an unspeakably hideous path .

With a Senate vote tomorrow on legislation to undo some of the damage from the Citizens United Supreme Court decision , the President laid out the stakes in no uncertain terms :
A vote to oppose these reforms is nothing less than a vote to allow corporate and special interest takeovers of our elections .
It is damaging to our democracy .
It is precisely what led a Republican President named Theodore Roosevelt to tackle this issue a century ago .
As the President discussed in his State of the Union address months ago , this decision essentially opened the floodgates for the influence of huge corporations , including foreign - owned corporations , on our elections .
Speaking in the Rose Garden , the President explained what this new limitless flow of undisclosed money will mean :
They can buy millions of dollars worth of TV ads –- and worst of all , they do n’t even have to reveal who ’s actually paying for the ads .
Instead , a group can hide behind a name like “ Citizens for a Better Future , ” even if a more accurate name would be “ Companies for Weaker Oversight . ”
These shadow groups are already forming and building war chests of tens of millions of dollars to influence the fall elections .
Now , imagine the power this will give special interests over politicians .
Corporate lobbyists will be able to tell members of Congress if they do n’t vote the right way , they will face an onslaught of negative ads in their next campaign .
And all too often , no one will actually know who ’s really behind those ads .
Once again , with a solution at hand , Republican leadership in the Senate stands in the way , hoping to deny an up - or - down vote :
So the House has already passed a bipartisan bill that would change all this before the next election .
The DISCLOSE
Act would simply require corporate political advertisers to reveal who ’s funding their activities .
So when special interests take to the airwaves , whoever is running and funding the ad would have to appear in the advertisement and claim responsibility for it -– like a company ’s CEO or the organization ’s biggest contributor .
And foreign - controlled corporations and entities would be restricted from spending money to influence American elections -- just as they were in the past .
Pounding his hand on his pedestal , the President emphasized again that simple bringing transparency to this kind of spending is about as common - sense as you can get :
And you ’d think that reducing corporate and even foreign influence over our elections would not be a partisan issue .
But of course , this is Washington in 2010 .
And the Republican leadership in the Senate is once again using every tactic and every maneuver they can to prevent the DISCLOSE
Act from even coming up for an up or down vote .
Just like they did with unemployment insurance for Americans who ’d lost their jobs in this recession .
Just like they ’re doing by blocking tax credits and lending assistance for small business owners .
On issue after issue , we are trying to move America forward , and they keep on trying to take us back .
At a time of such challenge for America , we ca n’t afford these political games .
Millions of Americans are struggling to get by , and their voices should n’t be drowned out by millions of dollars in secret , special interest advertising .
The American people ’s voices should be heard .
Pat O’Brien , in the Democratic primary runoff for secretary of state , steps forward with some sound legislative proposals to avoid future fiascos such as has occurred in Garland County .
The Election Commission there reduced the 40 polling places to two for the runoff , though voters countywide have a number of races to consider .
This was the big sin , but it was compounded by a farcical botched attempt to add a day of early voting ( contrary to the law ) to make up for the reduced polling places .
O’Brien ’s ideas :
We know that Bob has his core in mind and that the list announced later today will contain a few surprises but will likely be a reflection of the injury status of many stars more than a statement on their form .
So here is my list of the 30 I would bring into camp based on the list of the 2010 player pool on the US Soccer website and a couple not on that list ( * ) :
Keepers ( 3 ) : Tim Howard ( Everton ) , Marcus Hahnemann ( Wolverhampton ) , Brad Guzan ( Aston Villa )
Defenders ( 9 ) : Carlos Bocanegra ( Stade Rennais ) , Jonathan Bornstein ( Chivas ) Steve Cherundolo ( Hannover 96 ) , Jay DeMerit ( Watford ) , Clarence Goodson ( IK Start ) , Oguchi Onyewu ( AC Milan ) , Heath Pearce ( FC Dallas ) , Frank Simek ( Sheffield Wednesday ) , Jonathan Spector ( West Ham United )
The rest of my list after the jump :
Midfielders ( 11 ) : DaMarcus Beasley ( Rangers ) , Kyle Beckerman ( Real Salt Lake ) , Michael Bradley ( Borussia Moenchenglabach ) , Ricardo Clark ( Eintacht Frankfurt ) , Landon Donvan ( LA Galaxy ) , Maurice Edu ( Rangers ) , Benny Feilhaber ( AGF Aahus ) , Eddie Gaven ( Columbus ) , Stuart Holden ( Bolton ) Sacha Kljestan ( Chivas USA ) , Jose Torres ( Pachuca ) ,
Forwards ( 7 ) : Jozy Altidore ( Hull City ) , Edson Buddle ( LA Galaxy ) * , Conor Casey ( Colorado ) Charlie Davies ( FC Sochaux ) , Clint Dempsey ( Fullham ) , Eddie Johnson ( Aris Thessaloniki ) , Hercules Gomez * ( Puebla )
It was tough but I looked at the results of the 2009 and 2010 USMNT , and tried to verify fitness or who may be fit within the next 4 weeks .
Anyhow that is my 30 that I would bring in , if injury were to keep anyone out here are my backups at each position :
Keepers : Kevin Hartman ( FC Dallas )
Defender : Bobby Convey ( San Jose )
Midfielder : Brad Davis ( Houston ) , Alejandro Bedoya ( Orebro SK )
Forward : Robbie Findley ( Real Salt Lake )
Remember this is just camp , there are probably 20 names on that list that are locks ( we will talk about them in coming weeks ) and the rest are guys fighting for a slot or there in case of injuries .
I do believe that the US roster is more stable in goal and on defense but with injuries and lack of form plaguing some in the midfield and up top , the US attack oriented style may need a boost with some fresh legs and guys who current form is at a very high level .
So later today we will see how many I got right .
OFF MY SOAPBOX
TO CREATE life is the prerogative of gods .
Deep in the human psyche , whatever the rational pleadings of physics and chemistry , there exists a sense that biology is different , is more than just the sum of atoms moving about and reacting with one another , is somehow infused with a divine spark , a vital essence .
It may come as a shock , then , that mere mortals have now made artificial life .
Craig Venter and Hamilton Smith , the two American biologists who unravelled the first DNA sequence of a living organism ( a bacterium ) in 1995 , have made a bacterium that has an artificial genome — creating a living creature with no ancestor ( see article ) .
Pedants may quibble that only the DNA of the new beast was actually manufactured in a laboratory ; the researchers had to use the shell of an existing bug to get that DNA to do its stuff .
Nevertheless , a Rubicon has been crossed .
It is now possible to conceive of a world in which new bacteria ( and eventually , new animals and plants ) are designed on a computer and then grown to order .
That ability would prove mankind 's mastery over nature in a way more profound than even the detonation of the first atomic bomb .
The bomb , however justified in the context of the second world war , was purely destructive .
Biology is about nurturing and growth .
Synthetic biology , as the technology that this and myriad less eye - catching advances are ushering in has been dubbed , promises much .
In the short term it promises better drugs , less thirsty crops ( see article ) , greener fuels and even a rejuvenated chemical industry .
In the longer term who knows what marvels could be designed and grown ?
On the face of it , then , artificial life looks like a wonderful thing .
Yet that is not how many will view the announcement .
For them , a better word than “ creation ” is “ tampering ” .
Have scientists got too big for their boots ?
Will their hubris bring Nemesis in due course ?
What horrors will come creeping out of the flask on the laboratory bench ?
Such questions are not misplaced — and should give pause even to those , including this newspaper , who normally embrace advances in science with enthusiasm .
The new biological science does have the potential to do great harm , as well as good .
“ Predator ” and “ disease ” are just as much part of the biological vocabulary as “ nurturing ” and “ growth ” .
But for good or ill it is here .
Creating life is no longer the prerogative of gods .
Children of a lesser god
It will be a while , yet , before lifeforms are routinely designed on a laptop .
But this will come .
The past decade , since the completion of the Human Genome Project , has seen two related developments that make it almost inevitable .
One is an extraordinary rise in the speed , and fall in the cost , of analysing the DNA sequences that encode the natural “ software ” of life .
What once took years and cost millions now takes days and costs thousands .
Databases are filling up with the genomes of everything from the tiniest virus to the tallest tree .
These genomes are the raw material for synthetic biology .
First , they will provide an understanding of how biology works right down to the atomic level .
That can then be modelled in human - designed software so that synthetic biologists will be able to assemble new constellations of genes with a reasonable presumption that they will work in a predictable way .
Second , the genome databases are a warehouse that can be raided for whatever part a synthetic biologist requires .
The other development is faster and cheaper DNA synthesis .
This has lagged a few years behind DNA analysis , but seems to be heading in the same direction .
That means it will soon be possible for almost anybody to make DNA to order , and dabble in synthetic biology .
That is good , up to a point .
Innovation works best when it is a game that anyone can play .
The more ideas there are , the better the chance some will prosper .
Unfortunately and inevitably , some of those ideas will be malicious .
And the problem with malicious biological inventions — unlike , say , guns and explosives — is that once released , they can breed by themselves .
Biology really is different
The Home Brew computing club launched Steve Jobs and Apple , but similar ventures produced a thousand computer viruses .
What if a home - brew synthetic - biology club were accidentally to launch a real virus or bacterium ?
What if a terrorist were to do the same deliberately ?
The risk of accidentally creating something bad is probably low .
Most bacteria opt for an easy life breaking down organic material that is already dead .
It does n't fight back .
Living hosts do .
Creating something bad deliberately , whether the creator is a teenage hacker , a terrorist or a rogue state , is a different matter .
No one now knows how easy it would be to turbo - charge an existing human pathogen , or take one that infects another type of animal and assist its passage over the species barrier .
We will soon find out , though .
It is hard to know how to address this threat .
The reflex , to restrict and ban , has worked ( albeit far from perfectly ) for more traditional sorts of biological weapons .
Those , though , have been in the hands of states .
The ubiquity of computer viruses shows what can happen when technology gets distributed .
Thoughtful observers of synthetic biology favour a different approach : openness .
This avoids shutting out the good in a belated attempt to prevent the bad .
Knowledge cannot be unlearned , so the best way to oppose the villains is to have lots of heroes on your side .
Then , when a problem arises , an answer can be found quickly .
If pathogens can be designed by laptop , vaccines can be , too .
And , just as “ open source ” software lets white - hat computer nerds work against the black - hats , so open - source biology would encourage white - hat geneticists .
Regulation — and , especially , vigilance — will still be needed .
Keeping an eye out for novel diseases is sensible even when such diseases are natural .
Monitoring needs to be redoubled and co-ordinated .
Then , whether natural or artificial , the full weight of synthetic biology can be brought to bear on the problem .
Encourage the good to outwit the bad and , with luck , you keep Nemesis at bay .
DEPENDING on what kind of spy you are , you either love technology or hate it .
For intelligence - gatherers whose work is based on bugging and eavesdropping , life has never been better .
Finicky miniature cameras and tape recorders have given way to pinhead - sized gadgets , powered remotely ( a big problem in the old days used to be changing the batteries on bugs ) .
Encrypted electronic communications are a splendid target for the huge computers at places such as America 's National Security Agency .
Even a message that is impregnably encoded by today 's standards may be cracked in the future .
That gives security - conscious officials the shivers .
But the same advances are making life a lot harder for the kind of spy who deals with humans rather than bytes .
The basis of spycraft is breaking the rules without being noticed .
As with the Russians arrested last month in America and now deported , that involves moving around inconspicuously , usually under false identities , and handing over and receiving money by undetectable means .
For those that get caught , the consequences can be catastrophic .
The biggest headache is mobile phones .
For spycatchers , these are ideal bugging and tracking devices , which the target kindly keeps powered up .
But that makes them a menace for spies ( and for terrorists , who often operate under the same constraints ) .
Removing the battery and putting the bits in a fridge or other metal container disables any bug , but instantly arouses suspicion .
If two people being followed both take this unusual precaution near the same location at the same time , even the most dull - witted watcher may infer that a clandestine meeting is afoot .
Creating false identities used to be easy : an intelligence officer setting off on a job would take a scuffed passport , a wallet with a couple of credit cards , a driving licence and some family snaps .
In a world based on atoms , cracking that was hard .
Thanks to electrons , it is easy to see if a suspicious visitor 's “ shadow ” checks out .
Visa stamps from other countries can be verified against records in their immigration computers .
A credit reference instantly reveals when the credit cards were issued and how much they have been used .
A claimed employment history can be googled .
Mobile - phone billing records reveal past contacts ( or lack of them ) .
Missing links , in fact , are almost as bad as mistakes .
A pristine mobile phone number is suspicious ( especially when coupled with new credit cards and a new e-mail address , but no Facebook account ) .
An investigation that would have once tied up a team of counter - espionage officers for weeks now takes a few mouse clicks .
With enough effort , a few convincing identities can be kept alive — a minor industry in the spy world involves keeping the credit cards for clandestine work credibly active .
But for serious spies these legends wear out faster than they can be created .
Dead on arrival
Biometric passports are making matters worse .
If you have once entered the United States as a foreigner , your fingerprints and that name are linked for ever in the government 's computers .
The data can be checked by any of several dozen close American allies .
Obtaining a passport with a dead child 's birth certificate is increasingly risky as population registers are computerised .
Stealing a tourist 's passport and changing the photo ( a tactic favoured by Israel 's Mossad ) is no longer easy : in future the biometric data on the chip will need to check out too .
Only the most determined and resourceful countries can do that — and the cost is spiralling .
Technology creates other problems .
Take the dead - letter drop , where an item can be left inconspicuously and securely for someone else to pick up .
Intelligence officers are trained to spot these , in places that are easy to visit and hard to observe ( cisterns and waste bins in public lavatories , or under a heating grating in a church pew , for example ) .
Time was when monitoring a suspected dead - letter box involved laborious work by humans .
Now it can be done invisibly , remotely and automatically .
Next time you bury a beer bottle stuffed with money in a park , you should ponder what cameras and sensors may be hidden in the trees nearby .
The days of the “ illegal ” , living for many years in a foreign country under a near - foolproof false identity , are drawing to a close .
Spymasters are increasingly using “ real people ” instead : globalisation makes it unremarkable for those such as Anna Chapman , one of the ten Russians deported from America ( under her own , legally acquired , British name ) , to study , marry , work and live in a bunch of different countries .
Like so many other once - solid professions , spying is becoming less of a career and more a job for freelancers .
Austerity for workers , tax cuts for business — Europe ’s class policy
8 July 2010
A new report by the statistical office of the European Union , Eurostat , reveals that in the wake of the most serious economic crisis since the 1930s , European governments are continuing to cut corporate taxes while increasing the tax burden on the working population .
Eurostat reports that European governments cut the average rate of corporate taxation across the continent from its 2009 level of 23.5 percent to a new record low of 23.2 percent .
The reduction continues a trend which spans many years and has resulted in a major shift in tax policy .
This is but one expression of the ruthless class policy being pursued by governments across Europe and internationally — whether nominally “ left ” or conservative — to make the working class pay for the crisis of the capitalist system .
The result is ever greater levels of social inequality , as wealth is funnelled from the bottom to the top .
Big business , the banks and the super rich are being increasingly relieved of paying taxes .
The resulting deficits in state budgets , exacerbated by the hundreds of billions awarded to the banks in government rescue packages , are now being addressed through a combination of increased consumption taxes , which fall most heavily on the working class , and savage cuts in social programs and public sector jobs and wages .
Initially , the European Commission set a target corporate tax rate of 45 percent .
By 1992 , the target had been revised downward to 30 percent .
Over the past dozen years , corporate tax rates in Europe have fallen by nearly 12 percent .
The current level of 23.2 percent means that the average rate in Europe is 10 percent lower than the nominal rate in the United States .
Since the middle of the 1990s , Europe ’s biggest economy , Germany , has reduced its corporate tax rate by a staggering 27 percentage points , while its top rate for personal income tax has been cut by 9.5 points .
During the same period , Spain and France slashed their highest income tax rates by approximately 13 percentage points .
Italy reduced its corporate tax rate by 20.8 points and its top personal income tax rate by 6.1 points .
Commenting on the trend in German taxation , Peter Bofinger , a member of the German Council of Economic Experts , wrote in the Süddeutsche Zeitung , “ If we had the tax rates that were in place in 1998 , we would have 75 billion euros more revenue per year . ”
On Wednesday , the German cabinet met to discuss its plans to slash 81.6 billion euros from the country ’s budget over the next four years .
The plans involve major spending cuts in a range of social spheres , with disastrous repercussions for millions of workers and their families .
The sum the government intends to save over four years is nearly equivalent to the annual loss in government revenues due to the lowering of corporate taxes over the past two decades .
Thomas Piketty , professor at the Paris School of Economics , wrote : “ We have tax competition in Europe , and the result is very simple : the mobile factor of production , i.e. , capital , is taxed less and less ; consequently , a less mobile factor like low - skilled labor is overtaxed . ”
This over - taxation of labor takes the form of regular increases in income and consumption taxes .
According to the Eurostat report , average income tax rates increased across Europe to 37.5 percent from 37.1 in 2009 .
Value - added taxes also rose on average in 2009 by nearly 0.5 percent .
Since 2000 , 12 of the 27 EU countries have increased their taxes on commodities , with the highest rates of VAT ( 25 percent ) currently being charged in Hungary , Denmark and Sweden .
The contribution made by labour to state budgets is rising continuously .
Currently , income tax payments constitute 40 percent of all state revenue .
Consumption taxes account for an additional 25 percent .
Business taxes amount to just 15 percent of state revenue .
The invariable consequence of this development is the growth of inequality .
Camille Landais , a French economist working at the University of California , wrote of an “ explosion of top income shares ” in France beginning in the late 1990s , in which tax cuts for business played a major role .
In summing up this process , Landais noted that Europe is still far less unequal than the United States .
“ But the trend is in line with the trends in the United States since the 1980s .
If the tax systems — which are much flatter than most people think — continue to be as flat as they are , it ’s clear that in twenty years there ’s no reason France and Germany would n’t be as unequal as the United States . ”
Author Göran
Therborn argues that such extreme levels of social inequality are incompatible with democracy .
Therborn points out : “ The gap in income between those at the top and the average worker is now much wider than it was in pre-modern times .
In 1688 , English baronets had an annual income about one hundred times higher than that of labourers and out - servants , and 230 times that of cottagers and paupers .
In 2007 - 8 , chief executives of the FTSE top 100 companies received remuneration 141 times higher than the median income of all full - time employees in the UK , and 236 times higher than those of people in “ sales and customer service occupations . ”
This orgy of tax - cutting for big business and the super rich was carried out by European governments of all political persuasions , but in the continent ’s two biggest economies — Germany and France — it was nominally “ left ” governments which initiated the process .
In Germany , unprecedented concessions to business and the banks were implemented by the Social Democratic Party - Green Party coalition led by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder ( 1998 –2005 ) .
In France , it was the Socialist government ( 1997 –2002 ) , led by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , which began the process of drastic cuts in corporate and high - income tax rates , which was continued by subsequent conservative administrations , up to and including the government led by President Nicolas Sarkozy .
These supposedly “ left ” bourgeois parties are no less hostile to the interests of the working class and beholden to the financial elite than their conservative counterparts .
The only solution to the growth of obscene levels of social inequality and the attendant threat of dictatorial forms of rule is the independent political mobilization of the working class across Europe and internationally to take power and carry out the reorganization of society to meet social needs , rather than the profit interests of the banks and big business .

Mayoral candidate Rob Ford was quietly asked to stop coaching football at a Toronto high school following an incident with a student player , say officials with the Toronto District School Board .
Ford was coaching at Newtonbrook Secondary School in North York in 2001 when he had a confrontation with a young player over poor performance on the field , say two witnesses who spoke with the Star on condition of anonymity .
Chris Spence , director of education for the Toronto District School Board , confirmed a dispute between a student and Ford was dealt with internally , although he was not aware of the details .
“ Something did happen and they decided that he was no longer welcome to coach at Newtonbrook , ” said Spence , himself a former pro football player who was not director of the board at the time .
Witnesses interviewed by the Star disagree on whether there was a physical confrontation between Ford and the student player .
Ford , one of his players and an assistant coach at the time deny any physical contact took place .
But a parent and another player say Ford aggressively manhandled the student in anger .
Ford vigorously denied the allegations saying he ’s never assaulted a player and called the claims a “ political ” attack on his candidacy .
“ I ’ve never , ever once gotten into a physical altercation with a player , ” he said in an interview .
“ I ’m in first in the mayor ’s race . . .
They ’re going to do anything to stop me from becoming mayor of the city because they know when I become mayor , the party ’s over .
The gravy train is gonna come to an end and the wasteful spending will stop immediately . ”
While he concedes a verbal dispute with a player , he says he walked away from the confrontation and later quit the team .
Since his departure from Newtonbrook , Ford has been coaching football in the Catholic board where he remains today at Don Bosco .
Details on the incident have remained tightly guarded despite Ford ’s high profile as a city councillor and , now , mayoral candidate .
The TDSB has never before made its concerns over the incident — or Ford ’s dismissal from his coaching duties at the school — public .
Newtonbrook principal Lynne Koffman did not respond to an interview request .
And school vice - principal Katherine Armstrong declined to respond to questions during a telephone interview Monday .
Neither held their current positions when the incident occurred .
Mary Walker , communications supervisor with the Toronto Catholic board , said she was not aware of any allegations against Ford who has been coaching with the board for the past eight years .
“ ( It ) is appreciated and he has continued his commitment to the students of Don Bosco who are in the football program , ” she added .
Ford , who runs a philanthropic foundation that funds youth football in Toronto schools , is viewed by many school officials as a generous supporter of high school athletics across the city including Newtonbrook , Danforth Tech. , Sir Sanford Fleming , Forest Hill Collegiate , Lester B. Pearson and C. W. Jefferies .
Ford “ had shown lots of good will and was really generous , ” said the TDSB ’s Spence .
But questions about Ford ’s on - field conduct have lingered for nearly a decade .
A 2001 Star story reported that “ Ford 's eagerness to help his team .
. . has led to some nasty verbal exchanges with some Toronto District School Board teacher - coaches . ”
Frustrated by his team ’s performance during the game at Appleby College in Oakville in 2001 , Ford allegedly approached a player with heated criticism , say two witnesses .
“ To my horror and that of several other Newtonbrook parents in attendance as well as a large crowd of students , Mr. Ford went berserk , ” said a parent who said he was in attendance that night watching his son play .
He ran out onto the field and “ shook , ” and “ slapped ” the student player , he said .
The referee and others on the Newtonbrook bench quickly intervened , and the player was “ led away in tears , ” he said .
The reason for the alleged outburst was clear , he said : “ The young player had failed to perform up to the coach ’s expectations throughout the game and had been singled out for discipline . ”
The fact that Ford has been allowed to continue coaching is troubling , he said .
“ It is outrageous that a person in a position of trust and responsibility such as a high school football coach could beat up a player in front of many witnesses and walk away with impunity . ”
Ford ’s account of the incident is much different .
He says he pulled the player in question off the field .
When he arrived on the sidelines , the player threw down his helmet and told Ford to “ f --- off . ”
“ I said , ‘ Pardon me .
He said , ‘ You heard what I said . ’ ”
“ I left Newtonbrook on that day .
. . because I could n’t deal with a kid telling me off .
. .
I ’ve never ever been dismissed . ”
Simon Jr. Hall , a running back on the Newtonbrook team at the time who Ford presented to the Star as an interviewee , said he did n’t see any physical confrontation that night .

But he has a different recollection of Ford ’s departure from the team .
“ I remember him talking to us for the last time and telling us he ’s sorry that ( the school ) did n’t want him here no more . ”
“ He was an aggressive coach .
Not every player can handle an aggressive coach .
But I think he got the best out of the players . ”
A former Newtonbrook student who said he witnessed the incident as a Grade 10 player at the time recalled Ford grabbing another player by the throat after a disappointing play .
The teen said something to Ford prompting the coach to go after him .
Ford was allegedly restrained by several football players , and a teacher asked him to leave the game , said the Newtonbrook player who did not wish to give his name .
He recalled that Ford was often “ in students ’ faces , ” and always “ yelling and flipping out , ” calling players “ ass----- , ” “ jerks , ” and “ screw-ups . ”
“ It 's not like that at the university level — my coaches now are not like that at all , ” said the player who now plays football at a Canadian university .
He said the student who was allegedly assaulted did n’t go to the police as he “ was more embarrassed than anything . ”
TDSB ’s Spence said he ’s “ going to assume that the school would have exercised due diligence and they would treat something like that , if it was an assault , very seriously and involve those who need to be involved in a situation like that . ”
“ Of course , we are always concerned about students and student safety , and we want volunteers to come and coach and to support what we try to do .
We certainly have to ensure positive relations . ”
When told of the specifics of the allegations from witnesses , Spence said “ that sounds very serious . . . certainly those allegations would be of great concern to me , and I ’m sure for any school that was thinking of bringing him on to coach . ”
Ron Singer , Ford ’s close friend and the assistant coach that day on the football field , dismisses the allegations saying he does n’t recall any skirmish or physical contact between Ford and the player .
“ The player screamed something to Rob .
I ca n’t remember what he said .
But from what I remember , Rob was n’t even close to him . ”
Singer , a candidate for city council who coached alongside Ford for several years , says his friend is “ tough but fair ” as a coach but has attracted criticism of some of his coaching peers .
“ He ’s strict and a number of coaches have told me he takes it too far , ” said Singer , adding he knows nothing about Ford being removed from coaching in the public school board .
For example , Ford often benches players who miss practice — a policy that Singer supports but one that has earned criticism from some coaches , he says .
“ He feels , and I feel , it ’s not just coaching , it ’s life lessons . ”
Singer said he has no recollections of Ford using verbally abusive language with players .
“ A lot of coaches are animated .
But I do n’t remember him using derogatory comments . ”

Sharron Angle :
We 're going to " pursue " Harry Reid for reposting my Web site -- possibly in court
Now that the Harry Reid campaign has reposted Sharron Angle 's previous campaign Web site advertising her Tea Partying positions , Angle may be heading to court to stop him .
That 's what Angle said on a Nevada radio station this morning .
Asked by her host whether she intends to pursue Reid in court , Angle said : " We are going to pursue it .
I do n't think that Harry is above the law . "
In case you missed the whole backstory , after Angle won the primary she replaced her old campaign Web site with a new one featuring toned - down versions of her previous positions .
The Reid campaign , hoping to draw attention to her Tea Partying , posted a reconstituted version of her old site .
Angle responded with a cease and desist request , which Reid 's camp at first agreed to , before reposting her site last night .
Angle was asked about Reid 's latest in an interview with Nevada radio host Heidi Harris .
" Well your website is like you , it 's your intellectual property , " Angle said .
" So they can't use something that 's yours , intellectual property , unless they pay you for it or get your permission ...
And he did n't ask me for it , and he did n't pay me for it .
I would have sold it to him . "
Angle was asked : " So the latest is that it is up again , and you are just going to have to see as far as pursing this in court ?
Is that the plan ? "
" Well we are going to pursue it , " Angle replied .
" I do n't think that Harry is above the law .
He needs to obey the law if you and I need to obey the law .
Harry is n't immune .
He needs to obey the law as well . "
Listen to the exchange .
It 's unclear precisely how Angle intends to pursue this , but she did seem to answer affirmatively when asked if she was heading to court .
However she decides to pursue this , the upshot is that it could end up drawing even more media attention to her original Web site than it otherwise might have received .
It 's a curious strategy .

Never miss a thing again !
The gay activist and former Army lieutenant who has been a vocal critic of the military ’s Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell policy told Gay City News that he has not received any notice that his discharge under that policy was finalized on June 29 .
“ As far as I know , I have n’t been notified of my discharge except by the Gay City News , ” Choi said on July 21 .
“ Obviously , I expected it to happen . ”
Speaking by phone from Las Vegas a few hours after being released from jail for the arrests that he and seven other members of the activist group GetEqual faced as the result of blocking traffic during a protest , Choi said he learned his discharge was final when Gay City News reported it on July 20 .
He had no clue even though the end result he had prepared for the moment he has gone public in assailment on one of the most idiotic , asinine , and total dumba -- policies we have ever implemented in United States history .
Now it is official ladies and gentlemen : Dan Choi is the latest victim of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
When will we repeal this Straight Jacket - esque policy ?
When ?
( From TWD , not altering any tape and hating any discrimination , have a great rest of the day , and continue that support to get rid of nutty rules . )
Update :
Yes folks , the discharge is official .

At the start of Session 12 of TEDGlobal 2010 , Chris Anderson announced a mystery guest .
“ There ’s a site some of you may know , called WikiLeaks . ”
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange steps onstage for a surprise appearance at TEDGlobal 2010 , in a Q&A with Chris .
We learned how WikiLeaks works : “ We ’re using state - of - the - art encryption and anonymizers to get information .
And we get submissions by mail , regular postal mail .
If we happen to find out the identity of a source , we destroy that information . ”
[ Corrected quotes from TED ’s official transcript follow ]
Chris asked about the recent controversy over leaked diplomatic cables .
( WikiLeaks has tweeted that it was not given the documents . )
Chris asks :
“ If you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables … ” Assange replies : “ We would have released them .
Yeah . ”
Why ?
“ Because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human - rights abuses in those governments .
If you look at declassified cables , that ’s the sort of material that ’s there . ”
Watch now on TED.com : Julian Assange ’s Q&A with Chris Anderson .

Damn Cool Algorithms : Levenshtein Automata
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , tech , coding , damn - cool - algorithms
In a previous Damn Cool Algorithms post , I talked about BK - trees , a clever indexing structure that makes it possible to search for fuzzy matches on a text string based on Levenshtein distance - or any other metric that obeys the triangle inequality .
Today , I 'm going to describe an alternative approach , which makes it possible to do fuzzy text search in a regular index : Levenshtein automata .
Introduction
The basic insight behind Levenshtein automata is that it 's possible to construct a Finite state automaton that recognizes exactly the set of strings within a given Levenshtein distance of a target word .
We can then feed in any word , and the automaton will accept or reject it based on whether the Levenshtein distance to the target word is at most the distance specified when we constructed the automaton .
Further , due to the nature of FSAs , it will do so in O ( n ) time with the length of the string being tested .
Compare this to the standard Dynamic Programming Levenshtein algorithm , which takes O ( mn ) time , where m and n are the lengths of the two input words !
It 's thus immediately apparrent that Levenshtein automaton provide , at a minimum , a faster way for us to check many words against a single target word and maximum distance - not a bad improvement to start with !
Of course , if that were the only benefit of Levenshtein automata , this would be a short article .
There 's much more to come , but first let 's see what a Levenshtein automaton looks like , and how we can build one .
Construction and evaluation
The diagram on the right shows the NFA for a Levenshtein automaton for the word ' food ' , with maximum edit distance 2 .
As you can see , it 's very regular , and the construction is fairly straightforward .
The start state is in the lower left .
States are named using a ne style notation , where n is the number of characters consumed so far , and e is the number of errors .
Horizontal transitions represent unmodified characters , vertical transitions represent insertions , and the two types of diagonal transitions represent substitutions ( the ones marked with a *) and deletions , respectively .
Let 's see how we can construct an NFA such as this given an input word and a maximum edit distance .
I wo n't include the source for the NFA class here , since it 's fairly standard ; for gory details , see the Gist .
Here 's the relevant function in Python :
def levenshtein_automata ( term , k ) : nfa = NFA ( ( 0 , 0 ) ) for i , c in enumerate ( term ) : for e in range ( k + 1 ) : # Correct character nfa.add_transition ( ( i , e ) , c , ( i + 1 , e ) ) if e < k : # Deletion nfa.add_transition (( i , e ) , NFA.ANY , ( i , e + 1 ) ) # Insertion nfa.add_transition (( i , e ) , NFA.
EPSILON , ( i + 1 , e + 1 ) ) # Substitution nfa.add_transition (( i , e ) , NFA.ANY , ( i + 1 , e + 1 ) ) for e in range( k + 1 ) : if e < k : nfa.add_transition ( ( len ( term ) , e ) , NFA.ANY , ( len ( term ) , e + 1 ) ) nfa.add_final_state ( ( len ( term ) , e ) ) return nfa
This should be easy to follow ; we 're basically constructing the transitions you see in the diagram in the most straightforward manner possible , as well as denoting the correct set of final states .
State labels are tuples , rather than strings , with the tuples using the same notation we described above .
Because this is an NFA , there can be multiple active states .
Between them , these represent the possible interpretations of the string processed so far .
For example , consider the active states after consuming the characters ' f ' and ' x ' :
This indicates there are several possible variations that are consistent with the first two characters ' f ' and 'x ' : A single substitution , as in ' fxod ' , a single insertion , as in ' fxood ' , two insertions , as in ' fxfood ' , or a substitution and a deletion , as in ' fxd ' .
Also included are several redundant hypotheses , such as a deletion and an insertion , also resulting in ' fxod ' .
As more characters are processed , some of these possibilities will be eliminated , while other new ones will be introduced .
If , after consuming all the characters in the word , an accepting ( bolded ) state is in the set of current states , there 's a way to convert the input word into the target word with two or fewer changes , and we know we can accept the word as valid .
Actually evaluating an NFA directly tends to be fairly computationally expensive , due to the presence of multiple active states , and epsilon transitions ( that is , transitions that require no input symbol ) , so the standard practice is to first convert the NFA to a DFA using powerset construction .
Using this algorithm , a DFA is constructed in which each state corresponds to a set of active states in the original NFA .
We wo n't go into detail about powerset construction here , since it 's tangential to the main topic .
Here 's an example of a DFA corresponding to the NFA for the input word ' food ' with one allowable error :
Note that we depicted a DFA for one error , as the DFA corresponding to our NFA above is a bit too complex to fit comfortably in a blog post !
The DFA above will accept exactly the words that have an edit distance to the word ' food ' of 1 or less .
Try it out : pick any word , and trace its path through the DFA .
If you end up in a bolded state , the word is valid .
I wo n't include the source for powerset construction here ; it 's also in the gist for those who care .
Briefly returning to the issue of runtime efficiency , you may be wondering how efficient Levenshtein DFA construction is .
We can construct the NFA in O ( kn ) time , where k is the edit distance and n is the length of the target word .
Conversion to a DFA has a worst case of O ( 2n ) time - which leads to a pretty extreme worst - case of O ( 2 kn ) runtime !
Not all is doom and gloom , though , for two reasons :
First of all , Levenshtein automata wo n't come anywhere near the 2n worst - case for DFA construction * .
Second , some very clever computer scientists have come up with algorithms to construct the DFA directly in O ( n ) time , [ SCHULZ2002FAST ] and even a method to skip the DFA construction entirely and use a table - based evaluation method !
Indexing
Now that we 've established that it 's possible to construct Levenshtein automata , and demonstrated how they work , let 's take a look at how we can use them to search an index for fuzzy matches efficiently .
The first insight , and the approach many papers [ SCHULZ2002FAST ] [ MIHOV2004FAST ] take is to observe that a dictionary - that is , the set of records you want to search - can itself be represented as a DFA .
In fact , they 're frequently stored as a Trie or a DAWG , both of which can be viewed as special cases of DFAs .
Given that both the dictionary and the criteria ( the Levenshtein automata ) are represented as DFAs , it 's then possible to efficiently intersect the two DFAs to find exactly the words in the dictionary that match our criteria , using a very simple procedure that looks something like this :
def intersect ( dfa1 , df a2 ) : stack = [ ( " " , dfa1.start_state , dfa2.start_state ) ] while stack : s , state1 , state2 = stack .pop ( ) for edge in set ( dfa1.edges ( state1 ) ) .intersect(dfa2.edges ( state2 ) ) : state1 = dfa1.next ( state1 , edge ) state2 = dfa2.next ( state2 , edge ) if state1 and state2 : s = s + edge stack .
append ((s , state1 , state2 ) ) if dfa1.is_final ( state1 ) and dfa2.is_final ( state2 ) : yield s
That is , we traverse both DFAs in lockstep , only following edges that both DFAs have in common , and keeping track of the path we 've followed so far .
Any time both DFAs are in a final state , that word is in the output set , so we output it .
This is all very well if your index is stored as a DFA ( or a trie or DAWG ) , but many indexes are n't : if they 're in - memory , they 're probably in a sorted list , and if they 're on disk , they 're probably in a BTree or similar structure .
Is there a way we can modify this scheme to work with these sort of indexes , and still provide a speedup on brute - force approaches ?
It turns out that there is .
The critical insight here is that with our criteria expressed as a DFA , we can , given an input string that does n't match , find the next string ( lexicographically speaking ) that does .
Intuitively , this is fairly easy to do : we evaluate the input string against the DFA until we cannot proceed further - for example , because there 's no valid transition for the next character .
Then , we repeatedly follow the edge that has the lexicographically smallest label until we reach a final state .
Two special cases apply here : First , on the first transition , we need to follow the lexicographically smallest label greater than character that had no valid transition in the preliminary step .
Second , if we reach a state with no valid outwards edge , we should backtrack to the previous state , and try again .
This is pretty much the ' wall following ' maze solving algorithm , as applied to a DFA .
For an example of this , take a look at the DFA for food ( 1 ) , above , and consider the input word ' foogle ' .
We consume the first four characters fine , leaving us in state 3141 .
The only out edge from here is ' d ' , while the next character is 'l ' , so we backtrack one step to the previous state , 21303141 .
From here , our next character is ' g ' , and there 's an out - edge for 'f ' , so we take that edge , leaving us in an accepting state ( the same state as previously , in fact , but with a different path to it ) with the output string ' fooh ' - the lexicographically next string in the DFA after ' foogle ' .
Here 's the Python code for it , as a method on the DFA class .
As previously , I have n't included boilerplate for the DFA , which is all here .
def next_valid_string ( self , input ) : state = self .start_state stack = [ ]
# Evaluate the DFA as far as possible for i , x in enumerate ( input ) : stack .
append ( ( input [ :i ] , state , x ) ) state = self.next_state ( state , x ) if not state : break else : stack .
append ( ( input [ :i+1 ] , state , None ) ) if self.is_final ( state ) : # Input word is already valid return input # Perform a ' wall following ' search for the lexicographically smallest # accepting state .
while stack : path , state , x = stack .pop ( ) x = self.find_next_edge( state , x ) if x : path += x state = self.next_state ( state , x ) if self.is_final ( state ) : return path stack .
append ( ( path , state , None ) ) return None
In the first part of the function , we evaluate the DFA in the normal fashion , keeping a stack of visited states , along with the path so far and the edge we intend to attempt to follow out of them .
Then , assuming we did n't find an exact match , we perform the backtracking search we described above , attempting to find the smallest set of transitions we can follow to come to an accepting state .
For some caveats about the generality of this function , read on ...
Also needed is the utility function find_next_edge , which finds the lexicographically smallest outwards edge from a state that 's greater than some given input :
def find_next_edge ( self , s , x ) : if x is None : x = u'\0 ' else : x = unichr ( ord ( x ) + 1 ) state_transitions = self.transitions.get(s , {} ) if x in state_transitions or s in self .
defaults : return x labels = sorted ( state_transitions.keys ( ) ) pos = bisect.bisect_left( labels , x ) if pos < len( labels ) : return labels [ pos ] return None
With some preprocessing , this could be made substantially more efficient - for example , by pregenerating a mapping from each character to the first outgoing edge greater than it , rather than using binary search to find it in many cases .
I once again leave such optimizations as an exercise for the reader .
Now that we have this procedure , we can finally describe how to search the index with it .
The algorithm is surprisingly simple :
Obtain the first element from your index - or alternately , a string you know to be less than any valid string in your index - and call it the ' current ' string .
Feed the current string into the ' DFA successor ' algorithm we outlined above , obtaining the ' next ' string .
If the next string is equal to the current string , you have found a match - output it , fetch the next element from the index as the current string , and repeat from step 2 .
If the next string is not equal to the current string , search your index for the first string greater than or equal to the next string .
Make this the new current string , and repeat from step 2 .
And once again , here 's the implementation of this procedure in Python :
def find_all_matches ( word , k , lookup_func ) : " " " Uses lookup_func to find all words within levenshtein distance k of word .
Args : word :
The word to look up k : Maximum edit distance lookup_func :
A single argument function that returns the first word in the database that is greater than or equal to the input argument .
Yields :
Every matching word within levenshtein distance k from the database . " " " lev = levenshtein_automata ( word , k) .to_dfa( ) match = lev.next_valid_string ( u'\0 ' ) while match : next = lookup_func ( match ) if not next : return if match == next : yield match next = next + u'\0 ' match = lev.next_valid_string ( next )
One way of looking at this algorithm is to think of both the Levenshtein DFA and the index as sorted lists , and the procedure above to be similar to App Engine 's " zigzag merge join " strategy .
We repeatedly look up a string on one side , and use that to jump to the appropriate place on the other side .
If there 's no matching entry , we use the result of the lookup to jump ahead on the first side , and so forth .
The result is that we skip over large numbers of non-matching index entries , as well as large numbers of non-matching Levenshtein strings , saving us the effort of exhaustively enumerating either of them .
Hopefully it 's apparrent from the description that this procedure has the potential to avoid the need to evaluate either all of the index entries , or all of the candidate Levenshtein strings .
As a side note , it 's not true that for all DFAs it 's possible to find a lexicographically minimal successor to any string .
For example , consider the successor to the string ' a ' in the DFA that recognizes the pattern ' a+b ' .
The answer is that there is n't one : it would have to consist of an infinite number of ' a ' characters followed by a single ' b ' character !
It 's possible to make a fairly simple modification to the procedure outlined above such that it returns a string that 's guaranteed to be a prefix of the next string recognized by the DFA , which is sufficient for our purposes .
Since Levenshtein DFAs are always finite , though , and thus always have a finite length successor ( except for the last string , naturally ) , we leave such an extension as an exercise for the reader .
There are potentially interesting applications one could put this approach to , such as indexed regular expression search , which would require this modification .
Testing
First , let 's see this in action .
We 'll define a simple Matcher class , which provides an implementation of the lookup_func required by our find_all_matches function :
class Matcher ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , l ) : self .l = l self .
probes = 0 def __call__( self , w ) : self.
probes += 1 pos = bisect.bisect_left( self.l , w ) if pos < len( self.l ) : return self .l[ pos ] else : return None
Note that the only reason we implemented a callable class here is because we want to extract some metrics - specifically , the number of probes made - from the procedure ; normally a regular or nested function would be perfectly sufficient .
Now , we need a sample dataset .
Let 's load the web2 dictionary for that :
>>> words = [ x.strip ( ) .lower ( ) . decode ( ' utf - 8 ' ) for x in open ( '/usr/share/dict/web2 ' ) ] >>> words.sort ( ) >>> len( words ) 234936
We could also use a couple of subsets for testing how things change with scale :
>>> words10 = [ x for x in words if random.random ( ) <= 0.1 ] >>> words100 = [ x for x in words if random.random ( ) <= 0.01 ]
And here it is in action :
>>> m = Matcher ( words ) >>> list ( automata.find_all_matches ( ' nice ' , 1 , m ) ) [ u' anice ' , u'bice ' , u'dice ' , u'fice ' , u'ice ' , u'mice ' , u'nace ' , u'nice ' , u'niche ' , u'nick ' , u'nide ' , u'niece ' , u'nife ' , u'nile ' , u'nine ' , u'niue ' , u'pice ' , u'rice ' , u'sice ' , u'tice ' , u'unice ' , u'vice ' , u'wice ' ] >>> len(_ ) 23 >>> m.probes 142
Working perfectly !
Finding the 23 fuzzy matches for ' nice ' in the dictionary of nearly 235,000 words required 142 probes .
Note that if we assume an alphabet of 26 characters , there are 4+26*4+26*5=238 strings within levenshtein distance 1 of ' nice ' , so we 've made a reasonable saving over exhaustively testing all of them .
With larger alphabets , longer strings , or larger edit distances , this saving should be more pronounced .
It may be instructive to see how the number of probes varies as a function of word length and dictionary size , by testing it with a variety of inputs :
String length Max strings Small dict Med dict Full dict 1 79 47 ( 59 % ) 54 ( 68 % ) 81 ( 100 % ) 2 132 81 ( 61 % ) 103 ( 78 % ) 129 ( 97 % ) 3 185 94 ( 50 % ) 120 ( 64 % ) 147 ( 79 % ) 4 238 94 ( 39 % ) 123 ( 51 % ) 155 ( 65 % ) 5 291 94 ( 32 % ) 124 ( 43 % ) 161 ( 55 % )
In this table , ' max strings ' is the total number of strings within edit distance one of the input string , and the values for small , med , and full dict represent the number of probes required to search the three dictionaries ( consisting of 1 % , 10 % and 100 % of the web2 dictionary ) .
All the following rows , at least until 10 characters , required a similar number of probes as row 5 .
The sample input string used consisted of prefixes of the word ' abracadabra ' .
Several observations are immediately apparrent :
For very short strings and large dictionaries , the number of probes is not much lower - if at all - than the maximum number of valid strings , so there 's little saving .
As the string gets longer , the number of probes required increases significantly slower than the number of potential results , so that at 10 characters , we need only probe 161 of 821 ( about 20 % ) possible results .
At commonly encountered word lengths ( 97 % of words in the web2 dictionary are at least 5 characters long ) , the savings over naively checking every string variation are already significant .
Although the size of the sample dictionaries differs by an order of magnitude , the number of probes required increases only a little each time .
This provides encouraging evidence that this will scale well for very large indexes .
It 's also instructive to see how this varies for different edit distance thresholds .
Here 's the same table , for a max edit distance of 2 :
String length Max strings Small dict Med dict Full dict 1 2054 413 ( 20 % ) 843 ( 41 % ) 1531 ( 75 % ) 2 10428 486 ( 5 % ) 1226 ( 12 % ) 2600 ( 25 % ) 3 24420 644 ( 3 % ) 1643 ( 7 % ) 3229 ( 13 % ) 4 44030 646 ( 1.5 % ) 1676 ( 4 % ) 3366 ( 8 % ) 5 69258 648 ( 0.9 % ) 1676 ( 2 % ) 3377 ( 5 % )
This is also promising : with an edit distance of 2 , although we 're having to do a lot more probes , it 's a much smaller percentage of the number of candidate strings .
With a word length of 5 and an edit distance of 2 , having to do 3377 probes is definitely far preferable to doing 69,258 ( one for every matching string ) or 234,936 ( one for every word in the dictionary ) !
As a quick comparison , a straightforward BK - tree implementation with the same dictionary requires examining 5858 nodes for a string length of 5 and an edit distance of 1 ( with the same sample string used above ) , while the same query with an edit distance of 2 required 58,928 nodes to be examined !
Admittedly , many of these nodes are likely to be on the same disk page , if structured properly , but there 's still a startling difference in the number of lookups .
One final note :
The second paper we referenced in this article , [ MIHOV2004FAST ] describes a very nifty construction : a universal Levenshtein automata .
This is a DFA that determines , in linear time , if any pair of words are within a given fixed Levenshtein distance of each other .
Adapting the above scheme to this system is , also , left as an exercise for the reader .

Robust proofs of this hypothesis are welcome .

Pakistan ’s Suspicious Public
A series of militant attacks over the last week have sparked widespread anger in Pakistan .
Suicide bombers killed 62 people at government offices in the tribal agency of Mohmand today , and last Friday , over 40 worshippers died in an extremist attack on the shrine of Hazrat Data Ganj Baksh , the country ’s most important Sufi place of worship .
In Pakistan , however , much of this outrage has been directed at Washington and Islamabad rather than at the terrorists .
" America is killing Muslims in Afghanistan and in our tribal areas [ using drone attacks ] , " argued one Pakistani interviewed in the aftermath of the attack , explaining why the United States is ultimately to blame for the bombing .
" [ M]ilitants are attacking Pakistan to express anger against the government for supporting America . "
Similar sentiments have circulated widely on Pakistan ’s hugely influential private TV networks .
To understand this reaction , it is necessary to grasp the complexity of the domestic Pakistani debate about militancy .
The good news is that , over the last 12 months , ordinary Pakistanis have decisively turned against the Taliban ’s religious agenda .
The bad news is that Pakistanis have simultaneously become even more anti-American — which in turn is distorting their perception of counterinsurgency .
Pakistani perceptions of the Taliban ’s religious program have shifted from tacit acceptance to revulsion .
For a long time , the Taliban argued that they simply wanted to make the country more pious .
Until 2009 , most Pakistanis saw nothing wrong with that declared intention and largely opposed military operations against militant havens in northwestern Pakistan .
Last year , 80 percent of Pakistanis approved of Islamabad ’s February 2009 truce with the Taliban , which ratified jihadi control over large areas of the North - West Frontier Province .
But after the brutality of the Taliban ’s " Islamic " rule became self - evident , Pakistani perceptions changed .
Last October , Islamabad , acting with broad public support , launched a major offensive against Taliban bases in South Waziristan .
It has since followed that up with other operations in the tribal areas — for example , the Army is currently fighting in Orakzai .
Today , public approval of the Taliban has all but collapsed .
According to polling conducted by Gallup last December , no more than 5 percent of the population in any of the country ’s four provinces believes that the Taliban has a positive influence on their lives , including a meager 1 percent in the North - West Frontier Province .
But these heartening developments have been accompanied by a contrary and troubling trend : the hardening of anti-American sentiment among ordinary Pakistanis .
Of 28 countries polled by the Program on International Policy Attitudes for the BBC World Service in April , Pakistan was one of only two countries where a majority of the public held negative views of the United States .
And in another Gallup survey , when asked to identify the biggest threat to their country , 59 percent of Pakistanis identified the United States , while only 11 percent named the Taliban .
Pakistani disenchantment with the United States has skewed public discourse about extremism .
When Washington urges Islamabad to fight militancy , distrustful Pakistanis question whether counterinsurgency is really in their own national interests .
When U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured Pakistan in a series of town - hall meetings last November , one of her talking points was that Washington and Islamabad were fighting a common terrorist enemy .
But many Pakistanis rejected this contention .
As one journalist told Clinton , " We are fighting a war that is imposed on us .
It ’s not our war .
It is your war . "
At first glance , the stubbornness of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan can seem difficult to understand .
After all , President Barack Obama ’s administration has made significant policy shifts in response to enduring Pakistani grievances with past U.S. administrations .
For example , the United States is currently bolstering democracy by moving beyond an exclusive partnership with the Pakistani military and deepening relations with civilian political parties .
Moreover , Washington has allocated unprecedented dollars for a wide array of development and infrastructure programs , including vital projects in the energy and water sectors .
But many of these laudable measures — necessarily focused on long - term issues — have yet to show tangible benefits .
By contrast , Pakistanis are perpetually confronted by the coercive elements of U.S. power .
Constant media reports on drone strikes , the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the operation of private mercenary agencies and spy networks in Pakistan fortify a decades - long narrative of the United States as hostile and anti-Muslim .
Much of the media ’s reflexive demagoguery is made worse by credible reports of the local presence of organizations such as the security firm formerly known as Blackwater — reviled throughout the Muslim world .
Some might argue that rising anti-Americanism in Pakistan is insignificant as long as the United States maintains strong ties to officials in Islamabad and can convince them to expand military operations against militants .
But Pakistani suspicion of the United States is the Taliban ’s last remaining trump card :
If it is allowed to fester , the insurgency might regain the public ’s indulgence .
These opinions have broad currency in part because Pakistan ’s political leaders have yet to craft a compelling counterterrorism narrative .
Even worse , some mainstream Pakistani politicians have internalized the assumptions of Taliban propaganda .
Shahbaz Sharif , the chief minister of Punjab and one of the most powerful politicians in the country , declared in March that the Taliban should refrain from terrorism in Punjab because his political party , the Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) , had also " rejected dictation from abroad " — implying the two groups shared a common purpose against the United States .
Instead of allowing extremists to frame the domestic debate , Pakistan ’s leaders should foster a vigorous discussion that honestly confronts the jihadi Frankenstein .
Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani ’s call to bring together all major political parties for a national conference on extremism in the aftermath of the Data Ganj Baksh attack is a long - overdue step in the right direction .
For its part , the United States should consider whether some aspects of its counterterrorism campaign — such as the use of companies like Blackwater — have more costs than benefits in terms of public perception .
And both Washington and Islamabad need to collectively generate a narrative in which the two countries are seen to work in concert rather than in opposition .
Otherwise , anti-American sentiment in Pakistan will function as a protective shield for extremists for a long time to come .
Haselden Construction
The federal government has just finished construction on a zero-energy office building , the nation ’s largest , and is hoping that commercial developers will follow its lead .
The 222,000 - square - foot Research Support Facility is on the Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory campus in Golden , Colo .
Just over 800 employees will occupy the building once it officially opens in late August .
A zero-energy building creates as much energy as it uses over the course of a year , said John Andary , a principal at Stantec , the sustainable design consultants for the project .
Thanks to various “ passive ” design techniques and technologies , the facility will consume 50 percent less energy than buildings constructed to current commercial codes , he predicts .
The remaining power needs will be generated onsite from solar panels , allowing the building to operate at an annual net - zero energy basis .
Remarkably , many of the efficiency “ innovations ” are existing building techniques , some of them centuries old , that were developed to make the best use of natural light and the earth ’s ability to heat and cool .
By contrast , modern building design , based on the ubiquity of cheap energy , moved away from many of those principles .
“ We went back to simple design techniques that were used before there were electric lights and before we had air conditioning compressors , ” Mr. Andary said .
“ What you had then were narrow buildings that optimized the use of daylight and windows you could open to provide ventilation . ”
The building ’s east - to - west orientation and narrow 60 - foot width will bring daylight into all interior work spaces .
Typical office buildings may devote 30 percent of their total energy expenditures to lighting alone .
To take advantage of the operable windows , one of the building ’s many “ smart ” features will notify occupants in a message sent to their computer screens when they should open or close their windows , based on a comparison of inside and outside temperatures .
Mr. Andary described the walls as “ concrete sandwich panels ” – a layer of concrete on the outside , a layer of insulation and then a smooth concrete layer facing the interior office space .
“ This gives the same effect as an old stone cathedral where the mass of the building absorbs heat during the day to keep the interior cool , and then releases this heat when the temperature drops at night , ” he said .
A low - energy radiant heating and cooling system will further control the interior temperatures .
Rather than using a traditional ( and energy demanding ) forced air system to heat and cool the building , the radiant system essentially heats or chills the building mass itself using water pipes in the concrete floor slabs that circulate hot or cold water depending on the season .
Corrugated metal panels cover much of the building ’s south exterior , capturing solar heat and funneling it to a concrete thermal labyrinth beneath the building that also serves as the foundation .
The labyrinth stores the heat or can release it into the building when additional heating is required during the coldest months .
Much of the building is composed of recycled materials , including some from the runway of Denver ’s defunct Stapleton Airport .
Reclaimed steel natural gas pipes are used as structural columns .
The lobby is lined with wood recovered from Colorado pine trees destroyed by a bark beetle infestation that has been unfolding in this part of the country since 1996 .
The Department of Energy expects the project to get a platinum rating from the United States Green Building Council ’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , or LEED , program .
Platinum is its highest rating under LEED , the mostly widely accepted green building certification .
Although more expensive than conventional commercial buildings , the new building ’s cost , $ 259 per square foot , is in line with that of other LEED buildings .
The Department of Energy is hoping that the building will become a showcase for energy - efficient design .
“ Once we prove that the building works , and we will be monitoring this very carefully , we think others will want to emulate what we ’ve done here , ” said Bill Glover , the chief operating officer of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
The Department of Energy plans to share the building ’s design with any interested party through the publication of a how - to manual at the laboratory ’s Web site this fall .
Here ’s a video documentary on the project :
Often the very best jokes are laden with insight , and one of my favorite such jokes belongs to Demetri Martin , who says , “ It ’s interesting that ‘ cologne ’ rhymes with ‘ alone ’ . ”
Zing !
The word cologne evokes images of greasy dudes in Ed Hardy t- shirts , teenage boys with more scents than sense , and clueless divorcees getting back into the “ dating scene . ”
This was my presumption when Fashionista asked me to look into the state of men ’s cologne , yet once I ventured down this particularly pungent little rabbit hole , I realized just how misguided that presumption was .
Beginning with the name .
“ Cologne is a marketing word that Americans have been taught to use , ” says Chandler Burr , perfume critic for the New York Times .
“ The word ‘ cologne ’ in the U.S. means nothing .
You should just call it ‘ scent ’ . ”
So what ’s cologne ?
“ Cologne is a very specific recipe , ” Burr adds .
“ It ’s a citrus with an aromatic effect ; it ’s basically lemon , bitter orange , grapefruit , bergamot , and then maybe nutmeg or cinnamon added , maybe some other spice . ”
What we ’re looking for then is men’s " scent , " or " fragrance , " which unlike cologne ( perfumes based in alcohol were not invented until 1370 , in Hungary ) , has been around as long as civilization .
As for where men ’s fragrances are now , there ’s no one answer : Sales are both up and down — and like the scents themselves , the devil is in the details .
“ The fragrance market has been in decline for several years , ” says Karen Grant , Vice President and Senior Industry Analyst for Beauty at National Purchase Diary , a group that tracks department store sales .
“ Men ’s fragrances were picking up around the time of the early metrosexual trend : 2001 – 2002 .
Then we saw a dropoff … .
It ’s been in decline ever since . ”
Throughout the 2000s , a celebrity would pop up with a fragrance from time to time , Diddy for instance , which would help drive sales .
But these surges were ephemeral , and now the celebrity trend has faded completely .
Last year , the sales of high - end men ’s fragrances ( these are the scents sold at Sephora and in the big department stores , not , say , Walmart ) hovered around $ 779 million , a 10 % drop from 2008 , which was 8 % less than 2007 .
But just because the big stores are selling less , does n’t mean people are n’t buying fragrances .
“ The one area of the market where we ’re seeing the most stability is in what we would call these ‘ niche ’ fragrances .
Where it ’s very special .
Those could be fragrances at Barneys or Saks , or even the higher end . ”
While the big market , designer brand fragrances ( “ commercial…shit ” Burr calls it ) , like Acqua di Gio , are still the bestsellers , they have also taken the biggest hit .
They ’re losing younger customers to deodorant sprays , like Axe , and older more sophisticated clientele to the niche brands like Le Labo and Frederic Malle .
“ We do n’t sell much of Acqua di Gio .
We do n’t sell a lot of Tom Ford , ” says Bettina O’Neill , VP of Cosmetics and Fragrances at Barneys New York ( who , in fact , only carries the former as part of an arrangement with the Armani brand ) .
“ We find our customers do n’t want to smell like anyone else .
More so men than women . ”
Wow , I have finally found the ultimate CLI downloader .
I have spent the last day searching for an OS X alternative to the single - threaded wget and curl , that was multi- threaded and would handle HTTPS traffic , and I tried 'em all .
I tried puf , which does n't handle HTTPS at all , axel , which pretends to handle HTTPS but I caught it actually using HTTP instead ( tcpdump is your little snitch friend ) .
Naughty , naughty , axel , for giving us a false sense of security …
That 's worse than no security at all .
Then I found the truly amazing aria2 .
It not only worked first time , right out of the box , handling HTTPS traffic flawlessly ( believe me , I checked ) , but it downloaded files at record speeds -- my full allotted bandwidth .
I have been looking for a CLI alternative to DownThemAll for Firefox because DTA cripples Firefox and slows the entire system on my pretty fast 8 - core Mac Pro .
It just struggles to maintain a difficult connection , and I have plenty of those .
aria2 handles these with ease and does not in any way slow my system down .
The download speed is much more consistent than DTA too -- no choppiness like in DTA when it loses the connection for many seconds .
It just sits there in the background downloading away at max speed .
Wow .
Goodbye DTA …
I used the following syntax to get these speeds : ' aria2c --file-allocation=none -c -x 10 -s 10 -d " mydir " URL ' .
Note that aria2c is what HomeBrew has named aria2 -- do n't ask why , I do n't know … '- - file -allocation=none ' speeds up the initialization of the download which can take quite a long time for a multi-GB file otherwise . ' - c ' allows continuation of a download if it was incomplete the first time .
This came in really handy when , for some reason , the speed started flagging and I 'ctrl - c'ed out of the download and restarted it .
It resumed right where it left off at max speed .
Nice . ' -x 10 ' and ' -s 10 ' give 10 connections per server to speed things along .
I suspect the ' -s 10 ' is unnecessary but I prefer to err on the side of overkill . '- d' downloads files to a directory .
To install aria2 on OS X , install HomeBrew if you do n't have it and then type : ' brew install aria2 '
To view the huge man page : ' man aria2c ' .
The above usage is only the tip of the iceberg for this incredible app .
I only download one file at a time from normal HTTP(S ) URLs but it is capable of downloading multiple files simultaneously from mixed HTTP( S ) , FTP , BitTorrent , and Metalink sources .
And the options are more than anyone can handle in a lifetime .
As I said , the man page is huge .
No other download client even comes close to the many uses and capabilities of this app .
It is truly ' The next generation download utility ' ( as stated on the home page of aria2 on sourceforge . net ) .
I have only scratched the surface .
Kudos to all the devs who labored hard and long to bring this app to fruition and make it available for free to all of us .
Great job !
My good friend G.F.B. recently observed that the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe uncannily mirrors the global financial meltdown that was triggered by the September , 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers .
G.F.B. suggested that the Deepwater Horizon fiasco mirrored the global financial meltdown , almost as if it were a physical manifestation of the same hubris , denial of risk , manipulation and misinformation which collapsed the global financial house of cards .
How ?
Consider :
1 . The extreme levels of inherent risk in each system were downplayed / misunderstood by those responsible for their management .
2 . The unprecedented risk intrinsic to each system was masked by facsimiles of regulation and specialized expertise .
3 . The initial warning signs were dismissed , downplayed or ignored .
4 . Each system was on the outer edge of human engineering ( mechanical and financial ) but was treated by regulators and managers as entirely standard .
5 . Once the system collapsed , nobody knew how to fix it .
6 . As the full extent of the damage became apparent , those responsible sought to mask the true extent pf the damage .
7 . The mainstream media and elected officials unskeptically accepted prevarications , mis-statements , misinformation and manufactured facades as representations of the truth .
8 . As the true extent of the damage , distortion / manipulation and failure of responsible authorities became undeniable , public confidence in government , regulatory agencies and the market irrevocably eroded .
Here is a chart of the market with my notes .
This basic pattern applies to Deepwater Horizon as well , only on a much shorter timescale .
Did n't anyone notice that it is the height of insanity to be drilling down 18,000 feet down into a seabed which is 5,000 below the surface of the sea ?
There 's plenty of oil around , really ; we 're just drilling down 23,000 feet into marginal oil deposits just because we enjoy a challenge .

Miscellaneous dreams are dreams which do not have the aspects of other dreams .
They could be called normal or ordinary dreams even though no dream is normal or ordinary .
Lucid dreams are dreams in which the dreamer realizes they are dreaming and can take control of their dreams .
Prophetic dreams are dreams an individual has that have come true at a later date .
Sexual dreams are those dreams involving anything sexual or erotic .
Nightmares are dreams which involve elements that are frightening .
Start Sharing !
Kiddies , gather round and let me tell you another chapter in the story of " If you irritate people , they act irritated . "
Let 's begin with a recap : just before the Copenhagen climate conference , a large wodge ( that 's a technical term ) of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit at University of East Anglia magically appeared in public .
Those e-mails contained all the makings of a false controversy .
And , as you can imagine , anyone who had been grinding an axe wasted no time in placing said axe vigorously into the back of any climate scientist they could find .
The first target was Phil Jones , head of the Climate Research Unit .
The colloquial language used in his e-mail correspondence was trumpeted as fraud , while he also showed that his response to harassment ( and there is no doubt that he was being harassed ) was to become belligerent and petty - minded .
Jones was cleared by not one , not two , but three separate enquiries .
Target number two was Michael Mann at Penn State in the US .
He had corresponded with Phil Jones and , of course , in the leaked e-mails much of that correspondence became public .
Skeptics swung into action and rained complaints down on Penn State .
Although no formal accusations of fraud were made , the tone of the e-mails was apparent and Penn State launched its own enquiry .
The first problem is that there was no specific complaint , so one had to be constructed .
The university eventually used the e-mails to construct a single complaint that covered the general themes .
These complaints were :
Allegation 1 : " Did you engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions with the intent to suppress or falsify data ? " Allegation 2 : " Did you engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions with the intent to delete , conceal or otherwise destroy emails , information and / or data , related to AR4 [ a particular dataset whose handling had been questioned in the enquiries that Phil Jones went through ] , as suggested by Phil Jones ? "
Allegation 3 : " Did you engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any misuse of privileged or confidential information available to you in your capacity as an academic scholar ? "
Allegation 4 : " Did you engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing , conducting , or reporting research or other scholarly activities ? "
To determine if there was any truth behind these allegations , the university assembled a team of academics from both within and outside the university .
The individual committee members reviewed relevant " ...e- mail correspondence , journal articles , Op - Ed columns , newspaper and magazine articles , the National Academy of Sciences report entitled ' Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years , ' ISBN : 0 - 309-66144-7 and various blogs on the Internet . "
From this , they drafted an additional 15 more specific questions that needed to be answered in addition to the four general allegations .
Mann answered these and follow - up questions in a two - hour interview .
He was then asked to provide all e-mails related to the fourth IPCC report — these are the e-mails that Phil Jones had requested be deleted — which he did , along with a file that indexed the e-mails and a further 10 pages of supplemental information .
One of the hurdles with any enquiry into a scientific topic is trying to interpret the data and analysis methods .
Each branch of science has built up its techniques through years of testing , and it takes a long time to master and understand why things are done the way they are done .
To cope with this particular hurdle , the committee consulted an outside expert .
However , as we will see , they felt that this was not a sufficiently close examination .
The conclusion of this investigation was that Mann had not suppressed or falsified data .
Nor had he deleted e-mails and / or data related to AR4 .
And Mann had not misused privileged information .
In other words , Mann had been above board for allegations one , two and three .
Decision four was to launch another enquiry :
Decision 4 : The Inquiry Committee determined that " given that information emerged in the form of the e-mails purloined from CRU in November 2009 , which have raised questions in the public 's mind about Dr. Mann 's conduct of his research activity , given that this may be undermining confidence in his findings as a scientist , and given that it may be undermining public trust in science in general and climate science specifically , an Investigatory Committee of faculty peers from diverse fields should be constituted under RA - 10 [ university regulation ] to further consider this allegation . "
Thus , with this short paragraph the enquiry spawned another enquiry .
The second enquiry interviewed both Mann and a number of other scientists to determine Mann 's view on data sharing , code sharing , and manuscript sharing .
This was then compared to the views of other scientists , including Richard Lindzen , a well known critic of Mann's .
What was found was that Mann was exactly in line with the community as far as data sharing goes : the collector gets first use , after that the data is placed in a repository that allows public access .
The processed data gets presented in papers , while the in - between steps are not made public .
Code sharing was uncommon for a variety of reasons in the past , but is now more common .
It is , however , performed on a collegial basis , rather than through repositories .
All scientists , except one , felt that the methods section of the paper was sufficient to replicate results , negating the need for code sharing as a rule .
Although the other scientists had a range of views , Mann was pretty much right in line with the majority of the scientists consulted .
The only place where Mann found himself near one end of the spectrum was on sharing papers that were still going through peer review .
He had , in the past , shared papers that he had peer reviewed but were not yet published .
In these cases , the papers were authored by scientists that he had close contact with and were sent to other close contacts with the stipulation that they were not to be passed on .
He said that although he did not have explicit permission , he understood that he had implicit permission ( e.g. , he felt that his friends trusted his judgment ) .
The other scientists offered a mix of opinion on this , with some specifically requiring explicit permission , while others did not .
The end result : Mann is a scientist who behaves like a scientist .
He is above board and , given his record , an extremely good researcher .

Electric and ultra low carbon emission vehicles for sale in the UK are set to be eligible for 25 % off the purchase price of their sticker price ( limited to £ 5,000 or $ 7,760 USD ) from January 2011 .
The move was initially announced by the previous British government in 2009 but was put on hold until the Autumn spending review this year .
This new subsidy will drop the price of the Nissan Leaf in the UK from £ 28,350 to £ 23,350 ( $ 44,000 to $ 36,240 USD ) .
The number of electric cars and ultra low carbon emission cars in the showrooms is set to climb rapidly over the next 2 years and markets like the UK where fuel prices are significantly more expensive than other developed nations are likely to see a notable swing towards low and zero emissions vehicles if for no reason other than the fuel savings they offer .
The Nissan Leaf has a 3 pence per mile ( 4.5 USC ) operating cost , a cost so low that gasoline vehicles would have to go back to the mid 1960 ’s to operate as cheaply .

Artist creates a real life face book , photographing his appearance daily in a project he will continue until he dies
Advertisement
An artist has created a literal ' face book ' by taking a picture of his face every day for the last 12 years and posting them online .
When artist Jonathan Keller spent the last of his money on a fancy digital camera in 1998 , his girlfriend at the time was n't pleased .
When she demanded to know if he intended to use it every day , his answer was a defiant one .
However , the only thing he could think to photograph on a daily basis was himself .
Sitting at home in his bedroom he took a snapshot of his face .
The next day , he took another .
Scroll down for a video documenting eight years of the project .
[ caption ]
Exactly 3,931 snapshots later , the New Yorker now has a complete archive of his daily visage since 1998 - minus a few weeks he spent in Antarctica without his camera .
In one of the first , he is pictured as a fresh - faced student with unruly hair and glasses .
As time goes on , he can be seen ditching the glasses for contact lenses and experimenting with a number of hairstyles , from closely - shaven to shoulder - length locks .
And after compiling a video of thousands of the shots , his face is now one of the best - known on the internet , having been viewed millions of times on YouTube .
The 34 - year - old , who lives with his wife , fellow artist Keetra Dean Dixon , said : ' I like to say that the project began out of spite .
' I purchased a digital camera way back in 1998 which was rather expensive and at that time I really did n't have that much money .
After some discussions about the appropriateness of the purchase , my girlfriend at the time mockingly asked if I was going to " use it every day " .
[ caption ]
' I stated that I certainly would and resolved to start this project .
I wanted to examine the subtle and not - so - subtle visual changes that one experiences on a daily basis .
' For some reason , at the time , I did n't think too much about the long - term metamorphosis that I was about to embark on .
It did n't take more than a month to change my mind though . '
Mr Keller , who uses the name JK Keller for his artworks , soon realised that his photo project had taken on a life of its own .
A self - confessed obsessive compulsive , he has vowed to take the pictures every day for the rest of his life .
Every pimple , cut , beard and haircut he's had over the past 12 years have been recorded for posterity in a work which will only be complete when he dies .
' To stop now with be anathema to every fibre of my being , ' he said .
' Aside from the first three photos , I have always attempted to use a white background or as close as I can get when I 'm traveling .
I keep my face basically expressionless and hold the camera out in front of me with my arms as opposed to using a tripod .
[ caption ]
' Since I was initially interested in subtle changes that occurred daily , I wanted these aspects to act as a ' control ' while my face was the " variable " .
' Since the process itself really only takes five seconds , there is n't much ritual to it .
I just make sure it 's framed decently , my eyes are open , and it 's not blurry .
' The closest I 've ever come to missing a day is when I am travelling long distances and the time zone changes , which messes with what day it actually is .
I 've had to leave a couple of parties early to get home to take the day 's photo .
And I also have an obsession with answering people 's comments and checking stats related to the project .
' It 's interesting to note which of my friends mention it almost immediately when introducing me to someone new and which ones do n't ever bring it up .
' I think in general , people find it to be a bit of a novelty , which it admittedly is .
' As for the future , I seriously hope I go the route of George Clooney or Sean Connery and get better with age .
That , and I hope I 'm still alive .'
A set of slides distributed to Microsoft's PC partners in April of this year has been leaked onto the Internet .
The slides outline Microsoft 's vision for Windows 8 's hardware ecosystem : the form factors the software giant will be targeting , the hardware capabilities that will be offered , and the demands that these parameters will place on OEMs .
A new " Windows Store " is perhaps the most ambitious feature described .
Microsoft would offer a store service to third - party software developers .
The store would allow easy discoverability of applications both from within Windows and from the Web .
The store would handle standard features like account management and software updates , as well as providing capabilities such as the ability to replicate applications and settings across different devices .
The store would be curated , so only applications that reached a certain quality standard would be permitted .
The basic model , then , is a cross between Apple 's App Store and Valve 's Steam .
Indications are that such a feature would be well - received .
The slides are not the first such communication between Microsoft and its OEM partners ; they contain feedback from the first " ecosystem forum " at which the Windows Store concept was apparently first discussed .
The slides say that Microsoft 's partners believe that a Windows Store " ca n't happen soon enough , " and think that an improved application distribution model , including a unified catalog and purchase experience , is a " critical component " to their success .
The App Store has certainly won many fans on Apple 's iOS platform , and similar models have been adopted on both Android and Windows Mobile / Windows Phone .
Extending it to a desktop platform is in some ways logical , but thus far efforts to do so have been limited .
Steam is successful , but relatively limited in scope , being used for games and game - related material .
Microsoft itself has attempted a broader store — the Microsoft Marketplace , used in conjunction with the Digital Locker for online purchasing of both first - and third - party software — but its efforts were terminated last August .
It 's therefore a little surprising to see Redmond trying again , and so soon .
However , it 's probably fair to say that consumers and software vendors alike are now more attuned to the idea of having a centralized store for purchasing applications , and if other problems faced by the Microsoft Marketplace can be resolved ( for example , it was not available outside the USA , it was not well - promoted , and it was not well - integrated within the OS ) , the company 's next attempt may yet succeed .
Still no tablet OS in the works
The leaked documents suggest that Redmond still sees no value in creating a dedicated tablet - oriented operating system analogous to Apple 's iOS .
Microsoft describes three form factors that are particular priorities : slates , laptops , and all - in - one desktops .
These form factors are regarded as important because they give OEMs more ability to distinguish and differentiate their products than conventional desktops .
To drive home the significance of creating well - designed , attractive products , Microsoft references Apple in many of the slides , highlighting how Cupertino leverages strong industrial design and a consistent experience across its various products .
The decision to equip slate machines with Windows 8 does not , of course , mean that Windows 8 might not be more finger - friendly than Windows 7 presently is , but it does mean that Redmond is still not going to have a platform that can properly compete with the iPad or Android - powered tablets .
These low - powered ARM - based devices have no equivalents in the x86 world ; if Microsoft wants to target them , it can't do so with Windows 8 .
Beyond that , there are many slides that say , in essence , that Windows 8 will be a continuation of Windows 7 .
Windows 7's ( little - used ) sensor and location APIs are being heavily promoted .
Microsoft 's view is that Windows 8 hardware will support a richer range of sensors ( GPS , cell - tower positioning , proximity sensors , accelerometers , webcams , not to mention the company 's own Kinect ) , and that there is considerable value to be had from vendors properly integrating these devices into the platform 's frameworks .
For its part , Microsoft outlined a few new possibilities that would exploit these sensor capabilities , such as the ability to automatically log on based on a webcam 's detection of the user sitting at the keyboard , and then subsequently lock the machine when the user leaves .
In other slides , the software company said that it was continuing to emphasize start - up , shutdown , and restore - from - sleep performance .
These areas were performance targets for Windows 7 , and that is apparently continuing with Windows 8 .
This will include a new " Logoff + Hibernate " feature that will act as an accelerated alternative to shutting down .
Though it 's possible that dates have slipped since the documents were distributed in April , they also stated that Internet Explorer 9 would have a beta release in August .
Further , this beta release would include the full Internet Explorer 9 experience ; the three Platform Preview releases have provided developers with access to the new browser 's rendering engine and JavaScript processor , but have included only a rudimentary front - end .
This front - end will be revealed in the beta .
Mysteries remain
The most interesting feature of the documents , however , is perhaps how uninteresting they are .
Windows 8 is set to be a major release ( like Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 , unlike Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2 ) , so one might , naively , have expected Redmond to have a lot to say about it .
Instead , the picture painted by the leaked documents is very much an evolutionary one .
The use of sensors and the improvements to certain areas of performance are certainly welcome changes , but they 're direct continuations of the work already done in Windows 7 .
A successful application store might be a big deal for software developers , but its direct impact on the operating system is negligible .
Windows 8 may well be a major release , but the nature of its major changes remain a mystery .

Stainless Steel
17 foot diameter x 15 feet
In 2006 , I was commissioned to create a monumental sculpture by SKS Investments / X - 4 Dolphin LLC in San Francisco 's Mission Bay district .
I designed a pixilated stainless steel fountain that appears to be frozen in mid-air .
The pixilated fountain is made of varying lengths of 2 " square tubing that are lined up vertically and overlapped to create pixels .
The tubing remains open at the top and bottom so that from above or below the sculpture , viewers are able to see through the tubing , giving the fountain a feeling of transparency like water .
The sculpture has a mirror finish to reflect the colors of its environment .
As people enter the building , they pass underneath the sculpture , giving them the sense that water is pouring over them .
Enlarge By Darron Cummings , AP John Syer , a vice president over provider contracting at WellPoint noted asking patients for such fees may violate provider agreements if doctors charge for items insurers consider included in their payments .
A growing number of doctors across the country are boosting revenue by asking patients to pay new fees for services they say insurance does n't cover , insurance and physicians ' groups say .
The extra payments include no - show fees of $ 30 - $ 50 for missed appointments , widely varying charges for filling out health forms for school , work or athletic teams , and annual administrative fees of $ 35 - $ 120 or more to simply be a patient in some practices , medical associations and doctors say .
" It 's not unlike the airlines , " said William Jessee , president of the Medical Group Management Association , which generally advises against extra fees that may anger patients or run afoul of insurance contracts .
" They 've gone from all - inclusive to a la carte .
That 's what you 're seeing with physicians . "
Doctors who charge extra fees are in the minority , he said .
Some have done it for years , but more are joining them because they say they need the fees to offset the rising costs of practicing medicine .
Allen Greenlee , an internist in Washington , sent a letter in March to 7,000 patients in his group practice asking for a voluntary $ 35 annual administrative fee for costs insurance did n't cover .
He said he got only two angry letters and dozens paid extra to help others .
" I 'm trying to stay solvent , " he said .
COVERAGE : As primary care shortage looms , doctors cut work hours INTERACTIVE : Most Influential Doctors database WellPoint , the nation 's largest insurer by membership , is receiving more inquiries from doctors seeking to charge annual administrative fees .
" We have seen some increase in that type of activity , " said John Syer , a vice president over provider contracting at WellPoint , which operates 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans .
" The vast majority do not engage in that , " Syer said , noting such fees may violate provider agreements if doctors charge for items insurers consider included in their payments .
Though no national data are available on how many practices charge extra fees , Jessee said primary care doctors face increased financial pressures as insurance reimbursement has n't kept pace with costs .
The result has been a growing shortage of primary care physicians as medical students choose more lucrative specialty fields .
Primary care is critical to the nation 's new health law , which will give 32 million uninsured Americans coverage .
Office visits are the main source of insurance payments to primary care doctors , yet physicians spend much of each day on activities they 're not directly compensated for , such as phone calls and prescription refills , a study in The New England Journal of Medicine in April found .
" A lot of doctors are trying all kinds of experimental things just to survive , " said Gary Seto , a doctor in South Pasadena , Calif. , who charges an annual $ 120 - per- family " non-covered benefits fee . "
Sue Braga of the Arizona chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said she 's hearing of more practices charging for no -shows and health forms .
Susan Wheeler , 33 , said her kids ' pediatrician near Atlanta recently started a $ 10 - per- child form fee .
" I do n't like it , " she said .
" It 's part of their job . "

Image caption East Jerusalem demolitions have been criticised internationally
The Israeli authorities have used bulldozers to demolish three buildings in occupied East Jerusalem .
Israeli officials said the action was taken to enforce court orders against - what they called - illegal and unpopulated structures .
But residents say two of the buildings were inhabited by Palestinian families , while the third was a warehouse .
Israel has been under international pressure to stop demolitions in the area .
The US has described such actions as damaging to peace efforts .
Palestinians accuse Israel of discriminatory planning practices which deny them building permits , often leaving them no choice but to build illegally and risk demolition .
" I have to express my deep concern about the latest developments in East Jerusalem , " European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said .
Mr Barroso was speaking at a news conference attended by Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in Brussels .
" These are counterproductive developments .
Settlements and demolition of houses are illegal , they are against international law , they constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two state solution impossible , " said Mr Barroso .
Mr Fayyad said Israel 's actions were " inconsistent with the need to continue to have the concept of viability for a two state solution " .
The demolitions came a day after Israeli authorities approved the construction of 32 new homes in a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem .
Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since 1967 .
It annexed the area in 1981 and sees it as its exclusive domain .
Under international law the area is occupied territory .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state .
Illuminati is a standalone card game made by Steve Jackson Games ( SJG ) , inspired by The Illuminatus !
Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea .
The game has ominous secret societies competing with each other to control the world through sinister means , including legal , illegal , and even mystical .
It was designed as a “ tongue - in - cheek rather than serious ” take on conspiracy theories .
It contains groups named similarly to real world organizations , such as the Society for Creative Anachronism .

Dear Cecil :
If the average body temperature is 98.6 degrees F , why is it that when the air temperature reaches 85 or 90 we feel uncomfortable ?
Scott Hadley , Santa Barbara , California
Cecil replies :
One of Cecil ’s competitors once wrote that it was because we wore clothes — as though all you had to do to be comfortable in 98 - degree heat was walk around naked .
Clearly what we have here is a failure to grasp the scientific essence of the thing , namely , that the air temperature has to be lower than body temperature if you ’re to cool yourself efficiently .
Your body is a little fuel - burning engine , and like all engines generates waste heat .
That heat has to go somewhere , lest you pop a gasket .
The easiest place to put it is someplace cooler , such as the air around you .
However , if the ambient air temperature is the same as your body temperature , you have to go to great lengths to shove the waste heat out into it , e.g. , sweating like a pig or going out to K mart to buy an air conditioner .
What we want , therefore , is an ambient temperature that lets us dump waste heat with the least strain .
From experience we know this temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F .
If you ’re very lightly dressed you may prefer 80 .
But even if you ’re starkers there ’s no way you ’ll be happy when it ’s 98 in the shade .

Iraq Contractors
Who governs private contractors Bush allowed into Iraq to make sure they follow the rules and do n't take advantage of the situation ?
Since Vice President Dick Cheney 's old company ( which he still gets revenue from ) haliburton got most of the private oil contracts you'd think this would be a very easy question to answer by the president .

Ask an Expert : Why Black Holes Suck .
Or Do They ?
Janet Anderson , 256-544-0034
Marshall Space Flight Center , Huntsville , Ala .
Janet.L.Anderson@nasa.gov
There are many cultural myths concerning black holes -- several of the myths are perpetuated by television and movies .
Black holes have been portrayed as time - traveling tunnels to another dimension , or as cosmic vacuum cleaners sucking up everything in sight .
Black holes are really just the evolutionary end points of massive stars .
Somehow , this simple explanation makes them no easier to understand .
On Thursday , July 15 , NASA scientist Jerry Fishman from NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center answered your questions about black holes .
Joining the chat is easy .
Simply visit this page on Thursday , July 15 from 3 - 4 p.m. EDT .
The chat window will open at the bottom of this page starting at 2:30 p.m. EDT .
You can log in and be ready to ask questions at 3:00 .
See you in chat !
Gerald ( Jerry ) Fishman is a research astrophysicist with NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Chief Scientist for Gamma-ray Astronomy there .
He was the Principal Investigator of the Burst and Transient Source Experiment ( BATSE ) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory .
This observatory was the second of NASA 's Four Great Observatories in Space ( after Hubble ) .
It was launched by the Space Shuttle Atlantis in April 1991 and operated until May 2000 .
The BATSE experiment produced new scientific results on some of the most energetic and violent objects in the Universe , in particular , gamma-ray bursts , the most explosive and most distant objects known .
He has lectured extensively on these findings at major universities and planetariums in the US and at numerous scientific conferences abroad .
This experiment also serendipitously discovered terrestrial gamma-ray flashes above thunderstorms .
Dr. Fishman has over two hundred publications in his research areas .
He received the NASA Outstanding Scientific Achievement Award in 1982 , 1991 and 1993 .
He was awarded the Bruno Rossi Prize of the High Energy Astrophysics Division of the American Astronomical Society in 1994 , that Division 's highest award .
In 1996 he became a Fellow of the American Physical Society .
Jerry : Hi everyone !
Thanks for the early questions .
We 're working on setting up the chat and will start posting those answered in about 15 minutes .
Great to see you , and welcome to the chat !
Akarsh_Valsan : Hi , good afternoon Jerry .
How are black holes formed ?
Jerry :
Most scientists think that black holes are formed when the centers of very massive stars collapse and can no longer support the overlaying material .
These are called solar - mass black holes -- black holes with at least 10 x the mass of the sun .
Much more massive black holes are called supermassive black holes .
These are thought to start by " swallowing " other stars at the center of a galaxy .
They start as a small black hole and gradually grow to an enormous size , sometimes as large as a hundred million to a billion times the mass of our sun .
Some scientists believe that there are a class of " primordial " or small black holes that formed at the same time the universe formed .
These have n't been directly observed , so their reality can't be confirmed .
Some of the very small primordial black holes are thought to slowly evaporate over long periods of time , whereas more massive black holes can live for many billions of years .
Matt : I understand that their existence is purely theoretical , but can you explain micro black holes .
Specifically the theory of their creation , lifespan , death , and the effects that they cause on space around them .
Jerry : Some scientists believe that there are a class of " primordial " or micro black holes that formed at the same time the Universe formed .
These have n't been directly observed , so their reality can't be confirmed .
Some of the very small primordial black holes are thought to slowly evaporate over long periods of time , whereas more massive black holes can live for many billions of years .
Akarsh_Valsan :
What are the two different types of Black Holes ?
Jerry :
You 're probably referring to the " solar mass black holes " and the " supermassive black holes . "
There may be a third class , simply called " intermediate mass black holes , " but this third class is controversial as far as being detected .
The other two types have almost certainly been observed .
Sammy :
What is our nearest black hole ?
Jerry :
Our nearest black hole is probably an object called Cygnus X - 1 .
It 's about 30,000 light years away from us and is one of the brightest objects in the X - ray sky .
CraigNASA : Can you see a black hole with a normal telescope ?
Jerry :
The black hole itself can't be seen but if it has a nearby star circling it , some material from that star is stripped off and just before it gets sucked into the black hole , it gives off enormous radiation .
That 's how we observe it .
We do n't observe the black hole directly , but we observe the effects of the black hole in the binary star system .
rahulr96 :
How would one safely enter a black hole ?
Or could they ?
Jerry : I would n't want to be that person -- entering a black hole would certainly be fatal because of its enormous gravity !
wescott60 : Was Albert Einstein first to study black holes ?
Jerry :
There are several scientists before Einstein that realized that enormous gravity could exist .
Einstein 's equations gave us a method of describing what space and time would be like near a black hole .
The term " black hole " itself was n't coined until the 1960s by a scientist from Princeton , John Archibald Wheeler .
Akarsh_Valsan :
What are the properties of Black Holes ?
Jerry :
At a large distance from black holes , there really are no effects except for its gravity .
This is interesting because , for example , if the sun were a black hole instead of a normal star , we would hardly see its effects because we'd only feel the same amount of gravity and nothing else from the black hole .
tonster :
How are we able to detect gravitational waves that are created from two black hole collisions .
Would n't the waves be pulled into the black hole like light ?
Jerry :
When two black hole collide ( they actually do n't collide , but circle each other until they coalesce ) enormous " gravity waves " are thought to be emitted .
One ground - based system specifically developed to detect these gravity wave is called LIGO .
It 's a long , laser - based interferometer system .
Details of this system can be found by Googling " LIGO . "
NASA is planning a much larger space - based version of LIGO called LISA .
You may also want to Google " LISA NASA . " misty :
What is the general temperature of a black hole ?
Jerry :
The black hole itself has very little temperature , but when matter is about to enter the black hole , just before it disappears , it 's heated to millions of degrees and emits X - rays .
This has been observed in at least a dozen different objects in our own galaxy.sciencejunkie57 :
Thanks for sharing all this information with us .
Jerry :
You 're very welcome , thanks for being part of the chat !

Do blackholes grow continuously ?
Jerry :
Yes , if there 's nearby material they 'll gather this material and they 'll grow in mass -- but only slightly in size.doga_lover54 :
Do black holes expand and grow ?
Jerry :
We 've found at least a dozen solar mass black holes in our own galaxy .
There are probably millions of supermassive black holes at the centers of other galaxies but so far we 've only seen a few of the nearest of these .
Akarsh_Valsan : Can black holes really suck things up ?
Jerry :
At a distance , black holes really do n't have more gravity than normal objects , so at a distance they really wo n't suck things in any more than a normal object of the same mass .
Lori_Anne : Hi , I am wondering how the Doppler effect looks in gamma rays ?
Jerry : Good question .
The enormous gravity of a black hole would Doppler - shift any radiation that comes from or near the edge of a black hole , including gamma rays.sciencejunkie57 :
Is there any evidence that black holes emit any major amounts of Hawking Radiation ?
Jerry : No -- Hawking Radiation is still controversial and has n't been directly observed .
Akarsh_Valsan :
Do black holes move ?
Jerry : Black holes move just like any other object would move .
JJ_Jordan10 : Do you have any idea about what happens inside a black hole ?
Jerry :
It 's impossible to see inside of a black hole .
PaperChase : Besides LISA , is NASA preparing an other studies of black holes ?
Jerry : None that I know of .
Dell_Conagher :
How useful is the analogy that a black hole has the same characteristics as an elementary particle , having spin , magnetic charge and mass ?
Jerry :
It 's a good analogy , except that I 've never heard of a magnetic field being associated with a black hole .
Akarsh_Valsan : How can I see a Black Hole ?
Jerry :
You can't see a black hole directly , but if a black hole is in a binary star system , it can be seen with binoculars , an optical telescope , or an x-ray telescope above the Earth 's atmosphere.
longsheryl :
How big are these black holes ?
Jerry :
The black holes themselves have no size .
They 're called singularities .
It seems strange that they have mass but no size .
PaperChase ;
Can you give us some interesting Web sites to learn more about black holes ?
Jerry : Look on the right side of this page -- some good links there .
Dell_Conagher :
What are your thoughts on the theory that the trip past the event horizon could be survived under certain circumstances with a spinning black hole ?
Jerry :
The equations say that as long as you stay outside of the black hole " Schwartzchild Radius , " you can survive a trip near it .
Fox : Hi Gerald , my question is :
What exactly happens when two black holes come within contact of eachother ?
do they merge ?
or does something entirely different happen ?
Jerry : Yes , they merge , and an enormous amount of energy is released .
Dell_Conagher :
What are your thoughts on white holes ?
Jerry : " White holes " are theoretically possible , but have never been observed .
Many scientists do n't think they exist .
Lucas_Campos :
Does every black hole spin ?
Jerry :
Yes , it 's believed that most black holes have spin associated with them because the stars that they formed from were rotating before they became black holes .
raglev08 :
Ca n't you also detect a black hole by the light being distorted around a blank area in space ?
Jerry :
Yes , black holes distort the space around them so that light passing from objects behind them will seem distorted .
linmojay :
Is it true that one theoretically could stand at the event horizon point of a blackhole and not be sucked in ?
Jerry : Yes , that 's true .
Nazban :
How long can a black hole live for ?
Jerry : Black holes live for billions of years , even longer than the Universe will probably be around .
raglev08 :
Why does time seem to go slower as one gets closer to a black hole ?
Does it have anything to do with the Event Horizon ?
Jerry : Yes , it 's a natural result of Einstein 's equations of general relativity .
Dell_Conagher :
Do you think that information that passes past an event horizon is lost permamently , or is re-emitted somehow as Hawking Radiation ?
Jerry : Most scientists think the information is lost permanently .
A few scientists think that it 's somewhere emitted from a " white hole . "
I believe that Hawking Radiation refers to other radiation being emitted , mainly from small black holes .
Akarsh_Valsan :
Do black holes ever get full ?
Jerry :
No , black holes continue to grow as they absorb matter .
James :
Are black holes involved in hyper novas ?
Jerry : Many astrophysicists think that hypernovas are the birth place of stellar mass black holes and when they form , they emit gamma ray bursts .
Lori_Anne : How do black holes disappear ?
Jerry :
It 's thought that once a black hole is formed , it only extremely slowly evaporates and for all intents and purposes , it will live just about forever .
CraigNASA :
Are there any fatal objects that make it dangerous , or is it just the fact that the gravity would crush you ?
Jerry :
It 's just the enormous gravity when you get next to a black hole that would crush you .
RyanB : Is it true that no one has detected gravity waves yet ?
Jerry : Correct , they have n't yet been convincingly detected .
Akarsh_Valsan :
Can you name some naked eye stars that will turn into black holes eventually ?
Jerry :
There is a star I know of in the constellation Carina that some astronomers think is massive enough to collapse and form a black hole within the next few thousand years or so .
RyanB :
What are mini black holes and how do they form ?
Jerry : Some scientists believe that there are a class of " primordial " or small black holes that formed at the same time the universe formed .
These have n't been directly observed , so their reality can't be confirmed .
Some of the very small primordial black holes are thought to slowly evaporate over long periods of time , whereas more massive black holes can live for many billions of years .
Nazban :
Are there any NASA projects to study black holes ?
Jerry :
The x-ray and gamma-ray observatories that NASA operates study the surroundings of black holes .
LISA and LIGO will attempt to directly observe black hole mergers .
James :
What is the largest black hole detected so far ?
Jerry :
There are many " active galactic nuclei " that are thought to consist of black holes with extremely large masses .
It 's hard to tell which one is the largest .
Perhaps the closest two are called Centaurus A and M - 87 .
Drew :
Do thermo-nuclear runaways and black holes have anything to do with each other ?
Jerry : No , no relation .
Adam :
Is it possible that our universe was created from a blackhole from another dimension ?
Jerry : Most astrophysicists think our Universe was created at the time of the Big Bang , not from a black hole .
Nazban :
What is a quasar ?
Jerry :
It 's simply thought to be a supermassive black hole that 's putting out an enormous amount of energy .
Fox :
Do black holes ever die out ?
Jerry :
They evaporate , but VERY slowly .
Scarker :
Is it possible for an object to orbit a black hole within its event horizon without being sucked into the center ?
Jerry :
Yes , but its orbit will likely become smaller and eventually it will be sucked into the black hole .
Nazban :
How is a quasar powered by a black hole when light can't escape it ?
Jerry :
The light does n't escape from the black hole itself , but instead from matter just before it disappears into the black hole .
Akarsh_Valsan :
How can a force of gravity escape a black hole ?
Jerry : Gravity is n't a form of matter , so it can " escape " from a black hole ... and it does this at the speed of light .
raglev08 : I heard the center of our galaxy is actually a black hole , is this true ?
Jerry :
Yes , infrared observations have shown that stars near the center of our galaxy are moving so fast around an object called SGR - A* , that this object can only be explained by being a black hole .
It 's extremely close to the center of our galaxy .
michael :
Are there created some new elements in the black holes ?
Jerry : No , no new elements .
Dell_Conagher :
Do you believe that singularities are real , or are they just artifacts of incompatible theories of gravity and quantum mechanics ?
Jerry : Singularities are a result of the equations of general relativity .
We 're very confident that general relativity works , so we think that singularities are real .
Akarsh_Valsan : Can one black hole be formed inside other ?
Jerry : Probably not .
:)
JJ_Jordan10 : How do black holes bend space - time ?
Jerry : Again , this comes naturally from the equations of Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
It was first seen in 1919 during a solar eclipse when light from a distant star was bent as it passed close to the surface of the sun .
If space - time were n't true , this would n't have happened .
It was BIG news in 1919 , and it made Einstein famous and a world - wide celebrity .
intali :
How is it that black holes decrease in mass over time ?
Jerry :
The mass decreases via complicated process called black hole evaporation , or " Hawking Radiation , " named for Stephen Hawking .
kosig :
What happens to any mass that a black hole may gather ?
Jerry :
It causes the black hole to grow in mass and slightly in size .
Jackie : Can black holes in the centers of galaxies devour them ?
Jerry :
They wo n't devour the entire galaxy , but only perhaps a few unlucky stars nearby .
chaouki :
Is it possible that a black hole can approach the earth ?
Jerry : Not very likely .
We do n't know of any very nearby black holes .
Akarsh_Valsan : Who was Subrahamayan Chandrashekar ?
Jerry : A famous Indian - American astrophysicist at the University of Chicago .
The Chandra X-ray Observatory was named for him .
http://www.nasa.gov/chandra.longsheryl:
How big are these black holes ?
Jerry : Black holes really do n't have any size .
They 're called singularities and they have no dimensions .
It 's hard to imagine because we live in a 3 - D world , and black holes are 4 - D. ( To clarify ... we live in a 4 - D world , but this can only be seen over extremely large distances . )
Lester_Morgan :
Do evaporating black holes produce gamma rays bursts ?
Jerry :
No , the collapse of massive stars that form black holes are believed to produce gamma ray bursts .
Fox :
Will black holes still be around after the heat death of the universe ?
Jerry :
Yes , the larger black holes will probably outlive the Universe .
Elaine :
How many black holes are in the Milky Way ?
Jerry :
We think there are perhaps thousands of black holes in our own galaxy , but so far , we 've only seen the ones that are in close binary systems , several dozen at most .
chris_ryce :
How far away from us is the nearest known black hole ?
Jerry : About 30,000 light years .
This is Cygnus X - 1.Akarsh_Valsan : Sir , are black holes left over from a supernovae ?
Jerry : Most supernovae are thought to form neutron stars .
These have smaller masses than black holes and do n't have singularities .
The black holes are thought to form from hypernovae .
Nazban : Hi Sir , is it true that quasars are the brightest objects in the universe ?
and they are powered by a black hole ?
Jerry :
Yes , quasars are the brightest CONTINUOUSLY shining objects in the universe .
However , gamma ray bursts briefly outshine quasars .
bryte : Theoretically , what would make up a white hole ?
Jerry : " White holes " are controversial .digital :
Are there any connections between gamma ray bursts and black holes ?
Jerry :
We think that a gamma ray burst signals the birth of a black hole .
ual8658 :
Is it possible for a black hole to suck up earth ?
Jerry :
The Earth wo n't get sucked into a black hole because there are none that are thought to come close to us .
simulacra :
How are jets of radiation formed that shoot out of black holes if black holes have such huge gravity ?
Jerry : Material that 's drawn near a black hole goes into orbit and it's thought that the combinations of circular motion and entrained magnetic field will cause it to shoot out as oppositely - directed jets from the black hole , overcoming even the gravity of the black hole .
xbltheshadow :
What is the closest Black Hole to Earth ?
Jerry : About 30,000 light years.celestialm00n :
What is the relation with blackholes and dark matter ?
is there a possibility black holes feed black matter which is why it is expanding ?
Jerry :
Most astronomers do n't think that black holes would constitute enough matter to explain the dark matter that 's seen .
jocampo :
Why is there a Black Hole in the middle of every Galaxy ?
Jerry : Most astronomers think it was formed in the very early stages of the formation of the galaxy when a group of stars coalesced .
jocampo :
What does the Scharzschield radius really tell us about Black Holes ?
Jerry :
The Scharzschield radius has a very simple relationship to the mass of a black hole .
rahulr96 :
If a black hole has no source of energy to drain will it quickly die out ?
Jerry :
No , it can still live on .
jpelch :
Are there quasars near the Milky Way ?
Jerry :
The nearest quasar was also one of the first ones to be discovered .
It 's known by its radio source name , 3C273.jocampo :
How many solar masses is it required for a star to become a black hole ?
Jerry : Most astronomers believe that a black hole weighs a minimum of about 20X the mass of our Sun.rahulr96 :
What are black holes made of on the elemental level ?
Jerry : Black holes can't be described as being composed of any normal material , including molecules , elements , or elementary particles .

Perhaps you ’ve heard that there ’s been some … disagreements between certain feminist blogs and The Daily Show recently .
If not , let me recap !
A couple of weeks ago , Jezebel ’s Irin Carmon ( a hand - to - God Real Journalist , with non-blog bylines ! ) wrote a piece examining what she termed The Daily Show ’s “ Woman Problem . ”
She largely defined the show as being a hostile environment for women as evidenced by the perennially low number of female correspondents and the testimony of some named and unnamed sources .
The piece did n’t really go too far , other than apparently being widely linked on Facebook .
Olivia Munn , the Daily Show ’s but - one - month - old lady correspondent may or may not have heard about it , and , uh , commented .
But that was about it ; I never thought you ’d hear another peep .
I mean , this is The Daily Show , surely they wo n’t condescend to deal with some blogs , right ?
But then last week , in the middle of a long list of the travails of running a world - famous , critically - adored , massively - profitable talk show , Jon said , “ Jezebel thinks I ’m a sexist pig ! ”
And I thought : they ’ve got something planned .
Sure enough , they did .
Yesterday , an open letter
from various women staffers at the Daily Show hit the Internet , in which they say , among other things , that their boss is great guy !
( He pays their salaries ! )
They are “ integral ” to the development of the show !
Then Emily Gould came in at Slate with that classic ladyfight ender
: “ Y’all Are Just Jealous . ”
Her thesis is that blogs like Jezebel and Broadsheet and XX Factor drum up pageviews by exploiting women ’s envy of other women ’s positions : “ Instead of mimicking the old directly anxiety - making model - for example , by posting weight - loss tips and photos of impossibly thin models like a traditional women ’s magazine - Jezebel and the Slate and Salon ‘ lady - blogs ’ post a critique of a rail - thin model ’s physique , explaining how her attractiveness hurts women .
The end result is the same as the old formula - women ’s insecurities sell ads . ”
Gould ’s giving a pretty vague gloss on what it is that those blogs do , in my experience - Jezebel ’s anti-” bodysnarking ” rule is Internet - famous , and just yesterday they had a post explaining why Crystal Renn ought n’t to be criticized for losing weight .
Also , in general I think it ’s important to be skeptical of grand theses based on sampling of Internet comments .
Internet commenters ( and I ’ve been one !
Still am ! ) are assholes ; on this I think we can all agree .
But that does n’t mean that the only thing that can be going on behind these arguments is a feeding of the id .
I do n’t know that I can get on board with saying that the dominant dynamic among women on the Internet ( or anywhere else ! ) is purely jealousy .
In any event , I do n’t really think jealousy or envy is at the root of what ’s going on in the critique of sexism at the Daily Show particularly .
As a ladyparts - haver and even , gasp , a self - identified feminist of some years now , when I initially read Carmon ’s article , I also was n’t shocked or appalled by the allegations .
This was hardlythe first time the issue of a Daily Show sausage - fest has been raised .
In fact , and maybe your friends are different than mine , but every year , when they win an Emmy , everyone I know makes the standard joke about all those suits up on stage .
( In fact , Jon made a version of it himself once !
Though he was remarking on the prevalence of Ivy- educated Jews . )
And while no one , not even Carmon , denied that Samantha Bee , Kirsten Schaal and now Munn , work there , the latter two are trotted out only occasionally - Schaal last appeared on the show , per IMDB , on July 1 , 2009 .
Now , to make that observation is to make an observation about The Daily Show ’s image as a TV program .
But The Daily Show staffers ’ letter skirts the issue of image entirely , it seems to me , because it ’s so hard to dispute .
It ’s the gigantic , entirely visible elephant that blots out their affirmations that their boss helped them through 9/11 ( Really ?
9/11 ’s coming into this ? ) and is reportedly “ charming . ”
This even though , it seems to me , Carmon ’s original article ( with perhaps the exception of its initial diagnosis of “ boys ’ club ” ) was about the image of The Daily Show .
Carmon ’s piece thus dealt almost exclusively with writers and on - air talent , not the production staff .
I ’m not saying Carmon could n’t have been more precise about what it was she was commenting on about the show ’s makeup , but on the other hand it ’s not like she actually claimed no women worked there , and so , therefore , it ’s not like this letter is some grand corrective to the already objectively provable fact that women do work at The Daily Show .
Because here ’s the thing that we all know : just because you employ a ton of women ( 40 % , they say ! ) on your staff does n’t negate the possibility that the content of your show , and its public image - as in , who actually writes and says the words , who , in a word , are presented as the show ’s “ authors ” - is male - skewed .
No matter how porous the boundaries between the creative and production staffs , no matter how integral they are to the - day - to - day work of putting on the show , that ’s got to be obvious to you .
If your male writers are , as The Daily Show ’s are , dominating your women writers at a rough 15:1 ratio , if it is men that you take onstage with you at the Emmys , then let ’s be honest about what that means .
The entire excuse of having a ton of female production staffers ( in a mishmash of roles that includes two writers , a writer ’s assistant and a co-executive producer , as well as a TelePrompter operator , a hair and make - up artist and a wardrobe stylist ) reminds me more than not of the time I was in a corporate diversity seminar where someone was reduced to trotting out the high levels of people of color they employed in the mailroom as evidence of the company ’s successes on that score .
Women may be getting coffee , they may be building sets , they may even be giving comments on scripts , but the fact that they are almost entirely not in positions of creative control does , in fact , matter .
And in any event , I assume The Daily Show - like every other entity up to and including New York City ’s government - does n’t really want to talk numbers when it comes to diversity .
The Daily Show ca n’t possibly be claiming that its staff is actually representative of the American population writ large .
Because if we ’re going to play that game , I ’ll point out that I do n’t see a lot of women of color in that picture they issued .
( Not that you can tell just by looking , but still . )
And when I went through the LinkedIn profiles of these women , trying to gather what it was they did precisely - and , absolutely , some of these women , like Kahane Cooperman , the co-executive producer , are involved at creative levels of the show - it was hard not to notice that many came from NYU , the University of Chicago , UVA , Yale .
Their backgrounds are , indeed , uniform in a way , and probably uniform in a way that affects the way they view their audience and the comedy that they are prepared to do .
The thing about these discussions about diversity that ’s so frustrating is that there is , of course , an essential truth to the proposition that meeting some kind of quota - 6 women , 10 men , 3 people with disabilities and one with a freckle on the left side of his nose , on and on - wo n’t solve your diversity problem , necessarily .
First of all , if you spend any time on any of the lady websites Gould mentions , it ’s impossible to avoid notice of the fact that ladies , even ladies of some similar political affiliations , sympathies and even backgrounds do n’t necessarily agree with each other on individual issues .
( This makes her accusation that they are some kind of hive mind waiting on the Internet to pounce on successful women more difficult to defend , but I digress . )
Second of all , this is the entire reason the whole “ My best friend is black ” shtick can be so hysterically funny - it ’s that just because you happen to know some people of x characteristic who you can live with , employ , have a beer with , even marry , it does n’t mean you ’re immune to discriminating against them in small ways .
That ’s because we live in a world , like it or not , that defines men as more qualified and reliable than women , whites as more qualified and important than people of color , etc .
There are always different standards , and it was Gould who said - aptly !- that , “ If a woman writes about herself , she ’s a narcissist .
If a man does the same , he ’s describing the human condition . ”
But if you raise these issues , as Carmon did , the reaction is always ferociously defensive and immediate .
For example , the words “ Jon Stewart is a sexist prick ” do not appear in the piece .
Certain of her sources did make comments on Stewart ’s behaviour , but the only money shot ( heh ) is aimed at former Daily Show host Craig Kilborn .
( And who remembers That Guy ? )
But the moment Stewart used that phrase , this became about his hurt feelings , about his character , about whether or not you like the damn show .
And I can tell you , as someone who found the criticism somewhat trenchant : I do like the damn show !
That ’s exactly why it irks when it makes stupid jokes about sex workers , calling them “ used vagina salesmen , ” ( which , uh , right ? ) because fundamentally I think it ’s beneath them .
That ’s why it ’d be nice if it did n’t feel like a show that was written for people other than me .
That ’s why it annoys me that they are plainly uncomfortable and out of step whenever they have to make jokes about gender .
I have no desire to be a Daily Show writer , you see - I ’m not Just Jealous - but it sure would be nice to feel as if the funny was meant for me too .
And now , I ’m off to make myself a sandwich .

England 's performance at South Africa 2010 was officially their worst at a World Cup finals , according to Fifa .
The governing body 's post - tournament rankings placed Fabio Capello 's side 13th out of the 32 teams following their tame exit in the last 16 .
Their previous worst placing was 11th in 1958 and this year 's ranking is six places lower than England 's showing in 2006 and seven below their 2002 rating .
Winners Spain were top followed by the Netherlands , Germany and Uruguay .
England failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1974 , 1978 and 1994 .
They went out in the last 16 this time after scraping through a group that included the United States , Slovenia and Algeria , before losing 4 - 1 to Germany in the last 16 - their heaviest World Cup defeat .
606 : DEBATE
Looks like Fifa have just told us what we all knew all along - that this dad 's army team are the worst England team in history
U14281003 England went out in the group stage of the 1950 and 1958 tournaments , when there were only 16 teams in the tournament , but still managed to rank higher than 13th .
The World Cup was expanded from to 24 teams in 1982 and to 32 in 1998 .
Fifa 's rankings take into account group stage results , progress in the competition and the quality of opposition .
The top four rankings mirrored the final positions in the tournament .
Of the beaten quarter - finalists , Argentina were fifth , Brazil sixth , Ghana seventh and Paraguay eighth .
Japan , Chile , Portugal and the US were all higher than England in the table , while 2006 World Cup winners Italy were 26th and France , who triumphed in 1998 , were 29th after their dismal group stage exits .
Fifa president Sepp Blatter suggested England 's poor performance could be explained by the number of foreigners in the Premier League but also pointed to the overall strength of teams at what turned out to be an unpredictable World Cup .
" England is considered as being the motherland of football , as Brazil is the heartbeat of football , but there are no small national teams any more , " he said .
" There are small countries but their national teams are very strong as football has developed . "
Despite England 's poor showing at the tournament , the Football Association decided to stick with Capello , whose contract runs until the 2012 European Championship .
Attention now turns to the friendly against Hungary at Wembley on 11 August and the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign , which starts in September with back - to - back fixtures against Bulgaria and Switzerland .
Capello will discuss his plans at an FA Board meeting on Thursday .
Fifa 's latest world rankings will be released on Wednesday , with world champions Spain poised to reclaim top spot from Brazil .
Semi-finalists
Uruguay are likely to jump up from their current 16th place , while England ( eighth ) , Italy ( fifth ) and France ( ninth ) could all drop down following their under - par results in South Africa .
Fifa 2010 World Cup standings : 1 Spain , 2 Netherlands , 3 Germany , 4 Uruguay , 5 Argentina , 6 Brazil , 7 Ghana , 8 Paraguay 9 Japan , 10 Chile , 11 Portugal , 12 United States , 13 England , 14 Mexico , 15 South Korea , 16 Slovakia 17 Ivory Coast , 18 Slovenia , 19 Switzerland , 20 South Africa , 21 Australia , 22 New Zealand , 23 Serbia , 24 Denmark 25 Greece , 26 Italy , 27 Nigeria , 28 Algeria , 29 France , 30 Honduras , 31 Cameroon , 32 North Korea England 's past World Cup rankings : 1950 ( 8th ) , 1954 ( 6th ) , 1958 ( 11th ) , 1962 ( 8th ) , 1966 ( 1st ) , 1970 ( 8th ) , 1982 ( 6th ) , 1986 ( 8th ) , 1990 ( 4th ) , 1998 ( 9th ) , 2002 ( 6th ) , 2006 ( 7th )

The Fourth Wall : Stages Klaus Frahm
“ The Fourth Wall ” is a concept in dramatic theory , often used by actors to signify the invisible stage wall where the audience is seated to view the play .
The stage is classically perceived from the audience ’s perspective , where they are able to glimpse the action through a “ window ” into the set —
" The Fourth Wall . “
In this series , the direction of the viewpoint is opposite : we take the perspective of the actor .
The camera is far behind the iron curtain .
It is the camera ’s specific perspective , dissolving the traditional order , which questions the hierarchy of the stage and audience .
For the French philosopher Lacan , an image is a gaze pointing outward , as the light - points send out rays to the viewer .
In other words , the image looks at the onlooker .
Here , the space reserved for the audience becomes flat , like a postcard , and the real space of the theater , the stage , is explored in many directions .
The camera looks up , taking note of the scaffolding and lighting structures : the mechanics of the space .
Thus , we become aware of a workspace hidden behind the red velvet curtain .
The contrast between backstage machinery and the sea of velvet seats is exciting .

Yesterday morning I watched the first markup session of the Earmark Transparency Act .
The bill aims to create a comprehensive database of all earmark requests , not just approved earmarks .
In its current version , there are over twenty required data elements , including free text descriptions and justifications of the earmark request , as well as related documents .
The bill also calls for huge flexibility in the search interface and the API .
Overall , it ’s a win for transparency and a big technical leap forward in terms of how the government thinks about releasing its data .
It ’s biggest opponent in committee was Senator Carl Levin .
To be fair , Sen .
Levin is not against the spirit of the bill , but has serious concerns about the technical implementation .
He claims it is impossible for a search engine to aggregate earmarks by the free form text fields required by the bill .
Sen .
Levin also claims it ’s not feasible to sort or aggregate by documents related to the earmark ( such as the bill itself , or a related budget estimate ) .
Our policy team has logged some interesting thoughts on the subject , but I thought I ’d take this opportunity to approach this from a technical standpoint .
To be specific , the bill states : “ the term ‘ searchable website ’ means a website that … allows the public to search and aggregate earmarks by any data element required under section 3 ” , where section 3 contains a list of the data elements required .
Two of the data elements , the project description and the list of relevant documents , are the source of contention — not because they ’re included , but because Sen .
Levin is not convinced they can be aggregated , as the bill calls for .
Aggregate has a specific meaning in relation to computer science .
It ’s usually short for “ aggregate function ” , referring to the minimum , maximum , sum and average math functions .
It ’s quite common for these aggregate functions to be used in conjunction with an operation that groups the data by similar values .
Suppose we ’re aggregating data on a fiscal year .
First we ’d bin the data into similar groups according to their fiscal year value , then we ’d sum the earmark totals for each group , resulting in a list of fiscal years and respective totals of earmark requests .
As most of you may know , this is easily done in any SQL - based relational database ( and I have it on good authority the Senate uses Oracle ) .
Now let ’s throw some free form text into the mix .
We can follow the same operation , except instead of grouping by the exact fiscal year , we will limit the earmarks to those whose project description contains the phrase “ research and development ” .
Then we can sum or average the earmark totals for all of these earmarks .
These queries can also be combined , giving us all the R&D earmark request totals , by fiscal year .
As for aggregating by the list of related documents , I can kind of understand how this might seem tricky .
In this case , you would n’t aggregate by the exact text in these related documents .
Rather , you would house all of these documents in one place , and assign them all unique identifiers .
Then , the database only needs to keep track of a list of document IDs for each earmark request .
Now our previous query can be altered to return the sum of all earmark requests that have the defense appropriations bill as a related document ( using the document IDs ) .
We have built a similar document database that drives our Real Time Congress iPhone app .
Most professional software developers have learned the fundamental principles of database phrase searches , free form text search engines , relevancy algorithms and similarity calculations .
And if they did n’t , you do n’t need to reinvent the wheel since this software already exists for a multitude of platforms and is free .
Sen .
Levin should n’t be put in a position to make these technical judgments on his own and should instead leverage the expertise of the technical community .
He says that the Senate Sergeant at Arms ( the office in charge of technical infrastructure and support for the Senate ) agrees with his above claims .
And for this I think we are owed an explanation .
To all you non-programmers out there , I will let you in on a secret .
Every software developer , at some point in their career , will use their developer trump card .
When someone requests a feature that is a pain to implement , or a feature you disagree with but ca n’t convince the team to abandon , you rattle off some technical jargon about how it wo n’t be compatible with your Cold Fusion infrastructure , or some other nonsense .
To the Senate Sergeant at Arms I say : put it back in the deck .
If the technological infrastructure in congress is so backward and outdated that it cannot launch a free text search instance or make use of the “ LIKE ” SQL keyword , then we have a much more serious problem on our hands .
For starters , the existing technical infrastructure in Congress should be more transparent .
Congress has consistently watered down the specificity and breadth of the data it has released and has used data formats that are not machine readable .
All this has been done roughly under the guise of “ doing it the right way is too hard and expensive ” .
For example , when the House released their expenditure data , vendor names and other specific information regarding the expenditures was removed to ease the technical strain of making the text more uniform and easily comparable .
Additionally , it was released in PDFs instead of a structured data format such as JSON , XML or CSV .
These are serious impediments to total and open transparency .
There ’s very little known about what format Congress ’ internal data is in and what infrastructure already exists .
This works to Congress ’ advantage because they can consistently “ punt ” on meaningful transparency requirements due to supposed technical limitations .
One thing we do know is that a contractor called General Dynamics IT provides IT services to the Senate Sergeant at Arms .
This contractor is fourth biggest contractor for the federal government according to the Federal Procurement Data System .
It comes in just behind Lockheed Martin , Boeing , and Northrup Grumman .
From the General Dynamics 2009 Annual Report :
“ Information Systems and Technology also supplies network −modernization and IT infrastructure services to U.S. government customers .
As one of the U.S. Air Force ’s leading partners for network modernization , for example , the group has provided IT support services to more than 75 Air Force bases .
It currently supports all Air Force main operating bases .
The group also has provided continuous enterprise −wide IT services and support to the U.S. Senate for more than five years . ”
Is it really the case that a corporation that got $ 16 billion from the federal government in 2009 cannot aggregate all the earmark request records whose description contains “ ethanol ” , or sum the total earmark requests that have the agriculture appropriations bill in their related document array ?
Thankfully , the bill made it out of committee .
Hopefully those conducting the upcoming Senate floor debate will consult the open government technical community instead of settling for excuses about the limitations of IT .

at the positive electrode : 4 OH  → 4e  + 2 H 2 O + O 2 ... but since the OH  ions come from water , the overall reaction is
At the negative electrode : 2 H + + 2e – → H 2 ... but since the H + ions come from water , the overall reaction is
Electrolysis refers to the breakdown of a substance by passing an electric current through it .
This is accomplished by placing a pair of oppositely - charged electrodes ( usually of platinum or some other unreactive metal ) in the solution .
Positive ions that find themselves close to the negative electrode will acquire electrons , and negative ions near the positive electrode will lose electrons .
In the case of pure water , the reactions are as follows :
Whether a water is acidic or alkaline , it will always contain equal numbers of positive and negative electric charges .
Since alkaline water contains an excess of OH  ions , it must also contain some other kind of positive ion in addition to H + in order to equalize the opposite charges .
This extra positive ion is almost always a metal ion such as sodium , calcium or magnesium .
Similarly , an acidic water must always contain negative ions in addition to OH  ; the most common of these is bicarbonate HCO 3  .
This means that waters whose pH differs from 7 are never " pure " in the chemical sense .
All water and all aqueous solutions contain both H + and OH  ions .
If the quantity of H + exceeds that of the OH  , the water is said to be acidic .
If there are more OH  ions than H + , the water is alkaline .
Pure water , which contains equal numbers of both ions , is said to be neutral .
Chemists express the degree of acidity or alkalinity on the pH scale which runs from about 0 to 14 .
Acidic solutions have pH values of less than 7 , alkaline solutions more than 7 .
Pure water , being neutral , has a pH of exactly 7 .
Each unit on the pH scale represents a hundred - fold change in the ratio of the two kinds of ions ; for example , if the pH is 8 , there are 100 times as many OH  ions than H + ions ( that is , [ H + ] = 10 – 8 , [ OH – ] = 10 – 6 . )
but the extent of this reaction is severely limited by the fact that the reverse of this reaction is much more rapid , so that on the average , only about two out of every billion H 2 O molecules are dissociated .
No electrical device or chemical additive is capable of increasing these ion concentrations in pure water above this very minute level which is so small that for most practical purposes pure water can be considered to be ion- free , as evidenced by the fact that it will not conduct an electric current .
Pure water consists almost entirely of H 2 O molecules loosely bound in a network - like structure in which individual molecules are constantly changing partners .
Water molecules exhibit a very slight tendency to dissociate ( " ionize " ) into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions :
To a chemist like myself , the term is meaningless .
True , it is possible for water to contain dissolved ions ( electrically - charged atoms or molecules ) , but that 's something else again .
Almost all waters found in nature acquire ions such as calcium and bicarbonate as they come into contact with rocks and sediments .
Even the purest rainwater contains some hydrogen - and bicarbonate ions that are formed when it picks up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Here , in a nutshell , are a few basic facts that I believe anyone with a solid background in chemistry or physiology would concur with :
You wo n't find anything about the benefits of alkaline water in any standard textbook on nutritional biochemistry , and anyone with training in physiology or biochemistry would consider the claims in favor of it ludicrous , but the alkaline / ionized water quacksters and promoters have woven a nexus of scientific - sounding nonsense and outright lies in order to convince a gullible and scientifically - naïve public that drinking partially electrolyzed water ( produced by their over - priced " machines " ) is the key to health .
Alkaline water not for you ?
One enterprising outfit offers a machine that is supposed to produce acidic wate r;
For only $ 2500 you too can enjoy the benefits of pH 2.5 water good for curing " Hong Kong foot " and many other ailments !
Of course , cranberry or citrus juices are much less expensive sources of equally acidic water .
can be found here .
But unless you have some solid background in chemistry and physiology ( as the author and most of the " authorities " he cites clearly do not ) , beware that many of the statements are misleading , wrong , or are just plain nonsense .
To further mislead science - naïve readers , another Kangen page employs the common ruse of misrepresenting the 1931 Nobel Prize work of a famous pioneer of biochemistry .
Do n't believe any of this deceptive garbage !
( Note : Kangen is frequently misspelled as " Kangan " . )
" It is well known in the medical community that an overly acidic body is the root of many common diseases , such as obesity , osteoporosis , diabetes , high blood - pressure and more ... " [ link1 , link2 ]
Consider , for example , this outright lie that can be found at some Kangen Water sales sites :
In multi -level marketing scams , the parent company keeps a low profile and makes few claims that would attract the scrutiny of regulators such as the U.S. FTC .
Instead , they recruit thousands of " independent agents " who are provided with sales iterature containing false and misleading claims which they then transmit to their customers or put up on their own Web sites .
These agents , few of whom are well - enough educated to evaluate these claims or to realize that they violate the FTC rules on deceptive advertising , are as much victims as are their consumer customers .
It does n't help that quackery - filled " alternative health " books such as pH Miracle Living and Alkalize or Die by " Doctor " Theodore Baroody ( whose scientific credentials seem highly dubious ) plug alkaline water as one way of preventing cancer or of increasing one 's lifespan .
There is even a company that offers complete " alkaline diets " for which they make ridiculous claims .
Even the otherwise respectable Kurzweil and Grossman 's Fantastic Voyage ( see below ) goes off the track on this craze .
What most of these outfits actually sell are grossly overpriced electrical devices that purport to produce " ionized " and alkaline water by the process of electrolysis .
Many of these " water ionizers " appear to have their origins in Japan and Korea , two countries whose populations seem to be particularly susceptible to being taken in by pseudoscientific water - treatment schemes .
In North America , distribution of these dubious devices has depended largely on multi- level marketing schemes that enroll science - ignorant dealers to exploit even - more - vulnerable consumers while enabling the manufacturer to maintain a low profile to regulatory agencies such as the FTC .
" Ionized water " is one of many products and panaceas that the wonky - water wellness industry flogs onto the large segment of the general public that lacks the scientific background to distinguish scientific fact from pseudoscientific hype when the two are closely intertwined .
The purpose of this page is to critically examine some of the claims about " ionized " and alkaline waters from the standpoint of modern chemistry and physiology in order to provide you with the information you need to make your own informed decision before opening your wallets to the hucksters of these products and whose claims are totally lacking in scientific support .
Note that the consumption of H+ ions at the negative electrode leaves an excess of OH  ions in the vicinity of this electrode , making the water in this region alkaline .
Similarly , the consumption of OH  ions at the positive electrode makes the water near this electrode acidic .
If the regions near the two electrodes are surrounded by a semi-permeable barrier that inhibits diffusion of these ions into the bulk of the water , small local excesses can build up , but with pure water to start with , the acidity or alkalinity would be undetectable .
Eventually the H+ and OH  ions find each other and recombine :
H+ + OH  → H 2 O
... so the net reaction for the electrolysis of pure water is simply the production of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen :
2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2
... leaving the pH of the water at 7.0 , just as it was before electrolysis .
As mentioned above , the Kurzweil - Grossman book contains a number of un - truths about " alkaline water " , suggesting that neither of them has ever taken a course in chemistry or physiology .
Several of their misleading statements are outlined below ; anyone questioning my comments on them can check any standard textbook on human physiology .
Typing " ionized water " into any Web browser will yield hundreds of hits on outfits offering to sell you this worthless quackery .
One of the most egregious sites promotes " the Alkalarian approach to optimal living " and " the pH miracle for weight loss " together with nonsense about microscopic blood examination .
Adding to the confusion is the practice of some vendors to incorporate some of the false and misleading claims regarding structured or " clustered " waters with the standard ionization bunk ; see here for an example .
If you really want ( or need ) to reduce gastric acidity , products such as Milk of Magnesia or Alka - Seltzer are cheaper and more effective than " water ionizer " machines .
But bear in mind that acidosis and alkylosis are serious conditions that require medical intervention and can be properly diagnosed only by measurements of blood electrolyte and CO 2 content .
The pH of ordinary drinking water will have little effect on the pH of the stomach contents because gastric fluid has an overwhelmingly low pH ( Gastric fluid is essentially a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid . )
Hundreds of millions of years of evolution have adapted humans to tolerate drinking waters having a fairly wide range of pH ( 5 - 8 ) .
Any water that is sufficiently alkaline to significantly affect gastric pH is unlikely to be considered potable by most people .
Further , the enzymes that digest proteins in the stomach require a low pH in order to function properly , so if one were to ingest sufficient alkali to reduce gastric pH , it would also interfere with digestion .
The pH of blood is especially critical and must be maintained within the range of about 7.35 - 7.45 .
If the blood pH falls outside this range the condition is known as acidosis or alkylosis .
Temporary acidosis can be induced by holding your breath , preventing release of CO 2 .
Temporary alkylosis can be induced by hyperventilation , causing excess release of CO 2 .
Chronic acidosis or alkylosis can be very serious and is often associated with kidney failure .
which is carried by the blood to the lungs , where the carbon dioxide is then regenerated and expelled :
The pH of intracellular bodily fluids such as blood is controlled by an exquisitely - balanced set of reactions involving removal of ( acidic ) carbon dioxide through the lungs , removal of ( alkaline ) ammonia through the kidneys , and the buffering action within the blood by bicarbonate , and to a smaller extent by phosphate and certain proteins .
In the most important of these mechanisms , carbon dioxide produced by cell metabolism reacts with water to form carbonic acid H 2 CO 3 , and this reacts with carbonate in the blood to form bicarbonate
In order to flog their electrolysis units , these hucksters ( mostly independent agents showing little evidence of any knowledge of chemistry or physiology ) spin a number of yarns that are simply untrue , but which are easily believed by many people who are not familiar with modern chemistry and physiology .
Here is a summary of some of the more common claims with my comments .
There are hundreds of web sites offering up misinformation on the dangers of " acidic " and " high ORP " waters ( see here , for example ) which make statements that are unsupported by scientific evidence .
is a common scam used by dubious practicioners to prescribe dietary supplements or special diets .
Urinary pH depends on many factors and is a useful clinical diagnostic only in the context of numerous other measurements on urine and blood chemistry ( reference ) .
So unless you are under the care of a physician for nephritic disease , diabetes or a urinary tract infection , daily pH testing is just another form of navel - gazing .
An exception might be for people subject to kidney stones or gout , since low urinary pH promotes precipitation of uric acid .
For such patients , citric acid or a citrate salt ( which are metabolized to bicarbonate ) are often prescribed for raising urinary pH .
The idea , widely promoted on commercial quackery sites , that people need " alkaline " water supplements to " balance body pH " or " neutralize " acidic foods , has no scientific support .
It is pure , deceptive sales hype .
Numerous other processes lead to temporary unbalances .
Thus hyperventilation , which can result from emotional upset , leads to above - normal loss of CO 2 , and thus to alkalosis .
Similarly , retention of CO 2 caused by bronchopneumonia , for example , can give rise to acidosis .
Acidosis can also result from diarrhea ( loss of alkaline fluid from the intestine , ) while loss of gastric contents by vomiting promotes alkalosis .
Deviations of the blood plasma pH from its normal value of 7.4 by more than about ±0.1 can be very serious .
These conditions are known medically as acidosis and alkalosis .
They can be caused by metabolic disturbances such as diabetes and by kidney failure ( in which excretion of H 2 PO 4 – , for example , is inhibited . )
The major buffering system in the body is the carbonate system , which exists mainly in the form of HCO 3 – at normal physiological pH .
Secondary buffering action comes from phosphate , from proteins and other weak organic acids , and ( within blood cells ) , the hemoglobin .
It is remarkable that the pH of most cellular fluids can be kept within such a narrow range , given the large number of processes that tend to upset it .
This is due to the exquisite balance between a large number of interlinked processes operating at many different levels .
Interestingly , the ingestion of " acidic " foods can make the body more alkaline .
This comes about because the weak organic acids in such foods are partly in the form of sodium or potassium salts M + A – .
In order to maintain charge balance , some of the CO 2 produced by normal metabolism of these food acids must be converted into bicarbonate ( that is , M + HCO 3 – ) which is a weak base .
Respiration , the most important physiological activity of a cell , is an acid- producing process .
Carbohydrate substances are broken down into carbon dioxide , and thus carbonic acid :
About two - thirds of the weight of an adult human consists of water .
About two - thirds of this water is located within cells , while the remaining third consists of extracellular water , mostly interstitial fluid that bathes the cells , and the blood plasma .
The latter , amounting to about five percent of body weight ( about 5 L in the adult ) , serves as a supporting fluid for the blood cells and acts as a means of transporting chemicals between cells and the external environment .
It is basically a 0.15 M solution of salt ( NaCl ) containing smaller amounts of other electrolytes , the most important of which are bicarbonate ( HCO 3 – ) and protein anions .
Acid - base chemistry plays a crucial role in physiology , both at the level of the individual cell and of the total organism .
The reasons for this are twofold :
Do n't be taken in by the pseudoscience peddled by quacks , cranks , kooks or crooks !
( sample )
Instead , take a look at these references provided by real scientists for the education of medical students :
This is certainly not to say that " ionized water causes cancer " , but there is far more evidence for this than for the patently false claims by Kangen and others that it prevents cancer .
Hypochlorous acid HOCl ( always present even in alkaline hypochorite solutions ) is now known to trigger a number of cellular processes connected with cancer , either through inducing mutations in DNA sequences , or by making epigenetic changes to certain DNA bases .
It is known , for example that HOCl leads to the formation of 5 - chlorocytosine , which is believed to suppress some genes that normally act to inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth .
( C&EN , 2011.03.14 , p 40 )
But if you are drinking electrolytically - produced " ionized " water , there is another plausible physiological explanation .
The hypochlorite ions present in most such waters ( see above ) may make their way through the digestive tract and end up in the large intestine , where it comes into contact with the hundreds of species of [ mostly ] bacterial organisms that colonize everyone 's colon .
It is now believed that these so - called gut flora can actively alter the nature of many food and metabolic products that enter the colon , and they vary greatly between individuals .
It may be that the hypochlorite acts to kill off or suppress some organisms whose normal function is to remove substances to which one 's body is allergic or otherwise harmful .
A recent study has shown that placebos can be effective even when " medications " clearly labeled as " placebos " are administered !
For more on the placebo effect , see here and here .
Studies have shown that placebos can relieve the symptoms in about 40 percent of those who suffer from chronic ailments .
They are probably even more effective for those who are inclined toward " alternative medicine " or the " wellness " industry .
In other words , if you " believe " that something might help , it may well do so , and the more people are made to pay for it , the more eager they will be to have their beliefs confirmed .
So buying a " water ionizer " is a very expensive way of obtaining a solution that is essentially the same as diluted laundry bleach .
But would you want to drink this " eau de Clorox " ?
Do n't try this at home !
Many " water ionizer " devices depend on the addition of ordinary salt to make the water more conductive .
Electrolysis of a dilute sodium chloride solution liberates hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions at the cathode , producing an alkaline solution that consists essentially of sodium hydroxide NaOH which can be drawn off as “ alkaline water ” .
At the anode , chloride ions are oxidized to elemental chlorine .
If some of this chlorine is allowed to combine with some of the hydroxide ions produced at the cathode , it disproportionates into hypochlorous acid HOCl , a weak acid and an oxidizing agent .
Some ionizer devices allow the user to draw off this solution for use as a disinfecting agent .
In many cases the two streams can be combined to form a mixture consisting of both HOCl and sodium hypochlorite ( equivalent to diluted ordinary laundry bleach ) , depending on the pH desired .
... so if your water comes from a well and contains dissolved salts or " hardness ions " such as calcium or magnesium in medium concentrations , electrolysis might be possible , but it will not be effective in removing impurities .
It should be noted that groundwaters are usually somewhat alkaline to start with .
For electrolysis to occur to any practical extent , additional ions must be present in order to transport the current .
For example , the large - scale electrolysis of water to manufacture highly pure H 2 and O 2 is carried out by adding sulfuric acid .
The sulfate ions help carry the current , but they do not react at the positive electrode because H 2 O is more easily decomposed .
One more thing about the electrolysis of water having very low ion content : because of the very small number of ions in such water , it conducts electric current very poorly , so the process is extremely slow and inefficient .
This means that if your water supply is free of dissolved minerals , no significant amount of electrolysis will occur .
In other words , electrolysis cannot change the pH of ion- free water .
None of the sites hawking these " water ionizers " mention this , of course , nor do they bother to tell you the even worse news :
1 The stomach always contains some gastric secretion and is always acidic ; eating food stimulates the production of more acid .
2 If acid were present all the time , it would eat a hole in your stomach lining .
1 It is important to remember that hydrochloric acid is present in the stomach only when food is there .
How can alkaline water with a pH of 9 or 10 be expected to affect the body when the pH of the stomach is 2 or less ?
Some absurd sales claims about " ionized water "
Vendors who seek out the sucker market tend to go for even more outrageous flapdoodle .
The text in the left column below is taken verbatim from a typical water - ionizer sales site as it existed in Sept 2002 .
Similar twaddle describing how " ionized water " cures all sorts of ills can be found in many other places .
The shading indicates statements that I consider untrue , meaningless , or misleading .
[ Claims which I consider misleading , false , or meaningless are in purple print ]
The hype
The science .. ionized alkaline water is grouped together in smaller clusters of 5 - 6 water molecules instead of the 10 - 13 found in tap water .
This makes it " micro- clustered " , meaning it will be more quickly and easily absorbed , and will hydrate the tissues more effectively .
The hexagonal molecular structure resulting from electrolysis is what makes ionized water wetter than tap or bottled water .
These smaller " hexagons " of water molecules are half as large as the molecular chains that come out of the faucet , and permeate cellular membranes quicker so that Alkaline Water is more hydrating and quicker to refresh after strenuous exercise .
There is no scientific evidence to support the assertions about the existence of water clusters or its beneficial effects on tissue hydration .
See the Water Cluster Quackery page for more information on this bunk .
The diagram on the left is incorrect and misleading .
There is no way that H 2 O molecules in liquid water can be stabilized or retained in the hexagonal configuration shown .
Alkaline water Increases energy , decreases recovery time and improves capacity for aerobic activities .
" Reverses the aging process , lowers blood pressure and helps the heart work less hard . "
Neutralizes and flushes toxins and acidic waste from your body .
Your body can focus on achieving optimal health .
The electrolysis process rearranges healthy minerals that are native to your tap water according to their electrical charge .
As a result , alkaline ionized water contains essential calcium , magnesium , sodium , and potassium minerals in a form that can be assimilated .
Cancer does not thrive in an oxygenated and alkaline environment while health does .
There is no credible scientific evidence for any of these statements , which you will find only on Web sites promoting commercial products .
Acid water should never be consumed .
Those of us who live in Vancouver and other cities where the drinking water comes from mountain runoff and snowmelt have been drinking acidic water for years with no demonstrable ill effect .
( Yes , they had to tear up my street to replace the corroded water mains , but our stomachs all have built - in corrosion protection against the much stronger hydrochloric acid in ordinary gastric fluid . )
Beneficial uses of acidic water : Natural astringent for improving complexions .
It removes skin oil and greasy dirt without harsh chemicals .
Natural hair conditioner .
Highly antiseptic for cuts , abrasions , and wounds
Soaking in warm acidic ionized water improves healing from athletes foot , rashes , nail fungus infections and insect bites Claims such as these are widely propagated by water ionizer hucksters without any supporting evidence .
If you really want to sample the " benefits " of acidic water , try a dilute solution of vinegar or almost any fruit juice .
One outfit claims the following " Health indications for drinking alkaline water " :
High blood pressure - Muscle aches after exercise - Morning sickness - Diabetes - Hangovers - Osteoporosis - Body odor - Constipation - Obesity - Chronic fatigue - Diarrhea - Common colds - Migraines .
" Hydrogen - Rich " Water
This can refer to water to which hydrogen gas has been added or , more commonly , to what is sometimes known as " reduced " water containing what is claimed to be " active " hydrogen .
See here for more on these schemes .
H3O Hype
While most of the " ionized water " hucksters flog " alkaline " water , here is one that promotes an acidic water that claims to be good for everything from psoriasis and strep throat to halitosis and jock itch .
These jokers claim to have found a way of making a " stabilized , highly concentrated version of H3O in solution " ... bull - poop that would make any high - school chemistry student laugh ; the fact is that the hydronium ion H 3 O+ is already about as stable as any chemical entity , as long as it is accompanied by enough negative ions ( presumably sulfate , SO 4 2 – in this case ) to maintain electroneutrality .
Those who question my skepticism will find solace in an interview with the " world renowned physicist Dr. Tom Beardon " whose name , curiously , does not appear in the ISI database of published scientists .
According to this CBS - 11 News story , Alpha - Omega Labs was shut down by the FDA after its owner pleaded guilty to various charges relating to the marketing of this and other products .
Ionized Fabric-ations
The boutique - sportswear industry has discovered the marketability of pseudoscience and quackery ( witness the 2007 Lululemon flap ) , so here is the IonX Recovery Gear cabinet of " ionic " flapdoodle : " Harnessing the power of negative ions , IonX naturally replenishes energy , restores balance and enhances every stage of an athlete ’s workout .
. .
The patented technology increases blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tissue and muscles , while clearing metabolic waste such as lactic acid .
Additionally , IonX activates chemicals that improve muscle function , block pain and reduce inflammation . " [ link ]
I was unable to find any credible scientific support for any of these claims .
A look at the patent reveals that the fabric is treated with various compounds that are weakly dissociated into ions in water , and are basically the same as those employed as anti-static agents in fabrics and home laundry products .
( I presume that the delicious irony that these additives are widely used for exactly the opposite purpose of what the IonX products are purported to do , has escaped these people ! )
So there are a few " ions " involved here , but it is a basic law of physics that ions are always formed in oppositely - charged pairs , so to suggest that the negative ions exert some special effect outside the fabric is without foundation .
And their claims regarding oxygen , nutrients , and alleviation of metabolic wastes are simply absurd .
I wonder if those jocks with the backward - pointing baseball caps who used to sit in the back rows of my Chemistry classes will get taken in by this garbage !
You do n't need a machine to get acidic or alkaline water !
The cheapest and by far the best source of " acidic " water is cranberry juice , which offers the additional benefits of inhibiting the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces in the urinary tract and on dental plaque , increasing the amounts of " good " cholesterol in the blood , and raising the level of plasma antioxidants ( the juice 's vitamin C content may be a contributing factor here . )
See here for a reliable reference .
If you must have " alkaline " water , try dissolving some baking soda ( sodium bicarbonate ) in water ; this will give you a bitter - tasting drink with a pH of around 8.3 .
You can also purchase overpriced " concentrates " such as AlkaLife Drops that are touted by author / quacks such as Sang Whang whose misinformation - filled writings are not supported by science .
Build your own Instead of purchasing a grossly operpriced " water ionizer " , you can build your own .
Googling " build water ionizer " will yield a long list of sites and YouTube videos , with the usually mix of reliability from self - appointed " experts " .
Basically , you need a source of direct current of around 12 volts ( a car battery charger should do ) , and a couple of electrodes .
Important :
Do not use copper , steel , chromium , or other common metals for the electrodes , as these will add toxic metal ions to the water as they corrode .
Use only pure titanium ( or a " medical grade " titanium alloy ) or platinum .
You might find some of these on eBay or a similar source .
I do n't recommend building your own , and if you do so , your are " on your own " ; I will not respond to requests asking me to evaluate your plans or to seek advice .
Do n't bet the farm on it !
Several companies flog " anolyte water " and similar dubious electrolyzed water devices to the agricultural industry , promising such poorly - defined benefits for livestock as " better digestion " , " stronger egg shells " and " better yield " , while for field crops they say " conditions grains " , " conditions irrigation water " , etc. etc .
Of course , what they are selling is nothing more than an exceedingly - expensive means of generating what amounts to ordinary laundry bleach .
You do n't even need water to get hit by " ionization " scams !
Yes , this outfit offers " ionized bracelets " to willing suckers ... no mention of how they work or what they are supposed to do for you .
Here 's another that peddles tourmaline crystals as " Nature 's source of Far Infrared and Negative Ions " .
Of course , all matter above absolute zero emits far - ir radiaiton , ordinarily known as " heat " .
Tourmaline also happens to be piezoelectric : when you squeeze it , a small voltage difference develops between the two ends of the crystal .
Nothing special here , but these operators weave this into a fabric of lies about the crystals putting negative ions into and purifying water , reducing cluster size .
increasing dissolved oxygen , and having a general healing effect .
And how about Ionized stones ?
Can rocks be ionized ?
Well not really , but natural radioactivity occasionally knocks an electron out of an atom , creating an ion pair which can remain locked into the solid for a long time .
So in this sense , even the rocks you find in your back yard can be said to be " ionized " .
But these jokers take it to ridiculous extremes :
By placing an Ionized Stone next to a glass of water or plate of food , the water or food becomes energized , increasing digestibility and nutrient absorption .
Ionized stones can also be used effectively in conjunction with Ener - Chi Art -- simply place an Ionized Stone on the corresponding area of the body while viewing an Ener - Chi Art picture .
" Electrolyzed oxidizing water " ( " EO " water )
This term is commonly applied to the products of " water ionizing " machines when the marketing focus is on bactericidal properties , rather than on the false claims about the health benefits of alkaline drinking water .
As is explained above , these electrolysis devices produce what amounts to a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite , similar to what can be obtained by diluting some ordinary laundry bleach such as Clorox to the point at which the odor is no longer noticeable .
If this is made slightly acidic ( by addition of some vinegar or lemon juice , for example ) , then most of the hypochlorite ion is in the form of hypochlorous acid , which is a bactericide and is the active product produced when chlorine is used to disinfect drinking water .
The only real issues here are
Is it worth purchasing an expensive electrolysis device to generate the same mixture than one can get perhaps several hundred gallons of by diluting a $ 1.49 bottle of home laundry bleach ?
Is this stuff any more effective for purposes such as disinfecting vegetables and foods than by simply washing with ordinary water , or with water acidified by vinegar or lemon juice ?
Do you really want your food to come into contact with an oxidizing agent that can react with some of the organic components to produce potentially carcinogenic by - products ?
( This is , of course , one argument against the use of chlorine to disinfect waters containing a lot of organic material )
So while " EOW " that contains reasonably high concentrations of hypochlorous acid can act as a disinfectant , I consider it somewhat deceptive when promoters tout it ( as some do ) as a special , " chemical - free " disinfectant .
See also this Food Quality article .
Electrolytic " bleach generators " are legitimate devices for use in industrial and institutional settings in which large quantities disinfectant are required .
They are considered a " green " alternative to shipping or handling chlorine gas ( dangerous ) or hypochlorite solutions ( mostly water , and thus heavy ) .
In early 2009 , a widely - reprinted article by an LA Times reporter touted the use of machines that produce this " miracle water " .
But for home use , it hardly seems economical ; one could probably buy a supply of laundry bleach that would last several lifetimes for the cost of a " water ionizer " !
Tennant 's untenable claims
The Tennant Company is a long - established and reputable manufacturer of industrial cleaning equipment .
It is sad to see them descend into silly junk science in pushing their new " ech2o " technology which they say works by unlocking the vast amounts of energy stored in the water molecule H2O ... creating highly oxygenated micro-bubbles .
... the oxygenated water is sent through a water cell where an electric current is applied .
Flowing out of the water cell is highly charged , acidic and alkaline water with all the attributes of a powerful cleaner .
[ link ]
Give me a break !
" Vast amounts of energy stored in H2O " ?
" Highly oxygenated " ?
( How highly ? )
It sounds impressive , but what does oxygen have to do with cleaning , other than reducing the water surface tension by a minute amount , probably less than is produced by the electrolytes they have to add to electrolyze the water ?
And how can water ( or any bulk matter ) violate the electroneutrality principle and carry a significant electric charge ?
Finally , have any of these people passed high school chemistry , where they would learn what happens when you mix " acidic and alkaline water " ?
An article published in 2016 ( Cleaning with Bulk Nanobubbles , Langmuir 11203- 11211 ) by Tennant researchers cuts through the B.S. and reveals that their process electrolytically decomposes salt water into nanobubbles of hydrogen and oxygen gas that remain stable for long periods .
These bubbles , through their buoyant action , are believed to prevent dirt particles removed by mechanical scrubbing from re-depositing on the surface .
See this 2011 article about a dispute that challenges the effectiveness of this technology .
More recently , Tennant has been sued in Germany for misleading advertising and has been made to withdraw some of its claims in Germany , Belgium and the UK .
Active ions clean up !
ActiveIon™ markets a hand - held cleaning device which " frees you from chemicals " .
According to their Web page , it does not use salt or generate sodium hypochlorite , which was my original assumption that led to its mention on this page .
Instead , it employs electrolysis to generate " nanobubbles " ( presumably H 2 and O 2 ) which attach themselves to dirt particles .
As the charges from the nanobubbles build up on the dirt particles , they separate from one another and break apart due to repulsion of like electrical charges , and become suspended in the water solution – allowing the dirt to be wiped away .
They additionally claim that it kills bacteria and viruses by electroporation , a process that ruptures cell walls and is widely employed to insert DNA into cells .
[ But viruses do not possess cell walls ] .
Although the company claims that the efficacy of the device has been verified by third - party tests , they offer no performance data .
The scientific literature contains some references to irreversible electroporation as a means of food preservation and water treatment , I am not aware of any research results that verify the claimed mechanism or quantitatively explore its practical utility .
EO water sold for medical uses
There are a number of products on the market , ostensibly directed at the medical profession ( but conveniently available to anyone with a credit card ) that claim to be for topical use on the skin ( for " dermal wound care " , burns , abrasions ) , or for sanitizing instruments and surfaces .
Much of this so - called " technology " seems to originate in Japan .
What makes me , as a chemist , very suspicious about these products is that they never state explicitly what exactly is in the product ; instead , they only make vague references to terms such as " super - oxidized " which , to me , are meaningless and which I suspect are intended purely to impress people ( including all too many physicians ) whose chemistry background , if any , is far in the past .
Most medications that I am familiar with as a lay - person are defined in terms of their chemical composition rather than on the hocus - pocus ways in which they are made .
Oculus Innovative Sciences appears to be the most widely promoted of these products .
Judging from {an earlier version of their site} , they are " innovative " only in the sense that they have figured out a way to sell what is essentially hypochlorite laundry bleach at exorbitant prices ... or perhaps they are just trying to peddle their stock to science - ignorant investors .
My somewhat - jaded view of this promotion seems to be reflected in a 2007 PharmaTracker review .
I am very skepical about this or similar products .
All low - pH solutions tend to be bactericidal , but before buying into this , I would like to see some evidence that these products are more effective than a hypochlorite solution of this kind , any mild detergent or soap solution , or even a dilute solution of vinegar .
References to " ionized water "
A few articles on this subject have appeared in the scientific literature .
Most are from Japan , and none that I have seen clearly states the composition of the water used — a failure that would probably guarantee rejection by a mainstream medical journal .

None of these papers is very convincing to me , and I doubt that they would have passed muster in the more prestigious journals  which may explain the rather strange publishing venues several of the authors have chosen which are quite outside the medical and physiological fields .
One wonders if these journals have reviewers qualified to give papers on this subject adequate scrutiny .
It 's interesting to note that the last journal in the list also published the now - discredited article on cold fusion in the 1980s .

Have you ever heard of those foot - baths through which an electric current is passed in order to draw out the " toxins " from your body ?
To someone who knows no chemistry , it can be quite impressive to see all these evil substances color the water various shades of brown , green , and blue as the current works its magic .
Sometimes you see flecks of solids and bubbles of gas appear as your body is " cleansed " .
Well , this is an old parlor trick , a nice chemistry - classroom demonstration , and , of course , a highly profitable scam .

Upping their game ?
The impact of new contracts on football referees ’ performance
Alex Bryson , Babatunde Buraimo , Rob Simmons
After losing the football world cup final in South Africa , the Dutch press blamed the “ chump ” of a referee from England for losing control of the game .
Yet this column presents evidence that , as one of the few countries where referees are paid a salary , English referees have the incentives to be among the best .
The only Englishman on the pitch for the world cup final in South Africa was the referee , Howard Webb .
Like many referees officiating in the top tier of English football today he is paid a salary .
A decade ago he and his colleagues were paid by the match – effectively a “ piece rate ” .
The change was introduced by football authorities to improve referee performance .
Despite generating billions of euros in revenue each year , the performance and incentive structure facing referees has been little studied ( Frick et al. 2008 ) .
In this column we discuss our recent research on the impact of the new forms of contract ( see Bryson et al. 2010 ) .
Until the introduction of salary contracts in the early 2000s , all referees in English professional football were paid a match fee for each game they officiated .
The change was introduced to “ professionalise ” the top tier of refereeing .
Motivating the men in black
The new contracts offered greater income security to referees .
Under the match fee system , referees could be dropped from the list of officials immediately following a poor performance , whereas the salary contracts were initially renewable after two years ( and subsequently renewable annually ) .
The salaries also offered considerably more money than match fees .
In return , salaried referees were required to attend fortnightly off - the - job training sessions to improve their fitness and ability to make the right decisions on the pitch .
The motivation for introducing the salary contracts was the huge growth in revenues generated by football as a result of lucrative television deals and the realisation that referees ’ decisions were coming under increasing scrutiny in the media and among fans .
The employer – the Professional Game Match Officials Board – was intent on driving up standards through salary contracts .
Economic theory suggests that the employer was doing the right thing .
A classic review of research on incentives and worker performance notes that when a worker is paid a salary , “ despite the fact that there is no immediate relation between pay and performance , he is likely to have incentives to exert effort because good performance will improve future contracts .
Such reputational concerns imply that effort exertion can occur without explicit pay - for - performance contracts ” ( Prendergast 1999 ) .
The introduction of contracts could also have a second impact , attracting better quality workers .
Theory suggests that the result will be some “ sorting ” of workers , in which better ones seek out the salary contracts and less able workers remain on match fees or leave the occupation entirely .
A “ field ” experiment
Our research takes advantage of the fact that when salary contracts were introduced , referees officiating in the Championship – the second tier of English professional football – continued to be paid match fees .
This gives us a “ natural experiment ” , in which some workers move to salary contracts and others continue to be paid under the old system .
By comparing the relative performance of referees in the Premier League and the Championship in the pre-salary period with their relative performance in the post - salary period , we estimate the impact of the salary contracts .
This approach would be problematic if Premier League referees remained in the top tier throughout and thus obtain salaries , while Championship officials remain on match fees in the second tier throughout .
But this is not what happened .
All referees in both divisions became eligible for the new contacts , and some referees officiate in both divisions at various points .
There are two other concerns that might affect our ability to draw inferences about the impact of salaries on referees ’ performance .
The first is the possibility that other changes occurred at the same time as the switch to salaries , which may have had different effects on the performance of referees in the Premier League compared with the Championship .
But our analysis suggests that this is not the case .
The second concern is that the employer offered the salary contracts to the most able referees so that the contract is simply an indicator of a more able referee .
We are able to deal with this problem by controlling for referee “ fixed effects ” .
Our data include nearly all the matches played in the top two divisions of English football in the 12 seasons between 1997/98 and 2008/09 ( we have data for 11,169 of the 11,184 matches ) .
They include all 168 referees officiating at these games over the period .
Our measure of referees ’ performance is the number of yellow and red cards that they issue in a game .
Yellow cards are issued as a warning to a player when he has broken the rules , either by fouling an opponent , handling the ball , or for showing dissent .
A red card is shown if the player commits a second offence worthy of a yellow card .
Red cards can also be shown for a first offence if the offence merits it , such as violent conduct or a foul that directly prevents a goal - scoring opportunity .
Red cards lead to the player being sent off and suspended from subsequent games .
Issuing many cards is often a sign that the referee has lost control of the game .
Good referees are able to deal with most incidents without brandishing cards by communicating firmly with players from the outset .
This may not be true in every game , and perhaps the World Cup final is a good example of where this measure is more controversial .
But studies have shown a high negative correlation between number of cards awarded and subjective assessments of referees ’ performance by expert panels ( Frick et al. 2008 ) .
We find that referees ’ performance improves among those who moved onto salary contracts relative to those who do not .
The salaried referees issued an average of half a card less per game – a decline of one - sixth .
Our finding is robust to controls for referee fixed effects , which indicates that the result is not driven by salary contracts being awarded to better referees , although this does account for part of the effect .
Nor is it sensitive to workers sorting into or out of the profession .
Thus it appears that one can improve officiating at football games by using good personnel economics .
Perhaps officiating standards in international competitions will begin to rise when other countries join the likes of England and Spain in paying salaries to their top referees .

MILWAUKEE–Ray Allen , Milwaukee Bucks guard and budding NBA superstar , is drawing raves on and off the court , hailed by admirers as " not an asshole " and " a reasonably decent human being . "
Ray Allen .

The recipient of the NBA 's inaugural Magic Johnson Ideal Player Award , Allen was praised by Bucks coach George Karl as " a true standout individual , the kind of person who treats others with a basic level of respect . "
" Ray Allen is a great player , but he's an even greater person , " said Karl , who is accustomed to reporters asking him about Allen 's normalcy .
" I remember this one time during his rookie season , he was walking back to his car from practice , and a woman nearby slipped on a patch of ice and fell .
He could have kept walking , but instead he asked the woman if she was okay .
Right then and there , I knew this kid was something special . "

Allen , 25 , who came to the NBA from the University of Connecticut in 1996 , is among the NBA 's best at shooting three - pointers , defending the perimeter , and going home quietly after games .
A hardworking athlete , Allen has raised eyebrows around the league by never going AWOL or skipping practice .
" I knew when he came into this league that he had the potential to be a standout player , " said Sports Illustrated basketball writer Marty Burns .
" He had a reputation as a guy who would not only hit the clutch shot down the stretch , but also make eye contact with the towel boy .
He has the potential to be a decent human being in this league for another 10 or 15 years if he stays healthy . "

" I 'll never forget what he said to me before the first interview I did with him , " Burns said .
" He said , ' Hello , Mr. Burns . '
Then he extended his hand for me to , you know , shake .
That 's just the type of guy he is . "
Allen 's remarkable normal - human - being behavior carries over into his personal life .
Though unmarried , he spends a respectable amount of time with his 8 - year old daughter and is rumored to be on good terms with the girl 's mother .
He is also said to be close with his own mother .

Such decency has not gone unnoticed : Never accused of sexual assault , Allen has earned high praise for his lack of hostility toward women .
" When he was in college , Ray voluntarily went to several UConn women 's basketball games and has been quoted as saying that he'd play for a female coach , " Bucks public - relations director Cheri Hanson said .
" Ray Allen is n't merely in the top 1 percent of NBA players ; he 's in the 51st percentile of human beings . "
Advertisement
In addition to being a media darling , Allen 's civility makes him a fan favorite .
Though many pro athletes are abusive toward their supporters , Allen has , on numerous occasions , praised a home crowd as " good " or " great . "
Last week , after a tough home playoff loss to the Charlotte Hornets , he smiled and signed three or four autographs in the Bradley Center parking lot .
" That 's unbelievable , " said Karl , whom Allen has never threatened physically .
" To come off a tough loss like that in the Eastern Conference semifinals and still be willing to interact with people , you just do n't see that sort of thing very often . "

" Acting reasonably nice , exhibiting basic common decency , having a general awareness of other people 's feelings … that 's what sets Ray Allen apart from your run -of - the - mill NBA player , " said ESPN's Dan Patrick , who called his November 2000 interview with Allen " possibly the most civil " of his career .
" Here I am , an interviewer asking him questions , and instead of taking a swing at me or showering me with verbal abuse , he politely responds to my queries .
He did n't have to , but he did . "
Continued Patrick : " It 's nice to know that in this day and age , there are still athletes out there who say ' thank you ' when you give them a new car for making the all - star team . "
More Analysis of Case LNK Exploit Posted by Sean @ 10:30 GMT
There 's a new threat that spreads via USB storage devices , by exploiting a previously unknown flaw in Windows shortcuts .
We have added detection for the shortcut LNK exploit as Exploit : W32 / WormLink .
A.
The shortcut file used in this case is 4.1 KB .
Files associated with the trojan - dropper , backdoor , rootkit are detected as the Stuxnet family .
We mentioned two interesting details yesterday , that the rootkit was signed , and that it was targeting SCADA systems .
The rootkit components are digital signed and we 've confirmed that a valid Realtek Semiconductor Corp. signature is used .
The dropped drivers are properly signed , while the trojan - dropper itself only attempted to copy the digital signature .
In any case , the certificate , while valid , expired in June .
The H Security has a screenshot of the certificate .
Malicious software using valid digital signatures is something that our Jarno Niemel� recently predicted in his Caro 2010 Workshop presentation :
It 's Signed , therefore it 's Clean , right ?
Regarding the SCADA systems that are being targeted , the Siemens SIMATIC WinCC database appears to use a hardcoded admin username and password combination that end users are told not to change .
Thus , any organization successfully compromised by this targeted attack could be completely vulnerable to database compromise .
This Slashdot comment has additional details .
We 'll have more on this case as it develops .
Edited to add :
While the certificate used for signing has expired , noted above , because a countersigning technique to time stamp is used , it is still possible that the certificate can be utilized .
From Microsoft's MSDN Library : " The countersignature method of time stamping … allows for signatures to be verified even after the signing certificate has expired or been revoked . "
9 Sensational Sci-Fi Ideas That Came True Technologies and gadgets that debuted in science fiction films and novels .
July 28 , 2010  --
Want to predict the future ?
Maybe you should head to the movies or crack open a book .
Before technology can be tested in a lab , it has to be hatched in someone 's brain .
And , often , those brains do n't belong to scientists and product developers , but to imaginative science fiction writers and movie makers .
Sometimes it 's deliberate and sometimes it's not , but science fiction writers and scientists have long mirrored each others ' work .
" It 's incestuous , " said science fiction writer and futurist Brenda Cooper .
" I think there 's a sort of constant dialogue that goes on with science fiction writers and scientists and product designers . "
A complete list of all the science fiction prophecies that came true would fill pages .
But check out some of our favorite recent examples below .
' Minority Report ' - Like Software Fights Crime
It sounds like the basis of Steven Spielberg 's 2002 film " Minority Report " : a police unit dedicated to uncovering crimes before they even happen .
But for police officers with the Memphis Police Department , this is almost reality .
Instead of relying on human - like psychics , however , the officers rely on a sophisticated computer program .
It evaluates a wide range of factors – data on arrests , reported crime , probation , parole and even the weather – and then helps law enforcement identify patterns in crime as well as potential hotspots .
" If you can identify what kinds of crimes are occurring in a location , what days they are occurring and what time frame [ in which ] they are occurring , you really do have a sense of where to put the police , " said Richard Janikowski , director of the Center for Community Criminology and Research at the University of Memphis .
The predictive analytics software , called CRUSH ( for Criminal Reduction Utilizing Statistical History ) , is owned by IBM but has been adapted by the police department .
IBM and the Memphis Police Department announced this month that , since the program started in 2006 , crime in Memphis has dropped 30 percent overall and violent crime has declined about 15 percent .
Janikowski said organization and leadership changes contributed to the decrease in crime , but the technology played a significant role .
Digital Billboards
Next time you go to Japan , you might have your very own " Minority Report " moment .
Japanese railway companies are trying digital billboards that can determine the gender and age of people looking at them and then show them customized advertisements .
According to the Agence - France Presse , a group of 11 companies launched a one - year pilot of these high - tech billboards last month .
Unlike the billboards that called out to Tom Cruise 's character in " Minority Report , " these boards can't identify individual people .
But , using cameras , they can determine an onlooker 's sex and approximate age and then offer up an appropriate ad .
Flying Car Company Unveils Latest ' Roadable Aircraft '
Flying Cars
So it 's not the saucer - shaped vehicle George Jetson took to work .
The skies are still waiting to welcome cars that fly .
This week , Terrafugia , a leading flying car company in Woburn , Mass . , unveiled its most recent " roadable aircraft . "
The dual - purpose vehicle is equally comfortable on the road and in the sky .
Its wings can fold up to let the aircraft drive on the road and fit in a garage .
The wings extend so that the Terrafugia can take flight .
The company said the vehicle , recently approved by the Federal Aviation Administration , reaches 115 mph in flight .
3 - D Printing
Imagine that you 're on a camping trip in the middle of the woods and realize that you forgot to pack a screwdriver .
Or you 're hours away from home when your car breaks down and you need just one crucial part .
Cooper said that it might not be so long before a 3 - D printer lets you create those objects on the spot .
In " Star Trek , " Captain Kirk and his comrades called them replicators .
But Cooper said military officers might soon be able to use 3 - D printers to manufacture parts they need for their tanks while fighting wars in the desert .
" I think it 's kind of where PCs were 20 years ago , " she said .
" I think we 're going to see this become much more capable really fast . "
For example , a Brooklyn , New York - based company called Makerbots sells 3 - D printer kits for about $ 1,000 that let people " print " 3 - D plastic objects .
Once customers assemble the kit , they feed the machine a 3 - D design .
The company says the Makerbots can create almost anything that 's four by four by six inches .
Though most 3 - D printers mostly deal in plastics , Cooper said printers that produce metal objects -- and even human organs -- could be down the road .
Space Tourism
In the sci - fi classic , " 2001 : A Space Odyssey , " a Pan Am space plane shuttles passengers to a space station .
We 're not there quite yet , but thanks to commercial space pioneers like Sir Richard Branson and Elon Musk , we 're getting closer .
Branson 's Virgin Galactic is testing spaceships that could carry tourists on suborbital flights and , according to the Associated Press , already has a list of 300 clients willing to pay for the $ 200,000 ticket .
Musk 's SpaceX reached a major milestone in June , when one of its rockets achieved Earth orbit as planned .
At the time , Musk said the successful maiden voyage bolstered President Barack Obama 's plan to give private companies contracts to carry cargo and people to the space station .
" That makes you think of these sci fi heroes that could always design spaceships to go off planet , " said Cooper .
" That used to be something we wrote a lot about . "
Motion - Controlled Computing Reaches Consumer Electronics
Gesture computing and control is another fiction - becomes - reality kind of technology .
" Gestural computers – computers that respond to hand gestures – that 's become associated with the ' Minority Report , ' " said Annalee Newitz , editor - in - chief of the popular tech blog io9.com .
" Actually , the first time that people probably saw computers like that was in ' The Day the Earth Stood Still . ' "
In that 1951 black - and - white film , she said , one of the characters simply uses his hands to manipulate data on a massive computer screen .
In " Minority Report , " Tom Cruise 's character pulls on a glove and then is able to do the same thing .
The average computer may still come with a keyboard , but more and more technology is becoming motion - controlled .
Last month , Microsoft launched Kinect , its new game controller that recognizes players ' gestures and voices .
Even Apple 's multitouch iPhone , laptop trackpads and new Magic Trackpad use technology that responds to users ' hand and finger movements .
Newitz said MIT 's MediaLab is taking that kind of innovation even further with an experimental " invisible " computer mouse .
" Mouseless " lets a user control a cursor on a computer screen by moving her empty hand across a table the way she would move a real mouse .
The MediaLab's Sixth Sense project goes beyond even that .
With a wearable projector and camera , it lets users turn any surface ( even a hand or arm ) into a touchscreen control panel .
Robots
An essential sci - fi staple , robots are increasingly finding their way into real - life scenarios , both at home and at work .
In May , researchers in Germany presented an " autonomous robot car " with sensors , scanners and camera systems that could potentially help avoid military fatalities from bombings .
In Japan , a 4 - foot - tall robot called I - Fairy led a wedding ceremony .
" I can go to Costco and buy a robot to clean the floor … in Japan , they 're beginning to expand with medical robot , " said Cooper .
While Asian countries are friendlier to robots that Western countries , she said , we 'll continue to see more and more innovation in robotics .
Synthetic Biology
Frankenstein may seem like a far cry from reality but , in truth , scientists have already learned how to create an organism from man-made DNA .
In a small but important step in synthetic biology , in May , scientists from the J. Craig Venter Institute created the very first cell totally derived from DNA synthesized in a lab .
Did Science Fiction Predict the Demise of the Phsyical Book ?
" Synthetic biology is really making a lot of strides , " said Newitz .
" It goes all the way back to Frankenstein – the original synthetic creature . "
Scientists are n't going to turn out a whole human being anytime soon , but Newitz said that they have " grown " organs – such as lungs and a heart – for living lab rats .
Those techniques could potentially lead to the reconstruction of organs for human patients .
Tablets and E - Books
From the " Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " to " Star Trek " to " Minority Report , " the sci - fi genre has long promised an iPad - like computer that can be held in your hands .
But Bill Christensen , a Web application developer and owner of Technovelgy.com , a website on science fiction innovations , said electronic books were written about by a science fiction writer decades ago .
In the 1961 novel , " Return from the Stars , " he said Stanislaw Lem predicted the end of the physical book .
" No longer was it possible to browse among shelves , to weigh volumes in hand , to feel their heft , the promise of ponderous reading .
The bookstore resembled , instead , an electronic laboratory .
The books were crystals with recorded contents .
They can be read the aid of an opton , which was similar to a book but had only one page between the covers .
At a touch , successive pages of the text appeared on it , " Lem writes .
" That sounds pretty much like a Kindle to me and that 's fifty years ago , " said Christensen .
This week , he said , the reference was even more striking :
For the first time ever , Amazon said it sold more electronic books in the last quarter than hardcovers .
From the outside , Jerry Erwin ’s home in the northwestern US state of Oregon is a nondescript house with a manicured front lawn and little to differentiate it from those of his neighbors .
But tucked away out of sight in his backyard are the signs of his preparations for doomsday , a catastrophic societal collapse that Erwin , 45 , now believes is likely within his lifetime .

“ I ’ve got , under an awning , stacks of firewood , rain catching in barrels , I ’ve got a shed with barbed concertina wire , like the military uses , ” he told AFP .
He and his wife also have also stockpiled thousands of rounds of ammunition and enough food for about six months .
“ Several years ago I worked on paying off the house , replacing all the windows , and just very recently , I ’m proud to say , we ’ve replaced all our exterior doors with more energy - efficient ones , with as much built - in security features as I could get , ” he told AFP .
“ Plus I ’m going to be adding some more structural improvements to the door frames to make it hopefully virtually impossible to take a battering ram to them . ”
Erwin and others like him in the United States and elsewhere see political upheaval and natural disasters as clear signs that civilization is doomed .

“ We ’re hitting on all cylinders as far as symptoms that have led other great powers to decline or collapse : resource depletion , damage to the environment , climate change , those are the same things that affected other great societies , ” he said .
For Erwin , the decline is irreversible and the best approach is to prepare for the inevitable .
His pessimism is shared by a wide range of people , from left - wing environmentalists who believe climate change and capitalist greed will doom human society to Christian fundamentalists who think sin will do the same .
ADVERTISEMENT
They label themselves “ preppers , ” “ doomers , ” and “ survivalists , ” and take a variety of different approaches to the same question :
How best to prepare for the coming apocalypse ?
Jim Rawles , who Erwin describes as “ the patron saint of survivalism , ” prefers an isolationist , Christian - influenced approach .
ADVERTISEMENT
He homeschooled his children , declines to say where he lives , and advises readers of his website survivalblog.com to “ relocate to a safe area and live there year - round . ”
“ When planning your retreat house , think : medieval castle , ” he adds , extolling the benefits of using sandbags to protect any new home .
Rawles , like many on the most conservative end of the survivalist spectrum , is also anti-tax , pro-gun rights , and suspicious of anything that smacks of socialism .

But the survivalist movement also includes left - wing community activists , who are devoted to living off the land and have never fired a weapon , and people like Chris Martenson , who quit a job with a six - figure salary that he felt was “ an unnecessary diversion from the real tasks at hand . ”
He began growing his own food and developed a “ Crash Course ” that urges people to better prepare for societal instability .
He also took over management of his investments and boasts of a 166 percent return on his portfolio .
For Martenson , the wake - up call was the September 11 , 2001 attacks , when he felt gripped by uncertainty and totally unprepared .
Erwin had always felt that society would eventually disintegrate , but he and many other US survivalists say the dysfunctional response to the 2005 Hurricane Katrina was what spurred them to action .

“ I thought , okay , things are not going to get better … maybe this society , our civilization , the American empire , will collapse during my lifetime , ” Erwin said .
For John Milandred , no single event pushed him to leave his suburban home and set up a farm in Oklahoma .
“ We just got fed up of working all the time to pay bills and not accomplishing anything , ” he said .
A member of the American Preppers Network , Milandred said he and his wife aspired to “ grow our own foods and be self sufficient … to live like the pioneers , like our great - grandparents . ”

It is unclear how many people subscribe to the lifestyle , but there are hundreds of websites devoted to the movement , and Erwin ’s surburban - self - reliance.com attracts visitors from around the world .
The global financial crisis has increased interest in survivalism “ bigtime , ” Erwin said , but he feels sorry for latecomers to the movement .
“ We ’ll help them if we can , ” he said .
“ But a lot of people are climbing on board at the last minute and its going to be hard for them . ”

Photo Gallery Lew Perkins through the years
Feature Athletic Director Lew Perkins KU Athletic Director led the Kansas Athletic Department for seven years and retired on Sept. 7 , 2010 .
Look back at his time at KU .
Kansas Athletics Director Lew Perkins — who on Thursday announced his retirement — will work on Mount Oread until Sept. 4 , 2011 .
And Chancellor Bernadette Gray - Little said his expertise will be needed as KU faces an uncertain future because of the anticipated breakup of the Big 12 conference .
“ I believe that part of his decision to retire may have been to allow him to focus on the things that need to be done , ” Gray - Little said .
“ I think the idea was that by making his plans clear at this time that he would be able to focus more clearly on the things that we need to do . ”
Perkins and KU athletics have been mired in controversy in recent weeks , as it was revealed that five employees and a consultant allegedly had participated in a scheme to sell football and basketball tickets for personal gain .
Federal authorities are investigating the cash - for - tickets scheme , as well as other allegations about irregularities with tickets .
Still , Gray - Little said she was surprised when Perkins told her Thursday he ’d decided to leave .
“ I had not asked him to retire , and I had not asked him to resign , ” she said .
Self ’s perspective
KU basketball coach Bill Self said he , too , sees Perkins ’ leadership as key to the university ’s athletics program during coming months .
“ I knew that the day would come , ” he said of Perkins ’ planned departure from KU .
“ I think everybody knew it was coming .
It was surprising it would come today . ”
Self said he talked with Perkins on Thursday .
“ He was in good spirits , ” the coach said .
“ I think he has a peace about it .
And regardless of what angle you ’re taking , the man has been through a lot in the last couple of months . ”
However , Self said Perkins ’ decision to leave should not be equated with being forced out .
“ He wo n’t walk away from any battle or fights , ” Self said .
“ It was something he felt in his heart that was the best way to serve the university . …
This guy has gotten some stuff done while he ’s been here . ”
Perkins would not comment on Thursday .
However , in a statement he said , “ At this time , my greatest priority is working on conference alignment issues , and as I ’ve committed to the chancellor , I will work tirelessly on these efforts .
Conference alignment is the biggest challenge we have before us as an athletics department and an institution . ”
The timeline set for Perkins ’ retirement would allow him to claim one last retention bonus from Kansas Athletics before leaving , according to his contract .
According to an amendment to his contract negotiated by former Chancellor Robert Hemenway , Perkins would be paid $ 600,000 , tax - free , from Kansas Athletics if he is still serving as athletics director on June 30 , 2011 .
A $ 2.05 million retention bonus contributed to Perkins ’ receiving more than $ 4 million in salary and bonuses in 2009 .
His base salary is $ 800,000 per year , and he earns an additional $ 100,000 for media relations work .
Unprecedented changes
Perkins arrived at KU in 2003 after a highly successful stint at the University of Connecticut .
Perkins replaced Al Bohl , who left KU under turmoil after taking over for Bob Frederick .
“ I am very proud of the academic and athletic success of our student - athletes during my time at KU , and I will forever treasure the friendships and experiences being a Jayhawk has brought , ” he said .
“ Our supporters are among the best across the nation , and I could not be more pleased with how much we have accomplished together . ”
Perkins turned 65 this year and said it was “ the right time ” for such a decision .
During his time at Kansas , Perkins affected the growth of KU ’s athletic department budget in an unprecedented manner .
At the time of his arrival , KU ’s athletic budget was $ 27 million annually .
Today , KU ’s annual budget has reached more than $ 55 million .
In addition , while at Kansas , Perkins oversaw a football team that won the first BCS bowl game in school history , as well as watching a men ’s basketball program win its first national championship in two decades .
In 2008 , Perkins was voted by a poll in Time magazine as the top sports executive in the world .
He was the only college sports administrator to make the list of 35 .
Challenging year
It ’s been a difficult year for Perkins , who had to answer for fights between the KU men ’s basketball and football programs , then had a lame - duck football coach , Mark Mangino , for the latter part of the season because of an investigation into Mangino ’s conduct toward his players .
Following that , five members of the athletic department and one consultant resigned under pressure or were fired because of a ticket - scalping scandal that cost the university millions .
Finally , in recent weeks , Perkins found himself in the middle of a blackmail scandal involving exercise equipment provided to him for personal use .
A native of Chelsea , Mass. , Perkins was inducted into his high school Hall of Fame in 1989 .
A highly recruited basketball player , he played at the University of Iowa ( 1965 - 67 ) for Hall of Fame coach and KU graduate Ralph Miller .
Perkins earned his undergraduate degree there in 1967 .
Perkins served as Director of Athletics ( 1969 - 80 ) and head basketball coach ( 1969 - 79 ) at the University of South Carolina - Aiken as that institution grew from a junior college to a four - year institution .
He received his master ’s degree in education ( 1975 ) from the University of South Carolina .
Perkins delivered the commencement address and received an honorary Doctor of Education degree at USC Aiken in May 2005 .
Perkins also has served as athletics director at the University of Maryland and Wichita State University , and associate director of athletics at the University of Pennsylvania .
At Connecticut , where he worked from 1990 - 2003 , Perkins was instrumental in guiding UConn athletics to growth athletically , academically and financially .
His leadership influenced six NCAA Division I National Championships at UConn .
“ Every human has four endowments – self awareness , conscience , independent will and creative imagination .
These give us the ultimate human freedom …
The power to choose , to respond , to change “
– Dr. Stephen R. Covey
In reading the statement above we must consider what we are doing every moment in our lives to improve who we are and who we want to be as we grow in development .
Our self awareness as humans is a form that not only makes us understand that we are a part of everything in the universe .
However each action we do does have an effect as to the way our life turns out .
Each relationship we make or tear down outwardly will affect the world we are part of .
In knowing this we must look at every positive out come we can and strive for it .
It has been said what we put out will be received .
It is that way when making our decisions on who we are putting out for the world to see .
Each morning we look in the mirror and decide if we are worthy as to what may come to us in the day that will follow .
If we wake to a negative we find that we are neither happy or for that matter nothing during the whole day can do anything for us .
One thing we must learn to do is be not just aware of ourselves but others around us and realize that our actions can and will effect them or there out come .
We must before we take that look in the morning mirror say to ourselves at least five positive things we see we are worthy of and put out the vibe that we are worthy of the day and that we are worthy of our success and love that we can pass on .
When being aware of ourselves we must see that helping others is the first way to help ourselves be what we feel worthy of .
That brings us to the thoughts as to who we are deep in side .
Our conscience is that that guides us to making positive happenings in our life .
We do the best work when we listen to our conscience as to doing right by those we work with and being truthful not only to those we seek relationships with but to ourselves as to what we would like to see in the way we handle all our dealings with the world .
It ’s true that many people do not understand or have the will to listen to their most inner conscience .
They choose to live with what they make excuses for such as small truths and half lies as to how they do everything with anyone they know .
They create a reputation of mistrusts and negatives that follow them and cause them to sleep with nightmares .
The whole idea of following your conscience is to be aware that what you either can causes wellness or depression in the soul .
Many of us see ourselves as independent and like to work by the book we take pride in the fact that no one has to hold our hands as to us getting things done in an orderly fast manner .
Being independent in life is a strong force of a leader .
We can make things happen and build on those positives that can generate pride and strong will .
An independent person can create with in themselves self confidence and power that can transcend to others .
It is something that makes a persons thought there own and not something some other person has put out to be the one subtle thought .
An independent thought can carry with it structure of its own making and can invent a positive flow of Creative Imagination .
People that use their creative imagination can build with in themselves many positives that are like a light that can be reproduced .
In many ideas of creative imagination many great achievements have been brought to reality by people who at first may have been laughed at by lesser thinking men .
I have read so many books on people who have changed the world with a creative imagination .
They are what I like to call the visionaries of our future they have developed with in themselves the ability to see beyond the realm of conventional thought and have brought us all in to the ever possible reality that nothing is impossible if we just have faith that we can achieve all we dream and desire .
One of my favorite book collections was the Ray Bradbury series when he wrote many of his stories his creative imagination came up with worlds that in the time seemed far fetched or just imaginary .
However if you look around today in our real world many of his thoughts and idea ’s as to our world are now a reality and have been made in to real objects .
We who use our creative imaginations to day may be forecasting tomorrows change .
It is all these positive things that do give us the freedoms to think to believe and to expand ourselves to touch others in so many ways we may not even think of in the moment or free will as to creating our world is our power and it is that power that we must never give to some one else who may seek to use it wrongly .
Always strive for high performance in all you do .

FDA investigation at Columbia University serves as warning to other centres , say experts .
PET scans use compounds tagged with radioactive isotopes to reveal the inner workings of the brain .
SCIENTIFICA , VISUALS UNLIMITED / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
The work of a leading brain - imaging centre has been suspended after an investigation found that researchers had injected impure psychiatric drugs into clinical - trial volunteers .
Experts say that the episode should prompt other centres to review their practices , and it highlights the shortcomings of an oversight system in which academic labs are largely self - policing .
Researchers at Columbia University 's Kreitchman PET Center in New York used radioactive isotopes to label trace amounts of drugs and other compounds , inject them into human volunteers , and track their radioactive decay with positron emission tomography ( PET ) to visualize how the compounds bind to neural receptors .
However , the chemicals used by researchers at the Kreitchman Center repeatedly failed purity tests and were not correctly authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Permissive approach
Most experimental drugs in the United States are regulated through an Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application to the FDA .
But radioactive drugs used in research pilot studies do not require an IND , and can rely instead on approval from the research institution 's Radioactive Drug Research Committee ( RDRC ) .
Researchers are typically expected to file for IND status after 30 trial injections have allowed them to refine their procedure .
Even when IND status has been granted , however , the FDA only audits research laboratories in response to complaints , and such complaints are exceedingly rare .
Marc Laruelle , a psychiatrist at Imperial College London who worked at the Kreitchman Center from 1996 to December 2005 , says that its problems can in part be traced to the autonomy granted to PET investigators in the United States .
Laruelle says that he saw researchers at Columbia taking a permissive approach to regulations , injecting several hundred patients with compounds that only had RDRC approval , rather than filing the necessary IND application .
In 2003 he complained about the lax oversight to officials including radiologist Ronald Van Heertum , then director of the centre , but nothing was done .
Van Heertum did not respond to Nature 's requests for an interview .
After discovering a problem with the centre 's radiolabelled compounds used in his own research , Laruelle contacted the FDA with his concerns in 2004 and , when the FDA audited the centre the same year , it found a slew of problems .
For example , radiolabelled compounds that had failed quality - control tests were not properly investigated by researchers , and were still injected into patients .
As a result of FDA sanctions following the audit , production of radioligands — the radioactive molecules that bind with receptors in the body — was shut down for nine months .
Laruelle 's grants were frozen , and he had to dismiss technicians he could no longer pay .
Gordon Frankle , a psychiatrist who was a junior faculty member at the Kreitchman Center at the time , says that he was not confident that the problems with the lab 's procedures were being solved after the audit .
He moved to the University of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in June 2006 .
" It was not clear when and how the questions the FDA was raising were going to be addressed , " he says .
Repeated violations
FDA inspectors returned to the centre on 3 June 2008 .
They found that it was repeating the old violations — and making some new ones , such as injecting volunteers with drugs that were not sufficiently sterile .
In the aftermath of that visit , Columbia brought in Chester Mathis , a radiochemist who directs the PET facility at the University of Pittsburgh , as a consultant to advise on their production of fludeoxyglucose , a commonly used radiolabelled compound .
He says that he made several recommendations , but does not know if they were incorporated into the centre 's protocols .
At the time , Mathis also noticed that radioligand records relating to a drug trial in which he was involved were inconsistent , and production methods did not comply with the paperwork that the sponsoring drug company had filed with the FDA .
Mathis declines to name the drugmaker but says that he " brought it to the company 's attention " .
In January this year , the FDA went back to the centre to check on its progress .
Investigators found that technicians had given researchers ten batches of drugs that exceeded impurity limits , sometimes more than doubling them , according to FDA documents seen by Nature .
The lab was also using a faulty equation to calculate impurity levels , and an impurity signal found in the computer record of a gas - chromatography test on a radiolabelled compound had mysteriously disappeared from the filed printout .
The results of the investigation were reported in The New York Times on 16 July .
Fundamental reorganization
In a 6 July letter responding to the FDA , Columbia said that it had reviewed patient records and found no evidence of harm .
Paul Harris , a Columbia biochemist who has used the Kreitchman Center 's services for research into insulin- creating β- cells and diabetes , claims that most of the ' impurities ' reported by the FDA were simply the radioligands ' decay products , which are expected to form following injections .
And although experts contacted by Nature agreed that the violations were alarming and a breach of patient trust , they were less certain whether the impurities would have caused any negative health effects or affected the outcome of studies .
" With brain receptors , we really must be careful , " says radiologist Barry Siegel of Washington University in St Louis .
" But my gut feeling is that we have a large margin of safety . "

Columbia declined to answer Nature 's specific questions about the case .
David Hirsh , Columbia 's executive vice - president for research , told The New York Times that the university is now " fundamentally reorganizing the lab 's management and operations " .
The university has hired an external consultant to guide this process , and the Kreitchman Center 's radioligand lab is expected to restart production in January .
Some Columbia researchers have been able to obtain their radiolabelled compounds from commercial sources or other institutions , but research depending on short - lived isotopes , such as carbon - 11 , has been suspended .
Van Heertum and psychiatrist John Mann are no longer co-directors of the centre , according to Harris and Laruelle .
Abass Alavi , a radiologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , says that imaging centres across the country should take note of the case .
" This is a big lesson for all the major institutions that they are going to have to tighten their internal reviews . "
A court here on Monday convicted all the seven accused , including the former chairman of Union Carbide , Keshub Mahindra , in the Bhopal gas tragedy case and awarded them a maximum of two years ' imprisonment .
They were released on bail later in the evening .
The verdict came 26 years after the tragedy on the night of December 2 - 3 , 1984 ravaged the city , killing over 3,000 people immediately and thousands more in the following months .
Dozens of tonnes of poisonous methylisocyanate gas leaked out from the Union Carbide India Limited ( UCIL ) plant and over 35,000 people were killed in the aftermath of the leak , according to rights activists .
Warren Anderson , chairman of the U.S. - based Union Carbide group , who was named an ‘ accused ' in the tragedy , was absconding throughout the trial period .
Interestingly , the court did not mention his name on Monday .
The judgment pronounced by Chief Judicial Magistrate Mohan P. Tiwari convicted Mr. Mahindra , production assistant S.I. Quereshi , production manager S.P. Choudhary , plant superintendent K.V. Shetty , manager J.N. Mukund , vice - president Kishore Kumar and managing director Vijay Gokhale .
The eighth accused is the UCIL .
The ninth accused , R.B. Roychoudhary , died in the course of trial .
The accused were convicted under Sections 304 - A ( causing death by negligence ) , 304 ( II ) ( culpable homicide not amounting to murder ) , 336 , 337 and 338 ( gross negligence ) of the IPC .
Hundreds examined
The trial , which ran for over 23 turbulent years , saw the examination of hundreds of prosecution - side witnesses and deposition by eight defence - side witnesses before over a dozen judges .
Documents running into thousands of pages were produced during the trial .
The FIR was lodged on December 3 , 1984 and the CBI filed the charge sheet on December 1 , 1987 .
The prosecution charged the company with not heeding the feedback on inadequate safety norms and reports about other maintenance lapses .
Terming the verdict a “ delayed - thus - denied justice , ” NGO workers and activists said the $ 470 million paid by Union Carbide 20 years ago could never draw the veil over the heinous crime committed by the corporate giant .
Protest by victims
PTI reports :
Disappointed with the verdict , scores of gas victims staged a protest on the court premises and raised slogans against Mr. Anderson .
Reacting to the judgment , the U.S. - based company said neither it nor its officials were subject to the jurisdiction of the Indian court as they were not involved in the operation of the plant , which was owned and operated by the UCIL .
Correction
In the above report , there was an error in the eighth paragraph that stated the charges under which the accused were convicted — “ Section 304 ( II ) culpable homicide … ” .
The accused were charged under 304 ( II ) culpable homicide but the Supreme Court had diluted the charges to 304A in a 1996 order .
This exchange does n’t exactly make you feel that the publishing industry knows what it is doing .
But , in the case of Hardy , it has produced a fresh and funny memoir , thanks mainly to the fact that he is such a hopeless genealogical investigator that he does things such as setting off to the wrong village , without a map and without his reading glasses .
This entire post is a spoiler .
Stop reading if you have not seen Inception , because 1 ) I will reveal major plot points and 2 ) It will make no sense .
The literary critic Frank Kermode famously argued that all successful works of art have the ability to inspire multiple interpretations .
We read the classics , he said , because we believe they say more than the author meant .
In other words , it is the ambiguity of art - this ability to inspire arguments and blog posts - that makes it so interesting .
Inception , of course , is all about the ambiguity .
( Those who parse the wobbles of the spinning top in the final scene have missed the entire point of the scene . )
This does n't mean the movie is a masterpiece - I personally thought it was a smart summer blockbuster but no Dark Knight .
That said , I found this interpretation , by Devin Farci , to be mostly convincing :
Every single moment of Inception is a dream .
I think that in a couple of years this will become the accepted reading of the film , and differing interpretations will have to be skillfully argued to be even remotely considered .
The film makes this clear , and it never holds back the truth from audiences .
Some find this idea to be narratively repugnant , since they think that a movie where everything is a dream is a movie without stakes , a movie where the audience is wasting their time .
Except that this is exactly what Nolan is arguing against .
The film is a metaphor for the way that Nolan as a director works , and what he 's ultimately saying is that the catharsis found in a dream is as real as the catharsis found in a movie is as real as the catharsis found in life .
Inception is about making movies , and cinema is the shared dream that truly interests the director .
I believe that Inception is a dream to the point where even the dream - sharing stuff is a dream .
Dom Cobb is n't an extractor .
He can't go into other people 's dreams .
He is n't on the run from the Cobol Corporation .
At one point he tells himself this , through the voice of Mal , who is a projection of his own subconscious .
She asks him how real he thinks his world is , where he 's being chased across the globe by faceless corporate goons .
What I like about this interpretation of Inception is that it also makes neurological sense .
From the perspective of your brain , dreaming and movie - watching are strangely parallel experiences .
In fact , one could argue that sitting in a darkened theater and staring at a thriller is the closest one can get to REM sleep with open eyes .
Consider this study , led by Uri Hasson and Rafael Malach at Hebrew University .
The experiment was simple : they showed subjects a vintage Clint Eastwood movie ( " The Good , The Bad and the Ugly " ) and watched what happened to the cortex in a scanner .
The scientists found that when adults were watching the film their brains showed a peculiar pattern of activity , which was virtually universal .
( The title of the study is " Intersubject Synchronization of Cortical Activity During Natural Vision " . )
In particular , people showed a remarkable level of similarity when it came to the activation of areas including the visual cortex ( no surprise there ) , fusiform gyrus ( it was turned on when the camera zoomed in on a face ) , areas related to the processing of touch ( they were activated during scenes involving physical contact ) and so on .
Here 's the nut graf from the paper :
This strong intersubject correlation shows that , despite the completely free viewing of dynamical , complex scenes , individual brains " tick together " in synchronized spatiotemporal patterns when exposed to the same visual environment .
But it 's also worth pointing out which brain areas did n't " tick together " in the movie theater .
The most notable of these " non-synchronous " regions is the prefrontal cortex , an area associated with logic , deliberative analysis , and self - awareness .
Subsequent work by Malach and colleagues has found that , when we 're engaged in intense " sensorimotor processing " - and nothing is more intense for the senses than a big moving image and Dolby surround sound - we actually inhibit these prefrontal areas .
The scientists argue that such " inactivation " allows us to lose ourself in the movie :
Our results show a clear segregation between regions engaged during self - related introspective processes and cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing .
Furthermore , self - related regions were inhibited during sensorimotor processing .
Thus , the common idiom '' losing yourself in the act ' ' receives here a clear neurophysiological underpinnings .
What these experiments reveal is the essential mental process of movie - watching .
It 's a process in which your senses are hyperactive and yet your self - awareness is strangely diminished .
Now here 's where things get interesting , at least for this interpretation of Inception .
When we fall asleep , the brain undergoes a similar pattern of global activity , as the prefrontal cortex goes quiet and the visual cortex becomes even more active than usual .
But this is n’t the usual excitement of reality : this activity is semirandom and unpredictable , unbound by the constraints of sensation .
( This is usually blamed on those squirts of acetylcholine , an excitatory neurotransmitter , percolating upwards from the brain stem . )
It ’s as if our cortex is entertaining us with surreal cinema , filling our strange nighttime narratives with whatever spare details happen to be lying around .
Furthermore , the dreaming state is accompanied by an increase in activation in a wide range of " limbic " areas , those chunks of the cortex associated with the production of emotion .
This is why even the most absurd nightmares cause us to wake up in a cold sweat .
We care about what happens in our dreams , even when what happens makes no sense .
I 'd argue that Inception tries to collapse the already thin distinction between dreaming and movie - watching .
It gives us a movie in which most of the major plot points are simultaneously nonsensical -
Why are we suddenly watching a thriller set in the arctic ?
Why are all the subconscious mercenaries such bad shots ?
Why do n't Cobb 's kids ever age ? - and strangely compelling , just like a dream .
And so we bite our fingernails even though we " know " it 's just a silly movie .
Thanks to the subdued activity of the frontal lobes and the excited visual cortex , we sit in our plush chairs munching on popcorn and confuse the fake with the real .
We do n't question the non-sequiturs or complain about the imperfect special effects or the shallow characters .
Instead , we just sit back and watch and lose track of the time together .
It 's almost as if we 're being manipulated by Dom Cobb himself , as he effortlessly travels deep into our brain to plant an idea .
But this Dom Cobb - we 'll call him Christopher Nolan - does n't need a specially formulated sedative .
He just needs a big screen .

Patrick LaForge was underwhelmed by his visit to McNulty 's Tea & Coffee : " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
Patrick LaForge was underwhelmed by his visit to McNulty ’s Tea & Coffee :
I inquired about the roaster and was told with a shrug that the shop used an unnamed roaster in Long Island City , Queens .
Presumably the beans had been roasted recently .
Many coffee sellers now offer tasting notes as florid and adjective - rich as wine descriptions , but there was none of that at McNulty ’s .
The country of origin was listed and in some cases beans were described as organic or free trade .
No details were offered about the specific growers .
I did n’t realize how hooked I have become on knowing this information , even though I am not an expert who can make useful judgments based on it .
This is in some respects just a difference in marketing .
A place like McNulty ’s relies on the mystery and mystique of foreign lands .
A roaster like Intelligentsia and shops Stumptown and Cafe Grumpy appeal to a different type of consumer .
This type of customer is obsessed — perhaps too much so — with authenticity .
For these consumers , coffee is no longer an exotic product arriving by ship from third - world places with unusual names .
Knowing the details of origin improves the taste .
LaForge has hit on something important here , which is clearly making its way into the world of coffee from the world of wine , where it has been going strong for decades .
The more you know about your beverage , the better it tastes .
That ’s why so many wineries put so much effort into wine tours and that ’s why you ’re much more likely to enjoy your bottle of pinot noir if it has been preceded by a short explanation from the sommelier of who the winemaker is , where they ’re from and what exactly they ’re doing .
There ’s really no way of telling how or whether any particular part of the story affects the taste , but the simple telling of the story makes an enormous difference .
And so when you go to the Intelligentsia website , you ’ll find them featuring specific coffees like the one from Edelweiss Finagro Estate , in Tanzania .
You ’ll learn what to look for when you taste it : “ Toasted marshmallow and sandalwood greet you in the nose while saturated notes of pomelo and red wine appear immediately on the palate . ”
You do n’t have to have any clue what a “ saturated note of pomelo ” is in order to get the message .
But that ’s just the beginning of what Intelligentsia serves you with your pound of joe .
They ’ll also tell you who ’s growing the coffee ( Neel and Kavita Vohora ) , exactly where the farm is , what varietals are grown ( Bourbon , Kent , SL - 28 , Tacri ) , what altitude they ’re grown at ( 1700 – 1800 m ) and what months they ’re harvested ( July – November ) .
They ’ll then add some color :
These are the only farms I ’ve been to in the world where the biggest source of worry is not fungus or insect damage but invasion during the night by marauding herds of elephants , buffalo and even lions !
They pass through from time to time looking for water and elephants will actually locate underground pipes and dig them up with their tusks .
When they walk through the farm they trample everything in their path , leaving a big swath of razed land .
People like LaForge do n’t want altitude information on their coffee because they prefer 1700 m coffee to 1400 m coffee .
Instead , Intelligentsia is supplying something much more important and valuable : a unique narrative .
It ’s the same thing that ’s going on in the wine world :
Unlike Bordeaux , where many of the best - known chateaus are run by corporations or wealthy absentee owners , Burgundy is full of estates , including many of the leading ones , that are essentially small businesses .
Dealing with Bordeaux often requires working with middle management and marketing specialists .
It ’s much easier to visit a Burgundian estate and find the one person who has dirt on the boots , wine on the hands and a name on the bottle .
“ For people of my generation , 30 to 50 , I do n’t think we ’ve had the same magical Bordeaux moments , not in the same way we ’ve connected to Burgundy or even the Rhone , ” said Laura Maniec , who runs the wine programs for more than 15 restaurants in the B. R. Guest group .
She still buys a lot of Bordeaux for restaurants like Primehouse , a Manhattan steakhouse , and Blue Water Grill , a Manhattan seafood restaurant that hosts plenty of corporate parties where Bordeaux is nearly obligatory .
“ But there ’s a passion and a spark and a personal connection that are missing , ” she said .
What you get in Burgundy is a story and that personal connection , which is impossible to find in Bordeaux .
And you ’re increasingly finding the same thing in the new school of coffee roasters and importers .
It ’ll be interesting to see where it turns up next : tea ?
Truffles ?
Tofu ?
Facing Steep Odds , 128 House Democrats Revive the Public Option
Created : July 29 , 2010 06:15 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D - Calif. ) is leading the charge for a new public option health plan .
( Santa Rosa Press Democrat / ZUMApress.com )
Four months after President Barack Obama enacted the Affordable Care And Patient Protection Act , House Democrats have revived a top liberal priority that was eliminated from the sweeping health care law in the latter stages of a grueling year - long debate : the public option .
[ Congress1 ]
Armed with a new line of attack aimed at soothing deficit fears , Democratic Reps. Lynn Woolsey ( Calif. ) , Jan Schakowsky ( Ill. ) and Pete Stark ( Calif . ) last Thursday unveiled a bill that would offer consumers the choice of a “ robust ” government - run insurance plan alongside the private plans in the law ’s exchanges .
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill , which has gained 128 co-sponsors , will reduce the federal deficit by $ 68 billion between 2014 and 2020 .
“ As the deficit continues to grow , so does the need for a program that can save billions of dollars and improve health care while doing it , ” Woolsey , the co-chair of the progressive caucus , told The Washington Independent .
“ We are introducing the public option now so it will be available as a ready - made offset or deficit reducer in this or the next Congress . ”
Schakowsky argues that the lower overhead costs of government plans such as Medicare would allow the public option to create a better deal for consumers .
“ We could offer that kind of plan at a lower cost , and it would compete with private insurance companies , who would have to be more efficient and lower their costs , ” she told TWI .
“ It would follow the same rules as private insurers . ”
The measure is unlikely to reach the floor this year , and could face even steeper odds next Congress .
If nothing else , it appears part of a concerted effort by Democrats to galvanize disenchanted progressives and attack Republicans ahead of the tough November midterm elections .
“ You ’re the deficit hawks , ” said Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) , referring primarily to Republicans , “ and we ’re giving you a tool to be able to deal with the deficit . ”
Grijalva labeled deficit - minded lawmakers who refuse to consider the public option “ hypocrites , ” alleging that “ the excuse that it was going to be too expensive is phony . ”
For Democrats in election mode , catering to liberal wishes could help bridge the wide enthusiasm gap among voters — a key predictor of midterm victories , where the main objective is to turn out the party base .
A Reuters / Ipsos poll last month found that 72 percent of Republicans were “ certain ” they would vote in November , compared to only 49 percent of Democrats .
“ I do think this turnout issue is really going to be the crucial indicator , and the election hangs in the balance on how many of those less - committed Democrats actually turn out again , ” said Ipsos pollster Julia Clark .
“ That is a very real issue that we ’re focused on , ” Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( Md. ) , the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , admitted to Reuters .
Apart from the public option bill , the White House on Monday strongly hinted it will choose liberal favorite Elizabeth Warren to lead the consumer protection agency .
On Tuesday , Senate Democrats forced a cloture vote on the DISCLOSE Act , also a progressive priority , despite widespread expectations that it would n’t pass .
Republicans , who have depicted the public plan as a slippery slope to a national single payer system , derided the attempt to revive it and dismissed the CBO report .
“ House Democrats still do n’t get it , ” National Republican Campaign Committee spokesman Paul Lindsay told TWI .
“ As if it was n’t enough to vote for their party ’s overreaching health care takeover that was soundly rejected by Americans , they now have the audacity to propose a government option which would put health care in the hands of bureaucrats and further bankrupt our nation . ”
The CBO estimates that the public plan ’s premiums would be , on average , 5 to 7 percent lower than the private plans in the exchanges .
Providers would be paid Medicare rates plus 5 percent , a figure that would rise alongside physicians ’ costs .
“ Although skepticism about big government is growing , the CBO estimate gives [ Democrats ] an important selling point at a time of rising concern about deficits , ” said Jack Pitney , a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College .
Popular among the populace but highly controversial in Congress , the public plan has the political disadvantage of facing fierce opposition from insurance companies , which fear competition from the government .
And progressives should n’t hold their breath for a vote .
“ It ’s unlikely it ’ll be taken up this session , ” a House Democratic aide conceded , saying only that it ’s “ quite possible ” next Congress .
But is it ?
“ For the progressives , it ’s now or never , ” Pitney argues .
“ They know that Republicans will make big gains in 2010 , probably winning the House and maybe even the Senate .
The numbers favor further GOP Senate gains in 2012 . ”
Despite the historic accomplishment , liberals cannot help but look back on the vexing health care debate with wistfulness , if not bitterness .
Even though the bill covers 30 million Americans , liberals felt short - changed by its lack of a public insurance program .
While the House passed a version of a public option in its November legislation , it was removed from the Senate version due to a lack of votes , and subsequently pronounced dead .
( For a few liberal activists , this was the final straw that made the legislation no longer worth passing . )
One day later , a CBS poll found that six in ten Americans favored the opportunity to choose between private insurance plans and a government plan .
Surveys have consistently found that a large majority of the American public support the idea .
At the time , President Obama , soothing concerns of House progressives unsure whether to back a bill without it , reportedly assured them in private that it was merely a first step and he’d be willing to return to the public option later .
But major domestic initiatives are more likely to occur early in presidential terms , Pitney noted , arguing that the measure ’s chances of success during this Congress are slim – but not nil .
“ It ’s a Hail Mary pass , to be sure , ” Pitney said .
“ But Hail Mary passes sometimes work .
And Speaker Pelosi likes the Hail Mary .
And if they fail to make the effort now , they will regret it in the future .
Better a Hail Mary in 2010 than an Act of Contrition in 2011 . ”
The thing about the future is this : we 'll still have to do menial things like answer the door , or take out the trash , or get up off our couches to get our own brews after a long , hard day at the office ... unless we 're smart enough to invent robots to do such menial things , that is .
Well , Willow Garage has spent some time building a " Beer Me " application for its PR2 robot which gets at least one of these tasks under its belt .
They added a four - holed foam block placed behind the robot 's navigation laser so that it can safely carry four bottles across the terrain , and equipped their refrigerator with a tilted " self - stocking " shelf .
Check out its operation in the video below .
This one ’s too long to screengrab , but this chap ’s clearly put a * lot* of thought into this .
A lot of very twisted thought .
I love the qualifiers - like “ Obviously children would not be flogged publically except in the most unusual circumstances ” .
Well , obviously .
Like the kid at school that is an outstanding achiever in all facets of life , Frank Lampard has combined weighty brain power to his playmaking , ball - pinging , goalkeeper - slaying and net - bulging form .
It is rare that intellectuals and footballers are paired together in the same sentence because education is sometimes over - looked in favour of honing skills at tender ages , but a Chelsea club doctor has confirmed that Frank Lampard has an IQ that could be considered genius .
A- grade magnet Lampard - who turns 31 this summer - recently took an intelligence test along with several other Blues and is believed to have recorded a score that exceeds 150 .
Fellow Englishman John
Terry also scored highly and was placed third , but Lampard stole top honours .
Dr English is quoted byas saying , " John Terry was in the top three but Frank Lampard scored one of the highest sets of marks ever recorded by the company doing the tests - higher than me !
" A score of 150 would rank Lampard in the top 0.1 per cent in the country , which would be enough to secure the international a place in respected high - IQ society , Mensa .
Lampard obtained 12 GCSEs while at school in Essex and is even alleged to have secured an A* in Latin .

SAN FRANCISCO  During her 10 years as chief executive of eBay , Meg Whitman , the Republican candidate for governor of California , was known as a demanding leader who did not hesitate to express displeasure with employees who failed to live up to her standards .
But on one occasion , she was accused of going too far  and paid for it .
In June 2007 , an eBay employee claimed that Ms. Whitman became angry and forcefully pushed her in an executive conference room at eBay ’s headquarters , according to multiple former eBay employees with knowledge of the incident .
They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter was delicate and was deemed to be strictly confidential .
The employee , Young Mi Kim , was preparing Ms. Whitman for a news media interview that day .
Ms. Kim , who was not injured in the incident , hired a lawyer and threatened a lawsuit , but the dispute was resolved under the supervision of a private mediator .
Two of the former employees said the company paid a six - figure financial settlement to Ms. Kim , which one of them characterized as “ around $ 200,000 . ”
RALEIGH , N.C. -- North Carolina athletic director Dick Baddour said Thursday the NCAA is investigating a sports program at the school regarding possible rules violations .
A source at North Carolina told ESPN.com 's Joe Schad on Thursday that UNC football players were interviewed by the NCAA this week and asked questions about agents and whether anyone had received gifts or extra benefits .
Defensive tackle Marvin Austin , one of several Tar Heels who passed on the NFL draft this spring , was among the players interviewed , according to the source .
The source said the NCAA 's questions to players were intended to " make sure no Reggie Bush stuff is going on . "
Baddour declined to tell The Associated Press which sport was being probed .
" I was told that I could limit my comments to the fact that they had been here and they wanted me to say that we had indeed been cooperative , " said Baddour , adding that the inquiry " has our full attention . "
The investigation began with a phone call from the NCAA , Baddour said , though he declined to say when the call came or when investigators had visited the Chapel Hill campus .
" We work hard on our compliance program , a program of integrity , " Baddour said .
" We 're proud of it .
We are also proud that , or we think very strongly that , we get an inquiry from the NCAA that we would comply , we would do what they asked us to do and we would do it forthright and completely . "
A second source said that the NCAA asked all of UNC 's projected NFL draft picks to provide phone records so investigators could see which agents they had spoken with .
The players were also asked who paid for the travel , who paid their rent and which agents they had met with and when , according to the second source .
Austin recently tweeted about a trip to Miami .
Both sources used the word " hectic " to describe the agent activity surrounding North Carolina football since multiple players passed on the NFL draft .
A third source , with ties to North Carolina , said that Austin was asked about having been seen driving Kentwan Balmer 's vehicle .
Balmer is a former North Carolina defensive end who plays for the 49ers and worked out in Chapel Hill this offseason .
Another source said Austin stayed at Balmer 's apartment at times this offseason as well .
Davis is preparing for his fourth season in Chapel Hill and has guided the program to consecutive eight - win seasons , including the program 's first back - to - back bowl seasons since the late 1990s , when Mack Brown left for Texas .
Davis has a 20 - 18 record with the Tar Heels , including 11 - 13 in the Atlantic Coast Conference .
When Davis inherited the program from John Bunting , the Tar Heels had gone to just two bowl games in six seasons , during which they were a woeful 27 - 45 .
The Tar Heels are expected to contend for the ACC's Coastal Division title with a defense that returns nine starters from a unit that ranked among the nation 's best last year .
North Carolina opens the season against LSU in Atlanta on Sept. 4 .

When I write about China , I assume that nobody knows anything about China .
Ask an average well - educated Westerner to name a classic work of Chinese fiction or give the dates for a Chinese dynasty , and more often than not , even that simple task will stump him .
I hope that the situation will change as China ’s growing geopolitical importance leads more and more Americans to learn Chinese history , language and culture .
But it might not ; even the Chinese themselves sometimes believe a lot of misinformation about their own culture .
Consider their consistent adherence to the myth of a naturally unified China , or their occasional belief in the essential incompatibility of Western freedoms with Chinese culture .
The Chinese are just as prone to exoticize themselves as Westerners are to identify China as a mysterious Other .
This principle is doubly true of the Chinese writing system .
Raffi asked me to comment on a debate between this New York Times op - ed bemoaning the Romanization of Chinese on the internet , and this blog post that rather savagely critiques the op -ed .
Initially , I sided fairly solidly with the critique .
Even the hint of the exoticization of Chinese characters makes me grit my teeth , and the description of the language as “ strange and magical ” certainly made me put up my guard–after all , would anyone really describe Romance languages that way ?
It did n’t help that the piece contained a lot of nonsense about the way Chinese works .
Let ’s break down one particularly odious paragraph :
Part of the beauty of the Chinese language comes from a kind of divisibility not possible in a Latin - based language .
. . .
These characters each mean something on their own ; they are also combined with other characters to form hundreds of thousands of multisyllabic words .
Níhăo , for example , Chinese for “ Hello , ” is composed of ní — “ you , ” and hăo — “ good . ”
Is n’t “ You good ” — both as a statement and a question — a marvelous and strangely precise breakdown of what we ’re really saying when we greet someone ?
Latin languages do n’t have that sort of divisibility ?
Bonjour , Orientalism !
Not to mention , I would never say that Níhăo is simply Chinese for “ Hello . ”
Níhăo is a common Chinese salutation , typically translated as “ hello . ”
But Níhăo is not quite “ hello . ”
For one thing , it is composed of two distinct units of meaning –not because it ’s composed of characters , but just because that ’s the way it is .
Additionally , I do n’t think any Chinese person reads Níhăo as “ you good , ” even though those are indeed the component morphemes .
Again , this has nothing to do with the Chinese use of characters .
The word “ Godspeed ” is quite similar ; it is constructed out of two distinct morphemes , but most people understand it as equivalent to “ good luck . ”
In reality , Chinese characters are simply not the dramatically alien system of writing that people think they are .
They do n’t , as Pound mistakenly thought , directly represent ideas .
They are just another system for graphically representing spoken language .
We write “ book ” and they write 书 , but there does n’t seem to me to be any “ magical ” difference in the way the mind understands both those words upon reading them .
Of course , the system functions differently .
Most notably , because Chinese characters refer to words and not sounds , they allow communities that speak mutually unintelligible languages to easily understand each other through writing .
Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers are able to read each other ’s writing without any extra effort , and despite the fact that Cantonese and Mandarin are about as different in sound and structure as English and German .
Additionally , a high school student in the People ’s Republic can easily read a text from the Song dynasty .
The unique features of the writing system enable the Chinese to imagine themselves as a community unified by a common system of writing over vast stretches of time and space .
Ultimately , the simple fact that the Chinese writing system allows for an imagined Chinese community is in itself significant .
This feature of the language –however arbitrary , however accidental –has given the Chinese writing system a unique role in Chinese society .
The writer of the critique thinks that characters could be replaced with pinyin with no loss of meaning .
Such a theory requires a belief that languages are inert , perfectly transparent mediums for conveying meaning .
But languages and systems of writing are neither inert nor transparent ; they represent cultures , and they have their own cultural significances .
The Chinese system of writing , for example , has a tremendous cultural valence .
The Chinese words for culture ( wenhua , 文化 ) and civilization ( wenming , 文明 ) both contain the character for writing ( wen , 文 ) .
For centuries , China ’s unique writing system was the primary component in the civilization ’s claim to cultural superiority , a system that distinguished civilized tribute states from barbarian threats , an educated elite from peasant castes doomed to a life of hardship .
The Chinese writing system is more than just a writing system ; it signifies a way of life .
This quality is not a magical quality .
It is n’t an inherent , ineffable property of the language .
But meaning is often not located in words themselves .
It comes from that with which we associate those words , and from that with which we compare and contrast those words .
After all , “ they know not what they do ” and “ they do n’t know what they ’re doing ” are perfectly equivalent phrases in a syntactical sense , but have vastly different associations within our culture .
When I pray in Hebrew as opposed to English , I am giving Hebrew a meaning .
It has nothing to do with Hebrew , which is perfectly capable of expressing secular concepts .
However , by designating Hebrew as a “ sacred ” language , I am creating a role for Hebrew that has a distinct significance and valid meaning for me and for a community of believers .
Believing , after all , is the key term here .
When we create communities around language , we elevate them beyond the status of simple tools .
The idea that any two human beings can share what they ’re thinking without loss of meaning is so preposterous that languages automatically become more than objects of a science ; they ’re objects of faith as well .

It was 2017 .
Clans were governing America .
Clans organized around families and individuals who possessed stocks of food , bullion , guns and ammunition .
Photo :
A scene from the 1997 film , The Postman .
The first clans organized around local police forces .
The conservatives ’ war on crime during the late 20th century and the Bush / Obama war on terror during the first decade of the 21st century had resulted in the police becoming militarized and unaccountable .
As society broke down , the police became warlords .
The state police broke apart , and the officers were subsumed into the local forces of their communities .
The newly formed tribes expanded to encompass the relatives and friends of the police .
The dollar had collapsed as world reserve currency in 2012 when the worsening economic depression made it clear to Washington ’s creditors that the federal budget deficit was too large to be financed except by the printing of money .
With the dollar ’s demise , import prices skyrocketed .
As Americans were unable to afford foreign - made goods , the transnational corporations that were producing offshore for US markets were bankrupted , further eroding the government ’s revenue base .
The government was forced to print money in order to pay its bills , causing domestic prices to rise rapidly .
Faced with hyperinflation , Washington took recourse in terminating Social Security and Medicare and followed up by confiscating the remnants of private pensions .
This provided a one - year respite , but with no more resources to confiscate , money creation and hyperinflation resumed .
Organized food deliveries broke down when the government fought hyperinflation with fixed prices and the mandate that all purchases and sales had to be in US paper currency .
Unwilling to trade appreciating goods for depreciating paper , goods disappeared from stores .
Washington responded as Lenin had done during the “ war communism ” period of Soviet history .
The government sent troops to confiscate goods for distribution in kind to the population .
This was a temporary stop - gap until existing stocks were depleted , as future production was discouraged .
Much of the confiscated stocks became the property of the troops who seized the goods .

Goods reappeared in markets under the protection of local warlords .
Transactions were conducted in barter and in gold , silver , and copper coins .
Other clans organized around families and individuals who possessed stocks of food , bullion , guns and ammunition .
Uneasy alliances formed to balance differences in clan strengths .
Betrayals quickly made loyalty a necessary trait for survival .
Large scale food and other production broke down as local militias taxed distribution as goods moved across local territories .
Washington seized domestic oil production and refineries , but much of the government ’s gasoline was paid for safe passage across clan territories .
Most of the troops in Washington ’s overseas bases were abandoned .
As their resource stocks were drawn down , the abandoned soldiers were forced into alliances with those with whom they had been fighting .
Washington found it increasingly difficult to maintain itself .
As it lost control over the country , Washington was less able to secure supplies from abroad as tribute from those Washington threatened with nuclear attack .
Gradually other nuclear powers realized that the only target in America was Washington .
The more astute saw the writing on the wall and slipped away from the former capital city .
When Rome began her empire , Rome ’s currency consisted of gold and silver coinage .
Rome was well organized with efficient institutions and the ability to supply troops in the field so that campaigns could continue indefinitely , a monopoly in the world of Rome ’s time .
When hubris sent America in pursuit of overseas empire , the venture coincided with the offshoring of American manufacturing , industrial , and professional service jobs and the corresponding erosion of the government ’s tax base , with the advent of massive budget and trade deficits , with the erosion of the fiat paper currency ’s value , and with America ’s dependence on foreign creditors and puppet rulers .
The Roman Empire lasted for centuries .
The American one collapsed overnight .
Rome ’s corruption became the strength of her enemies , and the Western Empire was overrun .
America ’s collapse occurred when government ceased to represent the people and became the instrument of a private oligarchy .
Decisions were made in behalf of short - term profits for the few at the expense of unmanageable liabilities for the many .
Overwhelmed by liabilities , the government collapsed .
Globalism had run its course .
Life reformed on a local basis .

Subway systems are a perfect location for advertisements for two reasons : one , commuters spend a lot of time within them ; and two , potential customers are held captive , either waiting on the platform or squished on the train just looking for an excuse not to make eye contact with the person next to them .
We ’ve found some advertisers who ’ve thought of some pretty creative uses of this underground space .
View all ten examples after the jump .
This ad is so clever because it ’s hardly an ad in the traditional sense .
Above , Ikea has become a part of the subway car itself .
We know we ’d rather sit on a colorful , plush couch than a rigid , plastic bench that becomes less forgiving to our bottoms the further we travel .
To pass the time while waiting for your boyfriend or an acquaintance who just flew into the city and is most likely lost , why not pretend you ’re on holiday at some opulent ski resort ?
This ad can galvanize your imagination .
Do n’t you appreciate ads that are aware of their setting ?
Instead of simply pasting a bunch of identical advertisements all over the city , this company put in a bit more effort .
The joke is morbid , yet appreciated .
This one targets those who feel emotional comfort from physically holding a beer .
If that ’s you , it might mean you just had a hard day at the office ; it might also mean you ’re developing a life - long problem .
Any ad that makes people look is doing something right .
But does dangling potatoes from the ceiling of a subway tunnel make people want to buy mass quantities of Lay ’s potato chips ?
Simplicity is important , and this ad pulls it off .
The only negative side to converting a portion of railing into a dumbbell is that countless drunk jocks will use it as a chin - up bar .
While doing a few reps they ’ll make exaggerated grunts and moans to impress their equally obnoxious and garrulous friends .
This ribald ad by Durex works the participation angle .
It ’s borderline offensive and if you need to catch the train , impossible to avoid interacting with .
Ethics aside , it is definitely bold .
Can you actually listen to music if you plug in a set of headphones ?
More importantly , what kind of music does it play ?
This ad works because it ’s got us wondering .
Another way to pass the time : trying on fake watches .
Just like the couches inside the subway , Ikea also put some on the platform .
It ’s like waiting for the train in your living room .
The only downside here is that we ’d imagine the couches get pretty gross pretty quick .
Accidents happen , and not every city dweller makes hygiene a top priority .

NASA 's Cassini spacecraft captured this image on Dec. 7 , 2000 , just as two of Jupiter 's four major moons , Europa and Callisto , were nearly perfectly aligned with each other and the center of the planet .
If extraterrestrial life exists on Jupiter 's moon Europa , instead of deployingprobes to drill past its ice shell to look for aliens in the ocean below , onemight just go fossil - hunting on the icy surface .
" Aprospector sent there could possibly find extraterrestrial life within ourlifetimes , " suggested planetary scientist Richard Greenberg at the University of Arizona 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at Tucson .
Europa , which is roughly the size of Earth 's moon , is enveloped by a global ocean thatmay be about 100 miles deep ( 160 km ) .
This ocean is overlain by an icycrust of unknown thickness , although some estimates are that it could be only a few miles thick .
Sincewherever there is water on Earth there is a chance of life , for many yearsscientists have entertained the notion that this Jovian moon could supportextraterrestrials .
Recentfindings even suggest its ocean could be loadedwith oxygen , enough to support millions of tons worth of marine life like the typethat exists on Earth .
To see if any kind oflife actually evolved on Europa , scientists have proposed missions to drill through itsouter shell , perhaps usingheat to melt through the ice , whirring blades to clear away rocks and robotsubsto explorethe ocean .
" Withthat vision in mind , NASA has a multi-staged plan , first with a Europa orbiterscheduled for 18 years from now , and 10 or 20 years after that , a lander to seewhat the surface is like , and then maybe a generation later , hopefully we canfigure out how to drill all the way down through the ice , " Greenbergnoted .
He recently wrote a book , " Unmasking Europa , " which touchedupon how one might search for life on the Jovian moon .
However , rather thandeploying complex equipment to try and penetrate an uncertain distance into theice , the remains of marine life on Europa could be available right on the outershell for landers to find .
Scientists aren'tsuggesting that any life from Europa somehow managed to dig its way up throughthe ice .
Instead , the constant upheaval this Jovian moon undergoes could dragunwitting organisms upward , Greenberg explained .
Thescarcity of craters seen on Europa suggests the ice shell is no older than 50 million years old , hinting that it underwent complete turnover in that time .
The culprit for this extraordinary activity is the gravitational pull Europaexperiences from Jupiter .
This leads to tidal forces roughly 1,000 timesstronger than what Earth feels from our moon , flexing and heating the Jovianmoon and constantly stirring its crust .
Ice — probably newly frozen ocean water — apparently regularly gets pushed up frombelow , leading double ridges typically 330 feet high ( 100 meters ) to form andcover at least half of Europa 's surface .
Parts of the surface also couldpartially melt from below , creating rafts of ice that break loose and tumble around .
Thisprocess creates the " chaotic terrain " that comprises roughly 40 percent of the ice shell , and also sends matter both upward and downward .
" If there are organisms in Europa 's ocean , one could wellimagine that all over the surface there might be frozen chunks of thatstuff , " Greenberg said .
" People are talking about various kinds ofdrills and melting down through the ice , and I think we can jump past that andsample the ocean from the surface . "
Oneof the best places to look for any fossilson Europa would be newly formed double ridges , Greenberg said .
" Theridges that crisscross others are going to be the most recent ones , " heexplained .
" One could then imagine landers scooping up the ice andanalyzing it . "
Chaoticterrain would also be another good area to explore , as would an active crack inEuropa 's crust .
" Ifwe can land right next to an active crack , there 's a good chance we could samplesome of the most recent ice , " Greenberg said .
" If we could put apenetrator into it , we could even sample water as it comes up . "
If any microbes didmanage to make their way to Europa 's surface , the constant stream of radiationfrom Jupiter would likely break their proteins down over time , assuming such life would have proteins at all , said planetary geologist Brad Dalton at NASA 's Jet PropulsionLaboratory .
Still , experiments of Dalton 's have suggested orbiters could investigate the infraredsignature of Europa 's icy crust to look for tattered remnantsof life .
Landerscould conduct even more detailed analyses — for instance , using " lab - on - a- chip " devices on melted ice samples to look forbiomolecules , he added .
Also " there 's always the possibilitythat we could find structures — something analogous to skeletal remains , " Greenberg noted .
Dalton added that if landers dug " even a meter or sodown might also be able to find viable organisms , if there are any there . "
Ofcourse , if there is life in Europa 's ocean , it remains uncertain whether itwould indeed get lofted up via geological processes to its surface .
Conversely , if no life is seen on Europa 's surface , that does not mean there is no life inEuropa 's ocean .
" Mypoint is only why wait to look for life at the hardest place on Europa to getto ? "
Greenberg said .
" Why not go to the easy place first ? "
Cyberspies have launched the first publicly known global attack aimed at infiltrating hard - to - penetrate computer control systems used to manage factory robots , refineries , and the electric power grid .
The ultrasophisticated attack was discovered last week , but information about it – including the full range of capabilities of the espionage software – continues to emerge .
The spyware had spread for at least a month undetected and has already penetrated thousands of industrial computer systems in Iran , Indonesia , India , Ecuador , the United States , Pakistan , and Taiwan , according to a Microsoft analysis .
The attack is part of a sophisticated new wave of industrial cyberespionage that can infiltrate corporate systems undetected and capture the " crown jewels " of corporations – proprietary manufacturing techniques that are worth billions , experts say .
It 's significant , too , because of its potential to infiltrate and commandeer important infrastructure , such as the power grid .
No one knows who 's behind it .
Cybersecurity analysts are n't even sure yet what the spyware 's creators intend it to do to those industrial systems .
The intent could be to sell corporate proprietary secrets – or to seek an advantage over the US in some future assymetric conflict , such as a cyberwar .
" We have not seen anything like this before aimed directly at the industrial control system environment , " says Walt Boyes , a control systems security expert and editor in chief of Control magazine .
" It 's a clear - cut case of industrial espionage .
We do n't know its ultimate aim yet . "
But , he says , the attack is aimed specifically at the company that sells the lion ’s share of industrial automation software to the electric power sector in North America and Western Europe .
" That 's really scary , " Mr. Boyes adds .
USB memory stick the tool of choice
The spyware , dubbed the Stuxnet worm by Microsoft , uses the lowly , ubiquitous USB memory stick as its delivery vehicle .
But others say it also has the attributes both of a “ trojan ” program that gains command of a system and of a virus that replicates .
When an infected stick is plugged into a computer , the spyware instantly and almost invisibly loads itself onto that computer 's system .
In a never - before - seen twist , it does this without the user taking any action or clicking on any button .
The spyware then creates a secret " back door " for the attacker to access and control the computer remotely , say computer security experts .
But what makes security experts ' hair stand on end is what the cyber - spy program does next .
It searches the victim computer for the database of a supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) software program created by Siemens , the electronic control systems giant .
That specialized software is used to run chemical plants and factories – as well as electric power plants and transmission systems worldwide .
The only thing known for sure about the attackers ' goals is that the software attempts to harvest data from a history database within the Siemens software – and send it to servers on the Internet .
How successful it has been in doing this is n’t known .
In a statement on its website , Siemens said Friday that " we know of two cases worldwide where a WinCC computer has been infected .
A production plant has so far not been affected . "
The company is trying to determine if the spyware , besides attempting to send process and production data , " is able to send or delete system data , or change system files . "
Attackers ' intentions unclear
But the breadth of the threat could be far larger .
The spyware has at least 5,000 functions , and only that one basic function – the database download – is well - understood so far , Frank Boldewin , an independent computer security researcher analyzing Stuxnet , writes in an e-mail interview .
" It 's still unclear what exactly are the intentions of the attackers , " he writes .
" Someone might slightly change a process course , shut down the SCADA control servers , deleting the data base and so forth with a sabotage factor in mind , but I have n't found any code - snippets yet which instruct a hacked SCADA system to do so . "
Electric utilities , like many companies , are known to be under attack around the clock by attackers probing their Internet firewalls .
News reports last year suggested that some power - grid defenses may already have been penetrated by elite nation - state cyberattackers who may have planted " malware " bombs to deactivate or destroy a power system , or may have installed trap - door access for a future covert attack .
But nearly all of the publicly known cyberdamage to power stations ' computer controls has come from viruses rampaging on the Internet that workers accidentally introduced onto their companies ' systems .
That 's not the case now .
" When power plants got hit before , it was always collateral damage from other Internet - based attacks , " says Eric Byres , a controls systems expert with Byres Security in Vancouver .
" Now it 's clear that software - running generators and transmission systems and chemical plants are no longer just collateral damage – they are in the bull 's - eye . "
Symantec , the big antivirus company , was recently reporting 9,000 attempted infiltrations per day , worldwide , using the Stuxnet zero - day flaw in Microsoft operating systems .
Microsoft reports about 1,000 new computers infiltrated per day .
Any new USB drive or any device with a computer memory chip –including cameras and music players – that are plugged into an infected system become a transmitter of the worm .
Home computers vulnerable , too
Any computer hit by the spyware – even home computers that do n't have Siemens software – will have a " back door " installed on it that could potentially be exploited later , Mr. Byres says .
Antivirus companies are working on a short - term fix .
Microsoft , too , is working on a patch for its operating system – and has recommended some interim steps to help safeguard computers .
But virtually every computer with a Microsoft operating system today remains vulnerable to attack , say Byres and other experts .
While a wide array of attack software is widely available on the Internet , the unusually sophisticated techniques used in the Stuxnet attack indicate that a large , well - funded , very sophisticated organization is most likely behind the attack , several experts say .
" The significance of this attack is that this is a really serious piece of malware that upped the ante for all of us about what the bad guys are doing , " says Ed Skoudis , cofounder of InGuardians , a software security firm .
" The techniques being used here go way beyond what we 've seen even from sophisticated organized crime groups . "
Three things the spyware does
First , the spyware uses a " zero- day " attack – a vulnerability that neither Microsoft nor antivirus companies knew existed .
As a result , antivirus and other defenses were unprepared for it .
Second , the spyware managed to fool personal computer security systems by using a real , not a forged , digital certificate ( or complex encrypted code ) from a computer company named RealTek .
That circumvented another Microsoft barrier , giving the spyware automatic permission to install .
It 's possible that the keys used to create the digital certificates were stolen – a serious problem , but not as serious as if the certificates could be created .
A variant of Stuxnet ( one that uses another company 's apparently stolen digital certificate ) has already been found .
Third , the spyware payload – or its core program – was tailored to hunt for Siemens ’ SIMATIC WinCC and PCS 7 programs and to download the history of the systems ' operations .
That history could include pressures , temperatures , voltages , and all manner of SCADA settings for factories or power plant operators , Byres says .
Such a history could , for instance , allow the attacker to replicate the proprietary settings for production of a costly chemical .
For a utility , it ’s less obvious what use that would be , although it may provide a larger understanding of the settings of a power plant ’s turbines , for instance .
The spyware was detected by VirusBlokAda , an antivirus company based in Belarus , in mid-June .
But its SCADA - specific payload was not recognized until last week .
The spyware may even have been active many months earlier , judging from a January 2010 digital " time stamp " on it , says Chester Wisniewski , senior security analyst in the Vancouver office of Sophos , a global computer security firm .
An ' advanced persistent threat ' ?
The attack suggests that someone with deep pockets is behind it , to be sure .
But it also is an example of what some cybersecurity experts call " advanced persistent threat , " that is , attackers whose goals are not a big financial payoff but rather an ability to lurk for long periods on corporate or government systems in order to steal secrets – or lay the groundwork for cyberwar .
Security experts in the utility industry say only a nation state or very deep - pocketed organization staffed by professional hackers could have pulled off this triple - play malware .
" One of the best ways to attack the power grid is through a USB stick , to give it to a human being to just walk it past all the cyberdefenses and firewalls that have been set up – and then just put it straight into a vulnerable computer .
It 's really perfect , " says one utility - industry cybersecurity expert who asked not to be named because of his sensitive position .
Microsoft was working on a software patch to address the attack at time of publication .
Siemens on Thursday began offering a software tool to deal with the threat .
Yet the problem of patching SCADA systems will be slow , difficult , and costly , experts say .
In the past , utilities and others have resisted efforts to bolster cyberdefenses largely because of the costs involved in upgrades .
Siemens , GE , and ABB , as well as other control system vendors and users from several countries , will meet in London in October to discuss strategies for blocking the advanced threat now targeting their systems globally , the Sans Institute , a computer security group , reported .
Yet the fundamental threat remains , experts say .
" The good news as far as the power grid goes is that there 's awareness , because the threat has been discovered and advisories have gone out , " says the utility cyberexpert who asked for anonymity .
" The bad news is that not everyone is as mature in dealing with these problems as they need to be .
Right now there 's a big window of exposure . "

Masterplan Veranstaltungsgelände
In und um Duisburg spielen die Behörden schwarzer Peter
Die Polizei und die Rettungsdienste haben großartige Arbeit geleistet .
" Aber eine enge , vertrauensvolle Zusammenarbeit zwischen einer Stadt als Genehmigungsbehörde und ihrer Polizei stelle ich mir anders vor . " -
So der neue NRW - Innenminister Ralf Jäger auf seiner Pressekonferenz im SPD - Fraktionssaal des Landtages gestern Nachmittag .
Stadtverwaltung und Veranstalter verantwortlich ?
Der Veranstalter der Loveparade Rainer Schaller , die Stadtverwaltung Duisburg , Polizei und Feuerwehr spielen im Moment ein unwürdiges Spiel .
Ihr Handeln scheint nur davon bestimmt zu sein , eins zu vermeiden - die Verantwortung übernehmen ( müssen ) für die inzwischen 21 Toten und um die 500 Verletzte vom Wochenende in Duisburg .
Während Duisburgs Oberbürgermeister Adolf Sauerland ( CDU ) , der die Loveparade unbedingt in seiner Stadt haben wollte , der Polizei " Fehlverhalten " vorwirft , und auch der Veranstalter , Rainer Schaller , die Polizei beschuldigen , sie habe mit ihren Beamten den Stau im Tunnel mitverursacht , ging der neue Landesinnenminister zu Gunsten der Polizeibeamten heute in die mediale Offensive .
Rampe 2 . Alle Bilder : Ministerium für Inneres und Kommunales des Landes NRW
Innenminister Jäger und der Inspekteur der Polizei , Dieter Wehe , machten deutlich , dass aus ihrer Sicht der Veranstalter der Loveparade , die Firma Lopavent GmbH , Berlin und die Stadt Duisburg einen Großteil der Verantwortung trügen - auch wenn sie eine klare Schuldzuweisung aufgrund der laufenden staatsanwaltschaftlichen Ermittlungen vermieden .
Gleich zu Beginn seines Statements erklärte Jäger , er fände es " unerträglich , dass Verantwortung auf Seiten des Veranstalters der Loveparade und der Stadt als Genehmigungsbehörde abgeschoben werde - und das bevor überhaupt alle Fakten bekannt sind . " .
Der Minister und sein Polizist zogen für ihren Zuständigkeitsbereich eine rundum positive Bilanz .
Die Polizei sei schließlich nur dafür zuständig " sicherzustellen , dass die Besucher möglichst reibungslos und sicher über die öffentlichen Straßen und Wege auf das Veranstaltungsgelände gelangen können .
Das heißt , die Polizei übernimmt die Kontrolle für den nicht abgesperrten Bereich außerhalb des Veranstaltungsgeländes . "
Das habe auch alles prima funktioniert .
Auch die spätere Zusammenarbeit mit den Rettungsdiensten sei reibungslos und effektiv verlaufen .
Auch habe die Polizei im Vorfeld der Veranstaltung Sicherheitsbedenken für den nicht zu ihrem Verantwortungsbereich gehörenden Tunnel und Rampenbereich vorgetragen .
Diese Bedenken , so der Minister , " haben die zuständige Genehmigungsbehörde , also die Stadt Duisburg und der Veranstalter , entgegen genommen " .
Sie hätten " entsprechende Änderungen der von ihnen erarbeiteten und zu verantwortenden Sicherheitskonzeption angekündigt und zugesagt " .
Die Stadt Duisburg " ist die zuständige Genehmigungsbehörde für die Love - Parade .
Der Polizei wurde die Genehmigung erst am Samstagmorgen , also am Veranstaltungstag , auf eigenes Verlangen übergeben .
Auch auf Nachfrage vom Freitag erhielt die Polizei die Genehmigung nicht . "
Erst am Samstag um 9.00
Uhr habe sich die Polizei die Genehmigung " durch ihren Verbindungsbeamten beim Stab der Feuerwehr übermitteln lassen " .
Übersicht Sperrlinien Polizei
Dem Minister zufolge erhielt die Polizei in Duisburg also erst zu einem Zeitpunkt , als die ersten Teilnehmer schon in Duisburg anreisten , Kenntnis vom Wortlaut der die Genehmigung und damit auch die Rahmenbedingungen für ihr polizeiliches Handeln .
Schwer zu glauben .
Da stellt sich die Frage , warum die Polizei nicht die Veranstaltung spätestens Freitagabend aus Sicherheitsgründen untersagt hat ?
Liegt es vielleicht daran , dass es zuvor einen Personalwechsel in der Position des Polizeipräsidenten gab .
Rolf Cebin , der Amtsvorgänger des amtierenden Chefs der Duisburger Polizei ( die Funktion des Polizeipräsidenten ist im offiziellen Organigramm weiterhin mit " NN " gezeichnet - also vakant ) ging im Mai 2010 in Pension , nachdem er erhebliche Sicherheitsbedenken gegen die Durchführung der Love - Parade auf dem vorgesehenen Gelände des ehemaligen Güterbahnhofs äußerte .
Polizeipräsident warnte frühzeitig
Cebin hatte frühzeitig , nämlich bereits am 6 .
Februar 2009 , Sicherheitsbedenken hinsichtlich einer Großveranstaltung in Duisburg mit mehr als 500.000 Teilnehmern geäußert .
Drei
Tage später richtete der damalige Duisburger CDU - Bundestagsabgeordnete und heutige CDU - Kreisvorsitzende einen Beschwerdebrief an den damaligen NRW - Innenminister Ingo Wolf ( FDP , in dem er - auch unter Hinweis auf frühere ( unbestreitbare ) Polizeiskandale in Duisburg , wie etwa dem Flaggenstreit um eine israelische Fahne während einer Palästina - Demo in Duisburg " , die Abberufung Cebins forderte .
Zitat aus dem Schreiben Mahlbergs :
Am vergangenen Wochenende ließ die Duisburger Polizei erklären , eklatante Sicherheitsmängel stünden einer Durchführung der Love - Parade in Duisburg im Jahr 2010 entgegen ...
Mahlberg bat den Minister , die Stadt von einer schweren Bürde zu befreien und den personellen Neuanfang im Polizeipräsidium Duisburg zu wagen .
Der frühere Polizeipräsident von Bochum , Thomas Wenner , dessen Sicherheitsbedenken gegen die Durchführung der Love - Parade in Bochum zu deren Absage für 2009 führten , hat mittlerweile Strafanzeige gegen den Duisburger OB Sauerland , seine leitenden Beamten und die Loveparade - Veranstalter wegen fahrlässiger Tötung erstattet .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft hat ihre Ermittlungen aufgenommen und alle Unterlagen zur Loveparade im Duisburger Rathaus beschlagnahmt .
Die strafrechtlichen Ermittlungen werden von der Kripo in Köln geführt , mit der sachlichen Lageauswertung der Ereignisse in Duisburg wurde die Polizei in Essen beauftragt .
Seltsame Zahlenspiele
Normalerweise sind Veranstalter stolz auf große Besucherzahlen .
Bei der Duisburger Horrorparade ist das jetzt ganz anders .
Jetzt rechnet Veranstalter Rainer Schaller die Zahlen niedrig .
War zuvor von einer Millionen Teilnehmern und mehr die Rede , sprechen die Veranstalter nun von höchstens 200.000 , die verteilt über Stunden auf dem Gelände gewesen seien .
Auch die Polizei spricht von höchstens 350.000 bis 400.000 Menschen , die sich in ganz Duisburg bewegt hätten .
Der NRW - Innenminister unterstützt diese Darstellung .
Er habe die Szenerie aus dem 18 .
Stock eines Gebäudes beobachtet und Flächen gesehen , auf denen sich überhaupt keiner aufhielt .
Das Gelände sei nie ganz voller Menschen gewesen .
Die Genehmigung ging von höchstens 250.000 Teilnehmern aus .
Seltsam , Mitglieder der Polizeigewerkschaft werden in der WAZ mit der Aussage zitiert , Rainer Schaller " 500.000 Teilnehmer " angemeldet und eine Genehmigung für 250.000 Teilnehmer erhalten .
Auf der Pressekonferenz des Innenministers wurden die mit Schaller in Verbindung gebrachten Angaben , wonach eine Million Teilnehmer erwartet würden , als " PR - Zahlen der Veranstalter " bezeichnet .
Wie viele waren es ?
War die eine Million nur Fiktion , gedacht als wohlklingende Worte für die Ohren der Sponsoren ?
In Duisburg ist noch viel aufzuklären .

Viewing images that appear 3D is as popular as ever .
Therefore , let ’s now unveil so popular today anaglyph craze and see the stunning collection of various 3D pictures where the red and blue channels have been split and then reassembled so that the images appear three - dimensional when viewed through 3D red -cyan glasses .
If saying minutely , the picture contains two differently filtered color images .
When viewed through anaglyph glasses , these independent pictures are transmitted one for each eye , and then the brain fuses them together letting the viewer see a stereo three dimensional scene or composition .
That ’s mainly how the eyes are fooled into believing that the projected anaglyph images have depth .
Right now , get ready to experience this truly exciting effect , and do n’t forget to put your 3D glasses on !
In addition , you may as well check out the compilation of anaglyph websites with images coming into groovy 3D focus .
The showcase is made by our good friends from TemplateMonster .

[ The Jimquisition is a weekly unscripted rant from Jim Sterling , aka some fat twat with a microphone .
He swears and complains and occasionally makes some sort of interesting point . ]
After the rather surprising ( and appreciated ! ) response to last week 's episode , it would appear that The Jimquisition has been deemed worthy of a serial installment .
Here 's episode two .
Aspect ratio is slightly improved , although there was an issue , because once again , f*ck every video editing program in the world .
Also , the shot ended up being a tad too close , but hey ho , we 're learning as we go !
Anyway , this week 's episode is about both The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword and the upcoming Ocarina of Time 3DS remake .
More specifically , it 's about the rather predictable negative reactions that both of them earned , and that perpetual issue of hardcore fans who can never be pleased with anything , ever .
Also , HUGE thanks to KimStrandli for all the video advice .
BRITAIN'S oldest newly - weds tied the knot in the residential home where they live , aged 97 and 87 respectively .
Henry Kerr , just three years short of his 100th birthday , and his bride Valerie Berkowitz , 87 , have a combined age of 184 , The Daily Express said .
They fell in love when Valerie joined Henry 's poetry reading circle and the couple discovered they had mutual friends from their time ­living in South Africa .
Valerie had been a teacher in Johannesburg , while Henry had managed cinemas .
They tied the knot today in a Jewish ceremony at the Sunridge Court residential home in Golders Green , north London .
Henry proposed to Valerie over a cup of tea .
However , he had to wait some time to receive an answer .
Henry said : " She was bewildered and overcome and said she would have to think about it .
It became quite a joke .
I kept asking her and eventually she said yes . "
Valerie said : " These were both long and happy marriages to look back on and it's hard to replace that happy memory . "
Sunridge Court manager Pamela Darroux said : " They are very much in love and it has done them a great deal of good . "
Image caption Construction of the Iter reactor will take place at Cadarache in Southern France
Additional funds needed to construct the Iter fusion reactor will have to come from within the EU 's budget , member states have said .
The French - based machine will prove the concept of harvesting energy from the fusion of hydrogen nuclei - the same process at the heart of the Sun .
Iter has seen its baseline price tag rise dramatically since a consortium of nations green lit the project in 2006 .
The extra 1.4bn euros will cover a shortfall in building costs in 2012 - 13 .
After months of protracted negotiations , member states finally made their position clear at an Agriculture and Fish Council meeting on 12 July .
They want the funds to come from a variety of sources within the existing Brussels budget , including from its research budget ( the Framework Programme 7 ) .
The EU 's executive body , the Commission , had asked member states to inject fresh funds into the project .
The Commission and the European Parliament will have further input before the matter is finally resolved .
Iter itself is holding a special Council meeting on 27 - 28 July .
This will define the latest scope and schedule for the project .
Iter is a collaboration between the EU , the US , Russia , Japan , China , India and South Korea .
It is the culmination of decades of research .
Its fusion reactions will take place inside a 100 - million - degree gas ( plasma ) suspended in an intense doughnut - shaped magnetic field .
The reactor is designed to produce 500MW of fusion power during pulses of at least 400 seconds .
Critically , Iter is expected to demonstrate the principle that it possible to get far more energy out of the process than is used to initiate it .
The original plan was to build the experiment within 10 years for a budget of 5 bn euros .
But a range of issues , from technical to personnel matters , have conspired to inflate Iter 's final price .
Many now expect it to be in the region of 15bn euros ; and the total cost of construction for the EU - a major partner in Iter - is put at no less than 7.2bn euros .
EU ministers had tried - and failed - to resolve arguments over where the extra immediate funds should come from at their 26 May Competitiveness Council .
A task force was then established to find a solution to the issue .
Draft conclusions were agreed at a 30 June meeting of a senior EU body known as Coreper , and these were subsequently adopted as an " A point " at the Agriculture and Fish Council meeting this week .
The member states propose that the additional 1.4bn euros required for 2012 - 2013 should now be taken from a mix of sources within the current EU budget , including from the Framework Programme .
Many scientists have expressed the fear that raiding the 53 bn - euro FP7 pot could damage other projects .
At the European Science Open Forum last week in Turin , Italy , Prof Helga Nowotny , the new president of the European Research Council , again voiced her concern at the impact rising Iter costs could have on other types of European scientific activity .
A spokesperson for the UK government told BBC News : " We are pleased to note the conclusions call for important improvements to the financial management and oversight of the project .
" We agree with the view expressed in the conclusions that the additional financial commitments for Iter for 2012 and 2013 should come from a mix of sources within the current EU budget 2007 - 2013 . "
Los Angeles Lakers Head Coach Phil Jackson has decided to return to coach the team for the 2010 - 11 season , it was announced today .
“ Count me in , ” said Jackson .
“ After a couple weeks of deliberation , it is time to get back to the challenge of putting together a team that can defend its title in the 2010 - 11 season .
It ’ll be the last stand for me , and I hope a grand one . ”
Jackson , who most recently guided the Lakers to the 2010 NBA Championship , their second in a row , has won five titles as head coach of the Lakers .
Overall , Jackson has guided his teams to eleven NBA Championships , the most of any coach in NBA history .
A member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame , Jackson established a new Lakers franchise record for regular season victories earlier this year , earning his 534th career victory with a win over the Charlotte Hornets on February 3 .
The fastest coach to 1,000 career victories , his total of 1,098 regular season wins ranks him fifth all - time while his .705 winning percentage is the best in league history .
Additionally , Jackson ranks first all - time in NBA postseason history with a .697 winning percentage ( 225-98 ) .
His 225 playoff victories are also the highest postseason win total for any head coach in league history .
“ We ’re extremely pleased that Phil has decided to return , ” said Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak .
“ With this most recent championship , we ’ve now won five titles in the ten years he ’s been our head coach and have been to the Finals in seven of those ten years , which is amazing .
He ’s not only the best coach for this team , but quite simply the best coach in the history of the NBA . ”

Name : Headliner.fm
Quick Pitch : Headliner is a real - time social media recommendation exchange for artists and bands .
Genius Idea :
It 's tough for an upstart band to make it big , and since all you young musicians are in roughly the same boat , so why not work together ?
Headliner.fm makes that happen by helping bands promote one another on their Twitter , Facebook and MySpace profiles .
When you sign your band up at Headliner .fm , you 're given a number of " Band Bucks " proportionate to your social media presence — the more followers you have on Twitter , for example , the more Band Bucks you 'll get .
You can use those Band Bucks to request that other bands give you a quick shout - out on their social media accounts .
Each time you give another band a shout - out ( you can do three per day ) you 're given more Band Bucks .
This video explains the basic concept .
Bands have to accept promotion requests from other bands , so you can control what kinds of shout - outs are hitting your feeds .
Once you accept , Headliner .fm automatically handles the scheduling and the posting — just in case you might forget to do it yourself .
You can also get band bucks for inviting other artists to join the site .
Headliner.fm offers analytics tools so you can track how much of an impact your promotions are making .
Be smart about the bands you do promotions with by targeting audiences you think would also be interested in your music .
For example , it 's probably a safe assumption that Diddy 's feeds are n't the optimal place to promote your old - fashioned Bluegrass band .
Speaking of Diddy , there are a few big artists on the site , including Travie McCoy and The Hives .
Most of the thousands of members are smaller groups , though .

The creators of " Avatar : The Last Airbender " say that the new spinoff series " The Legend of Korra " will be more mature than the original show , but will still have the same sense of fun and adventure .
Nickelodeon , the network behind the original show , today announcedthat it will air the " Avatar " spinoff series " The Legend of Korra " ( a working title ) starting next year .
The first series took place in a world in which supernatural " benders " have the ability to manipulate the elements of air , earth , fire and water , and focused on Aang , a young airbender who turned out to be the Avatar , a person capable of controlling all the elements .
The new series takes place 70 years later in the same world and follows the new Avatar , a teen girl named Korra who has learned to bend earth , water and fire and seeks to master air under the tutelage of Aang 's son , Tenzin .
Earlier this summer , director M. Night Shyamalan released a live - action theatrical version of the first series called " The Last Airbender " that was poorly received by critics , although it posted respectable numbers in early box office returns .
Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko , the creators of " Avatar : The Last Airbender " and " The Legend of Korra " took the time to talk to Speakeasy today about the new series .
Gay Liberation Front : Manifesto
London , 1971 , revised 1978
Introduction
Throughout recorded history , oppressed groups have organised to claim their rights and obtain their needs .
Homosexuals , who have been oppressed by physical violence and by ideological and psychological attacks at every level of social interaction , are at last becoming angry .
To you , our gay sisters and brothers , we say that you are oppressed ; we intend to show you examples of the hatred and fear with which straight society relegates us to the position and treatment of sub- humans , and to explain their basis .
We will show you how we can use our righteous anger to uproot the present oppressive system with its decaying and constricting ideology , and how we , together with other oppressed groups , can start to form a new order , and a liberated lifestyle , from the alternatives which we offer .
HOW We Are Oppressed
FAMILY
The oppression of gay people starts in the most basic unit of society , the family .
consisting of the man in charge , a slave as his wife , and their children on whom they force themselves as the ideal models .
The very form of the family works against homosexuality .
At some point nearly all gay people have found it difficult to cope with having the restricting images of man or woman pushed on them by their parents .
It may have been from very early on , when the pressures to play with the ' right ' toys , and thus prove boyishness or girlishness , drove against the child 's inclinations .
But for all of us this is certainly a problem by the time of adolescence , when we are expected to prove ourselves socially to our parents as members of the right sex ( to bring home a boy / girl friend ) and to start being a ' real ' ( oppressive ) young man or a ' real ' ( oppressed ) young woman .
The tensions can be very destructive .
The fact that gay people notice they are different from other men and women in the family situation , causes them to feel ashamed , guilty and failures .
How many of us have really dared by honest with our parents ?
How many of us have been thrown out of home ?
How many of us have been pressured into marriage , sent to psychiatrists , frightened into sexual inertia , ostracised , banned , emotionally destroyed - all by our parents ?
SCHOOL
Family experiences may differ widely , but in their education all children confront a common situation .
Schools reflect the values of society in their formal academic curriculum , and reinforce them in their morality and discipline .
Boys learn competitiv ego - building sports , and have more opportunity in science , whereas girls are given emphasis on domestic subjects , needlework etc .
Again , we gays were all forced into a rigid sex role which we did not want or need .
It is quite common to discipline children for behaving in any way like the opposite sex ; degrading titles like ' sissy ' and ' tomboy ' are widely used .
In the content of education , homosexuality is generally ignored , even where we know it exists , as in history and literature .
Even sex education , which has been considered a new liberal dynamic of secondary schooling , proves to be little more than an extension of Christian morality .
Homosexuality is again either ignored , or attacked with moralistic warnings and condemnations .
The adolescent recognising his or her homosexuality might feel totally alone in the world , or a pathologically sick wreck .
CHURCH
Formal religious education is still part of everyone 's schooling , and our whole legal structure is supposedly based on Christianity whose archaic and irrational teachings support the family and marriage as the only permitted condition for sex .
Gay people have been attacked as abominable and sinful since the beginning of both Judaism and Christianity , and even if today the Church is playing down these strictures on homosexuality , its new ideology is that gay people are pathetic objects for sympathy .
THE MEDIA
The press , radio , television and advertising are used as reinforcements against us , and make possible the control of people 's thoughts on an unprecedented scale .
Entering everyone 's home , affecting everyone 's life , the media controllers , all representatives of the rich , male - controlled world , can exaggerate or suppress whatever information suits them
Under different circumstances , the media might not be the weapon of a small minority .
The present controllers are therefore dedicated defenders of things as they stand .
Accordingly , the images of people which they transmit in their pictures and words do not subvert , but support society 's image of ' normal ' man and woman .
It follows that we are characterised as scandalous , obscene perverts ; as rampant , wild sex- monsters ; as pathetic , doomed and compulsive degenerates ; while the truth is blanketed under a conspiracy of silence .
WORDS
Anti-homosexual morality and ideology , at every level of society , manifest themselves in a special vocabulary for denigrating gay people .
There is abuse like ' pansy ' , ' fairy ' , ' lesbo ' to hurl at men and women who can't or wo n't fit stereotyped preconceptions .
There are words like ' sick ' , ' bent ' and ' neurotic ' for destroying the credence of gay people .
But there are no positive words .
The ideological intent of our language makes it very clear that the generation of words and meanings is , at the moment , in the hands of the enemy .
And that so many gay people pretend to be straight , and call each other ' butch dykes ' or ' screaming queens only makes that fact the more real .
The verbal attack on men and women who do not behave as they are supposed to , reflects the ideology of masculine superiority .
A man who behaves like a woman is seen as losing something , and a woman who behaves like a man is put down for threatening men's environment of their privileges .
EMPLOYMENT
If our upbringing so often produces guilt and shame , the experience of an adult gay person is oppressive in every aspect .
In their work situation , gay people face the ordeal of spending up to fifty years of their lives confronted with the anti-homosexual hostility of their fellow employees .
A direct consequence of the fact that virtually all employers are highly privileged heterosexual men , is that there are some fields of work which are closed to gay people , and others which they feel some compulsion to enter .
A result of this control for gay women is that they are perceived as a threat in the man 's world .
They have none of the sexual ties of dependence to men which make most women accept men as their ' superiors ' .
They are less likely to have the bind of children , and so there is nothing to stop them showing that they are as capable as any man , and thus deflating the man 's ego , and exposing the myth that only men can cope with important jobs .
We are excluded from many jobs in high places where being married is the respectable guarantee , but being homosexual apparently makes us unstable , unreliable security risks .
Neither , for example , are we allowed the job of teaching children , because we are all reckoned to be compulsive , child molesting maniacs .
There are thousands of examples of people having lost their jobs due to it becoming known that they were gay , though employers usually contrive all manner of spurious reasons .
There occurs , on the other hand , in certain jobs , such a concentration of gay people as to make an occupational ghetto .
This happens , for women , in the forces , ambulance driving , and other uniformed occupations : and for men , in the fashion , entertainment and theatrical professions , all cases where the roles of ' man ' and ' woman ' can perhaps be undermined or overlooked [ note : last phrase unclear in copy used for HTML ]
THE LAW
If you live in Scotland or Ireland ; if you are under 21 , or over 21 but having sex with someone under 21 ; if you are in the armed forces or the merchant navy ; if you have sex with more than one other person at the same time - and you are a gay male , you are breaking the law
The 1967 Sexual Offences
Act gave a limited license to adult gay men .
Common law however can restrict us from talking about and publicising both male and female homosexuality by classing it as ' immoral ' .
Beyond this there are a whole series of specific minor offences .
Although ' the act ' is not illegal , asking someone to go to bed with you can be classed as ' importuning for an immoral act ' , and kissing in public is classed as ' public indecency '
Even if you do not get into trouble , you will find yourself hampered by the application of the law in your efforts to set up home together , to raise children , and to express your love as freely as straight people may do .
The practice of the police in ' enforcing ' the law makes sure that cottagers and cruisers will be zealously hunted , while queer - bashers may be apprehended , half - heartedly after the event .
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE
On 25 September 1969 a man walked onto Wimbledon Common .
We know the common to be a popular cruising ground , and believe the man to have been one of our gay brothers .
Whether or not this is the case , the man was set upon by a group of youths from a nearby housing estate , and literally battered to death with clubs and boots .
Afterwards , a boy from the same estate said : ' When you 're hitting a queer , you do n't think you 're doing wrong .
You think you 're doing good .
If you want money off a queer , you can get it off him - there 's nothing to be scared of from the law , cause you know they wo n't go to the law ' .
( Sunday Times , 7/21/1971 ) .
Since that time , another man has been similarly murdered on Hampstead Heath .
But murder is only the most extreme form of violence to which we are exposed , not having the effective rights of protection .
Most frequently we are ' rolled ' for our money , or just beaten up : and this happens to butch looking women in some districts .
PSYCHIATRY
One way of oppressing people and preventing them getting too angry about it , is to convince them , and everyone else , that they are sick .
There has hence arisen a body of psychiatric ' theory ' and ' therapy ' to deal with the ' problems ' and ' treatment ' of homosexuality .
Bearing in mind what we have so far described , it is quite understandable that gay people get depressed and paranoid ; but it is also , of course , part of the scheme that gay people should retreat to psychiatrists in times of troubles .
Operating as they do on the basis of social convention and prejudice , NOT scientific truth , mainstream psychiatrists accept society 's prevailing view that the male and female sex roles are ' good ' and ' normal ' , and try to adjust people to them .
If that fails , patients are told to ' accept themselves ' as ' deviant ' .
For the psychiatrist to state that homosexuality was perfectly valid and satisfying , and that the hang - up was society 's inability to accept that fact , would result in the loss of a large proportion of his patients .
Psychiatric ' treatment ' can take the form either of mindbending ' psychotherapy ' , or of aversion therapy which operates on the crude conditioning theory that if you hit a person hard enough , he 'll do what you want .
Another form of ' therapy ' is chemically induced castration , and there is a further form of ' treatment ' which consists in erasing part of the brain , with the intent ( usually successful ) of making the subject an asexual vegetable .
This ' therapy ' is not the source of the psychiatrist 's power , however .
Their social power stems from the facile and dangerous arguments by which they contrive to justify the prejudice that homosexuality is bad or unfortunate , and to mount this fundamental attack upon our right to do as we think best .
In this respect , there is little difference between the psychiatrist who says : ' From statistics we can show that homosexuality is connected with madness ' , and the one who says : ' Homosexuality is unfortunate because it is socially rejected ' .
The former is a dangerous idiot - he cannot see that it is society which drives gay people mad .
The second is a pig because he does see this , but sides consciously with the oppressors .
That psychiatrists command such credence and such income is surprising if we remember the hysterical disagreements of theory and practice in their field , and the fact that in formulating their opinions , they rarely consult gay people .
In fact , so far as is possible , they avoid talking to them at all , because they know that such confrontation would wreck their theories .
SELF -OPPRESSION
The ultimate success of all forms of oppression is our self - oppression .
Self - oppression is achieved when the gay person has adopted and internalised straight people 's definition of what is good and bad .
Self - oppression is saying : ' When you come down to it , we are abnormal ' .
Or doing what you most need and want to do , but with a sense of shame and loathing , or in a state of disassociation , pretending it is n't happening ; cruising or cottaging not because you enjoy it , but because you 're afraid of anything less anonymous .
Self - oppression is saying : ' I accept what I am ' , and meaning : ' I accept that what I am is second - best and rather pathetic ' .
Self - oppression is any other kind of apology : ' We 've been living together for ten years and all our married friends know about us and think we 're just the same as them ' .
Why ?
You 're not .
Self - oppression is the dolly lesbian who says : ' I ca n't stand those butch types who look like truck drivers ' ; the virile gay man who shakes his head at the thought of ' those pathetic queens ' .
This is self - oppression because it 's just another way of saying : ' I 'm a nice normal gay .
just like an attractive heterosexual ' .
The ultimate in self - oppression is to avoid confronting straight society , and thereby provoking further hostility : Self - oppression is saying , and believing : ' I am not oppressed ' .
WHY we 're oppressed
Gay people are oppressed .
As we 've just shown , we face the prejudice , hostility and violence of straight society , and the opportunities open to us in work and leisure are restricted , compared with those of straight people .
Should n't we demand reforms that will give us tolerance and equality ?
certainly we should - in a liberal - democratic society , legal equality and protection from attack are the very least we should ask for .
They are our civil rights .
But gay liberation does not just mean reforms .
It means a revolutionary change in our whole society .
Is this really necessary ?
Is n't it hard enough for us to win reforms within the present society , and how will we engage the support of straight people if we get ourselves branded as revolutionaries ?
Reforms may makes things better for a while ; changes in the law can make straight people a little less hostile , a little more tolerant - but reform cannot change the deep - down attitude of straight people that homosexuality is at best inferior to their own way of life , at worst a sickening perversion .
It will take more than reforms to change this attitude , because it is rooted in our society 's most basic institution - the Patriarchal Family .
We 've all been brought up to believe that the family is the source of our happiness and comfort .
But look at the family more closely .
Within the small family unit , in which the dominant man and submissive woman bring up their children in their own image , all our attitudes towards sexuality are learned at a very early age .
Almost before we can talk , certainly before we can think for ourselves , we are taught that there are certain attributes that are ' feminine ' and other that are ' masculine ' , and that they are God -given and unchangeable .
Beliefs learned so young are very hard to change ; but in fact these are false beliefs .
What we are taught about the differences between man and woman is propaganda , not truth .
The truth is that there are no proven systematic differences between male and female , apart from the obvious biological ones .
Male and female genitals and reproductive systems are different , and so are certain other physical characteristics , but all differences of temperament , aptitudes and so on , are the result of upbringing and social pressures .
They are not inborn .
Human beings could be much more various than our constricted patterns of ' masculine ' and ' feminine ' permit - we should be free to develop with greater individuality .
But as things are at present , there are only these two stereotyped roles into which everyone is supposed to fit , and most people - including gay people too - are apt to be alarmed when they hear these stereotypes or gender roles attacked , fearing that children ' wo n't know how to grow up if they have no one to identify with ' , or that ' everyone will be the same ' , i.e. that there will be either utter chaos or total conformity .
There would in fact be a greater variety of models and more freedom for experimentation , but there is no reason to suppose this will lead to chaos .
By our very existence as gay people , we challenge these roles .
it can easily be seen that homosexuals do n't fit into the stereotypes of masculine and feminine , and this is one of the main reasons why we become the object of suspicion , since everyone is taught that these and only these two roles are appropriate .
Our entire society is build around the patriarchal family and its enshrinement of these masculine and feminine roles .
Religion , popular morality art , literature and sport all reinforce these stereotypes .
In other words , this society is a sexist society , in which one 's biological sex determines almost all of what one does and how one does it ; a situation in which men are privileged , and women are mere adjuncts of men and objects for their use , both sexually and otherwise .
Since all children are taught so young that boys should be aggressive and adventurous , girls passive and pliant , most children do tend to behave in these ways as they get older , and to believe that other people should do so too .
So sexism does not just oppose gay people , but all women as well .
It is assumed that because women bear children they should and must rear them , and be simultaneously excluded from all other spheres of achievement .
However , as the indoctrination of the small child with these attitudes is not always entirely successful ( if it were , there would be no gay people for a start ) , the ideas taken in by the young child almost unconsciously must be reinforced in the older child and teenager by a consciously expressed male chauvinism : the ideological expression of masculine superiority .
Male chauvinism is not hatred of women , but male chauvinists accept women only on the basis that they are in fact lesser beings .
It is an expression of male power and male privilege , and while it 's quite possible for a gay man to be a male chauvinist , his very existence does also challenge male chauvinism in so far as he rejects his male supremacist role over women , and perhaps particularly if he rejects ' masculine ' qualities .
It is because of the patriarchal family that reforms are not enough .
Freedom for gay people will never be permanently won until everyone is freed from sexist role - playing and the straightjacket of sexist rules about our sexuality .
And we will not be freed from these so long as each succeeding generation is brought up in the same old sexist way in the Patriarchal family .
But why can't we just change the way in which children are brought up without attempting to transform the whole fabric of society ?
Because sexism is not just an accident - it is an essential part of our present society , and cannot be changed without the whole society changing with it .
In the first place , our society is dominated at every level by men , who have an interest in preserving the status quo ; secondly , the present system of work and production depends on the existence of the patriarchal family .
Conservative sociologists have pointed out that the small family unit of two parents and their children is essential in our contemporary advanced industrial family where work is minutely subdivided and highly regulated - in other words , for the majority very boring .
A man would not work at the assembly line if he had no wife and family to support ; he would not give himself fully to his work without the supportive and reassuring little group ready to follow him about and gear itself to his needs , to put up with his ill temper when he is frustrated or put down by the boss at work .
Were it not also for the captive wife , educated by advertising and everything she reads into believing that she needs ever more new goodies for the home , for her own beautification and for the childrens ' well - being , our economic system could not function properly , depending as it does on people buying far more manufactured goods than they need .
The housewife , obsessed with the ownership of as many material goods as possible , is the agent of this high level of spending .
None of these goods will ever satisfy her , since there is always something better to be had , and the surplus of these pseudo ' necessities ' goes hand in hand with the absence of genuinely necessary goods and services , such as adequate housing and schools .
The ethic and ideology of our culture has been conveniently summed up by the enemy .
Here is a quotation , intended quite seriously , from an American psychiatric primer .
The author , Dr. Fred Brown , states :
Our values in Western civilisation are founded upon the sanctity of the family , the right to property , and the worthwhileness of ' getting ahead '
The family can be established on /y through heterosexual intercourse , and this gives the woman a high value .
( Note the way in which woman is appraised as a form of property . }
Property acquisition and worldly success are viewed as distinctly masculine aims .
The individual who is outwardly masculine but appears to fall into the feminine class by reason . . . of his preference for other men denies these values of our civilisation .
In denying them he belittles those goals which carry weigh t and much emotional co/ouring in our society and thereby earns the hostility of those to whom these values are of great importance .
We agree with his description of our society and its values - but we reach a different conclusion .
We gay men and women do deny these values of our civilisation .
We believe that the society Dr. Brown describes is an evil society .
We believe that work in an advanced industrial society could be organised on more humane lines , with each job more varied and more pleasurable , and that the way society is at present organised operates in the interests of a small ruling group of straight men who claim most of the status and money , and not in the interests of the people as a whole .
We also believe that our economic resources could be used in a much more valuable and constructive way than they are at the moment - but that will not happen until the present pattern of male dominance in our society changes too .
That is why any reforms we might painfully exact from our rulers would only be fragile and vulnerable ; that is why we , along with the women 's movement , must fight for something more than reform .
We must aim at the abolition of the family , so that the sexist , male supremacist system can no longer be nurtured there .
WE CAN DO IT
Yet although this struggle will be hard , and our victories not easily won , we are not in fact being idealistic to aim at abolishing the family and the cultural distinctions between men and women .
True , these have been with us throughout history , yet humanity is at last in a position where we can progress beyond this .
Only reactionaries and conservatives believe in the idea of ' natural man ' .
Just what is so different in human beings from the rest of the animal kingdom is their ' unnaturalness ' .
Civilisation is in fact our evolution away from the limitations of the natural environment and towards its ever more complex control .
It is not ' natural ' to travel in planes .
It is not ' natural ' to take medicines and perform operations .
Clothing and shoes do not grow on trees .
Animals do not cook their food .
This evolution is made possible by the development of technology - i.e. all those tools and skills which help us to control the natural environment .
We have now reached a stage at which the human body itself , and even the reproduction of the species , is being ' unnaturally ' interfered with ( i.e. improved ) by technology .
Reproduction used to be left completely to the uncontrolled biological processes inherited from our animal ancestors , but modern science , by drastically lowering infant mortality , has made it unnecessary for women to have more than two or three babies , while contraceptives have made possible the conscious control of pregnancy and the freeing of sexuality from reproduction .
Today , further advances are on the point of making it possible for women to be completely liberated from their biology by means of the development of artificial wombs .
Women need no longer by burdened with the production of children at their main task in life .
and need be still less in the future
The present gender - role system of ' masculine ' and ' feminine ' is based on the way that reproduction was originally organised .
Men 's freedom from the prolonged physical burden of bearing children gave them a privileged position which was then reinforced by an ideology of male superiority .
But technology has now advanced to a stage at which the gender - role system is no longer necessary .
However , social evolution does not automatically take place with the steady advance of technology ,
The gender - role system and the family unit built around it will not disappear just because they have ceased to be necessary .
The sexist culture gives straight men privileges which , like those of any privileged class , will not be surrendered without a struggle , so that all of us who are oppressed by this culture ( women and gay people ) , must band together to fight it .
The end of the sexist culture and of the family will benefit all women , and gay people .
We must work together with women , since their oppression is our oppression , and by working together we can advance the day of our common liberation .
A NEW LIFE - STYLE
In the final section we shall outline some of the practical steps gay liberation will take to make this revolution .
But linked with this struggle to change society there is an important aspect of gay liberation that we can begin to build here and now - a NEW , LIBERATED LIFE -STYLE which will anticipate , as far as possible , the free society of the future .
Gay shows the way .
In some ways we are a / ready more advanced than straight people .
We are already outside the family and we have already , in part at least , rejected the ' masculine ' or ' feminine ' roles society has designed for us .
In a society dominated by the sexist culture it is very difficult , if not impossible , for heterosexual men and women to escape their rigid gender - role structuring and the roles of oppressor and oppressed .
But gay men do n't need to oppress women in order to fulfill their own psycho- sexual needs , and gay women do n't have to relate sexually to the male oppressor , so that at this moment in time , the freest and most equal relationships are most likely to be between homosexuals .
But because the sexist culture has oppressed us and distorted our lives too , this is not always achieved .
In our mistaken , placating efforts to be accepted and tolerated , we 've too often submitted to the pressures to conform to the straightjacket of society 's rules and hang ups about sex .
Particularly oppressive aspects of gay society are the Youth Cult , Butch and Femme role - playing , and Compulsive Monogamy .
THE YOUTH CULT .
Straight women are the most exposed in our society to the commercially manipulated ( because very profitable ) cult of youth and ' beauty '- i.e. the conformity to an ideal of ' sexiness ' and ' femininity ' imposed from without , not chosen by women themselves .
Women are encouraged to look into the mirror and love themselves because an obsession with clothes and cosmetics dulls their appreciation of where they 're really at . . . until it 's too late .
The sight of an old woman bedizened with layers of make - up , her hair tortured into artificial turrets , provokes ridicule on all sides .
Yet this grotesque denial of physical aging is merely the logical conclusion to the life of a woman who has been taught that her value lies primarily in her degree of sexual attractiveness .
Gay women , like straight men , are rather less into the compulsive search for youth , perhaps because part of their rebellion has been the rejection of themselves as sex objects - like men they see themselves as people ; as subjects rather than objects .
But gay men are very apt to fall victim to the cult of youth - those sexual parades in the ' glamorous ' meat - rack bars of London and New York , those gay beaches of the South of France and Los Angeles have n't anything to do with liberation .
Those are the hang - outs of the plastic gays who are obsessed with image and appearance .
In love with their own bodies , these gay men dread the approach of age , because to be old is to be ' ugly ' , and with their youth they lose also the right to love and be loved , and are valued only if they can pay .
This obsession with youth is destructive .
We must all get away from the false commercial standards of ' beauty ' imposed on us by movie moguls and advertising firms , because the youth / beauty hang - up sets us against one another in a frenzied competition for attention , and leads in the end to an obsession with self which is death to real affection or real sensual love .
Some gay men have spent so much time staring at themselves in the mirror that they 've become hypnotised by their own magnificence and have ended up by being made unable to see anyone else
BUTCH AND FEMME .
Many gay men and women needlessly restrict their lives by compulsive role playing .
They may restrict their own sexual behaviour by feeling that they must always take either a butch or a femme role , and worse , these roles are transposed to make even more distorting patterns in general social relationships .
We gay men and women are outside the gender - role system anyway , and therefore it is n't surprising if some of us - of either six - are more ' masculine ' and others more ' feminine ' .
There is nothing wrong with this .
What is bad is when gay people try to impose on themselves and on one another the masculine and feminine stereotypes of straight society , the butch seeking to expand his ego by dominating his / her partner 's life and freedom , and the femme seeking protection by submitting to the butch .
Butch really is bad - the oppression of others is an essential part of the masculine gender role .
We must make gay men and women who lay claim to the privileges of straight males understand what they are doing ; and those gay men and women who are caught up in the femme role must realise , as straight women increasingly do , that any security this brings is more than offset by their loss of freedom
COMPULSIVE MONOGAMY .
We do not deny that it is as possible for gay couples as for some straight couples to live happily and constructively together .
We question however as an ideal , the finding and settling down eternally with one ' right ' partner .
This is the blueprint of the straight world which gay people have taken over .
It is inevitably a parody , since they have n't even the justification of straight couples - the need to provide a stable environment for their children ( though in any case we believe that the suffocating small family unit is by no means the best atmosphere for bringing up children .
Monogamy is usually based on ownership - the woman sells her services to the man in return for security for herself and her children - and is entirely bound up in the man 's idea of property furthermore in our society the monogamous couple , with or without children , is an isolated , shut - in , up - tight unit , suspicious of and hostile to outsiders .
And though we do n't lay down rules or tell gay people how they should behave in bed or in their relationships , we do want them to question society 's blueprint for the couple .
The blueprint says ' we two against the world ' , and that can be protective and comforting .
But it can also be suffocating , leading to neurotic dependence and underlying hostility , the emotional dishonesty of staying in the comfy safety of the home and garden , the security and narrowness of the life built for two , with the secret guilt of fancying someone else while remaining in thrall to the idea that true love lasts a lifetime - as though there were a ration of relationships , and to want more than one were greedy .
Not that sexual fidelity is necessarily wrong ; what is wrong is the inturned emotional exclusiveness of the couple which students the partners so they can no longer operate at all as independent beings in society .
People need a variety of relationships in order to develop and grow , and to learn about other human beings .
It is especially important for gay people to stop copying straight - we are the ones who have the best opportunities to create a new lifestyle and if we do n't , no one else will .
Also , we need one another more than straight people do , because we are equals suffering under an insidious oppression from a society too primitive to come to terms with the freedom we represent .
Singly , or isolated in couples , we are weak - the way society wants us to be .
Society can not put us down so easily if we fuse together .
We have to get together , understand one another , live together .
Two ways we can do this are by developing consciousness - raising groups and gay communes .
Our gay communes and collectives must not be mere convenient living arrangements or worse , just extensions of the gay ghetto .
They must be a focus of consciousness - raising lie .
raising or increasing our awareness of our real oppression} and of gay liberation activity , a new focal point for members of the gay community .
It wo n't be easy , because this society is hostile to communal living .
And besides the practical hang - ups of finding money and a place large enough for a collective to live in , there are our own personal hang - ups : we have to change our attitudes to our personal property , to our lovers , to our day - to day priorities in work and leisure , even to our need for privacy .
But victory will come .
If we 're convinced of the importance of the new life - style , we can be strong and we can win through .
AIMS
The long - term goal of Gay Liberation , which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalised sexism of this society , is to rid society of the gender - role system which is at the root of our oppression .
This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles .
It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature .
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone , and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women 's liberation , we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women 's liberation movement , aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation .
In order to build this alliance , the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess .
To achieve our long term goal will take many years , perhaps decades .
But attitudes to the appropriate place of men and women in our society are changing rapidly , particularly the belief in the subordinate place for women .
Modern conditions are placing increasing strain on the small nuclear family containing one adult male and one adult female with narrowly defined roles and bound together for life .
The way forward
FREE OUR H EADS
The starting point of our liberation must be to rid ourselves of the oppression which lies in the head of every one of us .
This means freeing our heads from self oppression and male chauvinism , and no longer organising our lives according to the patterns with which we are indoctrinated by straight society .
It means that we must root out the idea that homosexuality is bad , sick or immoral , and develop a gay pride .
In order to survive , most of us have either knuckled under to pretended that no oppression exists , and the result of this has been further to distort our heads .
Within gay liberation , a number of consciousness - raising groups have already developed , in which we try to understand our oppression and learn new ways of thinking and behaving .
The aim is to step outside the experience permitted by straight society , and to learn to love and trust one another .
This is the precondition for acting and struggling together .
By freeing our heads we get the confidence to come out publicly and proudly as gay people , and to win over our gay brothers and sisters to the ideas of gay liberation .

Before we can create the new society of the future , we have to defend our interests as gay people here and now against all forms of oppression and victimisation .
We have therefore drawn up the following list of immediate demands .
that all discrimination against gay people , male and female , by the law , by employers , and by society at large , should end .
that all people who feel attracted to a member of their own sex be taught that such feeling are perfectly valid .
that sex education in schools stop being exclusively heterosexual .
that psychiatrists stop treating homosexuality as though it were a sickness , thereby giving gay people senseless guilt complexes .
that gay people be as legally free to contact other gay people , though newspaper ads , on the streets and by any other means they may want as are heterosexuals , and that police harassment should cease right now .
that employers should no longer be allowed to discrim inate against anyone on accou nt of their sexual preferences .
that the age of consent for gay males be reduced to the same as for straight .
that gay people be free to hold hands and kiss in public , as are heterosexuals .
Those who believe in gay liberation need to support actively their local gay group .
With the rapid spread of the ideas of gay liberation , it is inevitable that many members of such groups have only partially come to terms with their homosexuality .
The degree of self - oppression is often such that it is difficult to respect individuals in the group , and activists frequently feel tempted to despair .
But if we are to succeed in transforming our society we must persuade others of the merits of our ideas , and there is no way we can achieve this if we cannot even persuade those most affected by our oppression to join us in fighting for justice .
We do not intend to ask for anything .
We intend to stand firm and assert our basic rights .
If this involves violence , it will not be we who initiate this , but those who attempt to stand in our way to freedom .
This manifesto was originally produced collectively by the Manifesto Group of GLF .
We recognise that it leaves many questions unanswered and open - ended but hope it will lead to the furtherance of a scientific analysis of sexism and our oppression as gay people .

Science & Exploration Rosetta triumphs at asteroid Lutetia
10/07/2010 12343 views 23 likes
Asteroid Lutetia has been revealed as a battered world of many craters .
ESA ’s Rosetta mission has returned the first close - up images of the asteroid showing it is most probably a primitive survivor from the violent birth of the Solar System .
The flyby was a spectacular success with Rosetta performing faultlessly .
Closest approach took place at 18:10 CEST , at a distance of 3162 km .
The images show that Lutetia is heavily cratered , having suffered many impacts during its 4.5 billion years of existence .
As Rosetta drew close , a giant bowl - shaped depression stretching across much of the asteroid rotated into view .
The images confirm that Lutetia is an elongated body , with its longest side around 130km .
The pictures come from Rosetta ’s OSIRIS instrument , which combines a wide angle and a narrow angle camera .
At closest approach , details down to a scale of 60 m can be seen over the entire surface of Lutetia .
" I think this is a very old object .
Tonight we have seen a remnant of the Solar System ’s creation , " says Holger Sierks , OSIRIS principal investigator , Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research , Lindau , Germany .
Racing past an asteroid Rosetta raced past the asteroid at 15 km /s completing the flyby in just a minute .
But the cameras and other instruments had been working for hours and in some cases days beforehand , and will continue afterwards .
Shortly after closest approach , Rosetta began transmitting data to Earth for processing .
Lutetia and Saturn Lutetia has been a mystery for many years .
Ground telescopes have shown that it presents confusing characteristics .
In some respects it resembles a ‘ C - type ’ asteroid , a primitive body left over from the formation of the Solar System .
In others , it looks like an ‘ M - type ’ .
These have been associated with iron meteorites , are usually reddish and thought to be fragments of the cores of much larger objects .
The new images and the data from Rosetta ’s other instruments will help to decide but not tonight .
Compositional information is needed for that .
Sensors investigate Lutetia Rosetta operated a full suite of sensors at the encounter , including remote sensing and in - situ measurements .
Some of the payload of its Philae lander were also switched on .
Together they looked for evidence of a highly tenuous atmosphere , magnetic effects , and studied the surface composition as well as the asteroid ’s density .
Lutetia asteroid
They also attempted to catch any dust grains that may have been floating in space near the asteroid for on - board analysis .
The results from these instruments will come in time .
The flyby marks the attainment of one of Rosetta ’s main scientific objectives .
The spacecraft will now continue to a 2014 rendezvous with its primary target , comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko .
It will then accompany the comet for months , from near the orbit of Jupiter down to its closest approach to the Sun .
In November 2014 , Rosetta will release Philae to land on the comet nucleus .
Asteroid Lutetia " Wunderbar ! ' says David Southwood , ESA Director of Science and Robotic Exploration , " It has been a great day for exploration , a great day for European science .
The clockwork precision is a great tribute to the scientists and engineers in our Member States in our industry and , not least , in ESA itself .
Roll on 2014 and our comet rendezvous . "
But for now , analysing the Lutetia data is the focus for the Rosetta instrument teams .
Just 24 hours ago , Lutetia was a distant stranger .
Now , thanks to Rosetta , it has become a close friend .
​ Can marijuana actually make you smarter ?
Well , yeah , probably so , man .
But if you ’re bipolar , you now have some actual scientific research to back you up in that belief .
PsychCentral .
A recent study suggests that some patients with bipolar disorder who use marijuana actually performed better on certain tests involving cognitive functioning , reports Jessica Ward Jones , M.D. , at
Dr. Ole Andreassen of Oslo University Hospital in Norway studied 133 patients with bipolar disorder and 140 with schizophrenia .
The patients were questioned about prior drug use ; over the previous six months , 18 bipolar patients and 23 schizophrenia patients had used marijuana .
All of the participants then underwent several tests to assess neurocognitive function , including the logical memory test , the color - word interference set - shifting subset test , the digit span forward test , the verbal fluency test , and learning tests .
The bipolar patients who used cannabis performed better in verbal fluency than bipolar patients who did not use cannabis .
They appeared to perform slightly better on the learning test , as well , although researchers said these results were not statistically significant .
Marijuana , however , seemed to worsen function in the schizophrenic participants , particularly with regard to focused attention , logical memory - learning , and logical memory - recall .
“ Both neuropsychological test performance and individual effects of substance use can be regarded as endophenotypes , mediating factors between the neurobiological substrate and the expressed phenotype , ” Andreassen almost impenetrably writes .
What the good doctor means is that although some have speculated that a biological relationship exists between bipolar illness and schizophrenia , Andreassen ’s results provide evidence to suggest that the two illnesses may be separate disease processes .
The doctor was quick to pledge allegiance to conventional wisdom , saying he did n’t recommend that bipolar patients smoke pot ( despite the fact that it apparently makes them smarter ! ) .
“ The evidence linking drug use / abuse with poor outcome in severe mental disorder must still be decisive for clinical advice , ” Dr. Andreassen warned .
Dr. Andreassen ’s results were published in the November 2009 issue of Psychological Medicine .
Fraud Victim Weighs Lawsuit Against Bank
' I am Treading Water Here ' After $ 465,000 Theft
Michelle Marisco , owner of Village View Escrow Inc. , Redondo Beach , CA , has her attorney ready to file a lawsuit against Professional Business Bank , Pasadena , CA , after losing $ 465,000 in fraudulent account takeovers .
[ Note : For analysis of this incident , see Account Takeover : The New Wrinkle . ]
The crimes occurred in March , when hackers were able to hack the company 's network , steal bank credentials and send 26 consecutive wire transfers out of the country .
Marisco says she 's struggled to keep her business afloat ever since .
" I am treading water here , " Marisco says .
" I had to let one of three employees go because of this fraud loss . "
Village View Escrow is but the latest business to step forward and threaten legal action against banking institutions following such fraud incidents .
Among other high profile cases , Dallas - based Comerica Bank and Michigan 's Experi-Metal Inc are exchanging court motions in their dispute .
And Patco , a Sanford , Maine - based construction company , has sued Ocean Bank of Portsmouth , NH , for failing to detect and prevent over $ 500,000 in bogus transfers .
How it Happened
But Marisco says that the 26 wire transfers were made without her knowledge , and she never received any email notification from the bank , as she normally would when money was moved out of the escrow account .
The cybercriminals apparently disabled an email verification service offered by the bank .
" The whole experience is surreal and has opened my eyes to the loopholes and the lack of ' everything ' that would make sense when it comes to a business banking relationship , " Marisco says .
The point of infection likely occurred when Marisco received an email purportedly from UPS , stating there was a problem with a document she sent through the carrier .
When she opened an email attachment , her PC became infected with a virus .
She says she could n't read the attachment , so she forwarded it to her assistant , whose PC also caught the virus .
Subsequently , via malware , fraudsters were able to secure the company 's banking credentials and orchestrate the fraudulent transfers .
Bank's Response
" The minute I discovered it , I called the bank and told them about it , " she says .
" They put me on hold for a very long time , then they came back and said that my bank reps were not allowed to talk to me unless it was on speaker phone with senior staff present on the call . "
The bank then closed access to the business ' bank account , Marsico says , and she has only recovered a fraction of the money lost .
" Trying to run a business without access to my money was a horrible experience , " she says .
Marisco recovered some of the money from money mules duped into enabling the scheme .
She contacted the mules via social media , told them what had happened and managed to recover $ 70,000 .
" I was able to get that money back -- not the bank , " she says .
Business in Jeopardy
Because the money taken was being held for clients ' escrow accounts , Marisco says she has had to float a loan at another bank for part of the unrecovered $ 395,000 .
She also has listed her house and has declined her salary to help cover the losses and keep the business open .
She believes she is in jeopardy of having her license pulled because of the uncovered losses , " unless I come up with something pretty quick . "
The incident has taught Marisco about the devastation of fraud .
" I began this business three years ago and built it by myself , " says the business owner , who has 22 years of experience in the mortgage escrow industry .
" And we were doing really well business - wise -- until this fraud happened to the company . "
Fourteen Days in May is a documentary directed by Paul Hamann .
The program recounts the final days before the execution of Edward Earl Johnson , an American prisoner convicted of rape and murder .
Johnson protested his innocence and claimed that his confession had been made under duress .
He was executed in Mississippi ’s gas chamber on May 20 , 1987 .
The documentary crew , given access to the prison warden , guards and chaplain and to Johnson and his family , filmed the last days of Johnson ’s life in detail .
The documentary argues against the death penalty and maintains that capital punishment is disproportionately applied to African - Americans convicted of crimes against whites .
The program features attorney Clive Stafford Smith , a noted advocate against capital punishment .
Fourteen Days in May won a British Film Institute Grierson Award and a top prize at the Festival dei Populi .
It has been shown in many countries but has only appeared in an abbreviated form in the United States , on HBO .
Hamann disowned this shortened version .
It was in direct response to this documentary that the Lifelines organization was set up , to organize pen pals for death row prisoners .
Part 2 :
The taxpayer is spending more than £ 15 m a year to send the children of British diplomats and military officers to private schools such as Fettes , Winchester , Roedean and Marlborough .
The subsidies – costing as much as £ 30,000 a year in school fees – are being paid by the Foreign Office even when the diplomats have returned to the UK and then stay on for years .
The extraordinary hidden privilege has been unearthed by Gloria de Piero , a new Labour MP , in written questions .
In a co-ordinated response , the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development said the perk was necessary to " recruit , motivate and retain staff who are skilled and equipped to meet the department 's objectives " .
It is understood the same privilege is provided to senior members of the military , but no figures have been divulged by the Ministry of Defence .
The Foreign Office refused to disclose the identity of the private schools , but the DfID agreed to do so .
It disclosed that , in 2009 - 10 , 339 officers received " continuity of education allowance " for 521 children – representing around 6 % of staff employed at the Foreign Office .
FCO staff serving in the UK were paid £ 7,487,435 to cover school fees , with staff serving at posts overseas receiving £ 5,843,415 .
Under FCO rules staff based in the UK for between two and four years can have their children 's school fees paid but after four years must meet the cost themselves or switch to state education .
DfID reported that , in the financial year 2009 - 10 , 48 members of its staff on overseas postings received an education allowance at a total cost of £ 1,318,810 .
The Foreign Office minister , Alistair Burt , defended the practice , saying the department " helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children 's education in the UK where staff choose this , or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted " .
He added : " In some countries , we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons .
In others , local schools of an acceptable standard are not available . "
Andrew Mitchell , the international development secretary , said : " Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full - time education from the age of five , and they pay UK tax wherever they work .
" Most parents prefer to take their children with them , but in some countries they are not permitted to do so , either for health or security reasons . "
He said staff should be allowed to keep their children in private schools at taxpayers ' expense because continuity of education , particularly at secondary level , was an important factor .
De Piero said : " Expecting the taxpayer to pay the public school fees for the children of civil servants who are based in the UK is simply a luxury we cannot afford .
" At a time when the coalition 's cuts are threatening the education of the many , there can be no justification for this huge subsidy for the few .
" In this age of austerity , when public services are being cut , it can not be right that we continue to spend these huge sums on private education .
Ministers must urgently look at how to reduce this bill . "

Four - time World Rally champion Juha Kankkunen is expected to contest this year 's Rally Finland - 31 years after he first competed on his home round of the World Rally Championship .
The 51 - year - old denied his deal to drive a Ford Focus RS WRC was completed , but said he was interested in competing on the July 29 - 31 event - and possibly more rounds of the series later in the season .
Kankkunen , who has competed on Rally Finland 22 times , said : " Maybe there is a chance to do something , we will see .
I am in Spain on holiday right now , but when I get back to Finland there is a press conference - we have to see .
" It could be nice to do the event , though .
This is the last time , the last year for the current World Rally Cars , so it would be good to compete in Finland with this car . "
Having won the event three times , the chances of Kankkunen collecting a fourth success are slim .
" I have no idea about where I might finish , " he added .
" It would be tough because the boys are competing all of the time in these cars and they know the speed .
I guess the thing I have is that I know the roads at least . "
Kankkunen returned to rallying for the recent Rally of Portugal Revival , winning the event comfortably in a Ford Escort MkII .
He was partnered by Welshman Nicky Grist on the Faro - based rally and said that agreement could continue to Finland .
" I have n't even considered a co-driver yet , but why not Nicky ? " said Kankkunen .
" We had a good time in Portugal . "

Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is weighing up a bid by officials from Mallorca to try and grab Spain 's second race from Valencia in the future .
Amid doubts about the long - term future of the Valencia event , representatives from Mallorca met with Ecclestone at the European Grand Prix last weekend to present plans for an all - new venue that will be completed in 2013 .
Joan Jaume Mulet , the mayor of the Llucmajor municipality of the Balearic Islands , has thrown his support behind the project - and has already commissioned Spanish architects Mateo Palmer and Biel Arbona to work on the track .
The ' Circuit of the Balearic Islands ' is planned to be 3.6 miles long , and the project has recruited Federico Gastaldi - one of the men who took F1 back to Argentina in the mid-1990s - to act as a mediator in the discussions with Ecclestone .
Obama administration officials reject the criticism , saying that the benefits associated with the dozens of major rules adopted between President Obama ’s inauguration and the end of 2009 outweigh the costs by an estimated $ 3.1 billion , a savings they assert is greater than that attributed to new regulations in the first years of the Clinton and Bush administrations .
They arrived at that figure by factoring in upfront costs — like the price of stronger brake systems being mandated in new tractor - trailers — with the estimated long - term savings — like reduced property damage and an estimated 227 fewer highway deaths each year .
“ I do n’t want to put anyone out of business , ” said Inez Tenenbaum , chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission , who was appointed by Mr. Obama .
“ But if anything will help the marketplace , it is to make sure that people have confidence in the products that they buy . ”
The Environmental Protection Agency is perhaps the most aggressive advocate of the new regulatory philosophy in Washington .
It has moved quickly to reverse or strengthen Bush administration policies on power plant pollution , lead paint and toxic chemical discharges .
Last month , along with the Transportation Department , the agency mandated that automakers significantly cut greenhouse - gas emissions while increasing fuel economy standards , an issue the Bush administration had put on hold , citing the industry ’s weakened financial condition .
The car companies pronounced themselves happy with the result because it eliminated the possibility of even stricter regulation by California and about a dozen other states .
The agency ’s administrator , Lisa P. Jackson , has made clear that she would prefer to have Congress tackle climate change through broad legislation in what would be one of the largest regulatory actions in American history .
But if Congress fails to pass a law , she has already started the process of mandating standards on her own .

The shift is also evident at major agencies charged with policing worker safety , health and consumer products .
Many of the rules those agencies have adopted or are now pushing to impose — including a requirement that farmers refrigerate eggs and kill rodents to combat salmonella contamination on eggshells , which sickens 79,000 people a year — languished during previous administrations .
The supply - side gospel is dead — profoundly , utterly debunked by empirical reality — but refuses to shut up .
Not only are the wealthiest Americans hoarding trillions of dollars rather than investing ,
Nonfinancial companies are sitting on $ 1.8 trillion in cash , roughly one - quarter more than at the beginning of the recession .
And as several major firms report impressive earnings this week , the money continues to flow into firms ’ coffers . [… ]
A survey last month of more than 1,000 chief financial officers by Duke University and CFO magazine showed that nearly 60 percent of these executives do n’t expect to bring their employment back to pre-recession levels until 2012 , or later — even though they ’re projecting a 12 percent rise in earnings and a 9 percent boost in capital spending over the next year .
When asked why companies are holding back so much , many economists cite broader uncertainty that goes well beyond anything happening in Washington .
Firms are n’t sure whether the economy can sustain a strong recovery .
And as long as consumer spending remains low , there ’s not much incentive for companies to ramp up .
( WaPo )
Let ’s take a moment to recap ECON 101 .
The economy is measured in ( GDP ) Gross Domestic Product , which is the sum of four things : ( C ) Consumer spending , ( I ) Investment spending , ( E ) Exports , ( G ) Government spending .
The equation looks like this :
GDP = C + I + E + G
Consumer spending is down because we ’re scared of the economy .
Investors — both human and corporate — refuse to invest as long as consumer spending is down .
But that wo n’t come down until the economy improves .
This dilemma leaves us with just the ( E ) and the ( G ) .
Sure , Obama wants to increase American exports ; but that takes years of consistent policy and it ’s not guaranteed to work .
Which leaves you with ( G ) — big , bad , awful , terrible GOVERNMENT SPENDING — as the last option for lifting the economy to restore consumer and investor confidence .
Your supply - side strategy does n’t work .
Cut the taxes of these wealth - hoarders and all they will do is hoard more .
Arthur Laffer , whose imaginary curve forms the basis of conservative economics , thinks the solution is to do away with taxes altogether :
No income tax , no corporate profits tax , no capital gains tax , no estate tax , no payroll tax ( FICA ) either employee or employer , no Medicare or Medicaid taxes , no federal excise taxes , no tariffs , no federal taxes at all , which would have reduced federal revenues by $ 2.4 trillion annually .
Can you imagine where employment would be today ?
How does a 2.5 % unemployment rate sound ?
The Laffer curve is magic .
It makes government revenue grow by cutting taxes — except that it does n’t — so Laffer is just reaching his logical conclusion when he suggests that deficits will disappear ( magic ! ) when government has no revenue .
One imagines the investor - class would hoard their cash even then .
British scientists believe they have cracked the answer to the age - old question of which came first , the chicken or the egg ?
Researchers have found that a protein called ovocleidin ( OC - 17 ) is crucial in the formulation of eggshells , and it is produced in the pregnant hen 's ovaries , the Daily Express reports .
Therefore , the answer to the conundrum must be that the chicken came first .
Using a high - tech computer to look at the molecular structure of a shell , the team of scientists from the Universities of Sheffield and Warwick found that OC - 17 acts as a catalyst , kick - starting the conversion of calcium carbonate in the chicken 's body into calcite crystals .
They make up the hard shell that houses the yolk and its protective fluids while the chick develops .
" It had long been suspected that the egg came first but now we have the scientific proof that shows that in fact the chicken came first , " said Dr Colin Freeman , from Sheffield University .
" The protein had been identified before and it was linked to egg formation but by examining it closely we have been able to see how it controls the process . "
But the researchers have not yet got an answer to how the protein - producing chicken existed in the first place .

> There is a theater - of - the - ironic element in Scott Brown 's " victory " on the bank tax .
He successfully removed from the financial bill a $ 19 billion tax on banks with more than $ 50 billion in assets and on hedge funds with $ 10 billion or more .
Instead , about half the revenue to pay for reform will come from a stealth tax -- in the form of higher FDIC deposit insurance premiums .
( The required ratio of cash to expected exposure will increase 20 basis points from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent . )
One key banking lobbyist told me that " the net effect is the same ... this is a fixed cost and it could mean higher fees or fewer loans . "
It also will hit a much larger group of banks .
The old tax would have targeted just the mega-institutions that played the biggest role in making the financial mess .
The new stealth tax socks all banks with $ 10 billion or more in assets -- many of which avoided irresponsible lending practices and fancy investment instruments -- charging them $ 5.7 billion in higher premiums .
( Because more banks pay , the huge banks get away with paying less . )
Even though the policy will not go into full effect for ten years , costs could rise much sooner -- at a time when all banks are under greater pressure than ever to make more loans and get credit flowing again .
And hedge funds seem to be spared any new tax at all .
So Scott Brown the populist crusader , the protector of the middle class , the most popular politician in Massachusetts , has pushed a policy that probably means lower taxes for Wall Street , higher premiums for Main Street banks , and less lending to small businesses .

A Microsoft executive on Wednesday took a dig at Apple and his own company , quipping that the new iPhone 4 might be as problematic for Cupertino as Vista was for Microsoft .
A Microsoft executive on Wednesday took a dig at Apple and his own company , quipping that the new might be as problematic for Cupertino as Vista was for Microsoft .
" It looks like that iPhone 4 might be their Vista , and I 'm OK with that , " Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner said during a keynote speech at the company 's Worldwide Partner Conference , a video of which was posted online .
" That 's another mantle [ Apple is ] welcome to take .
I actually read that headline last week and I just sort of had to smile after I did cartwheels , again . "
is of course , the previous version of Microsoft 's Windows operating system before , which was plagued by bugs and generally viewed as a poor upgrade from XP .
Turner made his comments while talking about Microsoft 's efforts in the mobile space , and the company 's .
" One of the things that I want to make sure you know today is that you 're going to be able to use a Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you 're holding it to make a phone call , " Turner said , referring to the .
Turner acknowledged , however , that mobile has been a challenge for Microsoft .
His speech comes just one week after the company .
" This has been tough , " Turner said about mobile .
With the expected launch of Windows Phone 7 in late 2010 , however , " we 're back in the game , " he said .
" When you look at this phone it 's not like any phone you 've ever seen from Microsoft , and I think that 's a good thing , " Turner continued .
" We 're re-booting ourselves in this area . "
Turner also discussed Apple's .
The tablet , he said , is " fabulous at content consumption , [ but ] lousy at content creation . "
As a result , most people are not going to dump their laptops in favor of an iPad at this point .
" They 're generally a third device for most people .
That 's a fact and that 's not going to change , " Turner said .
" Productivity matters and you can't maximize productivity if all you 're doing is consuming content . "
CLEVELAND -- Angered and betrayed by LeBron James ' decision to leave for Miami , Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert accused the NBA 's MVP of quitting during the playoffs .
Gilbert , who posted a letter to Cavs fans on the team 's website shortly after James announced his plans to sign with the Heat , told The Associated Press late Thursday night that it's " accountability time " for James .
" He has gotten a free pass , " Gilbert said in a phone interview with The AP .
" People have covered up for [ James ] for way too long .
Tonight we saw who he really is . "
Gilbert said James quit on the Cavs during their second - round series against the Boston Celtics , who rallied from a 2 - 1 deficit to eliminate Cleveland .
" He quit , " Gilbert said .
" Not just in Game 5 , but in Games 2 , 4 and 6 .
Watch the tape .
The Boston series was unlike anything in the history of sports for a superstar . "
The Cavaliers were beaten by 32 points in Game 5 .
During the game , James appeared distracted and uninterested , often glaring at Cleveland 's coaches as the Cavs tried to foul to get back into the game in the second half .
James also made some puzzling postgame comments , saying he had " spoiled " people with his play over seven seasons .
Gilbert also said he believes James quit on the Cavs in Game 6 of their series in 2009 against Orlando .
" Go back and look at the tape , " he said .
" How many shots did he take ? "
The NBA will not comment on Gilbert 's statement , league spokesman Tim Frank told ESPN The Magazine 's Chris Broussard .
Gilbert , who has owned the Cavs for five years , said he was most disappointed by James ' behavior in the months leading up to the superstar 's announcement that he is going to Miami to play with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh .
Gilbert said James never returned a single phone message or text since the end of the season and that the Cavs were not informed of James ' decision until he went on the air .
Gilbert said Rich Paul , one of James ' business partners , called the Cavs moments before the announcement .
" LeBron James needs to go to another team with two superstars already so he can win a championship , " Gilbert said .
" We will win a championship before [ the Heat ] do . "

“ Most of her face was gone .
There was just this gaping hole in her face where her eyes and nose and most of her mouth had been .
I thought she was dead .
I just figured this was going to be another homicide scene .
“ Then I saw her fingers start to move — ever so slightly .
And it looked like she was trying to breathe through the wound in her face . ”

You have to credit the GOP for equal opportunity disinformation .
The women are as accomplished at prevarication as the men .
Let ’s start with Gov. Jan
“ I ’m really not a bigot when the sheet and hood are off ” Brewer .
This is starting to look like a pattern .
First Mark Kirk , now Jan Brewer .
Governor Brewer ’s effort to stir sympathy for her cause seems to have backfired on her .
Via the Arizona Guardian : Gov. Jan Brewer said in a recent interview that her father died fighting Nazis in Germany .
In fact , the death of Wilford Drinkwine came 10 years after World War II had ended .
During the war , Drinkwine worked as a civilian supervisor for a naval munitions depot in Hawthorne , Nev .
He died of lung disease in 1955 in California .
Brewer made the comment to The Arizona Republic while talking about the criticism she has taken since signing SB 1070 , the new immigration law that makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
" Knowing that my father died fighting the Nazi regime in Germany , that I lost him when I was 11 because of that … and then to have them call me Hitler ’s daughter .
It hurts .
It ’s ugliness beyond anything I ’ve ever experienced , " Brewer said in the story , published Tuesday .
How exactly does one stretch work for a munitions depot stateside into " fighting the Nazis " ?

One of the strangest phenomena in American politics is the persistence of claims , based on scanty or dubious evidence , proclaiming the death of the religious right or that the end of the culture wars is at hand .
Having written about the ever - evolving religious right for more than 25 years , I have found myself often perplexed and sometimes gobsmacked by such claims .
These claims play a significant role in the discourse but they ’ve received far less scrutiny than they merit .
The term “ culture wars ” as we currently understand it was first popularized by sociologist James Davison Hunter in his 1992 book , Culture Wars : The Struggle to Control the Family , Art , Education , Law and Politics in America .
Hunter framed it as a set of issues over which “ orthodox ” religious people and “ progressives ” were at odds .
Perhaps irreconcilably so .
And he worried that the political invective hurled by both sides could lead to violence .
But it was unsuccessful Republican presidential contender Pat Buchanan ’s demagogic speech at the 1992 Republican Convention that really launched the term into our political lexicon .
Although it is now generally referred to as “ the culture war speech , ” Buchanan never actually used the term , which is significant because Buchanan was saying something very different than Hunter :
There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America .
It is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be —as was the Cold War itself .
He makes it clear that this religious war is being waged on cultural fronts — but that culture is not the war itself .
This is not a distinction without a difference .
The religious war of which he speaks is not merely a collection of “ social issues ” over which people disagree , like abortion , homosexuality , and separation of church and state .
It is , rather , a clash of profoundly different worldviews which are then played out in battles over specific issues .
The fascinating problem with the method of those who declare that the culture war is over , or about to be , is that they rarely if ever actually take the metaphor a step further .
They do not name any of the belligerents , only the “ issues ” over which unnamed groups are said to be at war .
I believe there are two main reasons for this .
One is the temptation to treat scandals and specific electoral outcomes as ultimate outcomes for the entire religious right or for the culture wars .
On closer examination , the evidence from such episodes has never supported such conclusions .
The other reason has to do with the temptation to draw sharp final conclusions from highly transitory polling data — as opposed to evaluating the players , ideologies , institutions , and leaders of the religious right .
We need to ask ourselves , and those who make these claims :
How can there be a war without belligerents ?
How can there be an end to hostilities unless the warring parties themselves sue for peace ?
How can pundits say that peace is breaking out when none of the belligerents have even been asked if they would like to seek it ?
( And no , those engaged in self - selected common ground discussions , whatever you think of their merit , do not count . )
Consider , if we were going to talk seriously about baseball ( or any other sport ) as so many of us do .
We would be knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing sides , including such matters as injured players and replacements .
We would know about the respective capacities of both teams ’ pitching , running , hitting , and fielding .
We might know something about the philosophies of the managers and the relative depth of the pockets of the owners .
Take any field of competitive endeavor — including war itself — and the conversation is more like baseball than almost all of what we read or hear about the culture wars .
The claims that the end of the culture wars is at hand or that the religious right is dead are closely related , but they are not the same thing .
Following from Buchanan , if a religious war is being fought on cultural fronts it stands to reason that the religious right , a movement dominated by conservative evangelicals and conservative Catholics , is one of the belligerents .
And of course , the precipitous decline or demise of the religious right would be decisive in the outcome .
But there has , to date , been no credible analysis published anywhere ( to my knowledge ) to show that such a decline or demise is even remotely in process .
Thus it should come as no surprise that every historic element of the culture wars remains hot and that the religious right is playing a prominent and active role .
Facts are stubborn things — especially when one finds oneself without any .
Some of those who make the claims we are discussing here , when they bother to cite any evidence at all , tend to rely on interpretations of convenience of public opinion polls or election outcomes .
Chip Berlet has done a good job of debunking misuses of polling data of this sort , so I will not repeat all of that here .
That said , both liberals and conservatives , Republicans and Democrats , often display a lack of appreciation of the seriousness of purpose as well as the considerable resources , ideological rigidity , and ongoing political clout of the religious right .
Sometimes spectacularly so .
For example , religious right leaders objected when Governor Mitch Daniels ( R - IN ) called for a “ truce ” on contentious social issues — apparently without consulting those whom he expected to join in the truce .
They declared that such a truce is the equivalent of “ surrender . ”
Daniels , a possible 2012 GOP presidential contender , backed right off .
Rob Boston , who has written about the religious right for two decades concluded that “ Daniels ’ quick retreat ” indicates “ that the religious right has lost none of its political punch . ”
Politicians and their vassals understandably wish that contentious matters , over which there is little agreement ( and over which they have no control ) , would miraculously disappear .
And pols from Daniels to Barack Obama have made their wishes known .
But all of the polling , focus grouping , and crafting of clever “ messages ” have failed to end the culture wars .
The reason of course , it that the religious right , the main coalitional aggressor in the religious war and the various specific cultural battles by which most of us experience it , is unmoved by “ messages . ”
Little has changed since I wrote about this same general situation in my 1997 book Eternal Hostility : The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy .
The so - called culture war is marked not only by the kinds of volleys of unpleasant political invective from both sides that upsets DC insiders seeking to control public discourse .
It also comprises real - world violence ( such as the assassination of Dr. George Tiller ) and threats of violence emanating almost exclusively from one side .
I updated this point in an essay last year in The Public Eye magazine :
It is a one - sided war of aggression against the civil rights advances of women and minorities and the rights of individual conscience that we generally discuss under the rubric of religious pluralism and of separation of church and state .
For these political aggressors , war is not merely a metaphor or the equivalent of a sports analogy .
It is far more profound and stems from the conflict of “ world view , ” usually described as a “ Biblical World view ” against everything else .
It is explicitly understood by its proponents as a religious war and waged accordingly on multiple fronts , mostly in terms we have come to define as “ cultural . ”
How the conflict plays out takes on political dimensions and sometimes physical conflict .
This war is theocratic in nature , and seeks to roll back decades , and depending on the faction , centuries of democratic advances .
As useful an analytical tool as polling can be , it cannot properly evaluate vast , complex , historic elements like these .
But taken alone , and absent such context , polling can lead to what we may charitably describe as wishful thinking about the end of the culture wars and the demise of the religious right .
Those of us who have studied these matters for years are astounded by the frequency of such claims , and by the seeming obliviousness of otherwise thoughtful people who make them .
Sometimes repeatedly .
But such statements and the underlying views they represent are hallmarks of the politics of our time .
If past is prologue , fresh expressions of the death of the religious right and the end of the culture wars are surely at hand .
And with them , there will be opportunities to question and to study these eruptions of an underappreciated swath of contemporary political eschatology .

Ridley Scott 's Robin Hood premieres this weekend , much to the delight of action buffs , toxophilites , and people weaned on tales the legendary archer and his band of Merry Men .
The prequel , which stars Russell Crowe as the titular outlaw , re-imagines a Robin Hood prior to his self - imposed exile in the bowels of Sherwood Forest and , according to Slate 's Dana Stevens , bereft of the " recognizable tropes " from the well - worn legend .
" Little John ( Kevin Durand ) is n't particularly large , Friar John ( Mark Addy ) never carries Robin Hood on his back across a river , and no one mounts a horse by leaping down onto its back from a tree , " writes Stevens .
" This adaptation seems either not to understand the appeal of its source material or to reject it deliberately .
The movie eschews every value we 've come to think of as quintessentially Robin Hood - ish : derring - do , mischief , laughter , joy . "
But while critics pore over Ridley Scott 's arrow - riddled take on the pre-Magna Carta vigilante , other reviewers have chosen to analyze Robin Hood 's morally ambiguous brand of lawlessness through the prism of modern American politics .
" Rob from the rich and give to the poor " sounds awfully socialist , but Robin 's resistance to taxation may resonate more with the Tea Party than lefty themes of redistribution .
Is Robin Hood a Tea Partier or a socialist ?
A Tea Partier Turned Socialist ?
At the Washington Post , Michael O'Sullivan senses a strong anti-government current swirling beneath the popular mythos of Robin Hood .
While the master archer has always had a place in the public imagination for " robbing from the rich to steal from the poor , " the new manifestation is a wholly distinct beast .
" Set in an England that has been bankrupted by years of war in the Middle East -- in this case , the Crusades -- it 's the story of a people who are being taxed to death by a corrupt government ...
It asks :
What 's a man of principle to do ? , " says O'Sullivan .
" If you said , ' Steal from the rich , and give to the poor , ' you must be thinking of the old Robin Hood .
The correct answer here is : ' Do n't retreat , reload . ' "
He says there is " precious little of the socialist stuff " in this " politicized " version of the legend .
Robin Hood the Libertarian The New York Times ' A.O. Scott concurs , declaring Russell Crowe 's Robin Hood a medieval libertarian rather than a proto- socialist .
" This Robin is no socialist bandit practicing freelance wealth redistribution , but rather a manly libertarian rebel striking out against high taxes and a big government scheme to trample the ancient liberties of property owners and provincial nobles .
Do n’t tread on him ! "
In contrast to O'Sullivan 's analysis , Scott stops short at declaring Robin Hood an avatar for the Tea Party movement .
" So is ' Robin Hood ' one big medieval tea party ?
Kind of , though that description makes the movie sound both more fun and more provocative than it actually is .
The film ’s politics , in any case , are more implicit than overt , so that the filmmakers can plausibly deny any particular topical agenda , " notes Scott .
A Symbol of Equality , Socialist or Not The Boston Globe 's Ethan Gilsdorf ponders the modern appeal of the Robin Hood legend , made salient by " this hope for a savior to restore the balance of power . "
" Even today , he remains a powerful symbol against tyranny , injustice , and over - taxation , " reflects Gilsdorf , albeit hesitantly .
" Egalitarian . . . or socialist ?
If you believe in redistributing the wealth a little , Obama - robin is a force for good ; for those who see this nation ’s economic policies as troubling , not so much . "
Regardless of Robin Hood 's leanings , the political undertones are bound to generate interest .
" In these disillusioned days of robber barons ... it makes sense that , in Ridley Scott ’s newest of Hoods , Crowe does n’t simply steal from the rich and give to the poor .
...
Taking the law into his own hands , he becomes a freedom fighter and the ruling class does n’t like it . "
A Socialist for All Seasons Zachary Pincus - Roth at Slate argues that Robin Hood 's mantra of " rob from the rich and give to the poor " reflects an ingrown human instinct .
" While Robin Hood 's ideals are politically controversial , researchers in psychology and related fields are finding that humans seem inclined to engage in Robin Hood - like thinking ... "
Pincus - Roth points to a growing body of literature supporting his thesis that Robin Hood 's socialist overtones are simply a manifestation of human evolution .
" Everyone agrees that there should be some redistribution , but we disagree on how it should be done , " Fowler says .
" Republicans trust the market more .
Democrats trust the government a little bit more . "
This distinction may reveal why Robin Hood 's appeal cuts across party lines :
He has liberal goals but accomplishes them with conservative methods .
Instead of operating within the government , he 's against it , creating clever plots to foil a villainous bureaucrat , the Sheriff of Nottingham .
...
Now that sounds like a summer movie hero .

Press Conference for “ Schmucks ”
For those of us who enjoy contemplating the historical and political currents that run through film history , it ’s tempting to look at the latest comedy from director Jay Roach ( “ Austin Powers , ” “ Meet the Parents , ” “ Recount ” ) as a possible reflection of American discomfort at the brutal nature of business and the growing disparities between the wealthy and the increasingly lumpen middle - class .
However , when you ’re talking about a movie that ends with a confrontation between a good idiot ( Steve Carell ) who designs amazing dioramas using dead mice and an evil idiot ( Zach Galifianakis ) with the power of mind control , but only over other idiots , that may be taking things a little seriously .
Opening this Friday , “ Dinner for Schmucks ” borrows its premise and some of its plot from Frances Veber ’s 1998 “ The Dinner Game . ”
Paul Rudd co-stars as Barry , a rising L.A. executive who finds that entering his company ’s upper echelon will mean participating in a competitive Dinner for Winners .
All the guests are to bring an extraordinary person who has been unrecognized by society — in other words , a dithering idiot .
The winner of the nasty game is the one whose guest is the most amusingly stupid .
Barry is initially appalled by the idea and assures Julie ( Stephanie Szostak ) , his horrified art curator girlfriend , he ’ll have nothing to do with it .
On the other hand , he needs to pay for his Porsche and his absurdly large apartment at West Hollywood ’s Sunset Tower Hotel ( in real life , you ’d need a billionaire ’s wealth to afford that ) .
It ’s a choice between being nice and being unemployed and in debt .
Then the fates seem to reward him when , driving through a quainted - up version of Westwood Village , he nearly runs over Tim Wagner ( Carell ) , a clueless IRS employee and ultra-naive artist committed to his “ mousterpieces . ”
Wagner , of course , turns out to be a goodhearted type whose attempts to help his new friend backfire in increasingly absurd ways .
Fortunately , most of them are funny , particularly thanks to some outstanding and often completely unhinged supporting performances from Zach Galifianakis and Jemaine Clement of “ Flight of the Conchords ” as an absurdly pretentious and untalented , but hugely successful , artist on the make for Barry ’s increasingly angry girlfriend and all other attractive women on the planet .
“ Dinner for Schmucks ” is n’t going to electrify cinephiles or become a staple of screenwriting seminars , but a couple of weeks back it had proven itself to be a very effective laugh - getting machine at a West L.A. screening .
Therefore , full of a free breakfast , a selection of journos were in a pretty good mood for a morning press conference at the Beverly Hilton with a number of funny and / or talented people , including stars Carell and Rudd , supporting bad guys Bruce Greenwood ( “ Star Trek “ ) and Ron Livingston ( “ Office Space “ ) as well as director Roach and writers David Guion and Michael Handelman , who are about to become directors themselves with the film version of the BBC comedy , “ Cruise of the Gods . ”
The first question proved to be a starting point for some light shtick between Rudd and Carell , who have worked together previously to great comic effect in “ Anchorman ” and Carrel ’s breakthrough comedy , “ The 40 - Year - Old Virgin . ”
So , what was the most challenging scene in the film , Mr. Carell ?
“ We shot a scene where Paul had injured his back .
We shot it for about a day and a half , and I had to hug Paul , for a day and a half , ” said Carrel .
“ That ’s challenging for anyone , ” Rudd admitted .
“ And to lift him , ” Carell continued , “ because he was giving me nothing . ”
“ No , ” Rudd agreed .
“ The only way to sell it is to just go dead weight . ”
“ So , ” Carell agreed , “ that was probably the most physically challenging aspect of the movie .
Terrible , terrible answer .
Do n’t write that . ”
Perhaps feeling that it was maybe a little early yet for too much silliness , Rudd — who comes from a ‘ real ’ acting background but has an obvious gift for comedy — gave a serious answer .
“ It ’s always challenging .
Everything you ever work on is challenging .
Just to show up and try be real and not look as if I ’m playing at anything .
Just try and be the character .
It ’s always work . ”
So , would Paul care to elaborate on the challenges of being a straight man while Carell is having all the “ fun ” in a movie like “ Schmucks ” ?
“ It ’s a challenge not to ruin the take by laughing .
I did n’t rise to that challenge on many occasions …
It ’s weird , my definitions of ‘ comedy ’ and ‘ drama ’ or ‘ straight man , ’ all that kind of stuff , they ’re all blurry for me .
I do n’t really think of it in those terms , ” he said , talking about how the events of the film forced him to be “ reactive ” which he said can be not so easy to sustain for the course of an entire feature film .
He likes to think “ not so much in terms of jokes , ” but more in terms of the character , Rudd said .
Then , the same questioner noticed some new facial hair on Rudd .
“ What ’s with the beard ? ”
“ I ’m getting ready to start a movie on Monday . ”
“ That ’s a lie , ” Carell interjected .
“ He ’s just doing it for fun . ”
Rudd quickly changed his story .
“ I came in this morning at about 6:00 A.M. and applied it with spirit gum and hair from my back .
It took about an hour .
And it ’s like , what ’s going to be fun to wear in New York City summer heat ? ”
The next questioner asked if perhaps the issue of ruining takes might have arisen during Jemaine Clement ’s hilarious straight faced bits .
She wondered if the wacky but extremely self - serious character was inspired by anyone in real life .
“ It is hard , Jemaine cracks me up .
He got these guys laughing a little bit too , ” said Roach .
“ We based the character a little bit on Matthew Barney [ of the epic - length , famously disturbing “ Cremaster ” art film cycle ] and a little bit on Peter Beard and a little bit the guy from Ashes and Snow [ Gregory Colbert ] .
We mostly wanted to have a character who is so convinced not only that he was an artist in the most important sense of the word , but he was the best thing that ever happened to art and , really , the world …
And also that he had to be convincing as a rival for Paul ’s character ’s girlfriend .
Despite Jemaine ’s character and vibe that he portrays on the ‘ Conchords , ’ I always thought that he was kind of hunky . ”
What did the actors think about working with Clement ?
Had they ever bumped into him previously ?
“ I ’d never met him before , ” said Carell .
“ He ’s fantastic .
He ’s a really good improviser in the sense that you never feel him going for a joke .
You never get a sense that he ’s waiting for his turn to say something or do something funny .
He ’s really just a part of the scene and always ends up making it better .
He ’s also a really fine actor .
He committed to that character so completely .
There was a sense of calmness about him and a sense of inner dignity to the character in the face of its absurdity which I just loved .
He was a hard person to work with and not ruin takes because he ’s so , so good . ”
Rudd chimed in .
“ It ’s funny in that it seems like it ’s a character that ’s broad in that his look is very defined .
His style and vocation is such a specific thing , but he ’s so good with subtlety .
There were many , many moments when he would just kind of say something that was n’t a joke but would just really make me laugh , ” Rudd said .
As an example , he referred to a line in the film when , for reasons too complicated or too silly to explain , his character is alleged to have gonorrhea and his utterly straightforward response , “ I do n’t have gonorrhea , ” struck Rudd as funny on the set .
( It is in the movie , as well . ) .
“ He ’s weirdly soft - spoken about it .
He ’s good in everything . ”
Then came the inevitable question for the actors about what attracted them to the project .
( Just once , I would like to hear .
“ I needed the money .
No , I ’m not kidding .
I need cash . ”
Most actors are n’t rich . )
Carell led the charge on this one .
“ Working with Jay and working with Paul , those were enormous factors for me .
I liked the storyline too .
I thought it was funny .
It was a little weird .
It had a heart to it .
And I tend to like things that have a gray area to them .
Like the character that Paul plays ; here ’s a guy who ’s very conflicted .
He ’s not a bad guy but he ’s at a moral impasse in his life .
.. It actually said something very kind , ultimately . ”
Rudd did n’t disagree .
“ Yeah , and the people involved .
I thought the script was really funny .
That was really it .
It was kind of a no - brainer .
I was so excited to get offered the part . ”
Then , finally , the really fine and underrated , and usually non-comic , actor Bruce Greenwood spoke .
Greenwood is having a career renaissance these days and is probably best known to contemporary audiences as Christopher Pike in the J.J. Abram ’s “ Star Trek ” reboot .
He has , however , been a busy and highly acclaimed working actor since the 1980s , notably delivering a truly world - class performance as a tax accountant dealing with an immense personal tragedy in Atom Egoyan , “ Exotica . ”
He was also remarkably focused and memorable in David Milch ’s misfired “ John from Cincinnati . ”
“ For me it was working with Jay and Paul and Steve , ” Greenwood said , praising the script and the approach .
“ When you have this premise of making fun of people , it has a chance of being mean - spirited [ but ] it has this big heart … that appealed to me on an emotional level as well . ”
Ron Livingston , whose inoffensive looks and knack for putting on a vaguely insincere demeanor has put him in numerous regular guy and sleazy business guy parts , took a page from the Ringo Starr playbook .
“ I ’m just happy to be here . ”
After the laugh subsided Livingston decided to elaborate .
“ I think sometimes you have to try to imagine in your head what it ’s going to look like .
The great thing about this one was we ’ve actually had a chance to see Steve and Paul work together [ before ] and it ’s brilliant , ” Livingston said .
“ There ’s a comfort level there and a playfulness …
I think Jay does a great job having character comedy meet physical comedy in a way that you do n’t really give up one to jump into the other .
I was just thrilled , actually , to be along for the ride . ”
Then a journalist from Asia brought up the topic of both Steve Carell ’s Emmy nomination and his recently announced decision to leave “ The Office ” once his contract expires at the end of the upcoming seventh season .
“ I ’ll let Jay [ Roach ] take this one , ” Carell joked , but he eventually got around to the topic .
His response , while sincere , wo n’t win any prizes for originality .
“ I always wanted to honor my contract and I felt like now is a good time for the character to move on and for me to move on personally .
I want to spend more time with my wife and kids .
That ’s really the impetus behind that decision there . ”
Paul Rudd , however , had the real bombshell .
“ And Steve will be playing for the Miami Heat next year . ”
( Yes , the press conference was the morning after LeBron James ’ announcement . )
“ Very exciting , ” Carell added .
“ Scranton is burning my Jersey . ”
Then , someone brought up theword “ schmuck . ”
Now , for those of you who ’ve only heard the world colloquially and assume it means nothing more than “ idiot ” or “ fool , ” the Yiddish word “ schmuck ” is the fairly precise Yiddish equivalent to “ dick ” in all its many meanings , other than as a nickname for “ Richard . ”
It is also fair to add that the word actually derives from the German word for “ jewel ” — as in “ family jewels ” — and that Yiddish is very nearly a dead language , killed by the decision to make Hebrew Israel ’s national language , and it ’s been many decades since it ’s been used in a sexual context by many people .
A writer from a prominent Jewish publication , therefore , asked about how it ended up in the title .
Jay Roach took on the question .
“ The script was called that when it was first sent to me .
For me , it ’s kind of an ideal word for what the story is about .
In modern usage it has two meanings .
Like ‘ do n’t be a schmuck ’ can mean ‘ do n’t be a jerk , ’ which is what Paul Rudd ’s character is going through and ‘ do n’t be an idiot ’ which is what you think Steve Carrel ’s character is going through …
To me , it both is a funny word to say but it also resonated [ with ] what the two characters were about . ”
The questioner responded that the offense some people might be taking was more of a generational thing , and asked if anyone involved with the film had received negative feedback from elderly Jewish relatives .
Paul Rudd seemed to think the question was intended strictly for him .
“ Go right to the Jew — you know , I was in schul on Saturday , and … ” joked America ’s reigning movie Jewish American Prince .
“ No , my grandfather used to call me a ‘ schmuck ’ all the time , ” Rudd said .
After some difficulty to transcribe / describe silliness , Rudd continued .
“ I remember growing up , I ’d say , ‘ Oh , God , “ putz ” is such a funny word . ’…
I always thought like , ‘ Oh , “ putz ” is an idiot .
And I remember my dad saying , ‘ Well , you know , actually a putz is a penis ’ — what ’s up with the all words by the way , for ‘ penis ’ — it always took on , I think , not so much a specificity but general ‘ oh , you ’re being an idiot . ’…
I know that there are some people , I read it too , that might take offense to the fact that it ’s ‘ Dinner for Schmucks . ’
It would n’t have even crossed my mind . ”
“ Also , ‘ Dinner for Wieners ’ did n’t test well , ’ added Ron Livingston .
Following a brief discussion of Rudd ’s charter membership in the Judd Apatow stock company and how Seth Rogen had dubbed it “ the Jew - Tang Clan , ” it was on to less Hebraic matters .
In particular , with Steve Carrel ’s involvement in “ The Office ” winding down , would he be taking on projects that he was more directly involved with himself ?
“ I just completed a movie with Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore , that ’s the first movie my production company ’s producing .
That ’ll come out sometime next year , ” said Carrel .
“ I hope that I ’m able to start writing again once my tenure at ‘ The Office ’ is done . ”
The next question was on the topic of Zach Galifianakis ’s remarkable performance as Carrel ’s coworker and nemesis .
The questioner said he felt “ it looked like Marlon Brando and Andy Kaufman going at it . ”
“ Marlon Brando and Andy Kaufman ” ?
Carell interrupted .
“ I ’m trying to figure out who ’s who …
Now I ca n’t get that combination out of my head .
I want to see that movie , ” Carell added , but then actually addressed the question about the hard to spell / pronounce Mr. G .
“ He is intensely funny and his brain works a different way than most people , and I think that ’s part of what makes him so great .
[ It ’s ] that his thought processes are very unique to him .
He , too , I think is a really good actor because he comes in and he enters a scene as a character and he takes in his environment .
He ’s really committed to the character and not just to being funny or to think of funny things to say .
Everything he says comes from within his character …
He was really a joy to improvise with and act opposite . ”
The writer then wanted to clarify that Carell was still going to be making movies , and not “ going to work in his sister ’s general store , ” after finishing ‘ The Office . ' ”
“ I ’ll only make ‘ Office ’ movies , ” Carell joked .
Moving on , the next topic was the similarities and differences between “ Dinner for Schmucks ” and the more theatrical French film “ The Dinner Game , ” adapted by director Frances Veber from his own play .
Jay Roach was quick to praise the prior film which , unlike “ Schmucks , ” does not include an actual dinner .
“ It ’s more ‘ inspired by ’ than ‘ based on ’ but it was a great hook …
Frances is like the Mike Nichols of France .
I ’m sure he ’d rather just be the Frances of France .
He writes great farce , ‘ La Cage Aux Folles , ” “ La Valise ” and all these films .
He ’s a hero of mine and I felt lucky to get to be able to work on a story of his . ”
And then the radio interviewer next to me was astute enough to address a question to Bruce Greenwood , asking him about the differences between doing a broad comedy like “ Schmucks ” as opposed to the sometimes deadly serious films he ’s been best known for until recently .
“ Not that there were n’t some thigh - slappers in ‘ Exotica , ' ” he added .
“ But they were naked thighs , ” Greenwood interjected , commenting on Atom Egoyan ’s tragedy - laced 1994 drama set in a Toronto strip club .
As for doing this kind of broad comedy , he apparently had a fairly hard time at first .
“ I spent the whole first day just weeping into my handkerchief .
I just could n’t stop laughing …
vIt was great fun to be around . ”
But is the actor ’s cliche that “ dying is easy but comedy is hard ” true ?
“ Yeah .
I ’m used to doing stuff where you say what ’s in the script , ” said Greenwood , getting a laugh .
“ The first couple of days I just watched these guys with my jaw on the floor and then Jay says , just go at it .
See what happens .
It was a lot of fun . ”
A discussion with the writers followed regarding a key difference between the lead character in “ The Dinner Game , ” who starts out the film as fairly unsympathetic , and Paul Rudd ’s more conflicted character , who desperately wants money and success but who is almost as appalled as he should be by the “ Dinner for Winners . ”
Was it perhaps a studio decision to please the presumably more darkness - averse American audience ?
The answer , we were told , was not really — at least not consciously .
“ It seemed a little bit more interesting to us if you could see both sides of his character , and if he at the start of the film was a little bit at war with himself , ” said Michael Handelman .
“ In the original , that character very much is sort of a jaded guy who you feel like has lived a sinful existence for a very long time .
There ’s something about Paul being a younger guy where we wanted to deal with someone who was at a turning point in his life , ” said David Guion .
“ Paul is really at a turning point in his life , ” kidded writer Handelman .
“ We do n’t know if the good or the bad Paul is going to win . ”
“ Bad Paul , ” said Paul Rudd .
And then it was my turn to ask a question .
Correctly noting that the movie involves an awful lot of extremely well - off characters but wrongly noting that the poorest person in the film drove a Porsche — I should have said the poorest male person not bearing a special invitation to the “ Dinner for Winners ” —
I wondered how much our present economic morass was weighing on the minds of the creators .
“ We definitely thought that it was opportune , ” said writer Handelman , “ to have them working at a hedge fund or a private equity [ firm ] ”
“ We actually talked to a number of people at hedge funds when we were writing the thing , ” Guion added .
“ They were all extremely concerned that this would cast people in the financial sector in a negative light .
That would be the end of it for them , ” he said to some laughter .
Handelman chimed in , saying that would be doubly true if word got out that , “ on top of everything else , [ they ] played games likes this . ”
Then , I noted a scene in which Zach Galifianakis , as he ’s practicing mind control over Carrel , briefly turns a bright beet red , returning to semi-normal right before our eyes .
Was that as real as it looked ?
“ That was all Zach , ” said Jay Roach .
“ That is just him losing himself in his belief in his ability to control somebody ’s mind and putting every aspect of himself into it .
The funny thing about that is when we sent it to the lab , and I just got involved in the color timing , they tried to time it out , they thought it was a mistake .
So , I got it back and I said ‘ What happened ? ’ they said , ‘ We wanted it to match . ’
I said , ‘ No , no , no , that was real . ’
There ’s no digital effect .
That is all just the very blood of Zach Galifianakis rushing to his face to show itself . ”
The next questioner asked Steve Carell whether he got any “ secret pleasure ” from working with the stuffed mice and the amazing and rather beautiful “ mousterpieces ” created by his character ( actually , veteran animators and artists , the Chiodo Brothers ) which may be the single best aspect of “ Dinner for Schmucks . ”
“ Not so secret .
I was astounded by the detail in those mice dioramas , ” Carell said .
“ The man hours [ and ] the attention to detail and the commitment to those dioramas , they were astounding .
I think honestly things like that really help you with a character .
Because , to sit in a room with all of those and look at how meticulously they ’ve been put together really informs the characters a lot .
It really tells you a lot about who this guy is … I was very thankful and grateful to [ the Chiodos ] for how exquisite those dioramas were . ”
Did he ever find himself playing with them or dressing them in his spare time ?
“ I ’d rather not go into the details of that , ” Carrell said .
“ I do hope , at some point , to own one for my house .
I do n’t know whether it ’s the Ben Franklin or the Evel Knievel but I would love to have a mouse diorama in my own home to display proudly . ”
Then another questioner asked Paul Rudd about a scene requiring him to literally speak into actress Lucy Punch ’s crotch , playing an inordinately determined past “ Fatal Attraction ” - style hook - up for his character .
“ Into a cell phone ?
Speaking into a woman ’s crotch ?
You ’re asking me ? ” queried a concerned looking Rudd .
“ She ’s trying to get the first line of her story , ” Carell sagely commented .
“ I did n’t go for the bait with dressing the mice . ”
Getting a bit more sincere , Rudd said “ I was very nervous and uncomfortable …
I actually turned the color of Zach Galifianakis . ”
Shifting gears , what did the cast think of “ The Dinner Game ” as it compared to “ Dinner for Schmucks ” ?
“ Really , I approached this the same way I approached ‘ The Office , ” said Steve Carell .
“ I still have n’t seen the original ‘ Office ’ because I did n’t want to do an impersonation of Ricky Gervais .
I still have n’t seen the French film because I did n’t want to have that inform what I was going to do with this one .
I tried to look at it as a blank slate .
I ’d like to see it now that the work is done .
I ’ve heard only great things . ”
“ To prepare for this , ” said Paul Rudd , “ I watched the British ‘ Office . ' ”
Then came the obligatory praise for the director who , as per Paul Rudd , really does come across like “ a self - effacing guy ” despite being married for quite some time now to Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles .
“ My wife ’s really into Paul , ” Roach added .
Seeing as “ Dinner for Schmucks ” is a remake , someone wondered how would Roach and company feel about having one of their movies remade ?
“ I would love to see a remake of ‘ Austin Powers . ’
Especially in a completely different culture .
The Brazilian version of ‘ Austin Powers ’ or the Ukrainian version would be [ great ] .
I would be so flattered if someone thought to do that . ”
“ I ’ve had some I ’d like to remake ” said Bruce Greenwood , the highly experienced actor whose diverse credits include 1986 ’s “ The Malibu Bikini Shop . ”
Did anyone in the cast have the kind of unusual or extraordinary hidden talents that might get them invited to the Dinners for Winners .?
Carell admitting to playing two very “ unsexy ” instruments — the baritone horn , a sort of “ mini- tuba , ” and the fife .
Bruce Greenwood discussed his bowl - making hobby , which he said was not a joke , and Ron Livingston admitted to juggling “ a little . ”
Paul Rudd demonstrated that he can do a strange but hard to describe thing with his tongue .
Then Jay Roach was asked about , wait for it , the state of comedy today and how it ’s changed , and whether he felt a need for his comedies to have “ morals . ”
“ I do n’t know how much comedy ’s changed .
I grew up watching Woody Allen films .
‘ Annie Hall ’ sort of convinced me to go to film school .
I remember how that film … how funny it was , obviously , but how it made comedy as a way of coping with heartache , ” Roach said .
“ I think that ’s what attracted me to this story .
It ’s about a character who has coped with his own pain and separation from his wife , in a very unusual way , through his mice [ dioramas ] …
It was n’t so much meant to be a film with a moral as much as a film where you enjoyed watching how one person ’s approach to life , which might seem off - center , odd , or idiotic , could actually inspire another person to get more in touch with their better selves .
But [ that ’s ] mostly just because the characters were struggling to find a way to be , in a funny way . ”
The pre-tournament favourites versus the most impressive team in the competition so far .
A repeat of the 2008 European Championships final it may be , but this is completely different contest .
For a start , David Villa and Mesut Ozil – the two star men – were not involved two years ago .
Of the Germans , only Miroslav Klose , Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski remain in the same positions from that final , whilst Spain will start with a different formation to in 2008 , even the side contains a number of the same players .
Both sides have one selection dilemma ahead .
Germany are without Thomas Mueller , suspended ( because of the ludicrous rule that two minor offences in 450 minutes of football means a player missing a World Cup semi- final ) .
Joachim Loew has four options for replacing him – Raphael Honigstein believes the most likely starter is Toni Kroos , another exciting young creative player .
He spent last season playing on the left for Bayer Leverkusen , but is equally comfortable on the right ( or in the centre ) .
Vicente del Bosque does n’t have any suspensions – Spain have only picked up three bookings in the tournament – but he does have a problem with Fernando Torres .
The Liverpool striker has n’t looked fit so far , and there is speculation that del Bosque has finally lost faith in him , and will instead turn to David Silva , with Villa pushing into Torres ’ central striking position .
This would n’t require a great shift in the way Spain play – in fact , it would return them to their starting line - up against Switzerland in their opening game .
That ’s the only game Spain have n’t won so far , however , and if it is to be Silva and Andres Iniesta on the flanks , there must be more natural width – playing centrally is clearly a deliberate tactic , but it makes Spain ’s build - up play so simple and predictable .
It ’s more likely that del Bosque will give Torres one more chance , however .
Silva has n’t been particularly impressive himself , Cesc Fabregas coming into midfield does n’t give the team any more width , whilst Fernando Llorente and Pedro seem to be seen as impact players .
After what happened in 2008 , the German defenders wo n’t be too enthusiastic at facing Torres again , even if he is n’t quite on top form .
So where will the game be won and lost ?
The two formations are similar , assuming the predicted line - ups are correct .
Both broadly 4 - 2 - 3 - 1s , both with very direct attacking players on the left combined with a player wanting to come inside on the right , both with the right - back more adventurous than the left - back , both with three central midfielders who all have the ability to create .
The battle in the left - wing / right - back areas are particularly exciting .
Podolski and Villa do n’t want to defend , whilst Philip Lahm and Sergio Ramos do n’t want to be constrained to purely defensive jobs , as both are forced to provide the width attacking from the winger ahead of them .
The onus is on the two full - backs – they need to be brave and get themselves forward – they do , after all , have the safety net of one spare centre - back behind them .
More likely , though , the game will be won in midfield .
There is no other match - up in this tournament that would feature such composed , intelligent footballers in the midfield .
In terms of ball retention , Sergio Busquets , Xavi , Andres Iniesta and Xabi Alonso are near - unbeatable , but Germany ’s midfield trio have been even more impressive in this tournament .
Loew has a decision to make about pressing .
Should he instruct his team to sit relatively deep , and focus on not allowing Xavi and Iniesta time on the ball ( as Switzerland did ) , press higher up and disrupt the passing game of Busquets and Alonso ( as Paraguay did ) , or press all over the pitch ( as Chile did ) ?
Even with Germany ’s technical proficiency , it would be a surprise if Spain did n’t dominate possession , and so how Germany break up their attacks is particularly important .
Pressing is also a key factor in terms of del Bosque ’s tactics , but a more immediate problem is how to deal with Mesut Oezil .
He plays very high up the pitch , making it difficult for a holding midfielder to track him , but then treating him as a withdrawn forward ( and therefore the domain of the centre - backs ) gives him space between the lines .
Sergio Busquets has had a good tournament and is possibly the key player in that sense .
But the most important player is David Villa .
Spain are far from a one - man team , but when you consider that of Spain ’s six goals in the tournament , Villa has scored five and assisted the other , stopping him is clearly the most crucial feature of the game for Germany .
This has the potential to be a classic .

Report : Army secretly dumped chemicals offshore By John M.R. Bull , The ( Newport News , Va. ) Daily Press via AP NEWPORT NEWS , Va . 
The Army secretly dumped 64 million pounds of nerve and mustard agents into the ocean , along with 400,000 chemical - filled bombs , land mines and rockets — either tossed overboard or packed into the holds of scuttled vessels , according to an investigation by The ( Newport News , Va. ) Daily Press .
A forklift shovels one - ton containers of mustard gas over the side of a barge somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean in 1964 .
U.S. Army via AP
" We do not claim to know where they all are , " said William Brankowitz , a deputy project manager in the Army Chemical Materials Agency and a leading authority on the Army 's chemical weapons dumping .
" We do n't want to be cavalier at all and say this stuff was exposed to water and is OK .
It can last for a very , very long time . "
The weapons of mass destruction may still be deadly , and were dumped along with more than 500 tons of radioactive waste from World War II until 1970 , after which Congress and international treaty banned the practice .
The newspaper 's investigation also found : •
The chemical weapons were dumped in at least 26 locations off the coast of 11 states — six East Coast states , two on the Gulf Coast , California , Hawaii and Alaska .
Few , if any , state officials have been informed of their existence .
Five dumpsites are off the coast of Virginia .
•
The Army dumped much of its overseas World War II stockpiles off the coast of 16 other countries .
Hundreds of fishermen have been injured over the years from them .
•
The ocean - dumped chemical agents could pose hazards for generations .
The Army has examined only a few of its dump zones and none in the past 30 years .
•
The Army can't say exactly where all the weapons were dumped off the U.S. coast because records are sketchy , missing or were destroyed .
Several dumpsites are within sight of land .
•
More dump sites likely exist .
The Army has n't reviewed World War I - era records , when ocean dumping of chemical weapons was common .
A drop of nerve agent can kill within a minute .
When released in the ocean , it lasts up to six weeks , killing every organism it touches before breaking down into its non-lethal chemical components .
Mustard gas can be fatal .
When exposed to seawater , it forms a concentrated , encrusted gel that lasts for at least five years , rolling around on the ocean floor , killing or contaminating sea life .
The sea - dumped chemical weapons might be slowly leaking from decades of saltwater corrosion , resulting in a time - delayed release of deadly chemicals over the next 100 years and an unforeseeable environmental effect .
Steel corrodes at different rates , depending on the water depth , ocean temperature and thickness of the shells .
U.S. Army via AP
A barge piled high with one - ton steel containers of mustard gas at Sunny Point Naval pier in S.C. , to be thrown into the ocean in the 1940s and 1950s .
That was the conclusion of Norwegian scientists who in 2002 examined chemical weapons dumped off Norway after World War II by the U.S. and British militaries .
" It 's a disaster looming — a time bomb , say , " said Gert Harigel , a well - respected physicist in Geneva who 's been active in international chemical weapons issues .
" The scientific community knows very little about it .
It scares me a lot . "
While it seems unlikely that the weapons will begin to wash up on the U.S. shore , a clam trawler off New Jersey pulled up a mustard - gas - filled artillery shell last summer .
Three bomb disposal experts from Dover Air Force Base , Del. , were injured dismantling it , and one was hospitalized with large , pus -filled blisters .
The shell was discovered in a residential driveway in Delaware , having survived intact being dredged up and put through a crusher to create cheap clamshell driveway fill sold throughout the Delmarva Peninsula .
" The perception at the time was the ocean is vast — it would absorb it , " said Craig Williams , director of the Chemical Weapons Working Group in Kentucky , a grass - roots citizens group .
" Certainly , it is insane in retrospect they would do it .
It would be inevitable , I assume , all of this will be released into the ocean at some point or another . "
Boaters , divers , fishermen and commercial seafood trawlers have no way to steer clear of the dumpsites because the Army has put only one of its 26 known chemical weapons dumps on nautical charts .
And the federal agency in charge of undersea cable - laying operations , as well as gas and oil ventures , has only a vague idea of where chemical weapons were thrown into the ocean , said spokes - man Gary Strasburg .
That agency , the Minerals Management Service , knows only what the Army has revealed to that agency : that chemical weapons were dumped at sea and that some are in the Gulf of Mexico and off South Carolina , agency records show .
One marine mammal specialist thinks " it is a very good possibility " that leaking chemical weapons killed hundreds of dolphins in 1987 .
" You 'd see the photos and you 'd say , ' Man , this animal was burned by something , ' " said Bob Schoelkopf , director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine , N.J. " It 'd be nice to see the Army go down there and investigate , but nobody wants to open that book , it seems . "

People in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa will have to register their names if they want to make photocopies .
City shopkeepers say the authorities are particularly concerned about material printed in Tibetan .
This appears to be an attempt to prevent ordinary people from printing political pamphlets and other documents .
It suggests the security forces still have a tight grip on the city , two years after serious riots .
Individuals wanting to photocopy documents will have to show their ID cards and have the information recorded .
Companies will have to register their names and addresses , the number of copies they want and provide the name of the manager in charge of the work .
The police say they will carry out checks and punish any shop that does not abide by the new regulation .
' Aimed at criminals '
Photocopying outlets in Lhasa told the BBC that the rule is primarily aimed at the Tibetan language .
One shopkeeper said she would not now make copies of documents in Tibetan without police approval first .
Material printed in Chinese does not seem to be too much of a problem .
The authorities say the change is aimed at stopping criminals carrying out illegal activities .
But the suspicion is that it is directed at those who might want to print political pamphlets critical of the Chinese government .
It suggests that more than two years after a major outbreak of unrest in Tibetan areas , security is still tight in Lhasa .

A useful presentation for all those who continue to be bullish despite that fact that the double dip has officially begun .
In one of the better compendiums of bearish data , oddly enough coming from Goldman 's Jan Hatzius , the chief economist summarizes all the adverse trends that continue to not be priced into stocks .
He notes that while the inventory cycle has boosted growth , this artificial rise is now losing steam .
Key headwinds facing the economy are that fiscal policy , which has been expansionary , has now become to restrictive ; that there has been no overshoot in layoffs for a mean reversion expectation ; that the labor market multiplier is very much limited ; that while capital spending is just modestly above replacement levels , the large output gap suggests spending should be subdued ; the housing overhang is still huge and house prices have further to fall ; that there are risks to US from European crisis ; that inflation is dropping ( and non-existent ) even as utilization is low everywhere , which creates a major deflation risk ; that the scary budget deficit will destroy any hope for future fiscal stimulus as public debt is surging out of control ; lastly , with Taylor - implied Fed rates expected to be negative , the Fed 's monetary policy arsenal is non-existent .
All this in 18 pretty charts .

“ There ’s been times I ’ve had to make myself stop looking for jobs because it was driving me nuts , ” said Ms. Sadler , who admitted that she had contemplated suicide .
Every day has become a tense scramble , highlighting just how thin the governmental safety net for the jobless becomes beyond unemployment benefits .
After Ms. Sadler was cut off from jobless benefits , she qualified for $ 200 a month in food stamps , but food stamps do not pay her bills , nor do they cover other necessities .
She recently wrote to Tom ’s of Maine , because she uses the company ’s toothpaste , mouthwash and deodorant , asking whether it might be able to donate some products to her .
But she was informed that the company usually gives only to nonprofit organizations .
Ms. Sadler lives alone here in this small town in the northern part of the state , where Amish are sometimes spotted heading down the main road with horse and buggy .
She has only her 2 - year - old dog , Tootie - muffin , for company .
Before she lost her job , she had enrolled in community college to study medical billing and coding .
She finished the program in May , but most of the medical billing jobs she has applied for require experience .
The framed certificate , and another one for data entry , on her bedroom wall are just decorations at this point .
How she landed in this predicament is a product of both mistakes she made and forces beyond her control .
She dropped out of high school and had her daughter , Chastity , at age 15 .
She started working in factories soon after and eventually earned her G.E.D .
She had managed to scratch out a relatively comfortable life before she lost her job , making $ 14.65 an hour at Vuteq , in Georgetown , Ky. , a company that makes sun roofs and windshields for Toyota .
But she never accumulated much savings , besides $ 3,000 she had socked away in a 401 ( k ) account , which she quickly ran through .
She has always had a thing for Ford Mustangs and bought a used red one in 2006 that she now admits was a bad decision .
Housing will remain stagnate from 2010 to 2020 due to demographic shifts , higher mortgage rates , and shifting consumer taste in real estate

The dynamics for housing moving forward point to a very bleak future and a potential lost decade yet again from 2010 to 2020 .
Housing has a treacherous path moving forward and deep down demographic shifts will keep a lid on any significant housing appreciation moving forward .
The economy is in the process of deleveraging from a market highly dependent on real estate .
Wall Street and the government are doing everything they can to bring back the economy of yesterday but have had little success .
This recession has shrunk the middle class so those looking to buy homes have declined simply because many can no longer afford to purchase a home even at today ’s lower prices .
Focusing on housing first was a big expensive policy mistake where we should have focused on creating sustainable jobs .
The market is slowly shifting to a new housing paradigm .
Family growth rates , employment trends , baby boomers , and wages will all keep a lid on housing prices moving forward .
First we should break down the entire housing market : Source : Census The U.S. has a large number of homeowners .
A total of 75 million Americans can lay the claim to owning their home .
23 million of this group ( 31 percent ) actually owns their homes outright with no mortgage .
Of course not having a mortgage does not mean that these homeowners have no housing associated cost .
They still need to pay yearly property taxes , insurance , and all the cost in maintaining a home .
Another 37 million American households rent .
These are the basic dynamics of the housing market .
Of those homeowners with a mortgage , 7.2 million ( 14 % ) are in foreclosure or 30 + days late on their mortgage .
This practically guarantees a few years of cheaper housing hitting the market in a steady trickle .
This puts a herculean hold on any significant home building going forward .
From the recent Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Report , we find that current outstanding mortgage debt is $ 10.334 trillion .
We have to break out the renters and the homeowners with no mortgage and find that the average mortgage debt for homeowners is : $ 10.334 trillion / 51.575 million mortgaged households = $ 200,374 The current median home price comes in at approximately $ 170,000 .
Now some would argue that housing will regain traction and go on to rising to new levels .
Yet this assumption assumes that middle class wages will be growing moving forward .
If we look closely at the data the only real winner so far in this economic crisis is Wall Street but average Americans have seen very little benefit from the current bailout measures .
Now those with big investment bank salaries can afford their piece of prime real estate in Manhattan or the Hamptons but this does not make up the bulk of the housing market .
The bulk of the housing market is highly dependent on how middle class Americans are doing .
If we look at the current unemployment levels by age group , we see that those in the household forming age ranges or those entering into these categories , are taking on the brunt of this recession :
You can see that up to age 34 , the unemployment rate is trending much higher than the total national average .
These are prime age groups for forming households and if a family is not feeling safe financially , they will delay on purchasing a home .
The middle class young family is also delaying on having children so the necessity for a bigger home is also being pushed out .
This demographic shift is happening at the same time that baby boomers start entering retirement age and many will want to downsize .
And many of these people have a buffer for equity to sell since they bought prior to the housing bubble .
Take for example data on current owner households : Moved in before 1989 : 20.5 % of all homeowners Moved in before 1999 : 40.9 % of all homeowners
It is highly likely that in this group , you have many baby boomers that will sell to downsize in the years coming forward and the current decline in prices will only cut into their equity but not put them underwater given the decade long bubble .
They purchased before that .
Those that moved in before 1989 will have a much larger cushion .
So there is a large group of people that will sell regardless of market trends because they will have to simply because of life changing events .
And then on the other hand we have the fact that one - third of homeowners in certain states are underwater on their mortgages .
Take for example California : California has a large renting population and most that own a home carry a mortgage ( 77 percent ) .
Of those that carry a mortgage a stunning one - third are underwater .
In other words 1.76 million mortgages in California are attached to homes that are worth less than the actual balance of the mortgage creating a large incentive to walk - away .
Many of these loans come from Alt - A paper and option ARMs .
These loans will impact the market at least until 2012 and hurt the state .
California is n’t immune and other states like Nevada , Florida , and Arizona have similar dynamics .
In fact , here is the amount of mortgage debt in a negative equity position according to a recent Deutsche Bank analysis : California : $ 969 billion Florida : $ 432 billion Arizona : $ 140 billion
The only way that things would improve for banks is if prices moved higher .
But how can prices move higher if middle class Americans are dealing with high unemployment and stagnant wages ?
The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury have really reached the end of options in terms of what they can do .
Even the 30 year fixed mortgage is at all time lows in the midst of all this turmoil :
The 40 year average for 30 year rates is closer to 9 percent .
Today it is under 5 percent .
That is unsustainable and as we move forward with insurmountable levels of national debt , the rate will have to rise .
I know this seems impossible for many but as we have seen with other debt ridden countries , the market can turn on like a tornado and quickly change the dynamics of the situation .
For the housing market , this will mean even more pressure to keep prices muted .
The only way home prices can rise in a healthy manner is if we start seeing wage inflation .
We saw some of this in the 1970s where wages went up in tandem with home prices .
In the last decade , wages moved sideways while home prices went into a bubble .
As far as the economy going forward , the big job sectors seem to be in low paying service sector jobs .
Certainly someone can purchase a house with these jobs but not at current prices even though they appear to be solid .
The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury have done everything to slam the dollar and create some level of inflation .
Yet other central banks are doing the same .
So what happens is easy money flows to Wall Street for gambling while the real economy stagnates .
It is hard for many to believe that we will have another lost decade in housing but there is little reason to believe that prices will soon start to outpace inflation .
In fact , in the last year or two we have been dealing more with aspects of deflation .
We need to keep an eye on the real value of home prices adjusting for inflation / deflation .
Four years of squatting
Today 's featured property is the worst example of squatting I have seen to date .
The property was purchased on 6/7/1999 for $ 348,500 .
The owners used a $ 260,000 first mortgage and an $ 88,500 down payment .
On 3/31/2003 they refinanced with a $ 369,000 first mortgage .
On 8/5/2003 they opened a $ 100,000 HELOC .
On 10/14/2005 the obtained a stand - alone second from a private party .
On 5/25/2006 they obtained a $ 57,000 HELOC .
Here is where the story gets wierd .
The began squatting shortly after getting the last HELOC .

The second mortgage holder finally foreclosed on 4/30/2010 for $ 445,274 .
At first glance it looks like they got a great deal , but unfortunately , the $ 369,000 first mortgage — which probably has not been paid since 2006 — is still there .
The balance on that mortgage probably exceeds $ 500,000 .
The second mortgage holder is trying to sell to recover what they can of the $ 445,274 they have in the property .
Based on the listing description , it appears they had to evict the squatting homeowners .
I guess 4 years of squatting was n't enough … .

Our Changing Paradigms :
OUR CHANGING PARADIGMS : Models of reality — as Sources of Conflict BY : Archbishop Lazar Puhalo Reality at all levels and in every dimension is a mystery .
I will not suggest that the world , which we experience with our own senses , is not reality ; nevertheless , what we perceive is the surface of reality , which is penetrated only with great effort over time .
The more deeply we penetrate into this perceived reality , the greater the mystery becomes .
It is my proposal to demonstrate that almost all the apparent conflicts between science and faith arise from models of reality and not from reality itself .
The resolution to such conflict may arise from a re-examination of the models of reality we hold , which are based on obsolete information .
The Church fathers should perhaps be given credit for having the integrity and intelligence to have restructured their understanding of the history , geography and the nature of the earth and the universe , if they had had access to the technology and information which is at hand in our century .
The holy fathers were open to the learning and experience of the world around them , and utilised that learning themselves .
There is every reason to surmise that they would utilise our own contemporary exploration and learning to reshape many of their own models of reality .
The reshaping of our models of reality does not contravene our basic dogmatic understandings about God as Creator and Redeemer .
In fact , the discoveries of the past century only open us up to greater wonder at the beauty of the universe , along with its fragility : this can open to us also a greater appreciation of the presence of God and His role in the sustenance of our universe .
We need not limit the role and plan of God by the boundaries of our own finite understanding and wisdom , but can open up our minds to the beauty , the vastness , the fragility and the dimensionality of the universe , as a way of increasing our faith and love - relationship with God .
When we become rigid and frozen in our models of reality , particularly when based in literalistic understandings of Scripture and the non-dogmatic statements of the holy fathers about science and history , then we deprive ourselves of reality itself , and close ourselves off from a more full discovery of God 's presence , even though He is " everywhere present and fills all things . "
***
Modern physics and cosmology have become " superstar " subjects .
There is , however , an admirable and dignified modesty among physicists who acknowledge that they offer us only models of reality , rather than reality itself .
When Nils Bohr said , " the purpose of science is not to know the essence of nature , but to discover what can be known about nature , " he reminded us that science is a method of exploration , not the final arbiter of facts and understanding .
Science is not an alternative to revelation .
This same dignified modesty is expressed in the Orthodox Christian concept of apophatic theology .
Apophatic theology also acknowledges that doctrinal and poetic formulations are secondary worlds , models .
They are more or less adequate in helping us give words to and have concepts for our encounter with ultimate reality .
Since no one can know or comprehend the essence of God , even the dogma of the Trinity must be understood as a secondary world , a conceptual framework of enormous importance and clarity that is the best we can do in the framing of language for the experience of the ineffable , but it is , nevertheless , a model of reality .
When we assume that we have a concrete definition of the Divine , we step onto the path of those who built the Tower of Babel .
We will examine later the problems created in Western Scholastic theology when philosophical theologians attempted to present such models as facts which are legally definable , adequate and comprehensible by reason .
In a similar context , physicist Werner Heisenberg says of quantum physics that we have no framework for correlating the mathematical symbols of it with the concepts of our human language , nor can we satisfactorily discuss atoms in normal language .
The evidence of reality upon which scientific exploration builds models of reality can only be expressed symbolically by a mathematical formalism , which might be the closest one can come to expressing a metaphor for the great mysteries that are encountered but not resolved .
In order to better understand the essence of this discussion , let us first explain the meaning of models of reality .
Perhaps the best way to do this is to look at history 's most famous clash between models of realities .
In the year 1500 , the general model of reality for our universe was neat , tidy , dogmatic - and completely wrong .
It was generally acknowledged that the earth was the centre of a harmonious system of concentric circles .
These circles , diaphanous crystal rings , were delineated by the heavenly bodies that rotated in perfect circles around the earth .
The sun rotated around the earth , as did everything in the universe .
There could be no essential change within the region of the harmonious spheres .
Earth did not move .
Both the greatest of the philosophers and Holy Scripture agreed : Earth does not move , and the sun rises and sets as it moves in a perfect circular orbit around the earth .
This system was not thought to be a model of reality .
It was held to be reality itself - reality so concrete that it could be a dogma of faith .
Then , however , an insignificant science - oriented monk somewhere in north central Europe had the outrageous temerity to offer a radical revision to this venerable model .
Not only is the earth not stationary , he asserted , not only does it , like the other planets , rotate around the sun , but their orbits are not perfect circles .
Father Nicholas Copernicus had the good fortune to live beyond the reach of the Inquisition , but his writings were received with sufficient outrage , and suppressed .
When , however , Galileo pointed his crude telescope toward the heavens , the old model of reality about the universe was doomed .
Not only was Copernicus correct , but his understanding of the new model was only elementary .
Indeed , he had only presented a more accurate models , but by no means a complete model .
The conflict that had arisen by the clash of these two models of reality was enormous .
It had already cost the life of Giordano Bruno , and came close to claiming the life of Galileo .
Let us carry our example a step further .
Copernicus and Galileo also gave us only models of reality .
In fact , the sun is not stationary either , nor is it at the centre of the universe .
It races through space at an enormous speed , in one of the tentacles of a massive spiral galaxy , which itself is hurtling outward from some unknown point to some unknown destination .
This also is a model of reality which may be added to and augmented by yet more discoveries .
This historical example demonstrates both the meaning of " models of reality , " and of my thesis that models of reality , and not reality per se are the sources of all the apparent conflicts between Christianity and modern science .
Lest scientist judge too harshly , let us recall that the great physicist Boltzman was driven to suicide ( in 1905 ) at least in part by the ridicule he endured from other scientists for espousing atomic theory .
Atomic theory strongly contradicted the model of reality held by most physicists of his day .
How does the massive new information we have encounter models of reality shaped by an antique understanding of relevant sections of Holy Scripture ?
I would like to invite you to think together with me about how we might resolve the conflicts - sometimes bitter conflicts - between the new information which forms scientific models of reality , and models of reality drawn from a simplistic reading of the Bible .
AN OUTLINE OF THE MAIN POINTS OF OUR CONSIDERATION 1 .
Metaphor is integral to language , and the language of Scripture is rich in metaphor .
2 . There are serious problems and loss of meaning when one literalises metaphor .
3 . All tribes and societies throughout history have used stories to transmit their understanding of the meaning of life .
It is a singular curiosity of our modern era that these stories are often presented , not as landscapes of meaning , but as concrete fact , history and science .
4 . Challenging models of reality formed by the literalisation of metaphor and simple narratives is inevitable , and sincerely believing persons need to be clear about the language of meaning that constitute the purpose of a story , and not become party to the reduction of that story to history or science .
We should also be open to changes in our models of reality .
5 . Testing models of reality with regards to cosmology , the creation narrative and man 's history : a . Science : the scientific method .
b. Religious : consistency of meaning , rather than concreteness of facts .
6 . Theoria : a shared concept between physics and Orthodox Christian theology .
7 . Science and Christianity :
The challenge of living harmoniously with one another .
Here , we are speaking of those subjects where science and religion may overlap .
There is a range of subjects in which there is no such overlapping .
For example , science can say nothing about the Holy Trinity , the Resurrection of Christ and the Ascension .
2 Metaphor and Simple Stories Simple stories told for simple people are intended to convey meaning .
They are not concerned with scientific facts or chronological accuracy .
They will often contain sophisticated psychology in narrative that appears naive on the surface .
Although the stories appear simple , the meaning they convey may be complex and surprising in its depth .
Metaphor , which is very rich in older languages , conveys meaning by means of interlocking imagery .
It is not " concrete " language .
It has a fluidity that can convey textures of meaning which more concrete language cannot .
Metaphor also contains an internal dissonance that warns one not to literalise it .
At the very least , literalising a simple narrative story or a metaphor creates a false model of reality .
In relation to scripture and theology , when we literalize a metaphor , we create idolatry .
Let us look at the creation narrative in the book of Genesis , for example .
The details and processes of the creation of the universe , our solar system and our earth are extremely complex .
Indeed these matters are so complex and difficult to comprehend that the best scientific minds in history with the finest technology are only now unfolding the details , though with difficulty .
Why would the scripture attempt to explain all this vast complexity - so complex in many details that it exceeds human language and requires mathematical formulae to express it - to a wandering tribe of Hebrews who were not yet literate ?
Instead the narrative presents a simple story , but one filled with meaning and revelation .
Moses had to come down from Sinai with the Ten Commandments ; it would have been of no value for him to have returned with the Periodic Table of the Elements .
It is not surprising that ancient peoples formed a model of reality based on a more or less concrete and literal interpretation of the Genesis narrative ; what is astonishing is that anyone in the 20th and 21st centuries would hold such a model of reality when it is so clearly false .
The first tragedy in this is that it results in a loss of the actual meaning of the story .
The second tragedy is that such a disproved model of reality sets up an unnecessary conflict between religion and science , which undermines the faith of many who desire to believe .
The creation narrative , from the beginning up to the time of the holy prophets Sarah and Abraham , condenses an enormous time and a vast prehistorical oral tradition into a simple narrative .
This entire narrative is about meaning , not historical or scientific detail .
We must remember that we derive our theology from meaning , not from supposed facts .
Facts do not constitute truth even when they are accurate , only meaning can provide a basis of truth , and both the meaning in scripture and the truth of that meaning are revealed to us by the Holy Spirit .
The same might be said of science .
Brahe [ 1 ] was a careful , encyclopaedic recorder of observed astronomical facts , but still held an erroneous model of cosmology .
His facts were of little value until his assistant , Kepler , [ 2 ] interpreted them after Brahe 's death .
Only when the " facts " were given meaning did they become of value for knowledge and understanding .
" Truth " is founded on meaning , while models of reality are based on supposed facts .
More clearly , models of reality are derived from a presupposition of the accuracy of a given set of what appear , at least on the surface , to be facts - really , suppositions which have emerged in a given era of time .
For Orthodox Christians , spiritual and theological truth is derived from meaning , illumined by grace .
Revelation , in the Christian sense , is also about meaning : a way of integrating meaning into the events in life .
This too ( understanding revelation ) must be illumined by divine grace .
If there is , therefore , any claim to immutable truth , it is a subject of spiritual experience rather than rationalistic reflection on a given set of surmised facts .
[ 3 ] models of reality , being based on surmise and supposition about what are presented as " facts " in a given era , are malleable and subject to revision and change when some or all of the bases of the information that informed these " facts " are disproved or displaced by later discoveries and newly emerging sets of information relating to the same subject .
This is where the crisis arises for fundamentalism and Scholastic based Western theology in general .
Fundamentalist interpretations of Scripture consist in models of reality which are based on supposed facts , with little comprehension of meaning .
It is these models of reality which many religious thinkers bring into conflict with the models of reality generated by physics and other fields of science and medicine .
3 AXIAL II Karl Jaspars appears to have coined the expression , " axial period " to describe the great philosophical developments in the ancient world .
He applied it to the long era between about 800 and 400 B.C. [ 4 ]
During that era , an enormous revolution in human thought and understanding took place .
A radical shift in the paradigm that informed human thought and society occurred .
At first , the transformation moved almost with the gradualness of the shift of the magnetic poles , but then it erupted into a great flowering of philosophy and systematic ethics .
This era began at about the time Prophet Isaiah was illuminating the revelation of God in Israel .
It was the epoch in which the Azeri prophet Zoroaster revolutionised religion in Persia , Confucianism developed the system of ethics in China and the Milesian Greeks began to speculate about the nature of being .
During this period , too , the Buddha began to explore the problems of human suffering .
The great thinkers of this era began to consider the actual meaning of myths and taboos , and to transpose them into systems of meaning .
This process had , in fact , begun with the great lawgivers of history who attempted to systematise human experience into the structure of civil society , binding it together with legislation that took account of the purpose of the myths and taboos .
It was during this era that the quest for an understanding of the roots of good and evil advanced a general moral philosophy .
It was evident that people could keep any set of laws to the letter and still do evil things to others .
Law was not the solution ; it remained only a mechanism for controlling and mitigating behaviour within a given civil society .
Neither the moral concepts that were developing , nor the legal concepts were by any means universal .
During this great axial period , theology began its long journey toward development .
Philosophy was riveted on cause and effect , and later spent great energy on the question of how we learn and know .
The paradigm shift of this first axial period consisted in a movement away from unexplained myth , and into the realm of philosophy .
The development of both philosophy and theology were part of the same stream .
Within this stream , myth was converted to a systematic concept of ethics and social morality and the philosophers , both secular and religious , became the dominant practitioners who formed the grid of thought , beliefs , and structural changes in politics and governments and our concepts of humanity , the world and the universe .
I will contend , with Robert Solomon , that we are in the midst of a second great axial period .
It appears to me that a major paradigm shift is underway , and that it began already in the 1600s , but gathered its real force at the beginning of the 20th century .
I want to suggest that this shift has been , in some small way , motivated by the fact that the question of what we know is overpowering the question of how we learn and know .
[ 5 ]
The old preoccupation with a metaphysical dualism of mind / brain , and the abstraction of the intellect hardly seem tenable or significant in our present era .
Reality at all levels and in every dimension , is a mystery .
I do not suggest that the world of our sensual experience is not reality , but it is only the surface of reality .
This surface can be penetrated only with great effort , either spiritual or scientific , over time .
The more deeply we penetrate through the surface of this perceived reality , however , the greater the mystery becomes .
This is reflected in quantum physics , and also in Orthodox Christian theological experience .
Thus , both quantum mechanics and the world of Orthodox Christian spiritual experience are complementary .
Orthodox theology can be informed by modern science , and modern science can be illumined by Orthodox Christian spiritual experience .
This can be accomplished only when we clearly maintain the understanding that science is a method of exploration , not a dogmatic system , not pursued in the manner of a religion or " spirituality . "
Orthodox theology is not a system for interpreting the physical history and properties of the cosmos , but a means of the assent and transformation of the human person , an avenue of the revelation of redemption , and a framework for life and experience .
What shapes our idea that we are in a second axial period , is the major shift in the paradigms of philosophical and religious thought in the present era , beginning with the last decade of the 19th century . [ 6 ]
The shift has been such that scientists , and physicists in particular , have gradually replaced the philosophers as the architects of the grid through which we view humanity in relation to the world and the universe , and to each other .
This shift has clearly touched all areas of human thought and reasoning .
Just as the lofty theories of philosophers slowly " trickled down " to the most common levels of society , reshaping human thought , so the abstractions of scientists have been trickling down to every human level reshaping , over the past four or five centuries , every aspect of thought , including theological and religious concerns .
In the 20th century , and especially in the present century , technology , which is something of a parasite on science , has had an even greater impact on the shaping of the human mind .
Still , at the root of the making of the post - modern mind one has to see both quantum physics and evolutionary biology as seminal .
This is the great paradigm shift that constitutes what I see as the Second Great Axial Era .
From an Orthodox Christian point of view , if we are to continue to effectively witness the faith of Jesus Christ , we must respond to this Axial shift .
At a time when the Scholastic system in religious thought has been exposed for its emptiness as a spiritual and theological cul de sac , a deep spiritual void and hunger has been created in man by the age of technology , with both its benefits and its dehumanisation .
The equally blind alley of " spirituality without religion " offers no answers ; it cannot separate itself from the spirit of the age and the bondage to ultimate hopelessness .
Orthodox Christianity stands in a position to have a vital , existential encounter with the paradigm shift of the present Axial Era , and give form to the void and fullness in place of the emptiness that has been generated .
It has the content and the spiritual power to carry man beyond mere spirituality and into a profound spiritual life , in the grace of the Holy Spirit , which is not in conflict with this new grid of understanding , but which rather has a complementarity with it .
I will assert that Orthodoxy alone can sail easily upon the sea of our unfolding understanding of the universe , the origins of humankind and the mysteries of the quantum world .
In order to do this effectively , however , we must wean our Orthodox teachers and leaders away from the bondage of Western Scholasticism into which so many have fallen , and bring them back to the great existential revelation of the faith so clearly enunciated by the holy fathers , and in particular by the great hesychastic theologians who synthesised our understanding of our true relationship with God and the universe .
If we cannot , as teachers of the faith and theologians , address in a meaningful and open way , the new paradigms of the Axial Era in which we live , then we will be frozen in obsolete and meaningless models of reality , which we must forever set into militant opposition to the models of reality of physics and all the sciences .
If we fall prey to such arrogance , we will be unable to respond at all to the spiritual needs and aspirations of mankind , we will be unable to sustain the Gospel and we will be able to speak only to the most superstitious and religiously credulous elements in our various societies .
The younger generation will have been betrayed by us as we betray the Gospel and the faith with a blind , reactionary religiosity rather than an openness to new understanding and a grasp of the infinitude of the Orthodox Christian revelation .
Orthodox Christianity is not the arbiter of " facts , " but the healer of humanity , the source of meaning , the path to authenticity of life and the doorway to eternity - to immortality .

I have purposely avoided the use of the word " philosophy " and " philosophical , " because the context might not be understood , and one might think either that we are degrading philosophy or elevating it to too high a level .
Philosophy , to cite David Goa , is part of the " great human dialogue . "
We will discuss it later .

I do not recall his actual delineating dates , but it was during approximately that era ,

A crack in the conventional wisdom Economist slams U.S. incarceration regime » More Lies and Deception - Police Chief Kim Raney and Al Crancer , Jr. Sometimes I just really get tired .
Tired of fighting against all the bullshit and lies .
Tired of the fact that for years , prohibitionists have come to the conclusion that they have no need to tell the truth at all .
Tired of tracking down and reading through yet another “ study ” to find out that it ’s a whole lot of crap wrapped up with a pretty ribbon , so that others can pretend to tell the truth as they peddle their lies to eagerly vapid reporters .
Tired .
And yet … and yet .
The lies need to be exposed .
I found out about this Fox News interview video from a tweet from the folks at No on Proposition 19 who were quite excited about it .
As soon as I saw the segment ’s logo “ Going to Pot , ” I knew it would be a bad bit of business .
But I was n’t prepared for these two zombie flesh - eaters staring out at me from the video .
This was just after she said ( with wide - eyed amazement ) :
Who would of thunk , that in 2010 , we ’d be actually having a debate , about legalizing … pot !… to make up and balance a budget ?
And then she actually held that look for a couple of seconds .
My thought , however , was who’d have “ thunk , ” that in 2010 , we ’d still have idiots like this trying to keep us from legalizing something that should never have been criminalized ?
And , not to get off on a rant here , but who are these morons ?
I guess there ’s a reason I never watch television news channels and why in particular I use the parental control feature to lock FOX News ( Oh , I ’ll DVR Stossel or Napolitano if they ’re talking about the drug war , and of course , anytime Balko is on… , but I would absolutely freak if I accidentally flipped through channels in the morning and landed on these two ! )
I could understand ( not like , but understand ) such mindless zombies having an anchor job if they were , well , attractive , but these two are so ugly , their mommas would have to tie a pork chop around their neck to get the dog to play with them .
Anyway , police chief Raney ( who ’s not at all like those two ) lays it on really thick .
He ’s not an idiot .
Just a deceiver .
Here ’s what he has to say …
This is one of the most devastating initiatives ever to hit California [ … ]
It has no chance of taxing or regulating marijuana . [ … ] the effect would be devastating .
First of all , you have a work force , where now you have people bringing and smoking marijuana at the workplace …
Out - and - out lies and deception .
He complains twice about the notion that the state wo n’t get money from taxes because it ’s designed to be taxed at the local level .
He does n’t explain why that ’s bad , however .
After all , his city could get tax revenue .
But when you think about it , you realize that his drug war gravy train comes from the top ( from the state and the feds ) .
This initiative will force him to be responsible to and responsive to the local citizens in order to get funding .
None of the Police Chiefs like that .
And then he drops his big bombshell …
There was just a study that was just completed earlier this month by a retired analyst from the National Traffic Safety Authority .
He evaluated the five years previous to 2004 and the five years after , where medical marijuana was approved in the State of California .
What they ’ve discovered is that traffic fatalities where the driver tested positive for marijuana has increased 100 % , and his estimate is that , should this measure pass , that number will increase another 300 % .
What ?
I can already see where this is heading ….
“ driver tested positive for marijuana , ” percentage increases , etc .
This will be about cherry - picking minor shifts in data expressed in major percentages that will show no causality , but merely the presence of marijuana smoked at some previous time .
But now I ’ve got to track down the jerk who put together the piece of crap that ’s being used by the Police Chief to deceive the public .
I did , and boy , does it smell .
The folks at the Hive had run into this a while ago .
I either did n’t hear about it or did n’t notice at the time .
A recent study by Al Crancer Jr. a retired research analyst for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) has found that that passage of the upcoming California initiative this November “ TC2010 ” as it is commonly known might triple the amount of traffic deaths of marijuana related deaths on California highways .
“ No one is looking at the effect of the passage of this initiative on traffic deaths and injury , ” said Al Crancer , Jr. “ Everyone is focusing on the tax revenue benefit to the state of California ” . [ … ]
About Al Crancer Jr .
Crancer lives in Moraga , Californian today is the principal of Crancer and Associates , a statistical research group that conducts research and analyses in traffic safety .
In addition , Mr. Crancer has published numerous research articles that appeared in such journals as Science , Journal of the American Medical Association , and the American Journal of Psychiatry .
Clearly a badly written press release , which helped prepare me for what to expect .
Crancer and Associates appears not to even have a website and may only exist in Al Crancer ’s mind .
No reputable media picked up the “ study ” and it seemed destined to die until our intrepid Police Chief showed up .
It took me a little while to track down the study , but I finally found a copy of it at CADFY ( You can download it here ) .
The thirteen page “ study ” is full of irrelevant data included to make it look more impressive , and I did slog through the whole thing , but the relevant stuff was pretty limited .
So let ’s see what Mr. Crancer has to say in the abstract …
California data on drivers involved in passenger vehicle fatal crashes using Marijuana were analyzed to determine the impact on traffic safety and to provide information on the possible impact of an initiative , the Tax and Regulate Cannabis Initiative or “ TC2010 ” which is on the California ballot in November 2010 to reform and partially legalize Marijuana .
A total of 1240 persons were killed in the last five years in fatal motor vehicle crashes involving Marijuana .
230 were killed in 2008 .
Use has increase steadily in the last ten years and is now at 5.5 % in fatal passenger vehicle crashes .
The use in single vehicle fatal crashes where most drivers are tested shows an involvement rate of 8.3 % .
The largest increases occurred in the 5 years following the legalization of Medical Marijuana in January 2004 .
“ Involving Marijuana ” = drivers tested positive for marijuana and may not have smoked pot for days or weeks .
For the five years following legalization there were 1240 fatalities in fatal crashes , compared to the 631 fatalities for the five years prior , for an increase of almost 100 % .
Ah , that ’s where Police Chief Kim Raney got the 100 % figure .
And it ’s absolutely meaningless .
Because it has absolutely nothing to do with any changes in numbers or rates of fatal crashes .
It ’s only about the percentage of people with marijuana in their system and nothing about impairment .
Let ’s take a look at Crancy ’s charts and assume they ’re accurate .
[ Note , I have not independently verified these charts or the exact wording of the chart elements from the data at FARS – if someone else wants to , have at it , but as you ’ll see shortly , it ’s really unnecessary . ]
OK , we see an increase in drivers tested positive for marijuana .
But it does n’t look all that menacing , and it ’s not even close to the alcohol figures .
Let ’s look at the single driver crashes , which for some reason Crancy finds more compelling : Nope .
Not compelling .
Yes , there ’s been an increase in people with marijuana in their system since medical marijuana was legalized .
Of course .
That ’s not a surprise at all .
Are you aware that there was a huge increase in the number of traffic fatalities where the driver tested positive for Viagra in the five years after 1998 compared to the previous five years ?
That ’s because more people started using Viagra in 1998 when it was introduced .
Are you aware that there has been nearly a 20 % increase per year over the past seven years in traffic fatalities where the driver previously had ingested organic foods ?
Maybe organic foods cause traffic fatalities !
Or maybe there has been nearly a 20 % increase in organic food consumption each year for the past seven years .
Both of those have as much data validity as Mr. Crancy ’s absurd speculations .
Now , we can go to the same public government databases that Mr. Crancer used and take a look at all sorts of data .
Let ’s start with one he purposely ignored — the overall rate of traffic fatalities over that 10 year period in California .
The most useful base statistic is number of fatalities per million miles travelled , which , in California has been hovering a little over 1 per year .
This is particularly useful because it means that the data is n’t skewed by population shifts or changes in driving from gas prices , etc .
Why , I wonder , did Al Crancy leave this critical piece of data out of his report ?
Here ’s what we discover in California : From 1999 - 2003 : 6.26 fatalities per million miles travelled
From 2004 - 2008 : 6.12 fatalities per million miles travelled
That ’s right .
Since the legalization of medical marijuana in California , the rate of traffic fatalities has gone down .
What makes this particularly remarkable is that , while the number of people on the roads in California with marijuana in their system has increased , fatality rates have gone down .
Based on these figures , I predict a further reduction in fatality rates on the highways if Proposition 19 passes .
What makes this even more remarkable is if we take a look at Mr. Crancer ’s tables again .
Note how the percentage of drivers in fatal accidents with a BAC over .08 increased .
We know that drunk drivers cause fatal accidents ( something that has never been proved with stoned drivers ) .
So , if drunk driving fatalities rates have likely increased , and yet overall driving fatality rates have decreased , that indicates that the increased presence of marijuana in the system of drivers has actually countered or made up for the increased drunkenness .
Hey , it makes as much ( in fact a lot more ) sense than the conclusions reached by Al Crancer , and is much more supported by the data .
But of course a hack like Al Crancer , Jr. can call himself an analyst , pretend that he ’s part of an organization that does statistical research , throw together a bunch of data and completely distort its meaning , get another hack like Police Chief Kim Raney to take it to FOX News , and here we are again .
Yeah , it ’s tiring .
A Broward dad is lucky to be alive after he was shot during a botched robbery attempt .
And he has his 9 - year - old son to thank for it .
Police are searching for a suspect who shot Rodney Shepard in front of his three sons Monday evening in Plantation .
The shooting happened shortly before 5 p.m. Monday at the home on the 4500 block of Northwest 3rd Court .
According to police , Shepard and his three boys , 8 - year - old twins and a 9 - year - old son , were confronted by a family acquaintance outside the house .
As they talked to the acquaintance , known as " Dred " or " Dred O , " a Mercedes pulled into the driveway and a man with a handgun jumped out of the car and approached them .
The gunman ordered Shepard into his house and began to search his pockets for valuables .
Shepard and the gunman began to struggle , and Shepard wound up shot in the leg .
The 9 - year - old got a kitchen knife in attempt to ward off the gunman , who fled the scene .
Dred also fled the scene .
Shepard was taken to Broward General Medical Center in stable condition .
His sons were n't injured .
Plantation Police are looking for Dred , described as a black male , possibly in his 30s .
He drives a silver or gold Lexus .
The gunman , also a black male in his 30s , is about 6 - foot tall , thin to medium build with low cut black hair .
He was driving an older model silver , white or champagne 4 - door Mercedes with tinted windows .

ARTHUR :
Anaheim calling to the hockey world ...
It was the sort of rink rusty hockey you 'd expect in July , but it was also some of the best talent the Ducks have ever assembled at a Conditioning Camp .
Teasing at future pairings like Fowler / Clark and future lines like Holland / Smith - Pelly , the Ducks of the future are really something to see .
The game ended in a 4 - 4 tie thanks to the comeback efforts of Kyle Palmieri , but I have some general notes after the jump .
I had never seen the San Jacinto native shoot in stride .
It 's smooth , accurate and hard as all hell .
The defenseman opened up scoring when he saw opposing blueliner Justin Schultz pinch past him .
Brining the puck into the offensive zone , now defended by Jake Gardiner and MacGregor Sharp , Newton fired a hard shot over the goaltender 's glove .
Offensively , Newton was very effective all game , and he managed to make some smart plays on the puck in front of the net and against the boards defensively .
He generally played on pairings with Matt Clark or Ryan Hegarty .
Stephane Da Costa
He definitely had some moves -- he managed about the sexiest pass fake I 've ever seen -- but he was shutdown more often than not .
He played exclusively on a line with Chris Wagner .
I hope the NCAA kids are still around on Saturday so I can get another look at him .
Kyle Palmieri
Easily the prettiest goal of the game , Palmieri stopped on the goal line a few feet away from the post on Cousineau 's blocker side .
He then pulled it from backhand to forehand , and about an 8 foot diameter around Cousineau 's pads , to tuck it in glove side .
Palmieri attacked the net hard all game , cleaning up with Justin Vaive on one occasion and a similar backhand to forehand around the pads tying the game up with the goalie pulled in the dying seconds .
Word from J.P. Hoornstra , who interviewed Palmieri , is the prospect does n't expect an expulsion from Notre Dame as part of his arrest and that his court case has been settled , but being forced to go pro early does n't look like it would disagree with the Jersey boy .
He drew the first cheer from the crowd early in the game when he threw a diving sweep check on the goal line .
He also moved the puck well and put some great shots on net in a pairing with Matt Clark .
And he drew another cheer from the crowd when he hip checked Emerson Etem hard against the boards .
A good all around game , and definitely something to see .
Devante Smith - Pelly
Probably the most physical player of the game , he finished the defenders on the forecheck and came hard to the net , often sure to bring his check with him .
That worked out well for his partner for the night , Peter Holland , who came in very focused and threw a lot of quality shots in from the perimeter .
Smith - Pelly 's goal on the doorstep off a Holland rebound was smooth and it was good to see the hard push from him .
General Thoughts
Etem and Sexton brought a strong speed game , Kevin Lind looked pretty solid on D and NIcolas Deschamps and Maxime Macenauer made a strong combination .
Jake Gardiner and Justin Schultz were a sketchy pairing -- they even got caught trying to pinch simultaneously early in the game -- and Schultz was burned while activating at least twice .
They 're the Badger boys , but they do n't often play together back in Wisconsin .
I still have n't seen Tim Heed , but I 'll be back on Saturday .
If you go on Thursday , let us know how it was .
Joe Conason points out that the New York Times never quite got around to reporting the revelations that showed Andrew " Dim " Breitbart 's ACORN videos were carefully edited to show wrongdoing .
This nasty , scum - sucking piece of work has gotten away with it one too many times and I think this would be a really good time for them to rectify that omission , do n't you ?
For months , Breitbart continued to resist every request that he release the full , unedited ACORN videotapes , which ought to have alerted editors and producers that something was wrong .
But then in the course of the California investigation , Brown struck a plea deal with O’Keefe , who was in jeopardy of indictment for violating the state ’s privacy laws .
( According to Brown ’s final report , " the facts presented here strongly suggests that O’Keefe and Giles violated state privacy laws and provides fair warning to them and others that this type of activity can be prosecuted in California . " )
The plea agreement deal forced O’Keefe to turn over the complete set of tapes to state investigators .
Brown ’s verdict on their misuse was scathing .
" The evidence illustrates that things are not always as partisan zealots portray them through highly selective editing of reality , " he said .
" Sometimes a fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor . "
Meanwhile , Times public editor Clark Hoyt , like his colleagues in other mainstream outlets , has been forced to acknowledge gross errors in the paper ’s coverage – such as the false claim , encouraged by Breitbart and Fox , that O’Keefe went into the ACORN offices " dressed so outlandishly [ as a pimp ] that he might have been playing in a risqué high school play . "
In fact , the filmmaker never wore his ridiculous pimp regalia into a single ACORN office , always dressing instead like a buttoned - down junior accountant .
Amazingly , the New York Times never covered the Harshbarger report and gave little or no coverage to the other deconstructions of the Big Government “ scoop ” by law enforcement .
Last March , when Hoyt finally offered an excuse for the failure of the Times to adequately correct and explain the complex truth behind Breitbart ’s ACORN scam , it sounded weak :
The report by Harshbarger …was not covered by The Times .
It should have been , but the Acorn / O’ Keefe story became something of an orphan at the paper .
At least 14 reporters , reporting to different sets of editors , have touched it since last fall .
Nobody owns it .
Bill Keller , the executive editor , said that , “ sensing the story would not go away and would be part of a larger narrative , ” the paper should have assigned one reporter to be responsible for it . ”
Since then much more evidence has emerged , without generating the kind of reassessment that is overdue .
Now Breitbart has struck again , manipulating a gullible media establishment and a frightened administration in an attempt to destroy the reputation of an innocent federal employee .
Even today , despite overwhelming proof that he posted a snippet of the Sherrod video without any pretense of due journalistic diligence , he replies with taunts and gibes rather than any honest answers .
His latest smear is to claim that the white farmers who vouched for Sherrod are not who they claim to be .
On CNN , he brazenly demanded that John King explain how the cable network had determined their authenticity .
Coming from a self - styled journalist who has admitted that he never sought to fact - check the ACORN or Sherrod tapes , this is audacity verging on insanity .
Like the late Joe McCarthy , Breitbart smears both reflexively and with premeditation .
And like McCarthy , he badly needs someone to show the public how he does his dirty work .
So here at last is an opportunity for the Times and all the other media outlets that aided and abetted the ACORN fraud to restore a minimum level of standards and honor .
Investigate Breitbart , O’Keefe , Giles and the making and editing of the ACORN tapes without fear or favor -- then report the findings on page one .
Best day ever !
So there I was , sitting at the kitchen table studying for my physics lab ( wooo ) when someone knocks on my door .
So I go over to answer it and the second I see the package , I know this day has gone from an average , studying for physics over a rum and coke for breakfast kinda day to a SWEET TAP DANCING MOSES THIS IS THE BEST DAY IN MONTHS !
I tore open the package in a fit of unbridled glee like the buzzed man-child that I am and the package surrendered its cornucopia of gifts .
RESTRAIN YOURSELF EGGSAUCE
I tell myself .
Ok ok first things first , the letter .
With much self control I root through the gifts and eventually find what I am looking for .
I unfold it and begin to push the limits of my reading comprehension to words per second ratio .
This guy seems nice .
They talk about how they went out of their way to make sure I have the best Arby day ever ( which I am ) .
I near the closing lines of the letter and ready myself to unwrap the gif- HOLY HELL !
I GOT THE ORIGINAL SECRET SANTA AS A MATCH !
THAT'S RIGHT .
KICKME444 IS MY ARBITRARY MATCH .
So after I awoke from the concussion I received from hitting my head on the table after I fell over in shock , I got right down to unwrapping gifts .
My Arby gave me :
A shark in a bottle ( a real shark mind you )
a pirate flag ( Interestingly enough , me and some friends are building a raft this summer so these colors will be a futterin ' in the breeze before ye know it .
My other friends are also Redditors , so they might post the raft later this summer )
Two little pirate figurines
A ship in a bottle
Two bars of cake batter soap
Two California patches ( I 'm not sure if these are ranger patches or just decorative )
Some upvote stickers
The letter signed by the original secret Santa
the arbitrary day poster ( I totally hung it up on the wall and forgot to get it in the picture )
Thanks so much !
I will use these gifts as much as I can in everyday life ( soap probably more so ) .
Happy Arbitrary day to all !
The new financial reform law has what some lawyers call a secret weapon against fraud on Wall Street and in corporate America : the promise of a million - dollar jackpot to insiders who reveal an illegal scheme to the government .
Tucked in the massive bill is a provision that for the first time extends a concept long applied to government contracts to the private sector .
It gives whistle - blowers a mandatory 10 % — and as much as 30 % — of what the government recoups in fines and settlements in financial fraud cases .
These can include insider trading , false earnings reports and classic Ponzi schemes .
To claim a bounty , the whistle - blower must provide the Securities and Exchange Commission with “ original information ” that reveals the fraud and leads to a successful recovery .
“ This is very significant and will have an immediate impact , ” said Erika Kelton , a Washington lawyer who has represented whistle - blowers .
“ It will motivate knowledgeable insiders to step forward and tell the enforcement agencies what they know .
It is the secret weapon in this massive bill . ”
But some are worried about unintended consequences of the provision .
Some employees may see an incentive not to report a problem internally , but instead “ to go to the SEC with it , ” said Martin Rosenbaum , a Minneapolis lawyer .
After the collapse of Enron Corp. and the passage of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , companies tried to keep problems in - house by setting up hotlines and encouraging employees to tell top management if they saw questionable conduct .
“ Most people want their company to be strong and do the right thing , ” Rosenbaum said .
“ This has the potential to be a game changer , ” but not necessarily a good one , he said .
Some management experts said they foresee a flood of new claims driven by aggressive law firms that represent whistle - blowers .
“ I ’m skeptical .
This is the trend toward the informant - method of law enforcement , ” said Walter Olson , a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute .
“ Congress sees this as free money , but do we want to live in a society with paid informants everywhere ? ”
He noted that the Internal Revenue Service has used similar bonuses to pay those who expose tax cheats .
Some corporate lawyers say the bounty provisions are the most important but least noticed parts of the new law .
They have been overshadowed by the focus on new regulations for banks and the new consumer protection agency .
The whistle - blower provisions “ will have a huge impact , ” said Leslie Caldwell , a management lawyer in New York .
“ As people learn about this , they will see it ’s going to be very significant , ” Caldwell said .
“ There are a number of people in a large corporation who learn about things that could be considered violations of the securities law .
Now , they have a huge motivation to come forward . ”
Goldman
Sachs recently agreed to pay $ 550 million to settle a suit brought by the SEC accusing the investment banking firm of misleading investors who bought mortgage - backed securities just as the housing market collapsed .
Had the case arisen from a whistle - blower ’s tip under the new law , “ it would mean at least $ 55 million for the whistle - blower , ” Kelton said .
The idea of bounties for whistle - blowers goes back to the Civil War .
Congress in 1863 said that private litigants who exposed fraud in military contracts could keep some of what was recovered .
Congress greatly expanded the False Claims Act in 1986 and offered rewards to whistle - blowers who exposed frauds in other government contracts .
At first the targets were mostly Pentagon contracts .
More recently the majority of the claims have involved healthcare programs .
Thanks to the act , which took effect the following year , the government has recouped $ 24 billion since 1987 .
Of that amount , whistle - blowers have received nearly $ 2.5 billion .
“ This is the most successful fraud - recovery program ever .
It brings money back to the taxpayers , ” said Stephen Kohn , executive director of the National Whistleblowers Center in Washington .
It was the massive Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff in New York that convinced many of the need to extend the whistle - blower provisions to the world of financial frauds .
Harry Markopolos , an outside investigator who tried to the alert the SEC to Madoff ’s scheme , testified before Congress and urged lawmakers to empower whistle - blowers .
Signed by President Obama on Wednesday , the financial reform law for the first time extends the whistle - blower bonuses beyond government contracts to expose frauds in private companies that cheat their investors or their customers .
Its proponents say the best way to expose a financial scheme is to offer a windfall to insiders who know about it .
“ This is a not a get - rich - quick scheme for whistle - blowers , ” Kohn said .
“ Any time you are involved in a government investigation you are in for a long , drawn - out proceeding .
But under this law , whistle - blowers win if they are right , and the government collects . ”
The new law states that the whistle - blower is entitled to receive at least 10 % of what the government receives as a result of his or her tip , and more if the information was crucial to unraveling the fraud .
Awards are triggered only when the government recovers at least $ 1 million .
The largest awards in recent years have involved medicines and government - paid healthcare .
Last year , John Kopchinski , a Gulf War veteran and a former pharmaceutical salesman for Pfizer , was awarded a $ 51.5 - million whistle - blower reward for exposing problems with the drug Bextra .
It was pulled from the market in 2005 , and Pfizer paid a record $ 2.3 billion in fines and penalties to the government .

Hold on to your foreskins , fellas , because this could be your big break ...
Or maybe " break " is n't quite the right word ?
At any rate , The Puppetry of the Penis — that show where two dudes make elaborate origami with their genitals for a paying audience — is looking for new , um , talent !
They 're holding open auditions for their new show , and you 've got just two weeks to rehearse !

“ The bottom line with me is , it ’s very personal .
It ’s not a theology , ” Mr. Namdar said .
“ That ’s what my parents did , and not just my parents , the Sephardic community .
Maybe they did n’t want to know that there was a fire inside the engine , ” referring to the idea that driving violates the ban on igniting a fire during the Sabbath .
Or they knew but did n’t care , because it was their custom to drive .
In any case , he said : “ Why do you assume that the Orthodox Shabbat is the Sabbath ?
I do n’t agree with that .
Minhag Yisrael , the custom of Israel , is what matters . ”
Mr. Namdar rejects “ all this crazy stuff the Orthodox rabbis added , the stuff with tearing toilet paper and cracking open soda cans before Shabbat ” lest you violate laws against tearing and making new vessels , part of a complex body of law to prevent anything that could be construed as work .
The Sabbath , Mr. Namdar said , is not a theory but a practice , or rather a set of practices , living , evolving and human , handed down from parents to children , not inscribed in a book in heaven .
“ The second you write down the rules , it does n’t work for me , ” he said .
He believes that the Sabbath of everyday Jews , rather than the Sabbath of the disputers and the thinkers , was never as strenuous or elaborately thought - through as the Orthodox Sabbath is today : “ You ate well , you slept well , you had sex , you were in a special state of mind , you did not chastise the kids .
It was organic . ”
Those who want to keep the Christian Sabbath face the opposite problem  not an excess of law , but the absence of customs and a community that observes them .
Though Sabbath - keeping was once ubiquitous throughout the Christian world , Sabbath rituals other than church - going have mostly vanished .
What would an organic Christian Sabbath look like today ?
For James Carroll , an ex-priest and dissenting Catholic in Boston ( he is the author of “ Practicing Catholic , ” published in 2009 ) , it would look like the Sunday dinners of his childhood .
These were big formal meals , held at 2 p.m. every Sunday ( and on Christmas and Thanksgiving ) , which were sometimes the only meals at which he and his mother and brothers would be joined by his father .
Mr. Carroll ’s father , who worked at the Pentagon , was “ a typical absent father , ” he said .
“ He was never home at 5:30 on a weeknight when we had dinner .
There were five of us boys , and mealtimes were chaotic .
But Sunday dinner was a realm apart .
There were tablecloths , the good dishes , roast beef . ”
Mr. Carroll ’s father ’s presence at the dinner table was “ how we knew it was Sunday , ” he said .
“ That began a kind of family time that would extend into the evening , when we would all watch ‘ Disneyland ’ or ‘ The Ed Sullivan Show . ’ ”
Mozilla on Tuesday released the first official beta of Firefox 4 , the next major version of the popular open source Web browser .
Mozilla has completely overhauled Firefox 's user interface and added several noteworthy new features for Web developers and regular end users .
The new user interface represents a major departure from Firefox 's traditional look and feel .
It is arguably one of the most significant stylistic overhauls that Mozilla has undertaken since the initial transition from the old Mozilla suite to Firefox .
We tested the beta on Windows 7 because that is the platform on which the new theme is most mature ; design work is still ongoing for Mac OS X and Linux .
The new Windows theme is intended to match Microsoft 's glass aesthetic .
The tab bar was moved to the top of the window where it melds seamlessly with the titlebar .
The conventional menu was stripped out and replaced with an orange lozenge that is mounted in the top left - hand corner of the titlebar .
The entire title region and the inactive tabs are semi-transparent .
The inactive tabs are slightly frosted for readability .
The new main menu leaves out a lot of the standard items that were previously accessible through the conventional menu bar .
Many of the omitted items are still easy to reach through contextual menus and other parts of the user interface , but there are several features — such as private browsing and the download window — that are no longer easily discoverable .
You can still use those features by turning back on the classic menu or hitting
Alt to temporarily activate it .
It 's likely that these features will be exposed in more practical ways as the design work progresses .
The bookmark list now has its own dedicated menu button located in the main toolbar .
When you enable the bookmark toolbar , the bookmark button gets sucked down into it and will disappear from the main toolbar .
It 's a particularly nice touch and a good use of space .
The new design looks promising , but it still has some rough edges and needs further refinement .
There are still some parts that are awkward and feel out of place .
If you look at the right and left sides , for example , you can see that the elements do n't really line up properly .
The way that the tabs run up against the window titlebar buttons on the right - hand side also looks wrong to us , like it needs a little bit more vertical spacing .
Mozilla has replaced the old add - on manager window with a new interface that lives in an actual tab .
This seems like a good move in light of the growing complexity of the add - on manager .
The new add - on interface feels less cramped and cluttered due to the significant amount of spacing .
It seems likely that Mozilla will integrate more functionality from its add - ons website into the browser 's built - in add - on user interface in the future .
Mozilla 's support for emerging Web standards continues to advance in the new version of the browser .
Google 's open WebM video format works out of the box in Firefox 4 , supported alongside Ogg Theora in the HTML 5 video element .
We tested it by viewing several WebM video samples in YouTube 's HTML5 player .
Another major addition in Firefox 4 is support for WebGL , an open standard for displaying 3D content in webpages .
Although WebGL is implemented , it 's not enabled yet in the beta release .
On the roadmap
There are several additional features not included in the beta that Mozilla plans to add under the hood prior to the release of Firefox 4 .
We can expect to see these features arrive soon , because Mozilla is moving forward quickly with an aggressive development schedule .
One of these features , JetPack , a lightweight extension system based on HTML and JavaScript , is going to be integrated directly into the browser and will be supported alongside conventional add - ons .
JetPack was initially introduced by Mozilla Labs last year .
Much like the Persona feature that was added in Firefox 3.6 , JetPack was initially developed as an add - on itself so that it could mature independently before being adopted as a standard part of Firefox .
It 's a nice feature that will help lower the barrier to entry for extending the browser .
Mozilla was arguably the industry leader when Firefox 3 was released in 2008 , but other browser vendors have jumped ahead by delivering superior performance and reliability .
Mozilla is now in a position where it has to focus on becoming more nimble if it wants to retain its relevance in the increasingly competitive browser market .
The new features in Firefox 4 are a promising step in the right direction .
Users who want to try out the new beta release can download it from the Firefox Web site .
For additional details about the new version , you can refer to the release notes or the official release announcement in the Mozilla blog .
It is a controversial position , and Miami financial planner Frank Armstrong says he would not do it , although " it 's not crazy . "
He points out that companies that appear solid at a point in time can evolve into a mess and stop paying dividends , and the stocks can crash in value .
Last month , BP proved it by suspending its dividend .
Further , the stock has been plummeting .
Liberty and Creativity
Exercising creativity will help establish and improve a free society .
And a free society will be most conducive to the expression of ideas and the creation of art , literature , media , inventions , and Do - It - Yourself production .
I : Creativity Fosters Free Society .
The task of liberating society can be described as “ building a new world in the shell of the old ” or finding opportunities to build liberating networks into daily life .
In any sense , the project of liberation is an act of creation , and requires creative thinking to be successfully achieved .
The things we create can be the beginnings of the new world that must be built .
The personal liberation found in creating art and inventions facilitates the individual ’s ability to live a free life .
And on the social level , encouraging the exercise of creativity undermines the social control of authorities who rely on passive consumers and obedient producers .
One who creates is imagining new ways to live and breaking out of the roles and ideas that have been handed to him .
Expanding mental attention into new areas expands freedom – the individual who can think about more things is capable of doing more things .
Whether creating narratives from images in the mind , or creating usable items from discarded parts , the mental process involved in creation requires that the world be looked at from different perspectives than one is used to .
Such a mindset encourages the exploration and toleration of new ideas , hallmarks of a free society .
Creation disrupts the monotony and sterility of social control .
Where governments would put drab brown walls along highways , graffiti artists give passengers something to think about besides blank walls and asphalt .
The right sticker on a subway advertisement can make the viewer more apt to question the messages they are getting .
Public performances disrupt the routine of habit whereby people fall into acceptance of the status quo .
And Do -It - Yourself projects are more likely to make the individual feel he can influence the world around him .
Like a free society , creation can be a participatory process of discovery and a voluntary pooling of individual effort for maximum benefit to all participants .
Communication and free expression are more valued than slavish devotion to “ The Rules . ”
A more material payoff of fostering creativity can be discussed .
The products of Do - It - Yourself and Make Culture can form the basis of a counter - establishment - economy , finding ways to make discards into valuable capital for use and exchange .
And the more that people think innovatively , the more fronts of attack can be opened against authority .
For example , more ideas about how to counter attacks on Wikileaks make it harder for the US government to disrupt it .
And if Wikileaks is shut down , the authorities will then be confronted with multiple new ideas attacking them , as if they cut off one head of the Hydra to see two grow in its place .
Reason is only one part of the human thought process , so it is often helpful to communicate feeling to go with it .
Doing so makes things meaningful on a deeper level , and playing with emotions can reveal the thought processes behind them .
II : Free Society Fosters Creation .
A free society would have no taxes , no globe - spanning empires , and no regulations that lock the economy into rigid hierarchy and inefficiency .
But there would be an emphasis on personal liberty – this would be necessary to establish , safeguard , and improve a free society .
Such an environment would be conducive to a flowering of human creativity , as creativity would not be limited by arbitrary authoritarian decree .
The elimination of the state will increase the general wealth of society by two related means .
One , the government is not leaching off every minute of legal work to line the pockets of those who help politicians exert control and chase glory .
Two , there will no longer be arbitrary barriers to entering the economy or to create new economies , making it easier to start new businesses or new ways of exchanging goods .
The absence of state distortions in the economy means that people can work more productively with the same amount of time .
Prices of necessities , like housing , nutrition , and utilities , are kept artificially high by government intervention , particularly in land use and technology .
As Charles Johnson noted in Bits & Pieces on Free Market Anti-Capitalism : the Many Monopolies ,
certain key markets – importantly , the labor market , housing rental market , and other key markets are rigged markets – and in particular , indirectly - created captive markets , in which working - class folks in need of houses or jobs are driven into a market where they are systematically stripped of resources and alternatives , faced by artificially high costs , and generally constrained to negotiate with incumbent market players who have been placed in an artificially advantageous position over them
The practical result is that in an economy rife with state intervention on behalf of the most powerful interests , the average person works more and receives less than they likely would in a free economy .
The greater profitability of work combined with the falling prices of basic living expenses in a free society means that basic needs could be met with far less work , leaving more time to create and experiment .
The ease of finding someone to pay for art ( though there would likely be many people interested in free expression and wealth would be more generally attainable ) would have less determination over what kind of art was made , as the artist can more easily live off of other endeavors .
So art does not have to be easy to sell ( though there is nothing wrong with going for mass appeal ) but instead would be a truer reflection of the creator ’s desires to explore and create .
But creativity does not have to wait for after work is done .
A free society is more likely to value the application of creativity to work .
Where the authoritarian says , “ Do what you ’re told , ” the libertarian says “ If you want to be involved in this endeavor , find the best way you as an individual can contribute . ”
Valuing results over obedience leads to less drudgery and submission at work .
The individual is less of an automaton , and more of a craftsperson valued for his skills and ideas .
A free economy leaves more time for leisure as people work more effectively instead of working longer .
The demand for literature , games , and aesthetics would likely rise .
So the exchange of creations could be a more prevalent part of life .
And the innovation fostered by the nurturing of creativity in a free economy would likely make creation a greater part of social life .
In freedom , one does not need to perpetually labor for others in order to maintain survival or status .
The things you do on your own time are more meaningful than things done on others ’ time , and living without masters that require constant requests for approval is living free .
The individual flourishes in autonomy .
Individual freedom requires respecting individuality .
The freedom to experiment and express new ideas would likely be seen as valuable assertions of uniqueness .
III : Freedom of Communication .
The more easily information flows , the better the environment for creation , adaptation , and commentary .
All work is ultimately derivative – to be completely original , you would have to invent language and create every single environment that has fostered ideas .
It is the way in which one combines previous ideas that makes a new idea original .
In a free society , communication would be facilitated by innovation , by people having more time to communicate instead of taking and giving commands , and by the end of intellectual property regimes .
The greater communication that a free society would foster is another way that freedom encourages creativity .
In a free society , communication and accountability would take the place of copyrights and patents .
The regime of intellectual gatekeeping and intellectual property generally serves to enrich certain businesses at the expense of individual creators .
Authors sign away rights to get published , film studios are not permitted to make adaptations of works that others “ own , ” technology workers sign away profits from innovations to their employers , incremental improvements on products can violate patents , companies sit on patents to prevent competitors from developing products , and whoever is able to muster the strongest showing in a government court wins .
Ensuring creator recognition through public accountability works by using the flow of information and consumer choice – through innovation , not disruption .
In the information age , plagiarism is easier than ever to detect and draw attention to .
Selling creative works without paying the creators will lead to market pressure and social costs .
New business models to fund research and development will be created .
Those who succeed will sell products and those who do not can create products for their own use without a lawsuit hanging over their heads .
QuestionCopyright.org promotes a “ Creator - Endorsed ” trademark to certify that creators of a work endorse the version that carries the mark ( Stephan Kinsella discusses the idea in The Creator - Endorsed Mark as an Alternative to Copyright ) .
A dishonest use of such a mark would constitute a fraudulent attempt to make a profit .
If one sold a product bearing the Creator - Endorsed mark without the actual approval of the creator , the customer is not receiving the product they paid for .
The seller would be dishonestly keeping money that he promised the consumer he would give to the creator .
The Creator - Endorsed mark is one example of an effort to help creators make money by the spread of information and by the decision - making power of consumers .
Cases of derivative work are best decided in the court of public opinion .
If a work is an obvious rip - off , it will lose support and bring social costs .
If a work draws inspiration from other expressions of ideas , it will be up to each individual to decide if it is too derivative or not .
There will not be one line fixed by authority , but multiple standards based in communication , persuasion , and individual decision making .
The use of information technology without state restrictions will overall lead to better working conditions for creators .
As Kevin Carson notes in his latest Center for a Stateless Society study The Thermidor of the Progressives ,
[ I ]t ’s feasible for a larger number of people than ever before to obtain payment ( in smaller amounts ) for their ideas by marketing them directly to readers and listeners , as opposed to the previous state of affairs in which fewer people gained access to much larger sums of money by winning the approval of the corporate gatekeepers .
What we ’re seeing is a return to the folk model of making modest incomes by direct production for one ’s audience , in place of a model in which the “ artist ” is the client of some bureaucratic government or corporate patron ( with the giant publishing house or record company “ keeping ” the artist in the same way an Italian grandee kept his pet artist in the Renaissance ) .
The corporate gatekeepers , those who skim off the work of some while countless others petition for consideration , are now facing competition from the new entrepreneurialism enabled by the free use of technology .
Creators can reach a wider audience without the intermediaries of businesses who have their own interests in mind .
The gatekeepers are n’t better at recommending stuff than friends and trusted reviewers .
With mass exposure , quality control is democratized .
Creators can judge feedback from multiple sources in a conversation between equals instead of looking up the hierarchy for revision .
And consumers have more potential seals of approval to put their trust in .
And mass exposure is good for works that are n’t massively popular too .
The free flow of information enables niche audiences to more easily find the products they ’re looking for .
If I ’m trying to convince someone to buy a ticket to a concert I ’m going to , one of the best things I can do is point them to YouTube .
There might be official videos , there might be bootleg concert footage , and there might be videos made using movie clips without permission .
All help the potential consumer make a more informed choice , and lead to more interest in the product .
And a variety of creators can be better matched to more unique tastes .
As Carson says later in Thermidor :
But even assuming that “ piracy ” really does cut into the total revenues of the little guy who ’s trying to make a full - time career out of music or writing , that ’s looking at only one side of the picture .
It neglects what Bastiat called “ the unseen . ”
What revenue does come in to artists follows a much longer tail distribution , spread out among a larger number of people making small amounts of money , as opposed to larger amounts being concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of artists .
Let ’s consider my case .
I do n’t waste time worrying about the sharing of pdf files of my books at torrent sites , or how much money it ’s costing me .
To me , the proper basis for comparison is the money I still can make that I never could have made at all in the “ good old days . ”
In the good old days , I ’d have painstakingly put together a manuscript of hundreds of pages , and then put it away to gather cobwebs when I could n’t persuade the gatekeepers at a conventional publisher that it was worth the cost of printing and marketing …
[ I ] f it were n’t for digital publishing technologies and free publishing venues on the Internet , I would probably have lived and died doing menial labor with nobody anywhere ever hearing of my ideas .
If I ’d had to persuade a conventional publisher that my books could sell ten thousand copies before I could be heard , my entire writing career would have been confined to letters to the editor .
Thanks to digital culture , I ’m able to make my work directly available to anyone in the world who has an Internet connection , and market it virally to a niche readership at virtually no cost .
The breaking of monopoly leads to a flowering of alternatives .
Creators are able to see their visions realized in the physical world , and writers are empowered to communicate more .
But the creator is a consumer as well .
Finding inspiration and sources for projects can get really expensive or otherwise inconvenient if you ca n’t download it for free and later compensate and promote those you have found to be most helpful .
In anarchy , human creativity would be liberated and countless ideas would be experimented with .
Liberty and creativity are bound together in the pursuit of maximum freedom .
Stob Hi Verity , are we up for some more frolics and fun ?
Nope .
It 's a spot test today .
Using your neatest handwriting , write out a standard C++ loop on the nursery blackboard .
No copying .
This will count towards your final grade .
Joy .
What brought this on ?
Oh , ok – gimme the chalk , let 's get it over with :
for ( int i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_SIZE ; i++) { // do something to an array ...
You should be ashamed of yourself .
That code is a crime against modern C++.
Come out with something like that down the ACCU , you could find yourself sentenced to six months mentoring Linus Torvalds through his Visual Basic breakdown .
Ok , clever clogs , so what 's wrong with it ?
Let me count the ways :
You 've used < ' less than ' in the test instead of != ' not equals ' .
These days you are always supposed to test for inequality , in case you later ' port ' the code to use iterators .
But I LIKE the < test .
It 's a nice overrun - preventing sandbank at the back end of the loop , so that one does n't have to be too careful about getting the stopping condition exactly right .
Know what I mean ?
Shush , child .
There may be colleagues or employers reading .
You 've used a post increment i++ instead of a pre increment ++i , thus incurring the certain cost of an unnecessary copy .
Do n't be silly , it 's an int !
The day they change the language name to ++C , that 's the day I 'll start taking pre-incrementing seriously .
That ARRAY_SIZE is a disgusting # define that you are hiding somewhere in the header .
You can't prove that .
It might be a pukka const for all you know .
You have used a C - style array rather than a container class , thus depriving yourself of the STL 's sanity checks and versatility and potential performance gains and what not .
Just because it says ' array ' in the comment , that does n't signify anything .
I 'm pretty sure I 've updated it to a vector , now you mention it .
And anyway , I 'm suspicious about STL containers going faster ' in theory ' .
Was n't it OS / 2 that had a filing system that ran ten times faster than anything else , provided you remembered to run it ' in theory ' rather than ' in practice ' ?
You have used an int rather than an iterator to get at the elements of your structure , meaning you are restricted to containers that support random access .
See , the thing is , iterator declarations do n't half make a mess of the code .
They are such ugly , prickly things ; all full of :: and <> .
And you always have to make two , one for the index and the one to hold end marker , which makes it worse .
The clincher .
You should n't have been using a loop at all .
You should be using an algorithm
Here we go .
Finally we cut to the chase .
I 've been waiting for this .
Do n't take my word for it .
Listen to the voices of the gods .
Prefer algorithms to loops – Mariella Frostrup , 2000 .
Surely ' Bjarne Stroustrup ' ?
Prefer algorithm calls to hand - written loops – Meyers , 2001 .
Prefer algorithm calls to handwritten loops – Sutter & Alexandrescu , 2005 .
We are the legion of the Beast – The Ood , 2006 .
I seem to sense that you have some issues ...
I should cocoa !
You come barging in here , with your metropolitan mannerisms ...
... but there 's no need .
Because I agree with you .
Huh ?
You do ?
Oh yes .
I can never get algorithms to match the problem I have in hand .
I sit there looking at the list , wondering if I should be using adjacent_find or remove_copy_if , but they always have this quality of not quite doing what I want ...
Yes !
Yes !
That 's right !
It 's even worse than those bloody awful find_last_but_one_not_of functions you get with substrings !
... so I look at those adapters and binders and try to bodge it together with a bind2nd here and a greater_equal there ...
This is just what happens to me !
And then you give up and write a whole new functor thingy , just for this one loop ?
And then I give up and write a new functor , hidden guiltily in the middle of the implementation of the class I am really working on , thereby blowing the whole reusability thing to smithereens .
And messing up the readability of the code .
And making a complete pickle of the flow .
AND sending the performance to hell on a handcart too , for all I know .
Assuming you can get the sod to compile !
Yeah , you wrestle for 20 minutes with the bizarre error messages the compiler pushes out when you 're mucking about with templates .
Then you notice that the exercise has taken you about nine times as long as it would to bash in an ordinary loop .
You 're all cross and hot and bothered , because you 've just wasted half an hour trying to do the Right Thing , and the result is a complete and utter dog 's breakfast .
Anybody who comes round and tells me that this is intrinsically more reliable than a hand - coded loop will get such a slap ...
Oh God !
It 's such a relief !
All these years , I thought it was just me !
There , there .
Never mind .
It 's all going to be all right .
Would you like to borrow my hanky ?
Thanks .
But Verity , what are we to do ?
If the C++ overlords believe that the construction of nearly every loop should be a sort of inline Sudoku puzzle , surely the problem must be that we are simply too stupid to use the language ?
Well , I reckon I 'm pretty handy , actually .
Fancy myself ten bob each way , as a programmer .
And surely the very fact that you are a Reg reader implicitly puts you above the top quartile , if not decile , of both taste and coding competence .
I do n't think that we are the problem here .
We are good workers blaming our tool .
Damn right , sister !
So is there some sort of workaround ?
Well , the fabulous Boost boys have this library that lets you support llama functions ...
You perhaps mean ' lambda ' functions ...
... which kind of lets you bodge in the code where it belongs , in the loop .
So to do a for loop within a for_each , to steal an example from the Boost site
int a [ 5 ] [ 10 ] ; int i ; for_each ( a , a+5 , for_loop ( var ( i ) =0 , var ( i ) < 10 , ++var ( i ) , _ 1 [ var ( i ) ] += 1 ) ) ;
Hmm , s'pose that looks more like it .
It does , but I say it 's still too hard .
If you look at their examples , you 'll see it gets pretty hairy and ugly as soon as you need to do anything even slightly complicated .
I take it you have an alternative solution ?
Indeed .
If we must write lambda functions to use the standard library properly , then the language should bloody well support lambda functions directly , straight out of the box .
Proper , ordinary , C++ ; not using some near - C++ ersatz syntax that geniuses have toiled over for years using macro and template tricks to make it slightly less ghastly .
Let the compiler take the strain .
If JavaScript can do it , C ++ should be able to too .
Ask any Joel .
Sounds fab .
Where 's your modified version of gcc that supports this stuff ?
< cough > I see myself as more of an Ideas Person .
I leave mere implementation details to Mariella & co .
Quelle surprise .
To end things on a more positive note , how about an example of an iterative algorithm that 's easy - to - use , neat , quick and really does the business ?
Ok , how about this :
Have somebody else hold your glass for you .
Take one sip of liquid or , in severe cases , two .
Eh ?
It 's a cure for hiccups .
Works 100 per cent , at the pub , work and even home .
Try it .
Verity , you are too good to me .
I know . ®
