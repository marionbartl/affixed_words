Look in your bathroom .
Got a loofah in there ?
Ever used one ?
You know , like a sea sponge ?
Now think about it being used for building houses .
Huh !?
This is exactly what ’s happening right now in Paraguay .
Elsa Aldivar , a social activist teamed up with Pedro Padros , an industrial engineer to make this happen .
It did n’t happen right away .
Aldivar was searching for a way to give women an earth friendly way to generate income , and encouraged them to cultivate loofah , that grows easily there , to be dried out and made into cosmetic products .
But they found that a certain portion were n’t up to export standards , and 30 % of the quality material was being shaved off while making mats , slippers , insoles and the cosmetic tools .
[ social_buttons ]
So she wondered what use / value could be created from these .
Material for house walls and roofs , she decided .
After extensive trial and error , she and Padros devised the perfect combination of loofah , recycled plastic , and things like cotton netting and corn husks , all of which would otherwise be disposed of .
At less than $ 3 a square meter , competitive with wood .
But beyond being merely equivalent in price , it exceeds wood ’s capabilities , with the ability to take dye during manufacture , making painting unnecessary .
They are flexible , able to better withstand disaster situations .
If they do fall , there ’s less chance of injury , as they ’re lighter weight .
And they can be recycled , repeatedly .
And with care in initial selection of plastics , when they can no longer be remade into housing material , they can be used as biofuel .
While totally viable as a building material in many environments far outside rural Paraguay , their ease of use , and ability to work with local , familiar materials like adobe makes them ideal for use locally , providing both shelter and income .
They are the winners of the Rolex Award for Enterprise , and with this , they ’ll be building three demonstration homes and have a promotion center , where both urban and rural people will be able to learn about this innovative material .
Readers :
What else are you seeing out there to make super efficient use of resources , for building and otherwise ?
What other , lesser known options are being developed that we should know about ?

Why have n't cube attacks broken anything ?
Why have n't cube attacks broken anything ?
The talk and the paper
Shamir had already advertised his talk as introducing " cube attacks , " a powerful new attack technique that he had developed with his student Itai Dinur .
To illustrate this technique he spent several slides describing a stream cipher with an extremely large key , many S - boxes , etc. David Wagner later wrote that Shamir had " just piled on one security feature after another until he got a design where I just had to laugh -- since it seemed ridiculous to imagine an attack on the design , yet I knew if he was describing this cipher he had to have some trick up his sleeve to break it . "
After describing the cipher , Shamir said that the cipher clearly could not be broken by any previous technique .
Shamir 's words , as I recall , were " I am sure you will agree with me . "
Wagner wrote that the cipher " seemed ridiculously hard to break by all known methods . "
Shamir then explained how to break the cipher quite efficiently with a " cube attack . "
Bruce Schneier posted a note to his widely read blog saying " At this moment , Adi Shamir is giving an invited talk at the Crypto 2008 conference about a new type of cryptanalytic attack called ' cube attacks . '
He claims very broad applicability to stream and block ciphers . "
The news was picked up by some reporters :
Stream ciphers cower before Adi Shamir 's cube attack ... Adi Shamir brought a big new wrecking ball to bear on stream ciphers at Crypto2008 , the 28th International Cryptology Conference , one that will send architects of the algorithms back to their keyboards .
Dinur and Shamir posted their paper " Cube attacks on tweakable black box polynomials " a few weeks later .
They wrote " In this paper we develop a new technique ( called a cube attack ) " that added cipher outputs over " boolean cubes " and that was " provably successful when applied to random polynomials of degree d over n secret variables whenever the number m of public variables exceeds d + log_d n. "
Dinur and Shamir said that their attack was " a major improvement over several previously published attacks of the same type . "
They cited five previous papers ( from 2003 , 2007 , 2007 , 2007 , and 2008 ) that " try to break particular schemes by highly heuristic attacks that sum output values on Boolean cubes of public variables " but said that " the cube attack is much more general , is applicable to block ciphers in addition to stream ciphers , and has a better - defined preprocessing phase which does not need adaptations for each given scheme . "
They also criticized older " interpolation attacks " as requiring a huge number of queries " to uniquely interpolate the polynomial from its black box representation . "
The critical question
Shamir had said in his talk that he and Dinur were working on the Trivium stream cipher and that the audience should expect news about Trivium .
This cipher had been introduced in 2005 , had received wide acclaim in the cryptographic community for its extreme simplicity and extremely high speed , had survived extensive cryptanalysis despite its minimalist design , and in 2008 had been selected for the final portfolio in the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project .
However , when the Dinur - Shamir paper was posted , it turned out to be disappointingly light on examples .
It states an attack on simplified versions of Trivium , perhaps marginally less simplified than the versions attacked in previous papers , but it does n't give any real reason to think that Trivium can be attacked .
It also does n't make progress on any other ciphers .
The remainder of 2008 was also remarkably free of news regarding successful cube attacks .
Why have n't cube attacks broken anything ?
Is there some secret reason that every real - world cipher resists cube attacks ?
It turns out that the answer is yes .
Large degrees
Is this an accident ?
No .
The cipher - design community has understood the importance of large degrees for many years .
The 1992 paper " Higher order derivatives and differential cryptanalysis " by Xuejia Lai explains how to break every small - degree cipher ; Shamir was flat - out wrong when he said that his example cipher could not be broken by any previous technique .
A scan of Lai 's paper appears below .
Section 2 introduces higher - order differentials .
Proposition 2 shows that each differentiation reduces degree by at least 1 ; consequently an order -d differential reduces degree d to a constant .
Section 3 expresses higher - order differentials , in the binary case , as sums over Boolean cubes .
The last paragraph of Lai's paper recommends choosing functions whose order -d differentials are roughly uniform for all small d ; evidently this recommendation prohibits all small - degree functions .
Are Lai's attacks " highly heuristic " ?
No .
Are they limited to " particular schemes " ?
No .
Are they applicable only to stream ciphers ?
No .
Are they less general than cube attacks ?
I do n't see how .
Do they need to " interpolate the polynomial from its black box representation " ?
No .
It seems to me that " cube attacks " are simply a reinvention of Lai's higher - order - differential attacks ; if Dinur and Shamir had cited Lai's paper ( and various followup papers easily located through Google ) then they would have been forced to drop essentially all of their advertising .

Sarasvati is an open source workflow / business process management engine for Java and Haskell .
It is currently in beta , and is already suitable for use in many projects .
New in this release :
It includes the following major changes : 1 . Support for nested processes has been fully implemented .
Earlier versions did not work correctly .
2 . The domain specific language for guards / flow control GuardLang has been replaced with Rubric * An introduction to Rubric can be found here : http://code.google.com/p/sarasvati/wiki/Rubric . *
In addition to what GuardLang was capable of , Rubric statements can return strings , numbers and dates , and has a simple syntax for date offsets .
*
The Rubric AST implements the visitor pattern , so Rubric statements can be traversed , validated and otherwise inspected .
*
It is implemented in ANTLR , so it now has a proper lexer .
* Rubric can be used as a simple rules engine for specify task properties .
3 . A new node type has been added for the hibernate engine : HibPropertyNode *
The node type has an associated String ->
String map , which can be used to store arbitrary properties in the database .
4 . A new CustomNode type has been added .
Subclasses of CustomNode can be used by both the memory backed and hibernate backed engines .
*
You can now generally avoid writing the same node logic twice , if you are using both engines .
If need to control how your node is mapped to the database , you can still subclass HibNode directly .
*
It uses HibPropertyNode on the hibernate side to persist the node attributes .
5 . Custom node attributes must now be wrapped in tag .
The full changelog can be found here : http://code.google.com/p/sarasvati/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3A1.0.0-beta3
For those unfamiliar with Sarasvati , these are some of the features : * Simple , well documented , graph execution based core * Process modularity via load time or run time process composition * Process and token level attributes * Actions can be implemented in scripting languages .
* Execution history available through tree structure of immutable tokens *
Node guards which allow bypassing nodes or discarding tokens for flow control * Domain specific language ( Rubric ) for user understandable guards * Java implementation with Hibernate and memory backed engines * Alpha Haskell implementation with HDBC and memory backed engines * LGPL license
Why might you want to use Sarasvati ? *
Load time process composition gives you tremendous flexibility in modularizing your process definitions *
You want to provide transparency to your users * Extensible and customizable *
You do n't want the workflow engine to dictate how users , groups and tasks should be modeled .
Why might Sarasvati not yet be useful to you ?
*
It currently has no graphical editor ( planned for a future version ) .
*
It only runs on Java 1.5 or newer *
It does not yet have a turn key solution for users / groups / tasks .

* Illustration : Todd Albertson * Do n't trust anyone over 30 .
That 's the prevailing wisdom in Silicon Valley , a land once again bestrode by millionaire CEOs who just learned to shave .
Many people believe that the breakthrough ideas come only from the young .
And why not ?
Media stories constantly recite the ages of a few famous founders : Bill Gates of Microsoft , 20 ; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook , 20 ; the Google boys , 25 ; YouTube 's Chad Hurley , 28 .
Tumblr founder David Karp is 21 — and on his second successful company .
Young people rule tech innovation , we tell ourselves , because they have several key advantages .
They 're fearless and naive , so they 'll try anything .
They can spy markets that elders , with their locked - in views , cannot .
And without dependents or spouses , twentysomethings can work the sort of pyramid - building hours necessary for a startup .
It 's a kind of Logan 's Run world :
If you 're ending a third decade , you 're obsolete .
But hold on .
A recent study has finally collected some data on age and high tech innovation and found that older geeks are just as successful as young Turks .
What 's more , the chronologically advanced are especially successful at solving problems we increasingly — and desperately — need solved .
In other words , the high tech future may belong to the over - 30 set .
The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation surveyed 652 US - born CEOs and heads of product development who founded high tech firms in the boom ( and bust ) years of 1995 to 2005 .
Both the average and median ages were 39 — far older than the mythic dorm - room visionary .
Turns out those youthquake pioneers do n't really represent the pack .
They 're outliers .
So why is our intuition wrong about this ?
Because young and old founders create different types of startups .
Mature entrepreneurs tend to launch startups that require huge amounts of capital — biotech companies , energy firms , outfits that make expensive hardware .
Startup costs in these areas include tens of millions for research resources , large staffs , maybe a laboratory .
Then , to take their invention to market , they have to navigate complex , entrenched industries , which requires connections .
" You need to know how to run a company right off the bat and inspire confidence in investors , " says Vivek Wadhwa , a Harvard Fellow who coauthored the Kauffman Foundation report .
In contrast , those sexy Web - service firms that have dominated headlines on and off for the past decade require almost no capital .
The " social software " market also rewards people who intuitively understand new media experiences .
" There 's been social change , too , " says Paul Graham , cofounder of Y Combinator , a seed - funding firm .
" Ten years ago , it was bizarrely unusual for someone graduating college to launch a startup .
Now almost everyone who gets a computer science degree at least thinks about doing it . "
In essence , the high tech world divides itself : Young people create the way - kewl consumer software — the Twitters and the Loopts — and older folks tackle the heavy - industry stuff .
Young founders hack information ; old founders hack atoms .
But we 're moving to a world where we need more and more of the latter .
Think of some of the thorniest high tech challenges — solar energy , battery systems , plug - in cars .
These all reside in the world of atoms .
Whoever cracks the problem of carbon sequestration is going to reap a multibillion - dollar reward .
But they 'll have to solve some hellishly complex physics puzzles and then introduce the solution to an energy industry riddled with byzantine state - by - state regulations and run by an old - boy network of cigar - chewing gazillionaires .
Not something easily accomplished in sweatpants .
When you look at it this way , the constant hype over social applications like Facebook or Tumblr can seem a bit misplaced .
I 'm not saying that Web 3.0 or 4.0 apps are going away ( or that they 'll stop being fun ) .
But here 's my bet :
When we finally start solving our global energy and resource dilemmas , the next generation of media - feted tech CEOs will look more like your parents than your kids .
Or , to put it another way :
Do n't trust anyone who wants to put an age limit on innovation .

This addresses is something which I ’ve touched on before , the need for guidebooks when traveling .
The impetus for this was spurred on by a Twitter discussion with Leif Pettersen who declared :
I declare that smugly claiming to be too cool or savvy to travel with a guidebook is officially passé and open for ridicule .
Leif is a guidebook writer .
I ’ve met other guidebook writers while traveling .
I have nothing against guidebook writers .
After a 19 months on the road , however , I can say with 100 % certainty …
You do n’t need a guidebook to travel , and getting information online is better , cheaper , and more convenient than what you will find in a travel book .
Here is why :
Timeliness
I have used one guidebook on my trip .
Prior to leaving , I purchased the Moon ’s Guide to the South Pacific .
The author , David Stanley , is probably one of the foremost authorities on travel in the South Pacific .
He ’s been traveling the region for decades and knows the area very well .
I subscribe to his website to get news of the region .
Nonetheless , for reasons which were totally beyond his control , much of the information in the book regarding flights was out of date .
Pacific Blue had canceled their flights to Tonga .
Air Nauru no longer existed .
Several other transportation issues made me have to change my plans based on information I got online or on the ground .
The problem was n’t with the author , it was with the medium .
He is very diligent about providing updates to airlines on his website , but that same information might take years to make it to print .
The publication cycle for guidebooks means that the moment a new guidebook hits the shelf , the information is probably a year out of date .
The schedule for putting out new editions can range from 1 - 5 years and for little visited places , perhaps even longer .
Sites such as Hostelworld.com will have much more timely information .
You can usually find reviews from people who have stayed at the hostel within the last two weeks .
Transportation schedules are the things most likely to change .
You can find up to date train information at Seat61.com .
You can find up to date flight information at any number of flight sites like Expedia , Orbitz or Kayak .
You can get bus schedules from most places you stay .
I know here in SE Asia , bus schedules are easy to find at any hotel or hostel , and they will have the latest information .
Most places you will have an entire industry built around tourism .
Most guidebook authors get their information about attractions by picking up brochures , and you can do the exact same thing when you are there .
If attractions have been closed for any reason , you can more readily find that out online than in a guidebook .
Quality
To address the quality of the information you get from a guidebook , I will not even address the controversy surrounding guidebook author Thomas Kohnstamm and the allegations of fraud ( because there really was no fraud ) .
It is n’t necessary .
Leif ’s main contention is that you do n’t know what your source is online , but you do in a guidebook .
I contend the exact opposite .
I have no idea who most guidebook authors are and I have no idea what went into the research of the guidebook .
I ’m sure most guidebook authors are honest , but I ’m equally sure that some are n’t .
They might have fudged some information or taken freebies from hotel / restaurant owners .
I have no way of knowing .
There is huge demand to be a guidebook writer , because of the glamor associated with travel writing .
Most guidebook authors are paid very little , and are required to cover a lot of places in a short period of time .
I met one guy who was working on the Australia book for Let ’ Go .
We were both in Coober Peady , SA .
He was there for a day , and I was there for four days .
We both had access to the same information .
He was gathering up everything he could before he had to take off and go to the next place .
I probably experienced more of Coober Peady , but I was n’t trying to catalog as much information as I could .
Guidebooks are not reviews .
Guidebook authors do not visit the vast majority of restaurants , hotels , and attractions they write about .
They ca n’t tell if you if a place is good , just that it exists and contact info .
If you want reviews of place , you have to go online .
Do I trust the collective wisdom of hundreds and thousands of people , or a single person ?
I ’ll take the mob .
If a hotel is consistently getting rated poorly online , that is level of information you ’ll never get from a book .
The mob also does a good job with sites like Wikitravel .
I have personally updated some of the entries on the Solomon Island and East Timor , which I found to be out of date .
You have no way of knowing that I was the person providing the information of course .
Can wikis have incorrect information ?
Yes .
So far , however , I ’ve found them to be reliable .
( Prediction , Lonely Planet or someone else will eventually use these user created information banks to gather information and publish books using this content , bypassing individual authors completely .
This will totally remove biggest cost associated with information gathering . )
Most importantly , it really is n’t that hard to get information once you are at a location .
The more popular the place is , the easier it is to get information .
In somewhere like Bali , you will have people falling all over themselves give you brochures , which is the exact same information which goes into a guidebook .
Finally , all guidebooks are second hand information .
Online you can get primary information .
Via the web can you get hotel , park , or airline information directly from the source .
Cost and Weight
Guidebooks are expensive and heavy .
If you buy in a bookstore , you can easily spend $ 20 - 40 on a book .
( much less at Amazon ) .
Some of the thicker books can weight over a kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) .
That is not trivial when you are traveling .
If you are going to many different places , that can all add up .
Given the amount of money you spend on a book , you could spend hours at an internet cafe getting the same information ( and of course , it will cost nothing if you get it before you leave ) .
Ultimately , guidebooks sell because of fear and uncertainty .
When you go someplace you ’ve never been , you want to have some certainty about where to go and what to do before you show up .
I still feel the same thing before I go somewhere new .
However , I have come to learn that I can get by just fine by asking questions on the ground and doing some research online .
I ’ve arrived in many places with no accommodations booked ahead of time and had no problem finding a place to stay .
Smugness has nothing to do with it .
Guidebooks may have made sense back when Lonely Planet was founded in the 70’s .
Today , they are a vestigial reminder of a pre-internet era .
Be the author of your own guidebook and leave the Lonely Planet at home .
I am glad to announce that
we just released a new version of NDepend where the analysis phase
duration has been divided by 4 and the memory consumption has been divided by
2 .
An interesting question is : Does such a massive performance gain means that it was badly coded the first time ?
Previous slower versions met several thousands of functional
requirement needed to analyze properly any .NET application .
In this
sense , it was nicely coded .
But still , there
were room for improvement and my believe is that there is always room for better performance .
Even on the current much faster
version we identified several significant optimizations to be done .
The downside
is that this will require a lot of work .
So the first lesson learned
is that there is always room for better
performance .
We can complete this rule with the fact that the amount of work to make a program run
faster grows exponentially with the gain expected .
We quantified each
performance gain source and we obtained this chart .
As said we have a 75 % gain obtained
thanks to algorithm optimization , micro-optimization and parallelization .
The
current analysis duration ( 25 % of the original analysis duration ) can be split between 17 % of the time spent in our
code , and 8 % of the time spent in tier code .
In our case , tier code is the code of
Mono .
Cecil ,
used to build some object models of the assemblies analyzed .
The bulk of performance
was obtained with algorithm improvement and this is not a surprise .
IMHO the
surprise comes from the relatively small gain obtained from parallelization .
Indeed ,
we did some massive refactoring to parallelized the analysis with the parallel monologue idea in mind .
Now each
assembly is analyzed as a task that does n’t have any synchronization need with any
other task .
In other words each task uses its own states that are not visible
from the other tasks .
Unfortunately this requirement is not enough to ensure
proper scaling on the number of processor .
While we get the 15 % gain from
between 1 and 2 processors , the gain is almost zero between 2 and 4 processors .
We identified some potential IO contentions and memory issues
that will require more attention in the future .
This leads to another lesson :
Do n’t expect that scaling on many processors
will be something easy , even if you do n’t share states and do n’t use
synchronization .
When it comes to
enhancing performance there is only one way to do things right : measure and focus your work on the part
of the code that really takes the
bulk of time , not the one that you think
takes the bulk of time .
I have a quick real - world illustration .
Personally I
have always been amazed by the performance of the C# and VB.NET compilers .
Imagine , it can compile in a few
seconds thousands of source files that took dozens or even hundreds of man-year
to be written .
At analysis time , NDepend needs also to parse sources files but
it does it partially to only obtain comment and Cyclomatic Complexity metrics .
By measuring file loading time
we had a good surprise : loading source file in memory is much cheaper than
expected .
For example , to load the 1728 C# sources files of NDepend it takes
less than 0.2 seconds on the 13 seconds needed for a complete analysis of its own code .
Now , knowing
that it is almost free to load the source files in memory I am a bit less
impressed by the performance of the C# and VB.NET compilers .
And it leads to an
important lesson : NEVER anticipate the
performance cost , ALWAYS measure it .
And the only professional way to
measure is to rely on performance profiler tools .
Actually , we use both
dotTrace from JetBrain and Red-Gate ANTS Profiler and are happy with it .
Something important
concerning the measure of code performance is the percentage of time spent
inside tier code , things like DB or network access .
As we explained in the previous chart , in our case study
35 % of the analysis time is spent inside the Cecil code .
We can infer from this
number that if we want to have an analysis duration divided by 2 in the future ,
our code will need to run 4.3 faster !
( ( 100 – 35 ) / ( 50 - 35 ) = 4,3 ) .
This
clearly shows the importance of another lesson : assess your limits by measuring the percentage of time spent in tier code .
In the dissection of
performance gain , an interesting point is the 15 % gain obtained from
micro-optimization .
I mean things like using the right kind of loop , using the right kind of
collection , preferring to deal with primitive
CLR objects as int and string ( POCO idea ) , choosing carefully between structures and classes , buffering
properties getter results into local variables or even exposing
non-private fields .
I could summarized
the lesson learned by the fact that micro-optimizations
are worth it while premature optimizations are the root of evil ( as Donald Knuth said a long time ago ) .
The
difference between micro-optimizations and premature optimizations is that the
first ones are driven by measurement while the second ones are driven by
guesses , intuitions and hunches .
Something not quantified
in our performance gain is the fact that memory consumption has been roughly
divided by 2 .
Less memory does n’t necessarily means less managed objects but in
our particular case we do allocate
less objects .
The nice consequence is that less objects means less time spent in the
GC .
Less memory also means less virtual memory page fault , which is IMHO the
worst thing when it comes to polish performances of a program .
Finally , we are now experiencing a
great advantage of optimization : automatic tests naturally ran
much faster and it is a good motivation to run them more often !
I end up with an illustration of the tenet there is always room
for better performance : the Amiga demo scene in which I
participated in the early nineties .
Every demos ran on a constant
hardware .
It was the perfect incentive for
demo developers to produce code more and more optimized .
During several
years , every months
some record were beaten , like the number of 3D polygons , the number of
sprites
or the number of dots displayed simultaneously at the rate of 50 frames
per
seconds .
As far as I can estimate , the performance factor obtained in a
few years was something around x50 !
Imagine what

Advertisement Former senior defence official Theoneste Bagosora has been convicted of instigating Rwanda 's 1994 genocide and sentenced to life in prison .
Bagosora and two co-defendants were found by a UN tribunal to have led a committee that plotted the massacre of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus .
It is the first time the Rwanda tribunal has convicted anyone of organising the killings .
More than 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda 's genocide .
Along with Bagosora , former military commanders Anatole Nsegiyumva and Alloys Ntabakuze were also found guilty of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , and given life sentences .
RWANDA'S 1994 GENOCIDE
6 April : Rwandan Hutu President Habyarimana killed when plane shot down April - July : An estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus killed July : Tutsi-led rebel movement RPF captures Rwanda 's capital Kigali July : Two million Hutus flee to Zaire , now DR Congo
Rwanda verdict : Your views Rwanda 's 100 days of genocide Bagosora , 67 , and the two senior military officers were found to have organised , trained and armed the Interahamwe militia , which was responsible for most of the killing .
They were also responsible for drawing up a list of Tutsis and moderate Hutus who opposed their vision of an ethnically pure Rwanda .
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ( ICTR ) , based in Tanzania , rejected the defence 's argument that the killing was not organised , and therefore not genocide .
Bagosora 's lawyer , Raphael Constant , said his client would appeal against the verdict .
Brigadier Gratien Kabiligi , the former chief of military operations , who was on trial with Bagosora and the two other men , was cleared of all charges and ordered to be released from custody immediately .
In another verdict on Thursday , the tribunal sentenced Protais Zigiranyirazo , 57 , to 20 years in jail for his part in the genocide .
Mr Zigiranyirazo , a brother - in - law of former President Juvenal Habyarimana , was accused of ordering Hutus to kill 48 people in two incidents .
' Principal enemy '
The Rwandan government said it was " satisfied " with the court 's decision to impose a life sentence on Bagosora .
The Rwandan representative to the ICTR , Aloys Mutabingwa , said " justice has been delivered " but added that the acquittal of Kabiligi was " surprising " .
" The court ruled that Bagosora had the authority over the killers .
It is the most important thing ...
There can never be genocide without planning , " he said .
Prosecutors said Bagosora assumed control of military and political affairs in Rwanda when President Habyarimana 's plane was shot down in 1994 - the catalyst for the genocide .
However , the indictment alleges that he began planning the massacre as far back as 1990 .
BAGOSORA TRIAL Theoneste Bagosora on trial with three others 409 trial days 30,000 pages of transcripts 242 witnesses heard 1,600 exhibits 300 written decisions Most material translated into French , English and Kinyarwanda
Profile : Col Theoneste Bagosora
The following year , Bagosora helped draft a document circulated within the army that described Tutsis as " the principal enemy " .
Canadian General Romeo Dallaire , head of UN peacekeepers in Rwanda at the time , described Mr Bagosora as a " known extremist " and the " kingpin " behind the genocide .
Bagosora has been in custody since 1996 , when he was arrested in Cameroon where he was in self - imposed exile .
The trial , which began in 2002 , was expected to last two years .
The tribunal , which has come to play a key part in the process of justice and reconciliation , has so far convicted 34 people and acquitted six others .
Twenty - three remain on trial and eight trials have yet to begin before the tribunal winds up next year .
The effects of the genocide are still being felt in the region , in particular across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Some of the Hutu militias involved in the genocide fled to DR Congo , where Tutsi rebels , allegedly with some Rwandan backing , refuse to lay down their arms , saying they are being attacked by the Hutu fighters .
Some 300,000 people have fled their homes in DR Congo this year because of this conflict .
• Correction :
An earlier version of this story displayed an image and video clip of a defendant identified as Theoneste Bagosora .
In fact both showed pictures of another defendant , also sentenced to jail for his part in the genocide .
We apologise for any confusion .

Uncle Eddie ’s Vegan Cookies is the latest victim of the Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak , recalling its über - delicious Uncle Eddies Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate - Chip Cookies because they contain peanut butter supplied by Peanut Corporation of America .
[ social_buttons ]
The recent Salmonella outbreak initially seemed to be confined to the mainstream food system , but with the recall of Clif and Luna bars , people are starting to realize that just because you buy natural foods , you are n’t any safer from some inherent weaknesses in our supply chain .
When a product from one factory can infect hundreds , possibly thousands , of people all over the country , our reach is too big .
We ca n’t possibly be ensured of the safety of our food with a system like ours .
The FDA has determined that PCA distributed potentially contaminated product to more than 100 consignee firms , for use as an ingredient in hundreds of different products , such as cookies , crackers , cereal , candy and ice cream .
Natural products affected by the peanut butter recall so far :
Uncle Eddies Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate - Chip Cookies 12 oz .

All of the recall press releases , starting with those straight from PCA , the originator of the outbreak , say ‘ voluntary recall ‘ .
As if it was their idea .
Gimme a break …
As a reminder of what we ’re dealing with ( it ’s not something to take lightly if you have kids or elderly family ) , here ’s the wording on the recall about Salmonella :
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children , the frail or elderly , and others with weakened immune systems .
Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever , diarrhea ( which may be bloody ) , nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain .
In rare circumstances , infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections ( i.e. , infected aneurysms ) , endocarditis and arthritis .
The FDA maintains a searchable database for peanut butter product recalls , and you can subscribe to the FDA Recall RSS feed to get the latest updates in your news reader .
I do n’t think we ’ve seen the end of this yet .
And guess where else you can find the FDA recall information ?
On Twitter .
Yep .

Global recession - where did all the money go ?
Bridgeman Art Library
IT CONTAINS no military adventures nor epic journeys .
Yet “ The Tale of Genji ” is in every way Japan 's equivalent of Homer 's “ Iliad ” .
First mentioned in a diary exactly 1,000 years ago , in late 1008 , it has over the centuries been subject to changes , adaptations , mutations and translations ( not to mention being remade as a manga comic ) , all of which have helped it not just survive , but flourish .
Today this account of the amorous escapades of an aristocratic aesthete is widely regarded as the first modern or psychological novel .
The book 's success lies in its broad appeal .
Right - wing Japanese commentators point to “ The Tale of Genji ” and take great pride in emphasising how much more sophisticated civilisation was in Japan in the 11th century compared with Europe at that time .
For middle - aged Japanese , reading the book at study groups in adult - education centres is as popular , and as quintessentially Japanese , as flower - arranging or the tea ceremony .
Feminists rejoice that the author , Murasaki Shikibu , was a woman , even if writing fiction was generally regarded as frivolous and lowbrow ; not an activity for men .
The book 's 1,000th anniversary is being celebrated in Japan with lectures , symposia , plays , conferences and concerts .
A line of Genji tea and Genji sweets is already on the market and the CD of a newly composed Genji symphony goes on sale this month .
Ruthlessly summarised , the book 's storyline goes like this .
The “ dazzlingly lovely ” Genji , son of the emperor and one of his lower - grade consorts , is irresistible to women .
He enjoys a string of affairs as a young man , even abducting a ten - year - old girl so he can mould her into the perfect life - companion .
But sleeping with the daughter of the leader of the opposing political faction is one indiscretion too many and Genji is forced into exile .
Recalled eventually to the capital , he builds himself a mansion with a different woman in each of its four wings .
Honours are heaped upon him and he is offered the retired emperor 's daughter as a wife .
But Genji's royal bride betrays him with another man and when his beloved mistress dies after a long illness , our heartbroken hero follows her swiftly to the grave .
At this point the reader is only two - thirds of the way through the book , which runs to 1,200 pages in its most recent English translation and boasts a cast of more than 400 .
The story resumes with new heroes .
Two young men ( the purported son and grandson of Genji ) are wooing a trio of sisters .
One of them succumbs to marriage , but of the other two sisters , one starves herself to death and the other chooses to become a nun rather than fall into male hands .
Love , it turns out , is not innocent hanky - panky , but something noxious , corrosive — even deadly .
Sheer scale is not all that is forbidding about the book .
Japanese prose was still in its infancy in Murasaki 's day , so her syntax can be opaque .
Sentences lack subjects , direct speech is often unattributed and , most alarmingly , the characters change names according to their rank or circumstances .
Genji , for instance , is variously referred to as the captain , the consultant , the commander , the grand counsellor , the palace minister , the chancellor and the honorary retired emperor .
The subject matter is also challenging .
There is polygamy , bisexuality ( when one young woman rebuffs his advances , Genji consoles himself with her younger brother who turns out to be “ no bad substitute for his ungracious sister ” ) and something very close to incest .
Genji is attracted to Fujitsubo , one of his father 's consorts , because of her resemblance to his dead mother .
Even though she is , in effect , his stepmother , he fathers a child with her .
Murasaki 's language was already archaic and impenetrable a century after it was written , so the Japanese have been reading annotated , abridged , simplified and illustrated versions of the book since as early as the 12th century .
The same holds true today .
In the last century , four Japanese writers produced a total of seven updated versions of the book .
The most recent of these was by Jakucho Setouchi , a female novelist whose own work deals with issues of women 's independence .
Setouchi's “ Genji ” has sold more than 3 m copies since it was published in December 1996 , a success that Kodansha , the publisher , attributes to the author 's empathy with the women in the tale and her colloquial writing .
Canny marketing also played a part , with Kodansha organising lectures and discussion groups all over the country at the time of the launch .
Freer and less reverential adaptations exist as well .
Also from Kodansha is Waki Yamato's “ Fleeting Dreams ” , a “ sugar and spice and all things nice ” take on Genji in manga form that has sold 17 m copies .
For those who prefer a less saccharine approach , Shogakukan , a rival publisher , came up with another manga version that emphasises the malicious female characters and includes plenty of explicit sex .
It took until the 20th century before a complete English - language version appeared .
Arthur Waley , a Cambridge classicist who taught himself Japanese and Chinese , produced the first English translation in six instalments between 1925 and 1933 .
Waley was much more interested in readability than fidelity .
He sped up the plot , cut long descriptive scenes and the occasional entire chapter .
He clarified many of the sentences , added psychological background to the characters and westernised the Japanese architecture .
The result was a prose masterpiece , though one which modern scholars prefer to call an adaptation rather than a translation .
Lytton Strachey , a neighbour of Waley's , considered his translation “ beautiful in bits ” , but the reaction from Japan was much warmer .
Even if Waley 's Japanese noblemen sound a little like early - 20th - century Cambridge undergraduates , one contemporary Japanese writer famously declared that the Englishman had breathed life into a work that had been tottering around like a headless corpse .
Indeed , Waley 's stature in Japan is such that Heibonsha , another publisher , recently released a retranslation of Waley 's “ Genji ” back into Japanese .
“ Even in the modern - language versions of ‘ Genji ' , the majority of Japanese readers do n't make it much past the opening chapters , ” explains Takao Hoshina , an editor at Heibonsha .
“ Waley 's is the most accessible version for us too . ”
In 1976 Edward Seidensticker , an academic already celebrated for his translations of Yasunari Kawabata , a Nobel prize - winning novelist , brought out a new version .
Torn between admiration for Waley 's narrative verve and horror at the liberties he had taken with the text , Seidensticker produced a “ Genji ” that was doggedly faithful but a little lacking in grace .
It was left to Royall Tyler , whose charming and urbane “ Genji ” came out in 2001 , to chart the course between the exuberance and the exactitude of his two predecessors .
Perhaps because he lives in the Australian bush , Mr Tyler was willing to recognise that readers can lose their way in the novel 's vastness and so provides a handy kit of orientation tools : chapter - by - chapter lists of the characters and footnotes to explain the imagery of the poems dotted throughout the text .
“ The Tale of Genji ” rewards perseverance , but just as young Genji flits from one mistress to the next , so the reader can choose between the three English versions of the story .
Effervescent Waley , prim Seidensticker or suave Tyler — who will you take to bed with you tonight ?

Did your high school athletic trainer look like this ?
Mine neither .
In fact my school did n't have a full - time trainer , which meant no blow jobs .
It 's different for Tustin High athletes .
Here 's Hope Jacoby , 23 , an athletic trainer at Tustin High School ( Calif . ) who was arrested recently on suspicion of engaging in sex acts with an underage boy .
She has worked with athletes at the school for a year , according to the Los Angeles Times , and that may be an understatement .
Oh , and she was busted in the way we have all become accustomed : Sending photos of herself to students via text message .
Way to finish out 2008 , Hope !
Hope Jacoby , 23 , who has worked with athletes at the school for the last year , was arrested last week on suspicion of oral copulation of a minor and unlawful sex with a minor , said Orange County Sheriff 's Department spokesman Jim Amormino .
Sheriff 's deputies were informed of the unlawful acts by someone who saw a text message photograph , Amormino said .
The boy was between 14 and 17 years old .

When you add up the true costs of junk mail — paper , printing , delivery , and disposal ( 44 percent winds up in landfills unopened ) — you get 51.5 metric tons of greenhouse gases each year , the equivalent of 11 coal - fired plants or 9.4 million cars .
But while there ’s been a national Do Not Call registry since 2003 , Congress has yet to do the same for paper solicitations .
The USPS , in concert with the Direct Marketing Association , has successfully stalled efforts in at least 18 states to create Do Not Mail registries ; Postmaster General John Potter has argued that “ nothing is more targetable than the mail …
And you do n’t have to worry about filters . ”
The environmental group ForestEthics has launched an online petition ( at DoNotMail.org ) to push Congress to heed the majority of Americans ( nearly 90 percent , according to a 2007 Zogby poll ) who favor a registry ; more than 64,000 have signed so far .
For now , the junk - mail averse can remove their addresses from some lists via sites like GreenDimes .

For the millions around the world who can't wait to see the back of George W Bush , Muntader al - Zaidi has become a hero .
He is the Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at the US President during his final press conference in Baghdad , shouting , " This is a farewell kiss , you dog !
This is from the widows , the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq . "
YouTube videos of the incident have been viewed at least five million times , and a hastily launched internet game called " Sock and Awe " , in which players try to knock out the President by throwing virtual shoes at him , was so popular it crashed the website of its creators .
A Saudi businessman was reported to have offered $ 10 m for one of the shoes .
Mr Zaidi has been proposed as the next president of Iraq , awarded a prize in Libya and offered sanctuary by Venezuela 's President Hugo Chávez , never slow to come forward when there 's Bush - hating to be done .
Iraqis bearing shoes on poles filled the streets in support of the TV journalist , who was taken into custody .
Anyone who saw Iraqis taking off their footwear to beat Saddam Hussein 's effigy will know that the shoe - thrower intended to deliver a mortal insult .
Calling someone a " dog " in Muslim societies , where dogs are considered unclean , is equally offensive .
Mr Bush showed admirable reflexes in ducking the first shoe – the second was off - target – and sought to make light of the affair , saying : " So what if the guy threw a shoe at me ? "
Later he joked that " it was a size 10 " and , in a play on his warm words about an early encounter with Vladimir Putin , said he had " seen his sole " .
But just as his effusiveness about the chilly Russian President came to seem naive , his flippancy about the shoe attack might look misplaced if Mr Zaidi is mistreated .
The government of Nouri al - Maliki , the Iraqi Prime Minister , who was next to Mr Bush at the press conference , was far from amused .
An investigating judge who saw the journalist said he bore signs of having been beaten , and his family claimed that he had been coerced into making an apology to the President .

Mr Zaidi could be tried for insulting and attempting to assault a foreign leader .
So should the White House seek clemency for him ?
Mr Bush 's press secretary , Dana Perino , said he had " no hard feelings " about the incident .
But she also said that " the President believes that Iraq is a sovereign country , a democratic country , and they will have a process that they follow on this " .
Questioned further , she said : " I do n't know what their constitution says about pardons . "
The answer is that President Jalal Talabani could pardon the hapless journalist at the Prime Minister 's request – but there would have to be a conviction first .

Saw " Employee of the Month " last night .
Do not see this movie .
In fact , do n't even post about it on the Internet .
In fact , after reading this post , please neglect to transfer it to your long or short term memory centers .
Jessica Simpson and Dane Cook both turned in perfect performances .
That is to say , the script explicitly called for an inability to act - a skill which both leads have in quantity .
Here is a list of things I would rather do than see this movie again , ordered from most to least pleasant .
1 ) Gouging out my eyes
2 ) Committing seppuku
3 ) Seeing 1/2 of " Employee of the Month "
That said , all things being equal , if you are a fan of predictable plots , unfortunate acting , and casual sex / racism ... well ... still do n't see it .
Because , if you are looking for those things , you 're probably only sitting in the theater to look at the pretty girl ( a pursuit that you will find similar to reading a Where 's Waldo book ) .
Do n't see it .
If you 've seen it , get your money back .
If you already got your money back , see if you can get more .
Poutine was once a regional dish we simply had to treat ourselves to while visiting Quebec or eastern Canada .
These days it can be found all around Toronto .
And why not ?
The dish is not only a crowd - pleasing , artery - clogging home run , like pizza , chicken wings and nachos , it 's also patriotic .
A toque - wearing Canuck eating poutine is as iconic as a Parisian in a beret nibbling a croissant .
Smoke 's Poutinerie has successfully muscled in on the action down in office / club land .
Serving nothing but poutine and pop , Smoke 's is the current big man on campus during lunch rush .
Every weekday , the dedicated poutinerie goes toe to toe with its downstairs neighbour , fan - favourite Burrito Boyz , some days going through as much as 1,000 pounds of potatoes .
Both businesses stay open until past last call on the weekend .
All those potatoes smothered in gravy probably do as much to sop up late - night drunken hooliganism as the high - profile police presence in clubland .
The poutinerie offers more than a dozen variations of varying kitschiness on the basic formula .
Of course , this business is going to live or die on its essential dish .
The three ingredients in basic poutine each has to be great or it's a waste of stomach space .
Get them right and then we can talk about the curried chicken version .
Owner Ryan Smolkin receives deliveries every day so immediate demand is helping to keep up quality .
The cheese curds are not just squeaky but properly mixed in , rather than sitting on top .
Smoke 's fries are crispy but with plenty of " meat " on them .
The beef / chicken gravy is thick but not so shaped by cornstarch that it solidifies once it hits the table .
The fries are packaged up in cardboard boxes , generously piled high with all active ingredients .
So the basic ( $ 5.95 ) is a success .
" The Montreal " ( $ 7.95 ) resembles a Schwartz 's smoked meat sandwich the way that Play - Doh resembles any type of real food .
The thin strips of pink , rubbery beef are smoked meat in name only .
And a full sour pickle placed on top is instantly steamed .
A vegetarian option ( $ 5.95 ) extracts major potency out of mushrooms to make gravy that will not leave vegetarians out in the cold .
Sorry vegans , you are out of luck .
A poutinerie is no place for vegans .
Sweet , shreddy pork tops a simple variation ( $ 8.95 ) .
The young man who recommends it also promises that the package will keep for my 10 - minute walk home .
Most people would want to consume fries on the spot , but a good chunk of the crowd are bringing the murderous mounds back to their cubicles .
True to the young man 's word , the gravy and cheese remain warm 10 minutes later and some of the fries are even still crispy .
Often I eat alone in restaurants .
Like a sassy , undersexed sitcom neighbour , I do a lot of eavesdropping .
Two topics keep coming up at Smoke's .
One is that the portions are large .
True , I notice , glancing around the room , that these portions are rarely finished .
The second topic is the drunkard 's relationship to the dish .
Often overheard are comments like " This would be so good if I were drunk , " or " The best poutine I ever had was at so - and - so's , though I was really drunk . "
Toronto , I do n't know how you do your job , but I try to do mine sober .
Fortunately , Smoke 's is open until 4 a.m. on Friday and Saturday .
So you 'll have every opportunity to test - drive the poutine in its natural habitat .
Be warned , there will likely be other drunken people there , too .
Perhaps , by the time you read these words , I am no longer alive .
Perhaps this is my fate , to perish in service , felled by a potato .
If it has come to pass that you are reading my final words while my body lies in the morgue , veins clogged with gravy , heart surrounded by melted cheese , ankles puffy , I want you to know that it was worth it .
And it was an honour serving you .

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will not allow their six children to watch television so they wo n’t ask for toys .
Papa Pitt Brad explained to sources :
“ The kids do n’t ask for big gifts for the simple reason that they do n’t see a lot of American cartoon television , which is packed with all those manipulative commercials for big toys that look so fantastic .
“ When they do see that stuff is when they start asking for toys , so we figure if they do n’t see them they wo n’t know they ’re there . ”
Interesting … Tell us what you think ?
Sanders : Socialism for Rich , Free Enterprise for Poor
Bernie Sanders , the socialist senator from Vermont , makes a point I have n't heard anywhere else in his response to the bailout plan :
We must end the danger posed by companies that are " too big too fail , " that is , companies whose failure would cause systemic harm to the U.S. economy .
If a company is too big to fail , it is too big to exist .
We need to determine which companies fall in this category and then break them up .
Right now , for example , the Bank of America , the nation 's largest depository institution , has absorbed Countrywide , the nation 's largest mortgage lender , and Merrill Lynch , the nation 's largest brokerage house .
We should not be trying to solve the current financial crisis by creating even larger , more powerful institutions .
Their failure could cause even more harm to the entire economy .
Sanders strongly opposes the bailout , calling it " socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor . "
He 's right that the phrase " too big to fail " -- which is practically accepted wisdom at this point among Republicans and Democrats alike -- is a compelling argument to break these ginormous companies up .
That would be a massive intrusion into the free market by government , of course , but so is making taxpayers assume the debt for private companies that drove themselves to ruin .
Comments
Government rationale for existence , regardless of where one 's belief system lies on the quad , is to provide services for the common good , most explicitly security and well - being .
If this is true then allowing companies become too big to fail is a failure of government and as such must be corrected .
The elites of every country tend to do well unless they are deposed or lose a war with another group of elites but even then the losing elite (s ) will often continue living an opulent life style .
Hey !!!!
The elite class of every country / religion / cult / any type of social organization lives well and works less by skimming from the labors of the common classes .
That is what Marx and Engels tried to tell us !!!!
Those two should have stopped there rather than trying to concoct a cure for those burdensome elites .
Maybe elite classes are inevitable .
It 's just a shame elites are so ready to brainwash , then up to murdering masses of common folks so as to enable them to maintain the status quo that is so beneficial to the elites .
I admit that some groups of elites are kinder than others .
Sure can't compare American elites with the acts of Idi Amin , Stalin , Hitler , Pol Pot , etc. etc. etc .
But , the USA 's elite class HAS murdered common Americans to maintain the status quo .
Just look in the history books .
Even women and children have died at the hands of jack - booted thugs , representatives of the elite class , to ensure that wealth and power remained in the hands of the elites .
Please , my fellow citizens .
All I wish is that you attempt to cast off the years of indoctrination , the brainwashing all of us undergo to convince us that the way things are is correct , proper ... as it should be .
From schooling to the mass media to general culture ... we are constantly bombarded that the present status quo is the only RIGHT way to handle things .
Educate yourselves !!!
Do n't let the self - centered greedy elite class do your thinking for you .
Do n't let the Rush Limbaugh's of the world implant their propaganda .
Those folks are merely shills for the elite class !!!
I remain convinced that the greatest threat to our freedoms is our own elite class ; more of a threat than all foreign terrorists combined .
OB says , " ...
Do n't let the Rush Limbaugh's of the world implant their propaganda .
Those folks are merely shills for the elite class !!! "
I think this is a perfect example of the type of idiocy that turns the Democratic party of Liberal Progressives Whatever into fools .
Fannie Mae and Freddy are the elite " businesses " under discussion , and it is common knowledge that Chris Dodd ( Dem ) , their regulating chairman , has received the second highest amount of " campaign contributions " from those elitist businesses .
The highest pay - off ( sorry " elite donation " ) received is by Barrack Hussein Obama !
Talk about " Elitists " and they can't resist trying to point their boney - finger - of - accusation at Limbaugh , Republicans and the rightwing !
The creeps do n't even know that Limbaugh is talking out against such bailouts , or that it is the Democrats who are the " elite " who support these socialist schemes !
Carter started this particalar " Elitist " ball rolling to make Democrats rich and get votes .
Expanded by Clinton
When Bush tried to tighten restrictions ?
He met Democratic intransigence
No , the vast majority of Democratics are just like those on the Retort and here -- being too smart and educated to bothered by any facts , but just the sort of elitist - wannabes that will lie in order to defame a conservative to hide their ignorance and hateful prejudices !
Meanwhile , from whatever part of the " quad " , anyone can see who the liars and elitists just happen to be who are off - the - square .... as they attempt to lose in Iraq for votes , and to hell with the impact on our SECURITY .
For votes , the intransigent Left attempts subversion of the success of our commander - in - chief in war ...
Anti-patriotic , ignorant hypocrites ... those who still maintain themselves as such examples of intransigent Yellow - Dogism ...
Rogers ,
There was a good segment on Democracy Now , today :
Sen. Bernie Sanders , Robert Scheer and Dean Baker on the Proposed $ 700 Billion Bailout of Wall Street , the Largest Government Bailout of Private Industry in US History
www.democracynow.org
All of these firms should be allowed to fail , with the pieces being picked up at firesale prices by smarter survivors .
There 's also way , way too much concern over propping up housing values .
In lots of places , it would be a positive benefit for house values to drop to the floor - here in Maryland , it might then be possible for normal people to buy homes .
As it stands now , you have to go into major debt to buy a small townhome or condo , and then hope that its value increases enough to allow you move up the chain towards a house .
If there is n't a *** SPECIAL ***
Prosecutor to investigate this fiasco , then you 'll know that the United States of America is controlled by the very " elitist rich " who run the regulation and *** investigations * ** right now , right this very minute .
The very ones who have run away from the problem until after the election !
How is that defending our security ?
How is that solving the nation 's problems of world shaking significance ?
Trying to pretend that they need more REGULATION , and that they be put in - charge !
Is n't that the typical Democratic attitude towards the public ?
That the public is just too dumb to know that they are suggesting that the progressive , socialist fox be put in - charge of guarding the henhouse ...!
Thank God for the internet and where the Democrats can't hide the facts completely , and which they have previously controlled through their media stooges : print and television .
Now , the facts show that it is Democrats and Democrat socialism which has caused this economic attack ; attack by socialism against the economic system of the USA : capitalism .
Solution from Democrats : Regulate the theft by putting the thieves in charge of the problem , and MORE SOCIALISM IN MEDICINE
How will it be when you can't get a prescription because the government is bankrupt from this socialism attack on the USA 's form of economics .... ?
They will refuse you treatment because MANDATORY TESTS show that you have used a banned substance , own a gun , smoke outside your own door on your own property , or any other reason they can find or invent !
It will cost our children 's children 's children more and more trillions on trillions that welfare and " benefit " bike paths are already costing ....
Well , it is n't surprising that they will go for the security , and since Democrats have been relinguishing their individual freedoms since the " New Deal " , the " Great Society " and ending in " Government Bankruptcy " ... for " benefits " and to win votes for team over nation .
What did that great hero of Leftist Vietnam say , " Stupid is as stupid does ... "
As it stands now , you have to go into major debt to buy a small townhome or condo , and then hope that its value increases enough to allow you move up the chain towards a house .
I know people whose affluence has been built on moving into a series of more expensive homes , each selling for enough of a profit to afford the next one .
Even though it worked ( they have n't moved during the housing bust ) , I found the whole concept unnerving .
Hey , I 'm a realtor , and I 've had a ringside seat to this whole mess .
I may be the only realtor in the UT campus area of Austin who did n't make a killing by buying huge places I never could have afforded with interest - only loans , improving them and selling them for a huge profit .
Like a moron I just bought normal houses to live in and still made very nice profits from them , just not fuck - you money profits .
Silly me .
Even though predictions about Austin 's market seem to agree that we 're in for a 5 % upswing in 2008 across the board , and we 've never seen the crazy 20 - 30 % per year jumps that other markets have , the market here feels completely dead .
It is dead around the campus ; no one wants to pay 20 % down on a campus condo , especially now that they 've overbuilt the rental property and rents will drop drastically for a long time on brand new product , and even more so on older stuff .
I 'm going to have to find something else to do for a living .
Anyone need someone killed ?
I 'm not very good at it ( as far as I know - never actually tried it ) but I 'd like to think I 'm emotionally retarded enough to not feel guilty .
" We do not support government bailouts of private institutions .
Government interference in the markets exacerbates problems in the marketplace and causes the free market to take longer to correct itself . "

Tadowe ...
Do you also type John Sidney McCain ?
ILA needs to know , " Tadowe ...
Do you also type John Sidney McCain ? "
I think those who attempt to make me into the subject of comment confirm the effectiveness of my own commentary .
Thanks for showing your newborn obsession with me .
I 've faced the facts about McCain .
He was n't a hero in Vietnam , he showed his weakness in confessing war crimes to the NVA communists in order to get treatment for his crash injuries ; serious enough that he could have lost his leg to gangrene and even die from it .
After his leg was saved , he continued to assist the NVA and received better treatment than the other prisoners , who had n't confessed .
He did share what extras were given him .
All his fellow servicemen understand why he confessed because they were a heartbeat away from being tortured into treason themselves .
However , none think he was a " Hero " for his weakness .
You all can't say anything about that , though , although you would love to ( some idiots may try anyway ) .
Not because John McCain was a sailor tortured into treason , but because your party of Progressive Leftists and radical Democrats of that time were marching in the street assisting the NVA to win in Vietnam -- traitors to the USA without being tortured into it !
HO HO Ho Chi Minh !
The NLF is Going to Win !!!
Hey !
Hey !
LBJ How Many Kids Did You Kill Today ???
You Leftist Progressive Democrats think you are the heroes for helping the North Vietnamese win against freedom and liberty in South Vietnam .
That 's why I'm the subject for the subversives of the communist loving Left .

Genetically engineered peanuts may help fight the most common cause of fatal allergic reactions to food in the United States .
While the research is unlikely to result in the creation of completely allergen - free peanuts , it could result in fewer outbreaks and even fewer deaths .
For years now , government scientists have been testing ordinary peanuts in the hope of finding one that cannot cause the deadly allergic reactions which kill more than 50 Americans every year .
But nature may not be able to provide an answer .
Horticulture expert Peggy Ozias - Akins at the University of Georgia in Tifton is taking a different tack by using genetic engineering to grow hypoallergenic peanuts .
Most allergic reactions to peanuts are triggered by the same eleven molecules .
In theory , peanuts without the genes responsible for those molecules would be far less likely to trigger allergic reactions .
" Some proteins cause more severe allergic reactions than others , " said Ozias - Akins .
Tackling the worst offenders first , her team has made and tested peanuts that do not produce two proteins that are among the most intense allergens .
The research appears in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
The biologists shot a customized DNA sequence into the plants with a gene gun , causing the legumes to produce hairpin - shaped RNA molecules , which halt the production of the two proteins .
Messing with the genetic code of a plant could potentially cause the seeds to develop improperly , change the taste of the crop , or render it more susceptible to fungal infections .
But Ozias - Akins ' team found that they grow normally and can resist a common mold without any problems .
Still , getting rid of every allergy - causing substance in peanuts would not be easy , Ozias - Akins said .
" Given the number of allergenic proteins in peanuts , I doubt that developing an allergen - free peanut is realistic . "
Although it may be impossible to make a perfectly safe peanut , clipping the right genes out could make food accidents far less common .

Luke from Kotaku was right : I wanted so badly to , yes , love this game that perhaps its weaknesses - a cripplingly low frame rate and , yes , the onset of some serious tiltage needed to keep moving after the first few minutes - did n't fully sink in until I just could n't play past the fourth level while sitting on the can ( weeping ) .

But no matter - Namco / Bandai has dropped an update that almost entirely fixes our woes .
Framerate throughout has been greatly improved , with the only brief hiccups coming when you level up to the next size of Katamari - all else is smooth .
And in addition , even though I still stand by my preference of ILK 's tilt controls over Monkey Ball 's , a new gauge has been added to let you know where you are in the accelerometer 's X - Y tilt axes , which helps a lot .
Still , I wish there was a way to re-zero your acceleromter so you do n't have to tilt forward so much to roll at full speed , but even without that , Katamari is infinitely more playable now .

Montoya 's private army of assassins stands accused of hundreds of murders Colombia has extradited Diego Montoya , alleged to be one of the country 's most powerful drug lords , to the US to face trial for murder and drug trafficking .
The charges relate to Mr Montoya 's time as leader of the Norte del Valle cartel which , at its peak , reportedly exported 70 % of cocaine sold in the US and EU .
Known as Don Diego , he ran a private army accused of 1,500 murders .
At the time of his 2007 arrest by the Colombian military , he was on the FBI 's " 10 Most Wanted " list .
Mr Montoya arrived aboard a US military plane in Miami , where he is scheduled to appear in court on Monday to face 12 charges including drug trafficking , obstruction of justice , money - laundering and murder .
He faces at least 20 years in jail if convicted .
Earlier , television footage showed the handcuffed 50 - year - old in sunglasses and a jacket under a bulletproof vest , being escorted by heavily - armed Colombian police to a military airbase in Bogota .
There , he was handed over to agents of the US Drug Enforcement Administration , the DEA .
His extradition follows those of several other leading members of the cartel which Colombian authorities say has now been mostly dismantled .
Government coup With a $ 5 m ( £ 3.4 m ) reward advertised for the capture of the billionaire known in Colombia 's underworld as the " boss of bosses " , Mr Montoya was arrested in his home province of Valle del Cauca .
Colombia is closing a chapter in its fight against drug trafficking
General Oscar Naranjo
Colombian police chief
His capture was seen as a huge coup for the government , ending the reign of one of the legends of the Colombian underworld .
" Colombia is closing a chapter in its fight against drug trafficking , " police chief General Oscar Naranjo told AFP news agency after the extradition .
" This extradition is perhaps the most important in years . "
Officials say Mr Montoya helped found the Norte del Valle cartel , based near the city of Cali .
The FBI said the cartel received help from left - wing guerrillas and right - wing paramilitary groups .
While his army , the Macho Men , has been largely dismantled , the BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Colombia says Mr Montoya 's place and the drug smuggling routes he ran have been taken over by a new boss known by the alias Combatant .
Colombia may be claiming another victory on the war on drugs , our correspondent adds , but the flow of illegal narcotics continues largely unchanged .

Now the underground success of Muslim punk has resulted in a low - budget independent film based on the book .
A group of punk artists living in a communal house in Cleveland called the Tower of Treason offered the house as the set for the movie .
The crumbling streets and boarded - up storefronts of their neighborhood resemble parts of Buffalo .
Filming took place in October , and the movie will be released next year , said Eyad Zahra , the director .
“ To see these characters that used to live only inside my head out here walking around , and to think of all these kids living out parts of the book , it ’s totally surreal , ” Mr. Muhammad Knight , 31 , said as he roamed the movie set .
As part of the set , a Muslim punk rock musician , Marwan Kamel , 23 , painted “ Osama McDonald , ” a figure with Osama bin Laden ’s face atop Ronald McDonald ’s body .
Mr. Kamel said the painting was a protest against imperialism by American corporations and against Wahhabism , the strictest form of Islam .
Noureen DeWulf , 24 , an actress who plays a rocker in the movie , defended the film ’s message .
“ I ’m a Muslim and I ’m 100 - percent American , ” Ms. DeWulf said , “ so I can criticize my faith and my country .
Rebellion ?
Punk ?
This is totally American . ”
Ukraine is a key transit route of Russian gas to Europe President Viktor Yushchenko has said Ukraine has paid its debt to Gazprom in full , to prevent the Russian firm cutting off its gas supplies .
But Gazprom said it had not received the money so far and " it is too early to talk about debt repayment " .
Talks continued in Moscow as the two sides also need to agree on a price for 2009 gas supplies to Ukraine .
The Russian monopoly has threatened to cut off gas to Ukraine unless Ukraine signs a new contract by 1 January .
" The money will be transferred today , in two or three hours , " said a spokesman for Naftogaz .
Earlier , the Ukrainian government allowed Naftogaz to borrow up to $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) to pay the debt .
Gazprom has said Ukraine owes $ 1.67 bn ( £ 1.1 bn ) for gas and $ 450 m in fines for November - December supplies .
Earlier , Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller told Russian news television channel Vesti that " Gazprom will have no grounds for supplying gas to Ukraine " if it does not pay out its debt .
Ukraine is a key transit route of Russian gas to Europe , and it is feared that a supply cut could affect countries further west .
Gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of the European Union 's gas needs , or 42 % of EU 's gas imports .
A similar row between Gazprom and Ukraine in 2006 led to gas shortages in several EU countries .
Prices impact Gazprom supplies about one quarter of Europe 's gas Separately on Tuesday , Gazprom reported a solid rise in profits and sales following record gas and oil prices in the first half of the year .
For the six months to 30 June , net profit jumped 85 % to 609.4bn roubles ( $ 20.8bn , £ 14.2 bn ) compared with the same period in 2007 .
Sales rose 52 % to 1.74 trillion roubles on both higher prices and volumes .
However oil prices have slumped from July highs and most observers expect oil firms to see future profits slide .
The firm also said the credit crunch has affected its ability to attract loans .
" At the moment the management can not certainly assess the impact of further decrease in financial markets ' liquidity and the growing instability of foreign exchange and stock markets on the group 's financial state , " the company said in a statement .

Simpson wants to head off to college to study theology – and watching TV was her inspiration .
“ I ’ve been contemplating taking a college course in religion , ” the bubblehead told Marie Claire .
“ I love religion .
I remember whenever the book ‘ The Da Vinci Code ’ came out , the Discovery Channel did this three - night piece on it that I TiVoed and then watched eight times . ”
We just hope someone advises her not to include that bit in her application letter .

Update
This post is out of date .
If you 'd like to run Python on your Android device , please see my Android Scripting Environment project .
Here 's an early Christmas present for all those Python fanatics ( self included ) out there !
With a lot of help from my friends ( thanks Manuel and Thomas !)
I managed to install Python 2.4.5 on my G1 .
It 's still rough around the edges , but I think it 's a good start .
Klaus Reimer has a nice overview of how to cross -compile Python .
My instructions borrow a lot from his .
And here it is .
I 've uploaded the python2.4 binary I built for Android .
It 's missing lots of libraries , but it runs :)
I have n't corrected the build instructions yet , but I 'll hopefully get to that soon .
After I wrote and published my last article on writing a function to equalize heights in jQuery , I realized that the function would probably make a really useful jQuery plugin .
This is that plugin .
This is also my first attempt at a jQuery plugin , so I apologize in advance if I ’ve done something painfully stupid ( and painfully obvious ) to any and all plugin veterans out there .
Luckily , the functionality is extremely simple .
You can download the plugin here ( right - click and save the link ) .
You can see a demo of the plugin here .
The plugin ’s functionality is so simple because it ’s designed to do only one thing : set all elements you specify to the same height .
This plugin is slightly more sophisticated than the function I wrote earlier this week .
Instead of being stuck setting all your columns to the height of the tallest element , you can also ( optionally ) specify a minimum and maximum height you want the element to be .
For example :
$ ( " .columns " ) .equalHeights ( 100,300 ) ;
This would set all your elements to be at least 100 px tall , but no more than 300 px tall .
If your tallest elements contain more than 300 px worth of content , the containing element will still be resized , and a scroll bar will appear on the side of the element .
If you only specify one number , that number will be treated like the minimum height , meaning all elements will be at least that number of pixels tall .
You can also nestle the function inside of a chain , to keep your code minimalistic :
$ ( " .columns " ) .equalHeights ( ) .css ( " color " , " blue " ) ;
Detailed Usage
For those not familiar with using jQuery plugins , here ’s what you need to know .
Load the jQuery library in your document ’s head .
That ’ll look something like this : < script language= " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src=" jquery.js " ></ script >
Load the equalHeights plugin the same way .
Be sure the plugin comes after ( i.e. , below ) the main jQuery script … the function relies on jQuery already being loaded : < script language = " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src=" jquery.js " ></ script > < script language= " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src=" jquery.equalheights.js " ></ script >
In order for the function to be able to calculate heights accurately , you ’ll need to make sure it waits until the page is done loading before running .
So wrap the function call ( just like you should most all of your jQuery functions ) in a $ ( docment ) . ready ( ) function , like so : $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .columns " ).equalHeights ( 100,300 ) ; } ) ;
And that ’s about all there is to it !
Known Limitations
Sometimes this script has trouble accurately calculating heights in Internet Explorer if you ’re trying to find the height of an element that contains images that do n’t have heights set .
Unless the height has been specified , the script seems to assume a height of zero .
If you resize the text in your browser window , the blocks will not resize automatically .
In some browsers , you would be able to fix this by calling the script again on resize , with something like : $ ( " .columns " ) .resize ( function ( ) { $ ( " .columns " ) .equalHeights ( ) ; } ) ;
However , I ’m given to understand that this does n’t work on Firefox , as the browser does n’t report text resizes as a “ real ” resize .
I ’m currently not aware of a good workaround .
Worth Mentioning
I should point out that there is a similar jQuery plugin out there already called equalHeight which has similar functionality .
However , that plugin requires significantly more code and the author warns that it does n’t work in Internet Explorer .
I feel my contribution , which is very small and cross - browser compatible , is thus still worthwhile .
Further , CSS Newbie reader Jared Mellentine posted a similar jQuery function in the comments of the previous Equal Heights article .
His functionality is slightly different than mine ( his looks specifically for child elements , whereas mine assumes you ’re specifying the elements you want to resize directly ) , but he did give me the idea of adding additional functionality to my plugin .
So thanks , Jared !

PACKAGE CONTENTS :
The focus of this article will be on one of the more ethereal and little - discussed properties of Singleton Classes namely an answer to the question : “ What is the class of a singleton class ? ” .
Exactly this question was asked in chapter 4 of the Ruby Hacking Guide ; and the answer was purportedly depicted by the following diagram :
Beneath the diagram was written this text :
“ A class ’s singleton class puts itself as its own class .
Quite complicated . ” .
And that was where the matter was left to stand with no further discussion or analysis .
What follows , then , is my own research into the matter .
( applies only to Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 ) .
What is the class of a Singleton Class ?
First we can try a naive approach :
class Fren ; end class_of_meta = class << Fren ; self ; end.class puts class_of_meta #output is Class
The above result does not match what was stated in the RHG , indeed if the RHG is correct the output should be the Singleton Class of Fren .
However , we know we cannot necessarily trust the result from Object#class .
Ruby tries to hide the existence of Singleton Classes from us and the Object#class method will never return a Singleton Class .
Here is the source code for the Object#class method :
VALUE rb_obj_class ( obj ) VALUE obj ; { return rb_class_real ( CLASS_OF ( obj ) ) ; }
and for the rb_class_real ( ) function :
VALUE rb_class_real ( cl ) VALUE cl ; { while ( FL_TEST ( cl , FL_SINGLETON ) || TYPE ( cl ) == T_ICLASS ) { cl = RCLASS ( cl ) -> super ; } return cl ; }
The CLASS_OF macro used in rb_obj_class ( ) represents the _actual_ class of an object , and will quite happily expand to Singleton Classes or IClasses ( you can learn more about IClasses here ) .
The rb_class_real ( ) function on the other hand is responsible for taking a class and locating a superclass of it that is not a Singleton Class or an IClass .
The overall effect of rb_obj_class ( ) therefore is that it may prevaricate ; that is it may not return the _actual_ class of your object but instead one of its superclasses .
In order to find the actual class of a class , therefore , we must write our own function :
VALUE actual_class ( VALUE obj ) { return CLASS_OF ( obj ) ; }
Now , let ’s try to find the class of Fren ’s Singleton Class using our new Object # actual_class method :
class Fren ; end class_of_meta = class << Fren ; self ; end.actual_class puts class_of_meta #output is #< Class : Class >
The result we get is the Singleton Class of Class , we also know that this result is accurate because we wrote our own function .
So , according to our tests the class of this Singleton Class is not itself ( as stated in RHG ) but in fact the Singleton Class of Class .
Does this mean the RHG is wrong , or what is going on ?
To answer this we must look at the precise place in the Ruby sourcecode where Singleton Classes are created : the function rb_make_metaclass ( ) : ( note that the terminology in the sourcecode gets confusing , please go here to find a definition of the terms , however I will continue to just use ‘ Singleton Class ’ for the duration of this article )
VALUE rb_make_metaclass ( obj , super ) VALUE obj , super ; { VALUE klass = rb_class_boot ( super ) ; FL_SET ( klass , FL_SINGLETON ) ; RBASIC ( obj ) -> klass = klass ; rb_singleton_class_attached ( klass , obj ) ; if ( BUILTIN_TYPE ( obj ) == T_CLASS && FL_TEST ( obj , FL_SINGLETON ) ) { RBASIC ( klass ) -> klass = klass ; RCLASS ( klass ) -> super = RBASIC(rb_class_real( RCLASS( obj ) -> super ) ) -> klass ; } else { VALUE metasuper = RBASIC ( rb_class_real ( super ) ) -> klass ; /* metaclass of a superclass may be NULL at boot time */ if ( metasuper ) { RBASIC ( klass ) -> klass = metasuper ; } } return klass ; }
The important thing to note in the above code is that there are TWO cases , each of which rb_make_metaclass ( ) treats differently .
The first case is defined by the condition in the if , notably :
if ( BUILTIN_TYPE ( obj ) == T_CLASS && FL_TEST ( obj , FL_SINGLETON ) )
Which means in English “ if the class you want to make a Singleton Class for is itself a Singleton … ”
This leaves the second case to mean : “ if the class you want to make a Singleton Class for IS NOT itself a Singleton … ”
Let us consider the second case first where we are building Singleton Classes for classes that are not themselves Singletons .
This is the most common case we encounter in Ruby land .
Whenever we do something like this :
o = Object.new class << o ; end
or even something like this : ( the Metaclass for a class is automatically created on class creation )
class Fren ; end
we are are creating a Singleton Class for a class that is not itself a Singleton .
For this case rb_make_metaclass ( ) will do the following ( note I have removed the if ( metasuper ) for clarity ) :
VALUE metasuper = RBASIC( rb_class_real ( super ) ) -> klass ; RBASIC ( klass ) -> klass = metasuper ;
What the above code does is sets the class of the Singleton Class ( ‘ klass ’ in the source ) to the class of its first “ real ” ( read : non-Singleton or IClass ) superclass .
Let ’s see what this means in practice ; but first let us define some notation to aid us .
From here on SING ( obj ) will refer to the Singleton Class of obj , SUPER ( obj ) will refer to the superclass and CLASS ( obj ) will indicate the class of obj .
Now examine the following code :
class Fren ; end john = Fren.new class_of_meta = class << john ; self ; end.actual_class
In the above we know that SING ( john ) will be inserted into john ’s inheritance hierarchy right below Fren ; that is the class of john will be set to SING ( john ) with Fren as its superclass ( go here to find out why ) .
Now let ’s apply the rule from rb_make_metaclass ( ) : “ the class of john ’s Singleton Class is equal to the class of its first real superclass . ”
As stated earlier we know that the superclass of SING ( john ) is Fren .
We also know that Fren is a ‘ real class ’ ( not a Singleton or an IClass ) therefore the class of SING ( john ) should be equal to the class of Fren .
Now since Fren is a class it comes into the world already with its own Singleton Class ( SING ( Fren ) ) and the class of Fren is set to SING ( Fren ) .
Therefore , according to the rule from rb_make_metaclass ( ) the class of SING ( john ) should be SING ( Fren ) , or in notation : CLASS ( SING ( john ) ) = SING ( Fren ) .
Let ’s test this :
puts class_of_meta #output is #< Class : Fren >
Bingo !
Now let ’s try for the case of classes , repeating the code we tried at the start of this article and see if we can make sense of the result we attained :
class Fren ; end class_of_meta = class << Fren ; self ; end.actual_class
Let ’s now apply the rule “ the class of Fren ’s Singleton Class is equal to the class of its first real superclass ” .
We know that the immediate superclass of SING ( FREN ) is actually SING ( Object ) ( to find out why go here ) and we also know that the superclass of SING ( Object ) is Class .
‘ Class ’ itself , then , is the first ‘ real ’ superclass of SING ( Fren ) and so the class of SING ( Fren ) is equal to the class of Class .
Now Class has the peculiar property of being itself a class and being a class it is also born with a Singleton Class ; the class of Class , is therefore , SING ( Class ) .
It follows then , that the class of SING ( Fren ) is actually SING ( Class ) – or in notation CLASS ( SING ( Fren ) ) = SING ( Class ) .
Let ’s test this :
puts class_of_meta #output is #< Class : Class >
This result confirms what we got at the start of this article , and yes , contradicts the RHG .
According to the RHG the class of a Singleton Class is set to itself yet we have just demonstrated this to be false .
Or is it really false ?
We still have one more case to examine for rb_make_metaclass ( ) , the case where we create a Singleton Class for a class that is itself a Singleton Class .
This case is much less common in practice than the other .
Here is how we do it in Ruby :
class Fren ; end class << ( class << Fren ; self ; end ) ; end
And here is what rb_make_metaclass ( ) does for this case :
RBASIC ( klass ) -> klass = klass ;
From above we can see that class of the Singleton Class is indeed set to itself !
This fact somewhat vindicates the RHG ( although it is possible RHG was in fact entirely accurate for its particular version of Ruby ) .
Let ’s test this behaviour :
class Fren ; end class << ( class << Fren ; self ; end ) ; end puts Fren.actual_class.actual_class #output is #< Class : #< Class : Fren >> puts Fren.actual_class.actual_class.actual_class.actual_class # output is #< Class : #< Class : Fren >>
Yep !
The class of the Singleton Class of the Singleton Class is indeed itself .
The repercussions of this are quite curious ; it means that when an instance method is added to the 2nd level Singleton Class it will at the same time be available as a class method .
Please note what this rather odd behaviour of Singleton Classes of Singleton Classes does NOT imply .
It does not imply that every higher level Singleton will set itself as its own class ; indeed only the highest ( or deepest ) level Singleton will set its class to itself – all the lower order Singletons will have their class set to the Singleton of one order higher than their own .
That is , if we have a class Fren and 4 levels of Singleton Classes built on top of Fren then we will have the following situation ( using parentheses to indicate Singleton Classes and an arrow to indicate the ‘ Instance Of ’ relationship ) :
Fren —>( Fren ) —> ( ( Fren ) ) — > ( ( ( Fren ) ) ) — > ( ( ( ( Fren ) ) ) ) —> ( ( ( ( Fren ) ) ) ) —> …
Note that only the 4th level Singleton Class sets itself to its own class .
And finally here is my own Ruby Class diagram , showing the relationships between most of the Classes and their Singleton Classes , as well as illustrating the rather odd higher order Singleton Class behaviour described in this article : ( hollow arrow - heads indicate superclass and opaque arrow - heads mean ‘ instance of ’ )
Conclusion
The purpose of this article was to investigate some of the more esoteric aspects of Singleton Classes and to answer specifically the question raised in the RHG – namely “ What is the class of a singleton class ? ” .
In answering this question we found that the answer RHG gives is not entirely accurate for Ruby 1.8.6 ; indeed we found that the rb_make_metaclass ( ) function has different behaviour contingent upon whether the class is a Singleton or just a regular class .
We discovered that the higher order Singleton Classes are quite different beasts to our regular Singleton Class and do ( in accordance with RHG ) set themselves as their own class .
To verify the conclusions stated above for yourself , please download the mult C extension ( only tested on Linux ) .
It includes the methods Object # actual_class and Object # actual_super which return the actual class and superclass for the objects they ’re invoked on with ( almost ) no prevarication .
Please note the conclusions stated in this article have only been tested on Ruby 1.8.6 and I am unsure if they hold true for either 1.8.7 or 1.9 .

Here 's an important footnote to the string of boycotts and protests by gay - marriage supporters after Proposition 8 was approved by voters last month .
Marjorie Christoffersen , a manager at El Coyote who became a lightning rod for protests because of her donation to supporters of the ban on same - sex marriage , is said to be considering resigning , according to a restaurant official .
El Coyote manager Larry Crenshaw said Christoffersen is considering leaving the eatery , but no final decision has been made .
The restaurant was the scene of protests , pickets and boycotts in the days after voters approved Proposition 8 .
Christoffersen , who is Mormon , had given $ 100 to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Her mother owns the restaurant .
Crenshaw said Christoffersen has stopped serving and greeting customers at the venerable Mexican eatery known for its margaritas .
Activists opposed to Proposition 8 have launched boycotts of numerous businesses whose owners or employees contributed to initiative , which banned same - sex unions in California .

Send good karma , post a photo , criticize the prime minister - all things you can do with the click of a mouse at Facebook .
But in Croatia , the last one might be a click too far .
A man who launched a Facebook group critical of Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has been detained and questioned by police .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Some in the country are crying foul , sensing a move to quash cyber - debate .
Political analyst Jelena Lovric called the detention a " notorious abuse of police for political purposes . "
And the leader of the opposition Social Democrats , Zoran Milanovic , said the police action endangered freedom of expression .
The kerfuffle in the Balkan country had its origins several months ago when Niksa Klecak , 22 , set up an anti-Sanader group on Facebook , the social networking website .
The name of the group was , " I bet I can find 5,000 people who dislike Sanader . "
Last week , though , the hammer fell .
Police questioned Klecak for three hours and searched his home and computer .
Krunoslav Borovec , a senior national police official , rejected criticism of the detention .
Police acted legally , he said , because Klecak 's group displayed a photo montage of Sanader in a Nazi uniform .
Nazi symbols are banned under Croatian law .
Croatian police chief , Vladimir Faber , also insisted the investigation was " motivated by the content , not the author 's political affiliation . "
And the prime minister himself had no problem with the police action , either .
" There is no satire with Nazi insignia , " Sanader told Croatian state - run radio .
" The photo montage , he said , " was not an attack on me , but Croatian democracy . "
But Klecak , who is a member of the Social Democrats ' youth branch , was n't buying the explanation about Nazism .
He was convinced , he said , that his was a " politically motivated case . "
Lovric , the political analyst , said the case exposed officials ' fear of the web .
The government " cannot influence internet , and that deeply frightens it , " Lovric said .

Traditional Croatian news organisations are relatively free , although they do face pressure from political or business interests .
But opposition against Sanader is boiling on websites - and it has exploded since the police action against Klecak .
The government may find quashing debate on the web a bit difficult .
New anti-government Facebook sites are popping up like animals in the Whack - A - Mole arcade game .
One , calling for a protest against Sanader later this month , has gathered 80,000 members .
Klecak 's group has grown to 6,200 members since Friday - exceeding his original goal of 5,000 .
And another Facebook group , called " Search my flat , you Gestapo gang , Croatia is not a police state , " surfaced over the weekend and already has about 2,600 members .
By contrast , a group called " I bet I can find 7,000 people who LIKE Sanader " has just 19 members so far .
Still , the online activists may find that cyber - protests do n't necessarily translate into real ones .
It 's easier to click a mouse than to take to the streets .
A Facebook - launched protest against mafia - style murders in Zagreb , the capital , drew just a few hundred people .
And in Egypt earlier this year , a Facebook group called for a general strike on President Hosni Mubarak 's 80th birthday .
The group had 60,000 cyber-members , but the protest was a bust .
And real - life detention and questioning can certainly make a point .
Damir Kajin , another opposition politician in Croatia , said the police action " was a message to those who found a new way of political fighting on the internet . "

The boss :
As I gazed at my bacon and egg this morning , I realized ...
The chicken contributed , but the pig was commutted .
I am so clever .
Wally :
If I promise to work like a dead big , can i go home early ?
The American legal system is built on a foundation of respect for individual rights , particularly the rights of life , liberty , property , and the pursuit of happiness .
Unfortunately , that foundation is only very imperfectly understood and even more poorly implemented .
Throughout the history of America , the principle of rights has been corrupted to varying degrees by statist ideals -- worst of all by slavery but also by collectivist claims for the sacrifice of individuals to " the common good , " environmentalist demands to sacrifice human life and values to pristine nature , and much more .
Today 's list of violations of individual rights is as long as the Federal Register and then some .
Yet despite those corruptions , some core respect for individual rights -- for the fact that each individual ought to be free to use his own resources as he sees fit , based on his own independent judgment , without forcible interference from others -- remains in our legal system .
Unfortunately , many Christians seek to inject Christian principles into the American legal system .
Christians on the right seek to outlaw abortion and prevent gays from marrying .
Christians on the left seek to tax the rich to care for the poor .
Neither of those schemes is consistent with the principles of individual rights .
Consequently , I -- and the Coalition for Secular Government -- oppose them .
However , those schemes are child 's play compared to the attempt to wholly remake the American legal system according to Biblical law .
For a sample of what that view would entail , read this blog post from Dani , a self - described " right - wing Christian fanatic " :
This is how it should be according to the Bible if this were truly a Christian Nation :
YOU SHALL NOT MURDER : Judges will execute those convicted of murder ( Gen. 9:6 ; Ex . 21:12 -14 ; 20:13 ; Lev. 24:17 , 21 ; Num .
35:16 - 21 , 31 ; Deut .
19:11 - 13 ; 1 Ki. 18:22 , 39 -40 ; 1 Tim. 1:8-10 ) including those euthanizing , starving , or aborting ( Ex. 21:22 - 23 ) human beings from the moment of fertilization to natural death .
Judges will flog those guilty of assault and impose restitution for lost income and medical expenses ( Ex. 21:18 - 19 ) , and for permanent injury also require an eye for an eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot , burn for burn , life for life ( Lev. 24:19 -20 ) .
Judges will carry out all corporal and capital punishments swiftly and painfully , within twenty - four hours of conviction ; and limit floggings to forty blows ( Deut .
25:1-3 ; Lev. 24:19-20 ; 19:16-21 ; 1 Pet. 2:20 ) .
Judges will not convict for the use of force in defense of property and the innocent , in escalation to match the perceived threat up to lethal force ; nor for purely accidental homicide ( Deut. 19:4 ) ; will execute those guilty of negligent homicide ( Ex. 21:28-30 ; Deut. 22:8 ) ; and flog those who could have avoided otherwise accidental homicide , and anyone committing revenge killing ( Num. 35:26 - 27 ) of those guilty of capital crimes .
YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY : Judges will execute those convicted of bestiality ( Ex. 22:19 ; Lev. 20:15 - 16 ) ; those convicted of incest including with in - laws ( Lev. 11-12 , 14-15 , 17 , 19 - 21 ) ; of homosexual acts ( Lev. 18:22 , 29 ; 20:13 ) ; of child molestation ; of kidnapping or rape ( Ex. 21:15 - 16 ; Deut .
22:25 -27 ; 24:7 ) ; and of adultery with a married woman ( Lev. 20:10 ; Deut .
22:22 ; Ex. 20:14 ) .
Judges will flog those convicted of fornication ; of public use of vulgar sexual and excretory language ; of sexually suggestive dress or behavior ; of intoxication ; and of possession of pornography .
Judges will flog more severely those convicted of transvestism ; of public nudity ; and of distributing pornography .
And judges will flog more severely still those convicted of prostitution ; of producing pornography for any use ; and of sexual acts in public places .
YOU SHALL NOT STEAL : Judges will flog and require restitution for convicted thieves , negligent recipients of stolen goods , and those who violate contracts ( Deut. 25:1‑3 ) .
Judges will impose double restitution for recovered goods , the return of the goods plus one - hundred percent value ( Ex. 22:4 , 7 - 9 ; 20:15 ) ; quadruple for destroyed or sold goods ; quintuple for intellectual , irreplaceable and sentimental goods ( Ex. 22:1 ) ; seven times for insignificant goods ( Prov. 6:30 - 31 ) ; and twenty percent for voluntarily surrendered goods ( Lev. 6:1 - 7 ) .
The judge shall impose corporal punishment and life for life penalties for collateral damage from any crime , including bodily injury resulting from the destruction of property which warrants greater than even restitution .
A person or his resources causing unforeseeable or unavoidable property damage including by natural disaster without negligence shall pay no restitution , or with negligence shall pay even restitution .
Persons taking shared risk shall pay mutual restitution ( Ex. 21:32-36 ; Lev. 24:18 ) .
Avoidable accident without negligence , including the malfunction of a maintained resource requires even restitution but with negligence , including by a neglected resource demands double restitution .
Gross negligence requires quadruple restitution and intentional destruction demands quintuple restitution .
Excepting those executed , judges will sentence those who cannot pay restitution , to indentured servitude for up to seven years with the victim receiving all service or earnings .
YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS : Judges will punish those convicted of perjury , false confession , credible threat , conspiracy , abbeting , attempt , fully as though they had personally committed the crime ( Deut .
19:16 -21 ; 2 Sam. 1:15 - 16 ; Ex. 20:16 ) .
Judges will flog and impose restitution on those convicted of slander .
Judges will flog those in contempt of court , and execute those guilty of treason and violators of court orders which protect victims ( Deut. 17:12-13 ) .
A man is not innocent until proven guilty .
He is guilty the moment he commits a crime , but presumed innocent ( Deut. 22:22 -27 ) in court until convicted .
Convicting the innocent and acquitting the guilty are equally unjust ( Pro. 17:15 ) .
A judge at his discretion , suspends the rights of liberty including the use of weapons , for the credibly accused , and mandatorily confines one facing a likely sentence of maiming or capital punishment , until the rendering of a verdict .
Reasonable evidence from two or three witnesses , whether from eyewitnesses , physical , or strong circumstantial evidence , shall suffice for conviction ; individual rights shall not supersede the judge 's God - given right to impose punishment on the guilty .
Judges shall not grant nor have special immunity from prosecution ; shall not give more lenient punishment to minors ; shall not give special recognition to lawyers or experts in the law ; may observe and advise other judges during trial ; shall not allow witnesses to swear or give an oath ( James 5:12 , Mat. 5:34 -37 ; 2 Cor. 1:17 ) ; and shall question witnesses directly .
Judges shall not accept no - contest pleas or bargains ; shall punish criminals for all collateral damage ; shall permit witnesses and victims to participate in punishment ( Deut. 13:9 ; 17:7 ) ; and shall show no mercy to the guilty ( Num . 35:31 ; Deut .
19:13 , 21 ; Pro. 6:30 - 31 ) .
America 's Criminal Code shall be enforced by the King as authorized in The Constitution of America .
Dani is right about one thing : that 's what it would mean for America to be a " Christian nation . "
And that 's why all freedom - loving people -- whether Christian or not -- must fight to strengthen the respect for individual rights in the American legal system .
If American law is remade in the image of scripture , the result would be the worst kind of tyrannical hell on earth .
Even in a city of cynics , the Inauguration of a new president — and the infusion of new ideas , new personalities and new energy that comes with it — summons feelings of reverence .
Seven reasons for healthy skepticism
Even in a city of cynics , the Inauguration of a new president — and the infusion of new ideas , new personalities and new energy that comes with it — summons feelings of reverence .
Barack Obama , especially , is the object of inaugural good feelings .
He has assembled an impressive White House and Cabinet team .
The country is clearly in his corner .
With the economy gasping , and two wars dragging on sullenly , even many Republicans who ordinarily might enjoy seeing Obama fail now root for him to succeed .
The stakes are simply too great .

Amid all these high hopes , it may seem needlessly sour to point out why expectations must be kept in check .
But it is also realistic .
Here are seven reasons to be skeptical of Obama ’s chances — and the Washington establishment he now leads :
1 . The genius fallacy
There is no disputing Obama has built a Cabinet of sharp and experienced public officials .
His staff , especially on national security and economic matters , is often praised as brilliant — and that ’s by Republicans .
But recent history teaches us to be wary of the larger - than - life Washington figures supposedly striding across history ’s stage .
Consider the economy .
Everyone seems to agree Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner are smart , vastly qualified to manage and repair the economy .
Everyone was saying the exact same things about the two economic geniuses of the 1990s : Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan .
Now Rubin has been reduced to making excuses for his involvement in high - risk investments and for helping oversee the demise of Citigroup , which lost $ 10 billion in the past three months alone .
The onetime oracular Greenspan has admitted to Congress that his once - revered economic philosophy had “ a flaw , ” and many blame him for turning a blind eye to the housing bubble .
As it happens , the Obama economic team is full of Rubin protégés , including Geithner and Summers .
Geithner had to recently admit he failed to pay taxes on a big chunk of income — as part of his confirmation process to run tax policy and the Internal Revenue Service .
As president of the New York Fed , he was integrally involved in the decision not to rescue Lehman Bros. , which many see , in retrospect , as a grievous error .
The reception of the Obama economic team recalls the reception of President George W. Bush ’s foreign policy team eight years ago .
Many Democrats applauded the experience of Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell .
As Bush named his national security team in 2000 , The New York Times editorialized : “ Putting superstar players on the court does not always guarantee harmony or success . ”
In retrospect , that was an understatement , indeed .
2 . The herd instinct
The most bipartisan tradition in Washington is to laud bipartisanship , even while lamenting that there is not enough of it .
But the instinct for bipartisanship overlooks an inconvenient fact : Some of Washington ’s biggest blunders occur when the government moves to do big things with big support .
Bush won the much - regretted Iraq war resolution of October 2002 with strong Democratic backing .
The current economic crisis produces similar pressure to get on board the train — never mind for sure where it ’s going .
It is easy to sympathize with the temptation .
Top officials on Obama ’s team told us in recent days that things are much worse than most people appreciate .
The Obama staff and top lawmakers are getting stern warnings that the banking system in particular is extremely fragile and could collapse .
So they are moving with amazing speed to pump money into the economy .
First up is the stimulus package that could top $ 900 billion .
It is a mind - numbing number rarely contemplated in U.S. history — and yet it might not work .
There are no guarantees people will spend money the government doles out or that it will be enough to offset miserable economic performance elsewhere .
The history is n’t encouraging .
Rewind just a few months back .
Republicans and Democrats alike said the best of many bad options was to approve $ 700 billion to prop up banks , mainly to thaw the credit freeze and juice the economy .
Half the money is gone now .
Many banks took the cash and sat on it .
Some used it increase lending .
But much of it was wasted or unaccounted for .
Now Washington wants to spend the rest of it .
And a top Hill aide told Politico ’s David Rogers that Democrats will probably need to request even more .
3 . We are broke .
The past several months have produced a rare convergence .
Something that politicians of both parties find pleasurable — spending money — has overlapped with what economists and policy experts of all ideological stripes said is urgently necessary .
As “ Saturday Night Live ’s ” Church Lady used to say , “ How convenient . ”
One month from now , Democrats will likely have passed the massive stimulus bill and Obama will have signed it into law .
The new Treasury Department will be well on its way to spending the second $ 350 billion chunk of the $ 700 billion bank bailout fund .
After this rush of activity , the ability to spend during the balance of Obama ’s first term — never mind if there is a second — will be sharply constrained .
Instead , the new administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill will awaken to another first : the prospect of the national deficit approaching $ 2 trillion .
For most , these numbers are simply too big to ponder .
But ponder this :
This country has never reckoned with deficits like these .
Wait , it gets worse .
Remember those entitlement programs the elderly and poor need more than ever : Social Security and Medicare ?
In budget terms , they are more troubled than ever .
Social Security ’s surpluses “ begin to decline in 2011 and then turn into rapidly growing deficits as the baby boom generation retires , ” according to one recent report .
“ Medicare ’s financial status , ” the report said , “ is even worse . ”
Basically , the government needs more money than ever at a time when people are losing jobs , income and confidence .
4. Words , words , words
Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , though starkly different men , both viewed the presidency as pre-eminently a decision - making job .
Clinton often waved away speech drafts bloated with lofty language by saying : “ Words , words , words . ”
Obama seems to have a different view of the presidency .
He thinks that the right decisions can be reached by putting reasonable and enlightened people together and reaching a consensus .
He believes his job as president is to educate and inspire , largely matters of style .
He knows he is good with words .
He knows he has great style .
So that ’s why he projects exceptional confidence in his ability to do the job .
We do n’t know yet how justified Obama is in his self - confidence — or how naive .
But he is almost certain to face many tests , probably imminently , in which the test will be Obama ’s ability to act quickly and shrewdly — and not merely describe his actions smoothly or impress people with nuance .
And an unlike a governor — who must decide what ’s in a budget and what gets cut , or whether a person to be executed at midnight should be spared —
Obama has not made many decisions for which the consequences affect more than himself .
5 . He rarely challenges the home team .
Obama frequently talks of the need to transcend partisanship .
And he invokes his support for charter schools — a not - terribly - controversial idea — as evidence that he is willing to challenge Democratic special interest groups .
In fact , there are few examples of him making decisions during the campaign or the transition that offended his own party ’s constituencies , or using rhetoric that challenged his own supporters to rethink assumptions or yield on a favored cause .
Has Obama ever delivered a “ Sister Souljah speech ” ?
Ever stood up to organized labor in the way that Clinton did in passing North American Free Trade Agreement ?
This is not a good sign .
By Obama ’s lights , the national interest usually coincides with his personal interest .
Back to you , Church Lady .
6. Everyone is winging it .
No matter how much confidence Obama or other politicians project , the reality is the current economic crisis has totally scrambled the intellectual assumptions of almost every policymaker .
People who used to bemoan deficits want to spend like crazy .
Improvisation is the only proper response .
But the chances that improvisation will take the country to exactly the right destination — without some serious wrong turns along the way — seem very slight .
7 . The watchdogs are dozing .
The big media companies that once invested in serious accountability journalism are shells of their former selves .
The Tribune Co. — in other words , the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune — has slashed its Washington staff by more than half .
Newspaper chains such as Cox are fleeing D.C. altogether .
The end result :
There are few reporters in this country doing the kind of investigative reporting that hold government officials ’ feet to the fire .
Think back eight years to the pre-Iraq war reporting and consider the words of Scott McClellan in his otherwise humdrum book .
“ The collapse of the administration ’s rationales for war , which became apparent months after our invasion , should never have come as such a surprise , ” McClellan wrote .
“ In this case , the ‘ liberal media ’ did n’t live up to its reputation .
If it had , the country would have been better served . ”
Rigorous reporting is even more important when you have one - party rule in Washington .
Democrats , like Republicans , are simply less likely to scrutinize a president of their own .
The end result here :
Do n’t expect the Democratic Congress to investigate the Obama administration or hold a bunch of tough oversight hearings .
That means the only real check on Obama is the same one it ’s always been — the voters .

Politics
If you search the internet there are THOUSANDS of articles on this topic out there , and most of them give really stupid , useless advice .
Why are they so bad ?
Well , probably because they were written by guys who are n’t successful with dating and never had been .
The author is probably some dork who got divorced and now that he is dating again he thinks that makes him some kind of dating for single dads expert – LOL no .
So That brings us to my first tip , be CAREFUL where you get advice from , because most dating “ experts ” and gurus are complete morons and / or sketchy PUA creeps .
TIP 1 ) Be Careful Where You Are Getting Your Dating Advice !
Of course this article will give you some good pointers , and a bit of a foundational understanding …
But these tips are only regarding best practices for dating as a single dad .
If you have been out of “ the game ” for a while and are serious about doing better this time around , then I would strongly suggest taking your education a bit farther than simply reading a few random articles on the Internet !
I ’ve read a great number of books on dating , attraction and relationships since my divorce , and my top recommended resource is a program called “ Pandora ’s Box ” by a fella named Vin DiCarlo .
I recently wrote up a review of the Pandora ’s Box course here .
There are a couple of things I really like about this course .
For one thing , it offers a truly “ scientific ” understanding of female psychology , that I think every guy can benefit from .
Second , the course shows you how to successfully date quality women , not just score quick “ hook ups ” like a lot of so - called dating guides do .
One note though – the website for this product is very racy , so be sure your kid(s ) are n’t around when you check it out .
TIP 2 ) Do n’t Think You Need To Wait Too Long To Get Back In The Dating Pool
A lot of guys take their time getting back into the game after a divorce or a break - up with their baby ’s momma .
And if you read any of the more “ mainstream ” advice you will year crazy things about how you should wait YEARS , so you can emotionally “ heal ” , and other such nonsense .
Ridiculous .
You are a man , and as such it is natural that you would desire the companionship of a lovely lady - friend .
Do n’t deny your natural desires !
I think the real problem occurs when guys try to get back in the game , but they do n’t know what they are doing , so they either suffer painful rejections , or they end up hooking up with crazy , messed up women .
Having bad experiences like that right after a divorce of break - up can be really damaging .
The trick then , is to start having some positive dating experiences as soon as possible .
Only date cool , level headed , quality women , and know what you are doing so you do n’t get dumped hard again , and you ’ll be fine ….
how do you do this ?
See tip # 1 .
TIP 3 ) Do n’t Bring Hoes Around Your Kids
Listen , I get it .
Sometimes you may get lonely and want to spend time with “ easy ” women …
You know what I am talking about .
The kind of chicks you can find down at your local watering hole around closing time , who are looking for any half way decent man to hop in the sack with .
No judgement .
That said , it is never a good idea to bring these kinds of women around your offspring .
You want to set a good example for your kids in terms of what a healthy adult relationship is supposed to look like .
Sure , things did n’t work out with your kid ’s mom , but that does n’t mean that you ca n’t still set a good example by only bringing home women who you are really serious about .
My rule of thumb is to wait until you have already been seeing a woman for a couple of months and have agreed to be in a monogamous relationship with her , before you introduce her to the kids .
That way you can feel confident that she is woman of high moral character .
TIP 4 ) Consider Dating A Single Mom
Dating a single mom can have a lot of advantages over dating a childless woman .
Basically , a woman who has her own kids is going to know the deal .
She ’s going to know that you ca n’t stay out all night drinking because you need to take your kids to a birthday party in the morning , and she ’ll be understanding if your car is full of Teddy Grahams and half eaten apple slices .
Also , a single mom will understand that you need to put your kids first and not start acting like a baby when you ca n’t always make time for her if your kids need you .
You ’d think that childless women would “ get ” this , but often they just do n’t , even if they are compassionate , intelligent women .
TIP 5 ) Raise Your Standards Higher ( For Relationships )
When it comes to selecting a new serious girlfriend or even a new wife , it is very important to maintain the highest of standards .
After all , this new woman is not only going to be your partner , but she is also going to be playing a role in the lives of your children .
Do n’t get blinded by the first hot chick with a big butt and a smile .
Sure she may be fun to spend a little time with , but when it comes to a relationship you really need to look at her character , her integrity , her behavior etc …
Also – look back at why your past relationships have failed .
Often time the cause will lie in picking the wrong woman and settling for somebody who just was n’t right for you .
The thing is , when you have kids the decisions you make effect them too , so it is important for you to be very selective !

The Coming Great Depression : Leaving Fantasyland
Wall Street Journal commentator Peggy Noonan is undoubtedly not alone is seeing no evidence of Depression in America -- yet : Turbulence Ahead :
" One of the weirdest , most perceptually jarring things about the economic crisis is that everything looks the same .
We are told every day and in every news venue that we are in Great Depression II , that we are in a crisis , a cataclysm , a meltdown , the credit crunch from hell , that we will lose millions of jobs , and that the great abundance is over and may never return .
Three great investment banks have fallen while a fourth totters , and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 31 % in six months .
And yet when you free yourself from media and go outside for a walk , everything looks . . . the same .
Everyone is dressed the same .
Everyone looks as comfortable as they did three years ago , at the height of prosperity .
The mall is still there , and people are still walking into the stores and daydreaming with half - full carts in aisle 3 .
Everyone 's still overweight .
But the point is : Nothing looks different .
In the Depression people sold apples on the street .
They sold pencils .
Angels with dirty faces wore coats too thin and short and shivered in line at the government surplus warehouse . "
Peg would be well - served by reading up a bit on the Depression 's timeline .
As noted here last week , ( The Coming Great Depression : Scapegoats and Exploitation ) the Dow Jones Industrial Average actually recovered in early 1930 to early - 1929 levels .
( Look for the same this time around , too -- DJIA 12,600 is in the cards a few months out , despite all the structural damage to the market and economy . )
Breadlines did n't form in November 1929 -- the structural damage took years to play out then , and it will take years to play out now .
So do n't rush things , Peggy - - we 'll get to a visible Depression soon enough .
Great Depression : ( Wikipedia )
The Great Depression was not a sudden , total collapse .
The stock market turned upward in early 1930 , returning to early 1929 levels by April , though still almost 30 percent below the peak of September 1929 .
Together , government and business actually spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year .
But consumers , many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year , cut back their expenditures by ten percent , and a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the USA beginning in the summer of 1930 .
In early 1930 , credit was ample and available at low rates , but people were reluctant to add new debt by borrowing .
By May 1930 , auto sales had declined to below the levels of 1928 .
Prices in general began to decline , but wages held steady in 1930 , then began to drop in 1931 .
We can already anticipate " ample credit at low rates " in 2009 , just as we can also anticipate wages holding steady for awhile even as sales fall .
The wheels will fall off later in 2009 and deteriorate further in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 .
Here are the structural realities which have yet to play out :
1 . You can't force households or businesses to borrow more money and spend it .
Japan 's central bank has flooded that nation with liquidity and low interest money for 19 years to little effect .
2. U.S. consumers and corporations are already burdened with staggering debt .
Not only can't you force people to borrow more , you also can't force lenders to loan more money to insolvent households and businesses .
3 . Whatever money people get their hands on is going to paying down debt and savings .
Studies of the first " stimulus package " checks which went out to taxpayers in 2008 revealed that 2/3 of the money was not spent but used to service debt or saved .
Future " stimulus checks " will also fail to boost spending ; people already have more stuff than they know what to do with .
4 . The FIRE economy is dead .
Finance , insurance and real estate ( FIRE ) all prospered for one reason : the velocity of transactions and debt instruments .
With the volume of transactions off by 2/3 ( real estate ) or 99 % ( home equity loans ) , the FIRE economy is shrinking fast , with no barriers to further declines .
With lending standards rising even as real estate values plummet , there is nothing to stop transaction and debt velocity from falling much further .
5. Governments and corporations alike are living with Fantasyland expectations of revenue .
I recently pored over the 2009 fiscal year budget of my town of 120,000 people ( general fund spending is $ 135 million , which does n't include capital projects or bond - funded spending ) and was dumbstruck by the insanely unrealistic revenue expectations .
The city expects to reap the same amount of easy money from real estate transfer taxes ( 1 % of any real estate transaction goes to the city ) in 2009 as it did in 2007 and 2008 : about $ 11 million .
Huh ?
As transaction volumes decline by 2/3 and the sales prices plummet , then how can you possibly expect to rake in the same transfer tax revenues ?
The downtown shopping district was eerily quiet on Black Friday ; empty storefronts are everywhere , and sales are falling even at the town 's sales - tax heavyweights , the Toyota and Honda auto dealerships .
Yet the city expects to haul in the same sales tax revenue as in 2008 .
Based on what ?
The entire nation is in the grip of massive , total denial that revenues will drop in a recession .
Companies are trimming travel costs , as are consumers ; San Francisco International Airport was virtually empty on Wednesday , once one of the busiest travel days of the year .
Airports almost empty day before Thanksgiving .
" The dreaded Day before Thanksgiving was not so dreadful after all .
Bay Area airports were eerily empty for much of what traditionally has been among the busiest travel days of the year .
" There 's nobody here , " said Deborah Vainieri , who was waiting at San Francisco International Airport with her husband , Humberto , for a flight to Portland .
In a plot to beat the crowds , the Vainieris had arrived at the airport four hours early .
They walked right up to the check - in machine and were done in less than a minute . "
6 . If lenders make risky loans , they will go under -- and most U.S. households and businesses are no longer creditworthy risks .
So there you have it :
This conflict can not be resolved .
Lenders who foolishly extend credit to over - indebted , risk - laden borrowers will be paid back with losses and insolvency , yet as lending standards tighten and assets plummet in value , the number of creditworthy borrowers in the U.S. has shrunk .
As noted here many times : many of those who qualify for loans are deadset against debt .
That 's why they 're creditworthy -- they 've refused to take on huge debt for cultural or fiscal - prudence reasons .
They have zero interest in taking on debt , even at zero interest .
You can't force people to borrow money , especially when they 're already overloaded with debt , and you can't force prudent people to borrow when they have no need for more property , nor can you force people to buy real estate even as the values continue falling .
7 . The U.S. already has too much of everything : too many hotels , malls , office towers , homes , condos , strip - malls , lamps , furniture , CDs , TVs , clothing , etc .
As 50 million storage lockers filled to capacity with consumer crap are emptied in a desperate move to reduce expenses and raise cash , the value of literally everything ever manufactured will fall to near - zero .
As noted here many times before , the entire U.S. housing market was held aloft by two anomalies : speculators hoping to " flip " for huge profits , and a " one dwelling for every person " mentality that confused rising population with a rising number of households .
We are already seeing how population can continue rising slowly even as the number of households declines .
It 's called moving back home , doubling up , renting out a room , etc .
There are at least 20 million surplus dwellings in the U.S. right now ; there is no need for 700,000 more a year to be built , or even 70,000 more .
The FIRE economy based on transaction and debt volume / velocity : gone , over , toast .
Housing market based on speculative flipping and one - person households : over , gone , toast .
Loose lending by delusional lenders to risky , over - indebted borrowers : gone , over , toast .
Borrowing based on rising real estate values : gone , over , toast .
The notion that we " need " more of anything : gone , over , toast .
The idea that you can force lenders to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers : gone , over , toast .
The idea you can force people drowning in debt to borrow more : gone , over , toast .

Spirituality , Not Religion , Makes Kids Happy , Say Psychologists
To make children happier , we may need to encourage them to develop a strong sense of ' personal worth ' , according to Dr. Mark Holder , Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia , Visiting Assistant Professor Dr. Ben Coleman and graduate student Judi Wallace .
Their research says that children who feel that their lives have meaning and value and who develop deep , quality relationships – what they term measures of spirituality – are happier .
But according to their paper in the Journal of Happiness Studies , actual religious practices have little effect on that happiness .
Both spirituality , what they call an inner belief system that a person relies on for strength and comfort , and religiousness , what they term institutional religious rituals , practices and beliefs , have been linked to increased happiness in adults and adolescents .
Fewer studies have been done on younger children .
In an effort to identify strategies to increase children 's happiness , Holder and colleagues set out to better understand the nature of the relationship between spirituality , religiousness and happiness in children aged 8 to 12 years .
A total of 320 children , from four public schools and two faith - based schools , completed six different questionnaires to rate their happiness , their spirituality , their religiousness and their temperament .
Parents were also asked to rate their child 's happiness and temperament .
The authors found that those children who rated themselves according to their spiritual definition were happier .
In particular , the personal ( i.e. meaning and value in one 's own life ) and communal ( i.e. quality and depth of inter- personal relationships ) aspects were strong predictors of children 's happiness .
They determined that ' spirituality ' explained up to 27 percent of the differences in happiness levels amongst children .
A child 's temperament was also an important predictor of happiness .
In particular , happier children were more sociable and less shy .
The relationship between spirituality and happiness remained strong , even when the authors took temperament into account .
However , religious practices – including attending church , praying and meditating – had little effect on a child 's happiness .
According to the authors , " enhancing personal meaning may be a key factor in the relation between spirituality and happiness . "
They suggest that strategies aimed at increasing personal meaning in children - such as expressing kindness towards others and recording these acts of kindness , as well as acts of altruism and volunteering – may help to make children happier .

Biden to limit role of vice president
Dialing back his predecessor ’s expansive view of the office , Vice President - elect Joe Biden plans on “ restoring the Office of the Vice President to its historical role ” as adviser to the president and tie - breaker in the Senate , an aide to Biden said Saturday .
The declaration results from an attention - getting article coming from the Las Vegas Sun , which is reporting Sunday in a story by Washington Bureau reporter Lisa Mascaro that the new Congress “ will reassert its constitutional independence from the White House by barring the vice president from joining in internal Senate deliberations , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in an interview with the Sun . ”

“ The move is intended to restore checks and balances to a system that tilted heavily toward the White House in the Bush presidency , ” Mascaro writes .
“ By giving Vice President Dick Cheney regular access to Senate Republican caucuses , at times with White House advisers in tow , party unity became more important to many Republicans than upholding their responsibilities to provide legislative oversight of the executive , experts say . ”
The paper says that when Reid was asked whether Biden will be allowed to attend Senate Democratic caucus meetings , Reid said : “ Absolutely not . ”
Elizabeth Alexander , spokesperson for the vice president - elect , e-mailed in response : " Vice President - elect Biden had no intention of continuing the practice started by Vice President Cheney of regularly attending internal legislative branch meetings — he firmly believes in restoring the Office of the Vice President to its historical role .
He and Senator Reid see eye to eye on this . ”
Cheney has vastly enlarged the office ’s power , even claiming at one point that it had a special status beyond both the executive and legislative branches , by virtue of the role of president of the Senate .
That ’s a largely ceremonial function , except in the case of breaking ties .
Biden articulated his view of the office in St. Louis in early October , during his vice presidential debate with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Asked about the incumbent ’s interpretation of the vice presidency , Biden said : “ Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we 've had probably in American history .
The idea he does n't realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States , that 's the Executive Branch .
He works in the Executive Branch .
He should understand that .
Everyone should understand that . ”
“ The primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America , give that president his or her best judgment when sought , and as vice president , to preside over the Senate , only in a time when in fact there 's a tie vote , ” Biden said . , “ The Constitution is explicit .
The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote , only when there is a tie vote .
He has no authority relative to the Congress .
The idea he 's part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us .
It has been very dangerous . ”

The blow - by - blow cellular story of those rare people whose immune systems control AIDS on their own has been unknown to scientists — until now .
Researchers have uncovered the mechanisms used by a type of white blood cell to destroy HIV - infected cells .
If a vaccine could program cells to do this , it could protect people from AIDS .
" The cells are massively loaded with killer molecules .
They were able , in our assay , to kill almost all the HIV - infected cells , " said Mark Connors , an AIDS specialist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease .
" The killing was very efficient and very rapid . "
It 's still too soon to extrapolate from the observations to a fully effective vaccine against AIDS — something that scientists have pursued for years , only to be repeatedly disappointed .
But despite the failures of vaccines and other treatments , glimmers of hope are seen in what are known as long - term non-progressors : people whose immune systems naturally and inexplicably control a virus that causes two million deaths every year .
Approximately one person in 5,000 possesses this protection , and researchers have identified many genes and proteins that appear to play a role in this defense .
The latest findings , published today in Immunity , suggest a specific approach for a vaccine .
" It tells us what we want to build , " said James Riley , a University of Pennsylvania AIDS researcher who was not involved in the study .
Connors ' team studied CD8 + , or cytotoxic , T cells — the immune system 's first responders , responsible for destroying virus - infected cells before the virus can replicate and spread .
Once cytotoxic cells taken from long - term non-progressors were primed by an initial exposure to HIV , they loaded themselves with grains containing two weapons : proteins that can dissolve cell walls , and toxic molecules called granzyme B .
When armed , the cells attacked HIV - infected cells by drilling holes in their walls and pumping them full of granzyme B. Connors compared the cells to a gun loaded with bullets .
In contrast , cytotoxic cells taken from people with typical
HIV vulnerability " did n't load with enough bullets to be capable killers . "
In addition to vaccines , Riley said the mechanism could also inspire cell - based therapies .
" We do n't know , from a vaccine point of view , how to induce these types of cells , " he said .
Connors next hopes to identify the mechanisms that instruct cytotoxic cells to take up arms .
" There 's something that 's going on in these people , " said Connors , " and we 're amassing the tools to try and take that apart . "

Twitterのスケール関係で、面白い記事を発見したのでまとめ。
一時期 「 スケールしない」とか 「 動作が不安定」だとか言われ続けていたTwitter。5月ごろにslashdot.jpでも話題になっていた。論調は総じて「 Twitterがスケールしないのは、Rubyを使っているから」というもの。
ところが 同 じ５ 月 、「 Why Can't Twitter Scale ?
Blaine Cook Tries To Explain（なん でTwitterってスケールしないの？）」という、blog紹介記事がSilicon Alley Insiderに掲載される。記事の元になったblogエントリは、Twitterの前チーフアーキテクトだったBlaine Cook氏によるもの。Cook氏によれば、TwitterのスケールとRubyは何の関係もないという。
Why Can't Twitter Scale ?
Blaine Cook Tries To Explain
In Twitter 's case , there is zero chance that the problems there are in any way related to their language .
It is likely that there are architectural challenges which come from the fact that it is very hard to cache a Twitter data request since no two people ever get the same data .
And even for a given user , the data requests change quickly since users are always receiving tweets .
This is a hard , though not unsolvable problem that requires a very specialized caching architecture .
Eran Hammer - Lahav , has done some interesting work in this area and talks about it in an extensive blog post .
Twitterの場合、スケールの問題に、開発言語（Ruby）が少しでも関係している可能性はゼロといっていい。原因は、レスポンスをキャッシュすることが非常に困難であるというTwitterのアーキテクチャ上の問題だろう。ユーザはみんな（フォローリストの中身によって）それぞれ違うデータを取得するわけだから、ユーザ間でキャッシュの使いまわしができない。そして、ある特定のユーザのみをとって見ても、彼がフォローするユーザが発言するたびに取得すべきデータが頻繁に更新されてしまうわけだから、キャッシュしてもあまり意味が無い。この問題を解決するにはかなり特殊なキャッシュ・アーキテクチャを実装する必要がある。
と 、Ruby責任説を完全否定し、Twitterのスケール問題はそのアーキテクチャに問題があるからだと言っている。じゃぁ、Twitterはなんであんなにスケールに苦しめられていたの？そのスケールを阻むアーキテクチャって何？
Scaling a Microblogging Service - Part I
People do n’t seem to get what is so hard about scaling the Twitter service .
Some think it has to do with Rails , while others look at the hosting company or other operating factors .
Then there are those who incorrectly think a distributed or federated service is the solution ( which will only make things worse ) .
The idea that building a large scale web application is trivial or a solved problem is simply ridiculous .
In a way it is surprising that there are so few companies out there dealing with commoditizing web developing scaling .
Twitterをスケールさせることの何がそんなに難しいのか、みんなわかっちゃいないみたいだ。Railと関係があるって人もいるし、データセンターとか運用の問題だろうという人もいる。分散システムを導入すれば問題が解決するとか考えてるやつもいる。そんなことしても状況が悪化するだけだ。大規模なWebアプリケーションを構築することが簡単だと考えるのは馬鹿げている。（それほど難しいことだというのに）そういったWebアプリケーションのスケール周りをコモディティ化してくれる会社が数えるほどしかないっていうのは、ある意味驚くべきことだ。
There are two main subsystems from an infrastructure standpoint ( regardless of the actual implementation ) .
The first is the distribution ( or delivery ) system which takes every incoming message and delivers it to the right list of followers via Instant Messaging , SMS , or email .
The second is the retrieval ( or query ) system which allows users to query what the people they are following and the general population ( the public timeline ) have been up to ( few messages at a time ) .
Building the delivery system is n’t trivial , but much easier to scale .
Subscription lists are generally static ( who is following who ) and tend to be small ( even thousands of followers is still a small list ) .
Twitter only allows following all updates of a certain user or tracking all updates of a certain list of words , which means there is n’t any heavy calculation being done at the distribution point as to who should receive which message .
実装面を別にすれば、インフラ面か らTwitterを考えた場合、大きく二つのサブシステムに分けることができる。一つ目は届いたメッセージを、フォロアーにIMやSMS、emailを使って届ける「ディストリビューションシステム」。二つ目は、自分がフォローしているユーザや、その他のユーザについての、ステータス一覧（最新メッセージ）を取得する「クエリシステム」だ。
一つ目のディストリビューションシステムを構築するのは簡単じゃないけど、スケールさせるのはずっとたやすい。誰が誰をフォローしているかを表す"
サブスクリプションリスト"
は静的だし、リストのサイズも大抵は小さい。Twitterでは、あるユーザの発言は、フォロアー全員に届ければいいわけだから、どのメッセージを誰に届けるのかについて色々と計算する必要ない。
In its current state , pushing updates out is n’t a challenge even at a large scale , and something that has generally scaled well and has showed very solid performance and stability in the past year .
If Twitter was a push - only service , they would have no scaling issues at all – but in a way a much more difficult time competing with little - to - none technology barriers to slow competitors .
The retrieval system is where things are not as simple .
Unlike webmail services where refreshing a user ’s inbox only queries a very simple data set ( is there anything new in MY inbox ? ) , refreshing a user ’s home page on Twitter queries a much more complex data set ( are there any new updates in ALL my friends ’ pages ? ) and the nature of the service means that the ratio of reads to writes is significantly different from most other web services .
そういうわけだから、あがってきたメッセージを配送することに関しては、規模が大きくなってもそれほど難しくはないし、実際こういった類のアプリケーションはかなりスケールして、パフォーマンスも良好、且つ安定稼動させることができるってことが、過去に示されている。Twitterがこんな風に、PUSH要素しかないシステムであればスケールの問題なんておきなかっただろうし、競合に対しても技術優位性を確保できなかったから、競争はある意味もっと厳しかっただろう。
「クエリシステム」はそれほど簡単な話じゃない。DBへの問い合わせが簡単なwebメールサービスとか（自分のメールボックスに新しいメールが来ていないかどうかを調べるだけでいい）と違って、Twitter上で自分のホームページをリロードする（自分の友達全員のページそれぞれに、何らかの更新があるかどうかを調べなきゃいけない）ってのは、かなり複雑な問い合わせをする必要がある。しかもTwitterの使われ方では、ユーザの読みこみ/書きこみ比率が、他のWebサービスと比べてかなり違う。
It is these constant queries that bring Twitter down during popular events .
The fact that a single request for a user ’s home page or an API request for a user ’s friends timeline must perform a complex iterative query is what causing some requests to take too long , at best timeout and at worst cause the entire system to lag behind .
These custom views are expensive and mean that it is much more difficult to cache the final result of a request .
Going through a timeline request , the server first looks up the list of people the user is following .
Then for each person , checks if their timeline is public or private , and if private , if the requesting user has the rights to view it .
If the user has rights , the last few messages are retrieved , and the same is repeated for each person being followed .
When done , all the messages are collected , sorted , and the latest messages are converted from their internal representation to the requested format ( JASON , XML , RSS , or ATOM ) .
何か大きなイベントがあった 時 に Twitterがダウンしてしまうのはこういった処理のせいだ。アクセスのたびに複雑で反復的ななクエリを実行する必要があるから処理に時間がかかる。リクエストがタイムアウトしたり、運が悪けりゃシステム全体がラグってしまう。ユーザごとにカスタムされた情報を表示しないといけないから、生成負荷は重いし、キャッシュも難しい。
この処理では、まずユーザがフォローしている人のリストを取得する。そしてそれぞれの人に対して、ステータスが公開か非公開か、もし非公開だった場合アクセスしたユーザに閲覧権限があるかどうかを調べる。もし権限があれば最新の数件のメッセージを取得する。こういったことをフォローリスト全員に対してやらなきゃいけない。全部終わったら、取得したメッセージを集めて、時系列で並び替えて、最新の数件だけをJSONだとかXML、RSS、ATOM形式に変換する。
As long as all the messages in the system can fit into a single database table , this can be done with a pretty straight - forward query leaving the heavy lifting to the database .
But once a single table or even a single server is n’t enough to hold the entire message base ( or support the load ) , an application has to perform multiple database requests to gather the data .
Partitioning the database which for many application is enough to offer scalability , solves the issue of a large and inefficient single table scenario , but is also the reason why the system slows down .
Sharding takes away the ability to leverage the database indexing services to optimize users ’ views .
If the people you are following are not all on the same partition , multiple data queries are required .
全部のメッセージが単一のデータベースに入っているなら、こういった抽出処理は、データベースの負荷は重いけれども、シンプルでわかりやすいクエリですませることができる。でもデータがテーブルひとつに収まりきらなくなったり、サーバ一台では容量がたりなくなってしまったとき、アプリケーションは複数のデータベースにリクエストを投げなきゃいけない。データベースの分割は、スケールの手段として多くのWebアプリケーションで有効だけれど、（Twitterのようなソーシャルアプリケーションでは）データベースの分割は、システムの実行速度を遅くさせてしまう。データベースが分割されていた場合、クエリを処理する上で有効だったインデックスの威力が減退してしまうからだ。たとえばあるユーザがフォローしている友達が全員同じデータベースに載っていなかったとしたら、別のデータベースを探しにいかなきゃいけない。
その答えは、上記記事でもポイントされているように、Hueniverse社の founder である Eran Hammer - Lahav氏 による解説記事 「 Scaling a Microblogging Service - Part I 」 で触れられている 。
Twitterが苦しんでいた原因は、ソーシャルアプリケーション特有のデータ処理が、RDBMSにとって、かなり取っ付きにくい類の処理だったからだ。では、TwitterのようなWebサービスは、どうすればスケールしてくれるのか。
One simple but painfully restrictive solution is to duplicate the data for each user .
Basically what this means is turning the service into an email system .
Each user is given a mailbox and whenever someone they are following publishes a status , it is copied into their inbox , as well as into all the other followers ’ inboxes .
This brings the solution in line with existing systems such as webmail services where data partitioning alone can accomplish great scaling .
But this comes at a price .
First the data storage grows significantly faster and requires much more disk space , together with increased backup cost .
Second , it makes other actions much more complex such as erasing a message once sent .
ユーザごとにデータを重複して持たせることが、この問題に対する解法のひとつだ。emailと同じように、それぞれのユーザに「メールボックス」みたいなものを持たせて、誰かがステータスを更新したら、そのユーザをフォローしている人全員のメールボックスにそれぞれステータスのコピーを入れる。こうすればWebメールと同様、データベースを分割した状態で、いくらでもスケールさせることができる。欠点のひとつは全体のデータサイズがかなり大きくなってしまい、ディスクスペースを浪費すること。欠点のもうひとつは、一度送られてしまったメッセージが削除されたようなときにかなりややこしい処理をするはめになること。
つまり、ユーザからアクセスがあって初めて情報（フォローしている人のステータス）を探しにいくのではなく、誰かのステータスが更新された時点で、その人をフォローしているユーザ全員のページ情報を更新し、どこかに保管しておくというもの。こうすれば、情報の更新自体は、「デリバリーシステム」とほぼ同じ処理なので簡単にスケールするし、ユーザが友達の最新ステータスを取得しにきたときには、既に準備された情報を送るだけなので、Webメールと同様、やはり簡単にスケールすることができる。
Twitterが直面したアーキテクチャ上の問題は、Twitterに限った話ではない。FacebookやPownce、LinkedIn、mixi等、ソーシャルネットワークをベースに組み立てられたコミュニケーションサイトであれば、程度の差こそあれ、同様の課題をアーキテクチャに抱えているといえるだろう。この問題への対処は、SNS系サービスを大きくする上で避けては通れないはず。
たとえば日本のGREEがこの問題に対してどのように対処しているか、ITmediaの記事「大規模SNSのボトルネックとソリューション」で詳しく解説されている。
大規模SNSのボトルネックとソリューション
一定以上のユーザー数、データ量、そして機能を持つSNS では、普通に構築していくと非常に悩ましいボトルネックが2つ顕在化してきます。1つは、「友達の新着」系の情報取得です。もう1つはアクセスコントロール、つまり「この情報は全体に公開、こちらは友達の友達まで」といった制限です。
（中略）
blogテーブルが肥大化してくると問題が顕在化します。例えば1日平均で10万件程度の日記が書かれるとすると、1年でおよそ3500万〜4000万レコードのテーブルとなります。すると、WHERE句とORDER
BY句が並存した場合にインデックスが効果的に使われない*ため、パフォーマンスが劣化していきます。例えばuser_idとpublication_datetimeにマルチカラムインデックスが張られていても、
SELECT title FROM blog WHERE user_id IN （...）
で取得される件数（つまり自分の友達が書いた日記の総数）が増えれば増えるほど、ソートにコストが掛かります。
（中略）
また、GREEではログイン後の初期画面（いわゆる『ホーム』。図1）で、友達の新着情報を各種（日記、フォト、レビューなど……）表示させていますが、ホームはサイト内でもかなりアクセスの多いページで、毎回前記のような動的ページ生成を行うと、非常にコストが高くなります。
この問題に対処するため、単純にページキャッシュなども利用できますが、
表示されるデータがユーザーごとに異なるため、キャッシュのヒット率が非常に低い
データの性質上即時性が求められるため、あまりキャッシュしたくない
という問題があり、キャッシュの利用も避けたいところです。
ではＧＲＥＥはこの問題にどう取り組んだのか。
これら2つの問題について、目下のところGREEでは、「フックを利用したイベント通知機構」を利用して解決しています（図2）。つまり、
リクエストがあったタイミングでデータを取得する のではなく、 データ更新のタイミングであらかじめ必要なデータを非同期に構築しておく わけです。
考え方としては、個人ごとに 「メールボックス」のようなものを準備するHammer-Lahav氏の説明と大体同じで、且つデータのDBへの挿入は非同期で処理し、フロント側（webサーバ）を待たせるようなことはしないと。フロント側の処理を迅速に終わらせることは、Webサーバリソース（プロセスやスレッド）の回転効率を上げることにつながり、サーバのメモリ使用効率が高まる。
このあたりの話は、httpでいかにC10K問題を解決するか、という文脈で語られることが多い。データの格納をWebサーバと非同期でやるべきという考え方は、Life is beautiful ( 中島聡さん ) の記事「
マルチスレッド・プログラミングの落とし穴、その２」でも紹介されている。
前述 のHammer - Lahav氏は、現 在Real - Time Content DeliveryエンジンであるNouncer開発プロジェクトに従事されているということで、これを使えば開発者は簡単にスケールするMicro-blog（Twitterみたいなサービスの総称）サービスを作れちゃうらしい（サイトを見たところプロジェクトが停滞しているようだけれど..）。
こうやってまたひとつ技術がコモディティ化していくんだなー。。

The EV1 was a great California car .
Someone hZd one where I lived , and I would see it sliding through the shopping center 's parking lot at night , making absolutely no noise except the grating of the tires on the pavement .
I 've read that the batteries would n't hold a charge in really cold weather , but they worked fine here .
GM came out with the car because California had a requirement for a few years that a certain percentage of the fleet would have to be zero-pollution vehicles .
The Air Board got rid of the requirement and GM canceled the EV - 1 .

I still think big oil paid them to sink the EV1 ( along with every other idea coming down the pike ) .

Do n't fall for it again !
Oil imports support Terrorism , therefore , oil companies are supporting terrorism and should be viewed as Terrorist organizations .

If I believed in conspiracy theories .... I would agree with Floridiot .. who else but big oil stood to gain as much from killing the electric car .. especially considering they just knew that the stars were about to align in favor of big oil ..( Diebold , ES&S and Sequoia told them so ... the RNC and the Supreme Court .. it just had to be Bush and Cheney .. they would all profit handsomely !! ) ) .. and this country was going to " elect " a bunch of " oil men " to the White House ..( I have my tin foil hat on straight ) .. a permanent GOP ( moral majority ! )

Sometimes you just have to admit that there was a technological problem with the car .
The batteries were too , big , heavy and unreliable to be a real production car .
It 's a bit like complaining that the plane manufacture did n't keep producing the flying wing ...
Why did they have to wait 40 or 50 years with the B - 2 bomber to let technology catch up with their vision ?
The answer is the technology of fly by wire was invented and the answer about the car is that battery technology just was n't there .
Had they continued production of the car you all could point fingers and say how dumb were they for making a car that did n't go very far , cost a fortune to replace the batteries , did n't drive outside the tropics and therefore nobody wanted one any more .
Even the much vaunted Tessla has a battery pack costing $ 30,000 that has to be replaced roughly at 50,000 miles .
So perhaps GM is smart demanding that their batteries for the new Volt last at least 100,000 .
For those that are interested there was an article in Popular Science about the issue not so long ago .

Well , that did n't seem to bother the drivers of the car who offered millions to buy 'em !
Furthermore , there was a second battery technology for the EV1 that vastly improved the range .
That tech was never allowed to be used ( though I saw someone recently mention that Chevron bought the technology - have n't confirmed that , however . )

A little snippet for the linky impaired ( from the lower # 6 link ) : But GM's Andy Card had been fighting Electric cars for years , and GM 's true intention became apparent when on Oct. 10 , 2000 , GM agreed to sell their control of the EV batteries to Texaco .
Less than a week later , on Oct. 16 , 2000 , only days after Texaco acquired control of the batteries , Chevron agreed to purchase Texaco in a $ 100 billion merger .
Chevron announced the merger even though the GM sale of the batteries to what would become Chevron did not close until July 17 , 2000 .
Perhaps Chevron wanted this sale to be announced prior to the merger so it would not look like Chevron ( formerly Standard Oil of California ) worked directly with GM .

I must agree , the EV1 was a wonderful conveyance .
The LAFD had a couple of them for testing and I got to ride in one used by the Helicopter mechanics a few times .
Plenty of power , good distance on a charge , I 'd buy one today and use it to commute .
I would n't get rid of my matched set of 928 's but they could be garaged most of the time .

Peter in St. Paul ..........
You need to do some research on this subject .
There were no tech problems with these cars .
Their biggest problem was they did n't generate any income for the dealerships service department .
No regular dealer service was needed .
Toyota had a similar electric only version of the RAV4 that they made the mistake of actually selling to a small number of customers .
It used the same battery technology as the EV1 .
These small SUV are now worth their weight in gold and have proven very reliable 15 years later .
I say mistake because they never wanted anyone to know this was a viable , long term vehicle .
The NiMH battery technology for these cars was developed in the early 80's by Stan and Iris Ovshinsky .
Both cars used a version of his design called the EV - 95 that was deep - cycle , no memory , high output and long life ( over 100,000 miles ) .
They were also non-toxic and recyclable .
This battery is far better than the dirty lithium - ion type used in current hybrids .
So why are n't they being used today ?
Google " Ovshinsky Battery , Chevron " .
Chevron OIL company owns this patent and will not license it to anyone .
The patent covers any NiMH battery with a capacity large enough to power a vehicle .
Mr. Ovshinsky sold his patent to GM for the EV - 1 project who licensed it to Toyota for the Rav- EV .
When California dropped it 's requirement for ZEV's , GM sold the patent to Texeco on Oct. 10 , 2000 .
Six days later , before the patent deal was even complete , Chevron merged with Texeco for this technology .

So now we have GM in front of Congress , hat in hand , asking for bailout money .
They had the Golden Goose with the EV - 95 battery and gave it away .
Imagine how this technology could have advanced in the last 10 years if given the money that has been thrown at inferior Lithium - Ion .
So now GM is trying to fast - track the Volt to market and have admitted they do not have the battery needed to power it .
Ha !
I 'm no socialist , but I 'm all for taking this battery patent away from Chevron and giving it to the entire world , free of charge , for the good of the planet .
If they refuse to make it available when it 's most needed , they should n't profit from it later when their wells are dry .

Do n't believe the misinformation you read about the EV1 .
Cold temps are fine for electric cars ( just charge overnight , the batteries are toasty warm in the morning .
Driving warms the batteries , too . )
The gen II EV1 had NIMH batteries , that can last 125,000 miles or longer .
GM can't revive the car because they gave away the battery patents to Chevron , who wo n't make the EV - sized NIMH batteries anymore .
But you do n't need GM .
Reasonably priced electric cars are out there .

zap , I agree it is n't in the way that * and Fudd have done it , but it is breaking the Constitution .
That it 's been done before does n't make it okay .
One might accuse me of splitting hairs , but certainly the need to break patents that would immediately ease the planetary mess is infinitely more pressing than having Hillary for SoS .
And WHY would convincing them of the need to clean up the planet be so much harder than convincing them to break the Constitution to put Hillary in ?
That does n't make ANY fucking sense to me !
And , yes , I 'm thinking we need to start carting carbon to the moon really quickly ....

Do n't believe the hydrogen car scam .
Fuel cell cars will NEVER be cheap , the range will never improve , and they are too finicky in bad weather .
Its just a cynical move to pretend they are researching green cars , and hydrogen keeps real battery powered cars out of the hands of the consumer .
So in the meantime .... the next 100 years or so we will still be using gasoline while we chase the hydrogen phantom dream .

I remember a Nash Bridges episode where Nash 's Plymouth Barracuda broke down , and he had to ride in his girlfriend and fellow cop 's electric car .
I could n't tell you which episode , season it was .
MGM has only released season 1 of Nash Bridges recently .
( Yeah there are those VHS bootlegs , but not a trustable source if you ask me )
Anyway , I am sick and tired of hearing how the Hydrogen On Demand car 's do n't work , there was a news reel that had Stanley Meyers 's VW running down the road on it .
Now try to track down where that car is now , and someone will pop out of the woodwork saying it's in a basement gathering dust .
Utter nonsense , if it's in a basement gathering dust , show it , let 's see the dust on it , better yet , for national security , reverse engineer it and mandate that it 's technology be rolled out and phased into every car that currently exists .
Still can't find that car ?
Put the NSA on it , track everyone that ever knew Stan , familly , friends , Business , Search everywhere .
Meanwhile make the big three create rust resistant heads and blocks and research and make the plasma spark be tuned to the frequency of the size of the molecules that comprise water atoms .
It does n't work for these grease monkeys at popular mechanics ( Who I had a row with on electronic vote tabulation devices ) because they grew up learning physics from a book .
Where they never learned to experiment until learning something new .
They really do n't even know commone sense physics .
The Fact is , Hydrogen is more plentiful on this planet than crude oil ever will be .
It 's only that rotten greedy bastards can't make a profit off of water that it is n't already available in the mainstream .
Now think about this .
What if everyone had a portable 30 - 40 KW Hydrogen On Demand ( HOD ) generator instead of an electric bill .
It might just make up for some of the devaluation of the dollar the Treasury is doing by printing their way out their debt .
Think beyond just cars .
Everybody is saying manufacturing .
You now have your goal .
Manufacture HOD technology .
Tool up those fucking Big Three Factories .
( We already gave em fucking 25 Billion right ?
We OWN THEIR ASS NOW )
They need to do OUR bidding , Cars , Energy .
Think all the money wasted on transmission lines and power lines and transformer crap .
Eliminate the grid .
Make these power companies irrelevant ( except for certain circumstances ) and you make a strong independant America .
After all they are bitching about how hackable the existing system infrastructure is .
( At least the fake CIA docs are )
So what say you if you make your OWN god damn energy onsite ?
Let the terrorists hack your 30 KW generator in your back yard next to your doghouse !
This fucking country is being run by fuckers that do n't have no common sense .
All they have is power and money , and they brainwash and hire people to attack the truth .
The Federal Treasury is n't Federal , it 's CRIMINAL !
The sooner that is understood the sooner we can get through the pain .
Meanwile , FUCK these Automaker CEO's .
JAIL is where then need to have their next flight to .

Rick Cain .
WARNING : ( WEAR SAFETY GLASSES AND GLOVES , HYDROGEN IS SIMILAR TO GASOLINE IN THAT IT CAN DAMAGE PROPERTY AND CAUSE DEATH )
I suggest you get a glass of water , a pair of steel plates , a battery and a match .
Then take that experiment further .
Keep in mind your electronics fundamentals as well as your physics fundamentals might be lacking in getting a properly tuned plasma steam fire .
The only thing a common mechanic or machinist is going to be able to do is to manufacture parts that you tell them to .
If you tell them wrong , you will get the wrong parts .
The wrong parts wo n't work .
The whole way that gasoline engines run needs to be re-thought when considering using water for a fuel source .
A HOD vehicle will always be quite sophisticated to tune .
It will be more of an ART at first , until the physics and electronics are fully understood .
But once it is tuned , the weather will hardly make a difference any more than a gasoline vehicle does .
The only reason it has n't been pumped out like the Model T is that there is n't a Henry Ford out there with the balls to go all in and MAKE it happen .
But if you search carefully , you will find people around the world that have it working .

Further , the argument that it's too costly to make hydrogen and store it ( A method that I do n't think is the answer ) the same argument could be made that that natural gas that powers a lot of cool stoves across America is unsustainable .

PS : somewhere around here I got a photo of a Kit Car ( Based on top of a VW ) I helped build .
So it 's not like I do n't know about mechanics , tooling , combustion , electronics ( 8 wires to run the motor ) , etc .
It was a copy of a 1927 Bugatti , Kit came from some place out in Florida that went out of business in the 1970's ( we were worried we were not going to receive the kit ) I learned a lot .
I learned about CAR FIRES also .
Keep an ABC extinguisher handy !!
My point being that anyone can learn this stuff .
You do n't need to be a frigging engineer or physicist to screw around experimenting .
YOU DO need lots of money .
Probably pumped 25 grand in " 1970 money " into it .
I remember one day heating lead on my stove to pour into the front end to give it more weight .

Errrr ... why waste money transporting to the moon ?
The excess CO2 needs to go back into solid forms akin to where most of it came from during the human industrial period , and once locked back up in stable solids it does n't matter where it 's stored .
Big job , but doable .
As for Hydrogen - On - Demand ... where does the energy to crack the hydrogen out of the water come from ?
Solar or other renewable is fine if you can make the economics work .
Still need coal ?
Then it 's worse than useless as coal - fired plants will burn more power to crack your water than they will just sending you the power to charge your car directly .
And if the idea is that cracking water will itself yield an energy profit ( without something like a fusion reactor thrown into the mix ) ... that ai n't gonna fly .

Gotta have something to do with ADD
The hydrogen - on - demand systems that use a chemical reaction usually start with sodium borohydride ( or another boron / hydrogen derivative ) , which is a hydrogen - rich chemical compound and force a reaction that releases the hydrogen as needed .
In the case of sodium borohydride ( NaBH4 ) , the result of the chemical reaction is to degrade into inert salt , which can then be recycled back into sodium borohydride again .

An exothermic reaction such as the one described in your link is , of course , another matter entirely .

" Well , zap , I was expressing the need to do whatever is feasible instanter , not necessarily shipping it to the moon , but we are probably better equipped to ship it to the moon right now " I understand , but my space geek gene forces me to respond that , unfortunately , the answer is " No " .
We are not equipped to send even a kiloton of anything to the moon in one go ... much less the multi-megaton transhipments of carbon that would be needed .
Currently , forcing it back into solids on an industrial scale seems to be the only feasible answer .
And not " just enough " to counter current production ... it 's almost certainly too late for just that ... but enough extra each year for active cooling .
Then we chill for awhile and assess the damage .

Brad @ 36 : If it 's the same NPR interview with him that I heard , I believe he said it was not " profitable " .
He based that on the fact that most small car " profit " in generated after the sale from service and fuel sales .
Build a car that does n't either and it becomes " unprofitable .
Why they could n't structure the electric car lines more like their other lines is beyond me .
Base , Mid , Sport and Luxury versions of the same model with more advanced materials and electronics the more upscale you get .
They could also offer charge more for longer range versions for those who need it .
Why could n't the battery system be modular with the base car offering a range of 80 - 100 miles .
Upgrades for extended range or performance could be purchased from the dealer in the form of additional battery packs or higher performance motors .
The consumer could then add the addition battery packs when a long trip required them and leave them and the extra weight behind when not .
The BS about cold weather performance is just that .
These technical issues can be addressed just as they were for petro vehicles .

And then there is power density issue .
The EV1 batteries the size of a trunk and weighing a lot had as much power as 1 gallon of gas .
Imagine having to carry around a trunk locker filled with books or a gallon of orange juice and you get some of the problem .
Even the new smaller batteries have the issue of being large and heavy compared to the amount of power they can deliver .
And then there is the issue of batteries catching on fire .
You remember the issues of laptop computers going up in flames and their batteries are tiny compared to what is needed to drive a car and they are as I understand it , much the same .
Nobody has bother to comment on the cost of replacing the batteries and the issue of they wo n't last 100,000 miles
The point is , that the problems of batteries are more complex than most of us realize ... and our belief in technology to " overcome the laws of physics " in a very short time may be a little foolish .

Peter , the ' exploding battery ' you 're referring to is a Lithium Ion battery , not the nickel metal hydride battery technology that was used in the EV1 and now controlled by Chevron , and that problem has been addressed by improving the membrane between the positively charged and negatively charged cathode plates .
The other issues you mention , regarding the battery weight , the replacement cost , the range , the life of the battery , are all old and no longer operative .
Off the top of my head I can recall two separate recent stories regarding Toronto and San Francisco hybrid electric taxi fleets ( using Li-ion if I remember correctly ) , with well over 100 k miles in use and no need of replacement .
Unfortunately I do n't have time at this moment to dig up those links , so will have to find them later .

Peter in St. Paul ...... EV - 1 curb weight : 2970 lbs .
2009 Chevy Cobalt curb weight : 3216 lbs .
I can't find any news reports of EV1's or RAV - EV's catching fire , butI have seen gasoline powered vehicles on the side of the road burning .
Are you trying to imply riding on top of 15 - 20 gallons of gasoline is safer than a battery pack ?
I would much feel much safer with a battery than a gas tank or a hydrogen fuel cell .
Your comparison to the energy content of the EV - 1 battery and a gallon of gasoline is also a bit odd .
" The EV1 batteries the size of a trunk and weighing a lot had as much power as 1 gallon of gas . "
The Gen II EV - 1 with the NiMH pack had a max range of 160 miles , but typical range was 120 miles .
The best gasoline cars yield less than half that range per gallon .
Your final point : " The point is , that the problems of batteries are more complex than most of us realize ... and our belief in technology to " overcome the laws of physics " in a very short time may be a little foolish .
Not that we should n't try . "
There are no laws of physics to overcome with battery power and the complex technical issues were solved almost two decades ago .
Continual refinement will yield increased range and performance , much like every other electrical device of the last hundred years .
The bottom line is we have a very powerful oil industry that is willing to spend BILLIONS to make sure this happens when they want it to , not when it 's needed .

Peter in St Paul : I always amazes me how EV doubters always assume battery technology has stood still for the last several decades .
Even the NIMH battery packs in the EV1 ( and still driving around in some Toyota RAV4 EVs from the same time period ) are good for about 150,000 miles .
None of the battery technologies used in EVs are prone to explosion or fire .
New battery technologies are indeed expensive , but also very long lived .
Lithium Titanate batteries - like the Altairnanos used in this car : http://phoenixmotorcars.com have a lifetime that will probably exceed the lifetime of the auto .
Battery prices fall with time , just like any advancing technology .
Old battery technology is very affordable .
If you bought one of these , for example : http://www.alanizcorporation.com/
you would find that lead - acid batteries , while needing frequent replacement , nonetheless only cost you about a nickel per mile .

Former playboy playmate Vanessa Carbone has staged an unconventional protest against Japanese whaling , by holding a naked demonstration outside the Japanese embassy in Santiago , Chile ( pictures ) .
The Argentinian model was among a group of protesters demanding that the Chilean government create a whale sanctuary in the country ’s territorial waters .
Stripped down to nothing more than a skimpy thong , she unsurprisingly drew the most attention from passers - by .

Under existing international law , Japan is prevented from killing whales for commercial activities , but is allowed to hunt a specified number each year for so called ‘ scientific purposes . ’
Although unconventional , it ’s likely that Carbone ’s actions will help to significantly increase the spotlight on the activities of the Japanese whaling fleet – and on their opponents , who say the Japanese are seeking to re-commence commercial whaling activities by stealth .

Few incoming presidents have been left by their predecessors with as many challenges as Barack Obama .
In fact , with the daunting terrain facing the incoming president , one wonders why Obama and John McCain even wanted the office .
Other presidents facing an uphill task when taking office were :
 George Washington , who had to hold the 13 new states together long enough to get the republic firmly established ;
 Martin Van Buren , who had to deal with the economic panic of 1837 , which originated from the inflationary and excessive monetary and credit expansion by his predecessor Andrew Jackson ;
 Abraham Lincoln , Andrew Johnson , and Ulysses S. Grant , who faced a massive civil war and its aftermath caused , in part , by the policies of their predecessors , Franklin Pierce , and James Buchanan ;
 Grover Cleveland , who faced the second worst depression in U.S. history caused by the high tariffs , profligate federal spending , and excessive monetary expansion of his predecessor , Benjamin Harrison ;
 Franklin D. Roosevelt , who inherited the nation ’s worst depression from Herbert Hoover ;
 Gerald Ford , who inherited a nation disillusioned by the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal under the Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon administrations .
Of course , one might predict that the American people and media , as well as historians , might give Obama a break because he inherited such a mess from Bush .
Such a benevolent public reaction occurred after FDR inherited a severe economic downturn from Herbert Hoover and proceeded to prolong it into an extended depression .
Similarly , history has treated Lincoln excessively well for provoking a massive civil conflict  which killed more than 600,000 Americans and is still the worst U.S. war , but which provided only nominal freedom for African - Americans and might have been avoided by earlier offering the South compensated emancipation of slaves .
On the other hand , Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant have n’t fared as well , despite their efforts to clean up the Herculean mess left by Pierce , Buchanan , and Lincoln .
The episode in U.S. history most similar to the present circumstances may be Gerald Ford ’s inheritance of stagflation ( high unemployment plus inflation ) and the aftermath of the Vietnam debacle from LBJ and Nixon .
In one sense , Obama has it worse because he is inheriting two ongoing military quagmires , not just the national malaise caused by a lost brushfire war , and faces a financial meltdown that is worse than mere stagflation .
On the other hand , Obama is n’t inheriting the after effects of a scandal that undermined the Constitution .
Economically , the episodes most similar to the present appear to be the severe downturns that Van Buren and Cleveland inherited from their predecessors .
Astutely , both of these men  two of the best presidents in U.S. history  relied on tight money policies and free market principles to let wages and prices go down in order to reestablish equilibrium in the market .
George W. Bush has aggravated the current economic crisis by bailing out and partially nationalizing financial institutions , artificially pumping up credit , and thus aggravating the inevitable and necessary market correction .
Herbert Hoover and FDR enacted similar policies to artificially pump up the economy , only to convert a run -of - the - mill recession into the Great Depression .
Unfortunately , it seems that Obama will also join Bush ’s big government response to the crisis .
Historically , however , if the government does n’t commit massive blunders in interventionist economic policy ( on the scale of Hoover and FDR ) , the U.S. economy is usually resilient and will eventually right itself ; more challenging for Obama may be ending the two overseas military bogs .
Obama seems to have better inclinations toward the Iraq war than Bush .
At least , he has pledged to withdraw more troops faster from Iraq than his predecessor .
He may , however , transfer them to Afghanistan  the other nation - building and Islamist - rallying quagmire .
When entering office , no president has ever faced two losing wars and a severe economic meltdown , which also undermines the ability to successfully turn the wars around .
Thus , the only solution to save badly needed funds and take the fire out of the anti-U.S. Islamist blowback is a rapid U.S. withdrawal from both countries .
The nation is in peril ; only time will tell if Obama can rise to the challenge .
As the economy continues to reel , a new report finds that 4 million American households lost economic security between 2000 and 2006 , and that a majority of America 's middle class households are either borderline or at high risk of falling out of the middle class altogether .
The new report , " From Middle to Shaky Ground : The Economic Decline of America 's Middle Class , 2000 - 2006 " was published by the policy center Demos and the Institute for Assets and Social Policy ( IASP ) at Brandeis University .
" From Middle to Shaky Ground " is based on the Middle Class Security Index , co-developed by Demos and IASP / Brandeis , which uses government data and measures the financial security of the middle class by rating household stability across five core economic factors : assets , educational achievement , housing costs , budget and healthcare .
Based on how a family ranked in each of these factors , they were defined as financially " secure , " " borderline " or " at risk " .
In addition to the report , Demos and IASP / Brandeis have published an " Economic Security Scorecard " that the average family can use to measure where they fall on the Middle Class Security Index .
" The increases we 're witnessing in housing costs and the number of families who lack health insurance , coupled with the extreme volatility of the average household 's savings , show that a large percentage of America 's middle class are not well equipped to weather this current economic storm , " said Jennifer Wheary , one the report 's co-authors and a Senior Fellow at Demos .
" From Middle to Shaky Ground " shows some worrying trends in America 's households , including :
--
The median financial assets held by middle - class families declined by 22 percent .
This means that for every dollar in median assets that middle - class families held in 2000 , they held just 78 cents in 2006 .
These figures do not include home equity and therefore do not reflect additional losses families may have experienced due a decline in their home values .
-- Monthly housing expenses for the middle class rose by 9 percent .
As a result , the percentage of middle - class families who match the Department of Housing and Urban Development 's definition of " housing burdened " rose from 31 percent in 2000 to 37 percent in 2006 .
--
The number of middle - class families in which at least one member lacks health insurance grew from 18 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2006 .
" Declines such as these in any one area are alarming , " said Tom Shapiro , Professor of Law and Director of the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis .
" Bad news across a range of areas supporting financial stability means the middle class is confronting its greatest challenge since the Great Depression . "

Scotland on course to being the third most state - dependent country in world
Only Iraq and Cuba spend more taxpayers ' money on public services than Edinburgh
Scotland is on course to become the third most state - dependent country in the world .
Only Cuba and Iraq spend more taxpayers ' money on public service , The Sunday Times reports .
Economic forecasters predict that by 2012 public spending will rise to the equivalent of 67 per cent of Scotland 's gross domestic product .
In Cuba that figure is 81 per cent and in Iraq it is 87 per cent ..
The findings are contained in a report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) , which says that the uneven spread of cash north of the border is putting an ' unfair burden ' on English taxpayers and warns that the burgeoning Scottish public sector is ' unsustainable ' .
According to the findings of the study , commissioned by The Sunday Times , Scotland is ranked 20th in the world league table of the highest public - spending governments .
In 2007 - 08 , 56 per cent of economic activity flowed from public spending , compared with 43 per cent in the UK as a whole , which is ranked 42nd in the world .
The figure for Scotland is expected to rise dramatically over the next three years due to a combination of higher unemployment and a shrinking private sector .
One of the biggest drains on taxpayers ’ money is the public - sector wage bill , which stands at £ 12 billion , up 61 per cent since devolution , with almost one in four working Scots now employed by the state .
Some £ 2.3 billion is spent on pensions for public - sector workers , whose ranks have risen by 50,000 to nearly 600,000 in the past decade .
Scots now receive £ 1,644 ( 22 per cent ) more per head than their southern counterparts , up from £ 828 in 1999 .
A spokesman for the finance secretary John Swinney said the forecasts were overestimates

But with a spate of new product releases in the pipeline , 2009 could prove to be the year that electronic books , or e-books , cross over from being the sole preserve of techies to a must - have for everyone .
Currently , the Sony Reader leads the pack .
When the product launched through Waterstone 's stores in September , it quickly sold out , and the devices are flying off shelves ahead of Christmas .
But there is some tough competition on the horizon .
Amazon is finally set to launch its Kindle e-book , which allows users the opportunity to download hundreds of books wirelessly from the internet on the move , in the UK next year .
Like the Reader , its reputation is formidable , with almost 400,000 of the product already sold in the US .
In partnership with the publisher HarperCollins , Nintendo is launching its " 100 Classic Book Collection " , which includes 21 Shakespeare plays and 13 Dickens novels , for its handheld DS games console on Boxing Day .
There are also a range of applications available to allow users to read e-books on an iPhone , the current favourite being the free - to - download and simple - to - use Stanza , as well as hundreds of classic books that can be downloaded straight to the phone for 59 p .
These new products will join the Reader 's current competition , iRex Technologies '
iLiad portable electronic reader , which launched in the UK in April .
However , the iLiad is almost twice as expensive as the Reader and less popular .

Publishers are responding to the trend towards electronic readers , too .
Penguin 's digital business is complex , involving online marketing , distribution through new channels , such as mobile phones , and e-books ' rise to prominence .
The group is currently digitising 5,000 titles from its backlist and , by 2010 , almost all its 18,000 titles will be made available in electronic form .
It will join the likes of Project Gutenberg , an online project that has been creating a digital archive of classic texts since 1971 and now has 24,000 books available for free from its website ( www.gutenberg.com).
So what is the appeal of the Reader ?
Well , it is smaller than a hardback , comes with 100 classic titles on a CD – including Pride and Prejudice and Great Expectations – as well as 14 pre-loaded excerpts from new and recent books .
Users can store and display personal business documents in formats such as Adobe PDF and Microsoft Word , which are converted into rich - text format , and JPeg images , as well as using its USB - storage capability to transfer files .
An " auto sync " feature lets users set up folders with books and documents that can be automatically synchronised when the device is connected to a PC .
But the really neat thing – which is where electronic book technology comes into its own – is its use of electronic ink technology ( which the iLiad shares ) .
The display on the e-reader mimics the traditional book page by being viewable in direct sunlight or at angles of up to 180 degrees .
By teaming up with Waterstone 's to launch the product from its stores , Sony had the advantage of appealing to those who love books , as well as using the store 's relationship with publishers .
Needless , to say , Sony is in a buoyant mood .
It is No 1 in the marketplace – with a 90 per cent share of the market – and hopes to stay there even after Kindle is launched .
" We are in restraint at the moment ; namely , we do n't have as much stock as we need to supply everywhere we would like , " says Wes Dearing , the Reader 's UK product manager .
" At the moment we are conducting research to gain an insight into who is actually buying it .
While there would definitely be a percentage of gadget aficionados getting hold of them , there are also those who love books buying it , and I would argue that we are already reaching the mass market .
But to pull in as many people as we can , our product strategy will now be to open up our range of colours , and implementing new technology to get people interested .
A lot is also driven by the content available . "
Sony needs to continue investing in its product if it is to see off the various competitors set to flood the market .
Nintendo is a great example of a non-traditional book company trying to get in on the act .
" Ultimately , it has been Nintendo 's mission to expand audiences beyond the normal gaming arena , " says Nintendo 's senior product manager , James Honeywell .
" It is a vibrant market for us and we want to try to bring in new consumers .
The movie industry does not just appeal to one area of the population – everyone goes to see films .
That 's the same as we are doing with video games . "
The gaming firm tries to appeal to adults through its Touch Generations of titles , which includes the fabulously popular " brain training " games ( the most famous of which is Dr Kawashima 's Brain Training : How Old is Your Brain ? ) .
Crucially , however , the DS operates using a backlit screen , which means that sustained reading could cause eye strain .
" Everyone is working towards a book in an electronic format , and we would never position the DS and Reader as directly competing , " continues Honeywell .
" The two machines offer very different things .
The Reader is more specialised in this area , whereas the DS offers various kinds of entertainment .
If it does turn into a more established thing , then maybe Nintendo can develop more products .
We are going to launch it and see what happens . "
The Kindle was initially supposed to be on sale in Britain in time for Christmas , but the delay is partly because the Kindle uses a free wireless service called Whispernet , which enables users to download books , and signing up networks in Europe is " a complex operation " , say Amazon 's business leaders .
This is good news for Sony , which can use the time to develop its own " on the move " download service .
At the moment , in the US , Kindle is quite well known for its use of wireless technology , specifically 3G advanced telephone networks , " continues Dearing .
" That 's something we are considering , though it 's an area we are looking at to see if consumers really want it .
Potentially , we could team up with a mobile phone network to do that .
We will look at that moving forward . "
Sony is also presumably going to try to get its price down , as £ 200 is a lot to shell out before any reading has actually been done .
This might not be as big a problem as one might normally expect .
The Reader has proved popular with older consumers , who are benefiting from its ability to increase text size and thereby reduce eye strain .
And what of traditional books ?
Does this mean that 2009 will see their covers closed for the last time ?
" We are strongly identified with Sony , and while we have been pleased with sales , there were supply issues , " said a Waterstone 's spokesperson .
" The original stock we had sold out in three days .
But what we have always said about Readers is they offer another element of choice on how people can read .
With other forms of entertainment , such as movies , you can watch them on DVD or your phone or iPod .
People expect that now .
We see them as different way of reading .
We see them more as an extension of the market .
We have 7,000 titles on our website at the moment .
We are working with publishers to get their books converted into new formats as quickly as possible . "

Buying an Apple computer ?
Get ready to throw away your monitor , over and over again .
New Apple hardware is shipping with " HDCP " anti-copying technology that prevents showing some video on " non-compliant " monitors .
Best part : the list of " compliant " monitors will change over time : the monitor you buy today can be " revoked " tomorrow and stop working .
Slashdot says that Apple 's added " copyright protection " to its video .
But copyright law is n't violated when you watch a movie on an " unapproved " monitor .
This is n't about enforcing copyright law , it 's about giving a small handful of movie companies a veto over hardware designs .
Yesterday , our buddy David Chartier at Ars and Sam Oliver at AppleInsider both publicized an issue that 's been burning up the support boards for a while now : iTunes video rentals and purchases in HD are flagged for HDCP control , and in cooperation with the new Mini DisplayPort connector on the MacBook and MacBook Pro unibody models , those movies and TV shows are refusing to play back on non-compliant external displays .
In this case , ' compliant ' means HDMI or recent - vintage DVI , but even monitors or TVs that support HDCP may not properly negotiate with the DisplayPort connector to give iTunes and QuickTime the all - clear signal ( if so , quitting and relaunching iTunes once the display is hooked up may clear the playback hold ) .
Equally annoying : HDCP is only supposed to apply to ' high - value ' digital streams , meaning standard - def purchases and rentals on the iTunes store should be out of scope … but some reports indicate that both the HD and SD instances are flagged , blocking playback on anything but the laptop 's internal display or a straight - thru HDMI connection .
Argh !

This piece of code has a huge bug in it .
Can you see it ?
I ’ll give you a hint , what is going to happen if Key , IV or Mode are going to throw an exception ?
Well , let us check the actual generated code from Reflector .
As you can see , we first set the value to a local variable , we set the properties and only then we enter the using clause .
If any of the properties will throw out an exception , we will never enter the using block , and the object will never be disposed .
Personally , I think that this is an issue with the compiler , that it should be able to generate safe code for this scenario .
As it is , the code looks fine , but the subtle bug can come and bite you .
Beware .
Mr. Johnson , who is now deputy director for management at the Office and Management and Budget , said most people were stunned to learn that the percentage of politically appointed employees in the federal government is so small , a mere 0.17 percent of the civilian work force of 1.9 million .
Mr. Johnson , who is well regarded by Republicans and Democrats alike for his expertise about federal employment issues , said that there were about 1,000 senior positions in the federal agencies that required Senate confirmation .
These are typically positions like assistant , deputy and under secretary .
In addition there are 8,000 senior bureaucrats in what is called the Senior Executive Service and by law , no more than 10 percent , or 800 , of these managerial positions may be filled by political appointees .
Finally , he said , an administration has some 1,500 jobs to fill , known as Schedule C slots , with salaries ranging from about $ 25,000 to $ 150,000 .
The lower end of this scale are those jobs that people traditionally think of as political slots  suitable , say , for some party leader ’s niece who just graduated from college .
( That adds up to 3,300 , not including hundreds of federal judges , diplomats and members of boards and commissions . )
“ To have one or two political appointees for every thousand employees is not unreasonable , ” Mr. Johnson said .
“ It ’s actually a minimal number given that every new administration wants to bring its own initiatives and needs a fresh set of people committed to those new policies . ”
The long odds of landing a position have probably contributed to the frenzy of job seekers trying to gain whatever advantage they can .
One person involved in the Obama campaign said she had been contacted for help on behalf of someone who was three degrees removed  a friend of a relative of a friend .
The Obama person spoke on the condition of anonymity , saying that to do otherwise , or to name names , would simply embarrass all concerned .
TUCSON - An ultralight pilot who flew a bit too low crashed his marijuana - stuffed aircraft southwest of Tucson .
The unnamed pilot sustained serious back injuries following Friday night 's crash near the Casino Del Sol .
Federal officials think the single - engine plane may have been overloaded with about 350 pounds of marijuana when it clipped electrical lines and crashed .
A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection says smugglers have been using ultralights to avoid radar .
This particular plane avoided radar after taking off from Mexico , but was eventually spotted by a Customs and Border Protection unmanned aircraft flown by remote control .
Officials say the pilot could face drug smuggling charges as well as charges of illegally entering the U.S .

A fair and clear termination policy can be the difference between an exciting work environment that encourages growth , and whatever the opposite of that is .
Nowhere is this clearer than in the professional relationship between the Decepticon leader , Megatron , and his subordinate , Starscream .
As a service to budding executives and , more importantly , Megatron , we 've combed through the entire Transformers catalog to find five examples of Starscream 's behavior that should not be tolerated by any executive .

1 5:35 Into the First Episode of the TV Series The Situation Upon hearing that their enemies , the Autobots , are planning to scour the universe for an energy source , Starscream tells Megatron : " The Autobots would have lost eons ago if I 'd been calling the shots . "
He follows that statement up with : " My time will come , Megatron . "
Suggested Course of Action
It 's best to address a situation before it gets out of hand .
At this point , just five minutes into the first episode of the show , Megatron should have already been asking himself if it was worth keeping Starscream on as a member of the team .

The answer is clear .
Megatron has many employees who are willing to listen to his orders without politicking for more power .
He should have immediately terminated Starscream and had him escorted from the premises by Shockwave and Thundercracker .
Or alternatively , he could have shot him in the back of the head with his huge arm cannon .
2 10:30 Into The Same Episode The Situation After four million years , a volcanic eruption brings the Decepticons back to life with the aid of fix - it robots on the Autobot ship that crashed on Earth .
Once all the Decepticons are fully functional , Starscream begins firing his arm laser aimlessly at the valley below .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Suggested Course of Action
One should never confront an erratic , potentially violent employee alone .
Megatron needs to attempt to develop a workplace environment that fosters trust among existing employees and management , and to do so he cannot tolerate loose cannons such as Starscream .
For sensitivity purposes , Megatron should have taken Starscream off the premises and fired him privately in order to preserve the Decepticon 's dignity .
Failing that , Megatron may have considered waiting until Starscream turned around so that he could shoot him in the back of the head with his enormous arm cannon .
This conversation takes place in New York because I cannot picture us anywhere else .
I am leading you to the north - eastern bench in Washington Square or walking by your side through the Botanical Garden in Brooklyn .
I no longer need to convert my thoughts from Hebrew into English so that you will be able to understand how much I miss you .
After 30 years in which you stubbornly refused to learn this language you understand every word I say .
But this conversation is especially strange because you are silent .
Your deep , hoarse voice does not dominate it with new trains of thought , unexpected questions , memories of your childhood in Hebron , your adolescence in Ramallah during the first intifada or the four years you studied art in Baghdad .
You no longer butt in , either , with things that happened to you yesterday and this morning .
New York loves people like you , people who peel the world with their fingers , like a glowing orange dripping juice .
Adventures were happening wherever we went as if they were lying patiently in ambush , waiting for you to show up .
The impassive Indian owner of the cigarette stand on West 4th Street turned in your presence into a glib conjuror who juggled with his fingers and pulled the change out of his left ear .
The homeless man in Union Square opened his worn sack for you and revealed a treasury of lost keys , boasting that he could open the doors of half Manhattan and spend each night in a different bed .
The angelic girl with ponytails who sailed on her skates into the Lower East Side café invited us , in a heavy southern accent , to come and watch her dancing nude at a strip joint on 60th Street .
The black missionary , an old lady of huge dimensions , spoke about her Sweet Jesus and rolled a cigarette filled with hash .
I laughed at you , saying you lived as though your life were a film .
Standing next to you , I felt that I too was being projected on an enormous screen .
Then you spoke mainly about the children 's book you were writing .
In the smallest room in Brooklyn , more than 30 sheets of paper covered in detailed pencil drawings were pegged on to strings you had criss - crossed above your bed .
Only one character appeared in all of them - neither man nor boy , all curls and jewels ; his eyes were always closed and on his lips hovered a faint , soft smile .
In December his name was Sultan , in January Hassan and in May he was Reihan .
The titles also kept changing until you decided on Hassan Everywhere .
But the wonderful journey progressed with tremendous momentum .
In one drawing your hero is embracing a drop of dew in the desert , in a second he is playing the violin to a swarm of bees and in a third he is diving into the depths of the sea to kiss a sad fish .
The Arabic text that accompanied them was lyrical and abstract and went far beyond the adventure it described .
Since I suspected myself of being biased , too dazzled by the artist to be able to judge his work , I took Joy along , a senior editor in a big publishing house , who said this was an exceptional achievement .
The children 's book agent who met you said your talent was eerie .
The representatives of the Al - Qattan Foundation , who had chosen your book to inaugurate the children 's library they were setting up in Gaza , also spurred you on .
You worked then without respite , by day and night .
Hassan floated out of a wonder train , met a butterfly of light and spangled the sky with stars .
There was no piece of wall , from the floor to the ceiling , from which this dreamy , smiling figure did not peep .
Outside your apartment , the New York winter of 2002 stretched long into the following year .
There were months of continuous , disheartening , paralysing cold .
Even the locals agreed it was one of the hardest seasons the city had ever known .
For us this cold was a source of tears .
It was so alien , so offensive , our bodies could not cope .
Under the four pairs of trousers you wore , one on top of the other , and under my disintegrating red coat , we were shivering all the time .
We were more Levantine than ever .
We fantasised about our Middle Eastern sun , as miserable as two junkies without their fix .
The weather exposed our foreignness , mocked at our opinion of ourselves as universal beings dependent on nothing .
Our passports held visas from the US Department of Immigration , authorising a legal stay in New York , but the winter seemed bent on deporting us .
Neither the chicken soup we ate in the Ashkenazi restaurants in the East Village nor the Sahlab we drank at the Cairo Cafe succeeded in assuaging our longing for home .
During the interminable games of backgammon that we played , I heard myself talking to you about Israel without a single drop of cynicism souring the words .
Suddenly , and how ironic that it should happen with you of all people , I found in my voice a true love of homeland .
I had to sit with a Palestinian guy on the freezing steps of City Hall in Brooklyn in order to admit to myself how attached I am to Israel .
I had to go all the way to New York so that you , with the nostalgia of one born to a refugee family , who grew up with the ongoing longing for the landscapes that surrounded me throughout my whole life , would describe them to me .
Far from them , by your side , I loved them perhaps more than ever .
It was snowing all around but we waxed poetic about the pale - silvery side of the olive leaves , the light touch that cracks open the flesh of ripe figs , the brassy smell of the carobs in bloom , the invisible thorns on the skins of the cactus fruit .
In the train , on the way to Andrew 's birthday party , we poured out our hearts about the smooth , dry smell of the air in the hills around Jerusalem , about the damp of the coastal plain , about the weariness of the noon hours in the July Hamsins .
I compared our reflected faces in the window .
Behind it , the scenes that we were visualising were projected on the sooty walls of the backward - rushing tunnel .
The expression on our faces was the same expression , the vista was of the same homeland , only the passports in our coat pockets were different ; the passports of enemies .
Outside the station , we mentioned the sea and we sighed a deep sigh that blew a small cloud of mist from our mouths .
At every opportunity , as if it were surrounding our thoughts and appearing outside every window , from every room , the Mediterranean found a way of entering our conversations .
Ever since the courses of our lives crossed in 8th Street , a new shade has been added to my picture of the sea .
Since then , the water itself has seemed deeper , and suddenly frightening .
Hugo and Mahmoud , through whom I met you , trailed after us that first evening .
The trees were decorated for Christmas with chains of light and the shop windows with red and green .
Through the film of dry tears that the cold brought to my eyes , everything sparkled more brightly .
You told me you could not drive , could not shoot and could not swim .
The awareness that I was Israeli and you were Palestinian lingered between us , but slowly grew faint .
We were one man and one woman in the heart of the Village in New York : young , beautiful , flirtatious .
" Me - I 'm a fish in water , " I boasted about my diving skills .
And before you managed to react , I had already been swept away into excited chatter about the Mediterranean .
I said I could not bear the thought of living far from this treasure of nature .
I said life in Tel Aviv is worthwhile only because of the blue background that stretches out behind it .
I said it is the wonderful , open , western wall of my home .
I said that for me it is holier than all the holy places .
You were silent .
" And how come you ca n't swim , anyway ? " I teased you , " what about the beach at Gaza ? "
You smiled the sad version of that smile and described the difficulties that the Israeli occupation heaps on the passage of West Bank residents to the Gaza Strip .
Embarrassment rooted me to the spot while you counted on the fingers of one hand the number of times you had bathed in the Mediterranean in your entire life .
The inequality of our freedoms hit me powerfully because that evening , in New York , absolute equality existed between us .
" Come on . "
You turned and held those cold , dry fingers out to me .
" I wo n't throw you into the sea for that . "
All at once , everything between us became political .
In a huge wave , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict flooded the space between us .
For a long moment we walked without speaking .
The thing that had enabled the immediate connection between us now imposed a certain distance .
It flared into an argument after we left Astor Place and you finished the sentence you had started earlier .
" But I really do believe that you and we have to share this sea , we have to learn to swim in it together . "
The argument that began then , at two in the morning , continued throughout the entire winter .
In the summer , suddenly , it was cut off .
The depressing weather broke me on June 10 .
It was still raining .
I booked myself a plane ticket and told you that in another five days I was going back to Israel .
You asked enviously : " You 're going home ? " I trembled , as usual , when we spoke that word .
I do not know which of us started it , when it happened that we stopped saying " Israel " or " Palestine " .
We simply said home , but we meant the same place .
Through your messianic gaze , it was always one place .
In my eyes , from a distance of thousands of kilometers , it was the conflict ripping these two places apart that made them , paradoxically , one .
From that distance , Abu Mazen seemed to be a brave new leader and Ariel Sharon was quoted as saying , " An end to the occupation . "
The renewal of talks towards negotiations joined rumours of a rare spring that was sweeping the region after a blessed winter and I , filled with hope and with a physical need for the warmth of the sun , wanted to go home .
You were more doubtful about the Road Map .
The peace you dreamed of would be realised on the day when there arose , between the sea and the river , a binational state , common to both peoples .
I remember how your eyes shone when you described it with broad gestures .
Equal , free , without borders .
For you it was exciting , the expression of a wish ; for me it was a prophecy of doom that made me tremble .
Because of this disparity , the argument between us led nowhere .
I prayed and I still pray for a modest , lukewarm , mediocre peace - while you dreamed of harmonious , utopian , John Lennony reconciliation , I insisted repeatedly that the crisis of hatred and suspicion between the two peoples was too deep and tragic for such a dream to come true .
You mocked me and said I had little faith , that I was restricting the horizon of my thinking .
I said I was reducing my expectations to the measure of two separate narrow states because the one wide one would be the end of the state of Israel .
You declared that only the continuation of the occupation would be the end of Israel .
I said I was filled with shame and criticism for what Israeliness looks like and for the occupation as its main feature , but I did not want it to change except for those bad and harmful features .
You said I was shortsighted .
I wanted the day to come when I would need a passport to visit you in Ramallah .
I wanted you to come to Tel Aviv and be able to move about freely and safely when you visited me .
The reason I love the thought of a Palestinian state with the borders of the Green Line is because then , at last , the state of Israel will also have its own borders .
Another reason I hope to live to see a Palestinian independence day is that I will then feel freer to celebrate my own independence day .
Perhaps I told you this and perhaps I only mused anxiously that a binational state was liable to turn everything upside down , to switch our roles in this tragedy .
I see you now compressing your lower lip with disappointment and shaking your curls from side to side before starting again .
Over and over , without a single drop of bitterness , your vision of the new Middle East was turning the entire room into a large , generous , ideal country : Israstine or Palestael , you would laugh suddenly ; " we 'll call it whatever you like " .
You would explain that there are two peoples but only one land .
Our sources of water depend on each other , our economies are conditional upon each other , the holy places of the two religions are interwoven in the same city , the landscapes and the roads and the communities and the air space above them are in each other 's grip .
Your eyes would widen then with wonder .
" Deep inside you , you know very well that your grandchildren and my grandchildren will live together in this land , so why not now ? " you would ask so convincingly , " why not us ? "
This was the stage at which I would despair .
The Palestinian insistence on the right of return , exactly like the Israeli insistence on the settlements - by now I was almost shouting - holds up the solution interminably .
I want to go back to the 1967 borders , but you , you want to return to the non-borders of 1948 .
Stamping my feet and waving my arms , I was no longer capable of hearing your answer .
I can't really remember when exactly you too decided to leave the United States , but from that day nothing else concerned us .
The time we had left together we spent wandering in the streets , drinking and smoking but mostly intoxicated with the sudden decision to leave .
We got on and off the train from the Botanical Gardens to the Brooklyn Bridge and back to Union Square .
It was not only the town I was taking leave of , it was you too .
Before I left for the airport we embraced again and I gave you a bitter smile .
" Yaallah , baby , " I then spoke the bad joke that now makes my flesh creep , " See you in the next world . "
We both knew that even though Ramallah and Tel Aviv are less than an hour apart by car , it would be very hard for us to meet .
We knew that if we had not taken a flight of 12 hours from there to another country , to a generous city like New York , we would never have met .
It was equally clear to us that even if we had met , say at some left - wing demonstration , we would , at most , have achieved a polite friendship .
A bond like this could not be formed between two people facing the physical and theoretical barriers that from now on would stand before us .
Your answer , too , seems to me today like a bad omen , but then it was light and optimistic .
" Not in the next world , " you said , " next time we meet it will be in Jaffa ; we 'll sit by the sea and eat fish . "
I got into the taxi and did not know that , with the exception of the meal you planned for us , it was all going to come true .
We arrived , three weeks apart , in Tel Aviv and Ramallah .
During the 10 days that you managed to spend there , we spoke on the phone two or three times and on the 11th day you came to Jaffa , to the sea .
I am still there .
I live next to the Greek Church , opposite the port .
The Mediterranean surrounds the house and appears outside every room , at every window .
From the balcony I can see the exact spot from which you set out on your last journey .
I sigh , once because of this spectacular beauty and once for you .
This sea is different from the sea I left and different from the one I recollected in New York .
Your death has conquered it since then and now dominates the entire expanse before my eyes .
It has finally turned you into Hassan who is Everywhere , giving you the bluest identity card there is , entitling you to sail back and forth , with total freedom , above this country from Rosh Hanikra in the north all along the coastal plain down to the southern strip in Gaza .
If I ever thought that your joy of life was a political statement , today I know that the way in which you lost your life defined it finally .
Now we share the sea with complete equality - you from the water and me from the shore - and I want to tell you that your binational dream has been realised in the most terrible way .
I want you to know that the film you are starring in has been playing for the last eight months on the blue screen of the seashore in Tel Aviv .
I watch it from the balcony ; it opens on the morning of August 6 2003 when four young Palestinians leave Ramallah for a one - day illegal stay in Israel .
Karma is driving the car , you are sitting next to her and in the back are your youngest brother Waffa and Samer , your nephew .
You go through the Kalandia checkpoint with exceptional ease and the whole way west , following the humidity towards Tel Aviv , you all sing and take each other 's pictures .
The car is parked near the clock tower in Jaffa .
When Waffa heads for the market to buy fruit , the three of you go down to the no-swimming beach at the foot of the mosque , far from the lifeguards .
You choose an isolated spot so as not to arouse suspicions .
The waves are rough .
Karma and Samer go in to have a dip .
You only roll up your trousers .
As they go deeper you wave to them with ever longer gestures from the shore .
I can hear from here the sigh that perhaps you sighed .
I guess at the salty smell that filled your lungs , the water lapping at your ankles and the feeling of the sand on the soles of your feet .
I see your beautiful eyes moving with pleasure , drawing the perfect line of the horizon .
Maybe you looked back from time to time , stimulated by the approaching taste of the fruit .
But the next time you turn your gaze back to the distance , Samer is gone .
I can imagine your feverish thoughts , Karma 's signals of distress , your anxiety welling .
I think of you deliberating .
Unable to stand aloof , you remove the striped shirt you were wearing that day and then strive to swim out , fighting the waves , choking .
I see your movements becoming fewer , slowing down , your strength fading , your body growing cold .
But more than anything I think of you deep in the water that surrounded you , infinite as air .
The moments when you realise that not only can you not save Samer but that you yourself are drowning , haunt me ceaselessly .
I cannot imagine the silence that must have enveloped your senses and the crushing loneliness , or perhaps only a sort of emptiness .
Over and over I try to guess at your thoughts in those minutes , what came into your mind as life ran out of you .
I want to hope that they were full of awareness , full of inspiration , full of light .
I want to believe that you were carried away on underground currents as by a wind , that you let the blue colours lead you serenely and reconciled .
I imagine you at this everlasting time as an illustration in a children 's book being drawn in slow motion .
There you are neither man nor boy , all curls , bejewelled with seaweed and shells , sinking with closed eyes among the strokes of the paintbrush that depict the water , while on your lips hovers a faint , soft smile .
My dearest Hassan , you entered and left my life so quickly that now I think I imagined you .
The friendship between us seems impossible , a wild invention , considering the iron certainty of the occupation on the one hand and the terrorism on the other .
I look from here at who we were in New York and see us as other people saw us - with disbelief .
Israelis and Arabs were either amazed or suspicious .
We seemed strange when we reminded each other to ring home after every suicide bombing in Israel and with every report of Israeli army operations in the territories .
American Jews could not understand how it was that your Arabness is more familiar to me than they will ever be .
We come from the same neighbourhood , I used to say , but today , when I think of it from here , I too wonder at us .
I keep remembering the blurred sight of your face through the cigarette smoke and the mists of inebriation or through the glittery curtain of those dry tears of cold .
I keep remembering the utterly prophetic words you let fly one day , stoned out of your mind .
You said that perhaps we should set up a sort of protest movement of friends .
I would introduce you to all my Israeli friends and you would introduce me to all your Palestinian friends .
We would throw a party , you said , turned on by the idea - parties !
Later , all my friends and your friends would introduce each other to all their friends ; the thing would grow and grow .
People would learn to love each other , learn to forgive each other .
There would be comfort , reciprocity , you will see , you said , taking another drag and exhaling the words slowly from your lungs .
" It will change the situation , I am telling you , a movement like this could change the whole political map in the Middle East . "
Then , throwing your head back , you burst out laughing .

Kathleen 's post :
For a 61 year old woman , I had a terrifically interesting day .
On Wednesday , February 20 , 2007 I got arrested - along with a 73 year old woman named Dot .
We entered Sen. Gordon Smith 's office and asked the receptionist if we could n't speak to Senator Smith or one of his aides .
We were informed that Senator Smith was in Salem today - and no aide except one involved with immigration issues was present in the office today .
I asked if Sen .
Smith or his aides would be in his office tomorrow and I was told that in order to speak to the senator a voter would have to submit a request in writing .
The receptionist 's answer was an acceptable response - but she ignored the fact I had just indicated that we would be willing to speak to one of his aides in consideration of the busy senator 's schedule .
I did not believe a " written request should be necessary to speak to one of the senator 's aides so at this point I wondered , " Does this senator believe he has any obligation to the citizen - to his fellow Oregonians ? "
Why would n't a telephone call provide the senator OR one of his aides with sufficient notice that one of his constituents had a desire to express an opinion on an important and pressing issue such as the Iraq war .
I felt that the receptionist was being evasive - and that the senator was prepared to duck and dodge any request for a serious conversation on the issue .
At this point , I did sit down and wrote out a letter requesting some time with the senator , himself , within 7 working days since I felt that the effort of a written request warranted more than a few moments with one of the senator 's office staff .
The receptionist asked us to leave , Dot and I refused - and 3 regular police officers came to arrest us - soon joined by 3 bicycle officers .
Dot and I must appear awfully dangerous to require 6 police officers - even though I am only about 5 ' 4 " tall and Dot 's head barely came to the height of my shoulder .
( I 'd guess Dot is slightly less than 5 ' tall . )
Neither
Dot nor I would make a very convincing Amazons , but I felt honored .
Each police officer who Dot and I encountered today were courteous , polite , and even apologetic ; some seem amused - a few seemed shocked .
I feel that they should be commended for their warmth and courtesy - I think Dot would agree that we felt we received better treatment from the hands of PPD than we did from Sen.
Smith 's office .
One Sen . Smith 's aides who arrived about the time the police officers arrived .
( I think the gentleman who came out to speak to us was an aide since he was dressed in a suit - not a security uniform . )
Dot asked him if he could make a statement about the senator 's stance about defunding the war .
The man ( I fail to recall his name ) refused to offer statement on Smith 's behalf , and he said , " You should have more respect for a U.S. senator than to refuse to leave his office " .
At his point I turned this man 's rudy complexion a neon red because of something that I said ....
Oops .
In the presence of the police officers he 'd called I said , " " Gee I woulda thought that a democratically elected politician should have more respect - for the voter - for his constituents ...
Should a senator play hide and seek with his constituents ? " and I asked the police officers if we looked like we " two little old ladies looked dangerous ? " and I made a statement to the affect that the senator must be very easily intimidated to be afraid of 2 elderly constituents .
Dot spoke movingly to Smith 's representative of hearing and seeing a very recent Iraq returnee who was medicated for PTSD and visibly quite shaken by a slight noise and another veteran who said that his children do not have health insurance .
The Smith representative said that the senator wants to talk with those people and to help them .
Senator Smith 's representative did offer to help the veterans that Dot had seen at the David Wu's town hall meeting , but he said the senator would need to talk with them " directly " - and his dismissive tone seemed to exclude the senator 's need to speak further with either one of the two of us about any topic .
On the elevator to the parking garage one of the six officers asked if Dot or I had ever been arrested before .
I said , " No .... we 're first timers . "
That got a laugh so I recycled the remark when we were being booked .
Later in the process of being searched for weapons , I made the statement " My most lethal weapon is a sharp tongue . " - with a smile to indicate that I was indeed harmless .
( Providing an Irish woman with an audience was perhaps not the best strategic decision that Gordon 's political advisers may have made today . )
With each officer with whom I came into contact at the jail , I asked " What do you think of a senator who 'd arrest his constituents for making an attempt to speak to him ? "
I did not hear a single negative response to that question and several officers actually indicated they were shocked .
One of the female police officers who dealt with us told me that she is a Portlandindiemedia photographer and she told me that she 'd see us at the next peace demonstration !!
When it was time to have my mug shot taken I was talking , of course - I do love an audience .
The policewoman told me , " Keep a straight face and look into the camera . "
Of , course that made it impossible for me to keep a straight face - I laughed and they had to take the picture again until I could keep my mouth closed .
When it became evident that this procedure could take all day - they finally got a mug shot of me - obviously stifling laughter with a good deal of effort .
Of course I spoke to all my fellow prisoners as well - and urged them to vote .
They all expressed shock that two old ladies were arrested for attempting to talk to their senator .
( I think I should have been a politician or a preacher cause proselytizing comes so naturally . :-D)
Let me encourage you - I had a great time meeting all the other women .
I begin to think that some of the most interesting , independent and intelligent women are not necessarily " model little housewives " or entirely respectable ones from society 's viewpoint , though more than a few have had very difficult lives and backgrounds .
I must say that I liked Daniel , Monica , Katrina , a beautifull young 18 year old , and all the other women I met " behind bars " .
After nearly 5 hours in detention , I was chauffered home by Tom Hastings a local peace activist who teaches Conflict Resolution at Portland State University - the perfect end to a very interesting day .

Some history .
The following is an editorial that is encouraging a particular Democrat to run against Gordon .
The sentences are satiric .
Imagine if one of Oregon 's two U.S. senators had repeatedly voted against raising the minimum wage , or voted against allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for reasonable prices for prescription drugs .
Imagine if strongly progressive Oregon had sent somebody to the world 's greatest deliberative body who voted against investigating Halliburton , and who voted to raid the Social Security trust fund in order to pay for tax cuts for America 's richest people .
Imagine if Oregon had a senator who believed that people who work for a living should pay taxes at a higher rate than people who make their money buying and selling stock .
Imagine if that senator was one of the prime sponsors of a massive tax cut for multinational corporations — especially drug companies — that stash their profits in overseas tax havens .
A tax cut that George W. Bush 's own treasury secretary denounced as favoring multinationals over domestic firms .
Imagine the senator not only voted for the Iraq war , and supported it for four years , but as late as June 2006 gave an impassioned speech defending the war as a noble fight for " freedom . "
Imagine that in December 2006 he said he was open to supporting sending more troops to Iraq .
Imagine that the same senator openly called for then - Attorney General John Ashcroft to override Oregon 's voter - approved Death with Dignity law , opposed a woman 's right to choose an abortion and was an unabashed supporter of the Patriot Act .
Imagine the senator was one of Congress ' top recipients of trips on corporate jets , accepting rides worth over $ 69,000 since 2001 .
Imagine the same senator voted to allow coal - fired power plants to increase their toxic emissions .
Imagine that his position on global warming was so absurd that the Daily Astorian said he had joined the Flat Earth Society .
Imagine that he had voted to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Imagine he had voted to give $ 11.5 billion in subsidies to the oil and gas industries .
Imagine that the senator thought he could pass himself off as a " moderate " by continuously engaging in transparently political contortions — like taking six different positions on the war in Iraq in six weeks .
Yeah .
Imagine that .
Well , one does n't have to imagine ; Oregon has this Senator , right now .
I think I may count yesterday ’s small skirmish outside the Denver Mint as of the most hilarious scenes at the Democratic National Convention .
Not the “ Shake Your Money Maker ” protest by Recreate 68 , where activists performed a Yippie - esque “ levitate the mint ” performance and Marc Cohen donned a wizards outfit and chanted oddly .
That action only drew about seventy people , half of whom were from the media .
No , I ’m talking about when Alex Jones , the official raving maniac of the 9 - 11 Truth movement , spotted the nationally syndicated Neocon pundit Michelle Malkin and began screaming at her so loudly , for so long , that she eventually fled , pursued by Jones and a mob of cameras and desperate reporters .
“ Shame on you , you little monster ! ” Jones shouted .
“ You little fascist piece of trash ! ”
The dozens of riot cops watching over the protest did nothing to break up the situation , even as Malkin hurried across Colfax , Jones and entourage in tow .
Somehow Malkin leaves the indecent out of her blog post about the event .
Maybe it was a too traumatic to go into for the Fox News commentator , who has written a book defending racial profiling and the use of internment camps .
Other reports of the incident make the mistake of equating Jones with R - 68 , when in fact he came to the event to confront protesters like Glen Spagnuolo , who he believes are government - sponsored agent provocateurs .
" You 're the agent provocateur ! " Spagnuolo shouted into his megaphone in a fruitless attempt to bring attention back to the mint protest .
“ Alex Jones is a capitalist stooge wearing a Ralph Lauren T - shirt ! ” one protester screamed .
Regardless , Jones seemed pretty pleased with himself as he walked back toward his car through Civic Center Park .
“ The Left is dying !
The Right is dying ! ” he said to his small group of minions .
“ We ’re the only ones that can see it ! ”
Ai n’t that the truth .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 6/12/2008 ( 4315 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
SEOUL , South Korea --
Investigators digging into the grim hidden history of mass political executions in South Korea have confirmed that dozens of children were among the more than 100,000 people killed by their own government during the Korean War .
The investigative Truth and Reconciliation Commission has thus far verified more than two dozen mass killings of leftists and supposed sympathizers .
The victims are among at least 100,000 people estimated to have been hastily shot and dumped into makeshift trenches , abandoned mines or the sea shortly before and after communist North Korea invaded the south in June 1950 .
The killings , details of which were buried in classified U.S. files for a half - century , were intended to keep southern leftists from aiding the invaders at a time when the rightist , U.S. - allied government was in danger of being overrun by communist forces .
Family survivors last month met with the U.S. Embassy for the first time , saying afterward they demanded an apology for alleged " direct and indirect " American involvement in the killings .
Declassified records show U.S. officers were present at one killing field and that at least one U.S. officer sanctioned another mass political execution if prisoners otherwise would be freed by the North Koreans .
Uncounted hundreds were subsequently killed , witnesses say .
With thousands of citizens ' petitions in hand , the three - year - old truth commission has been taking testimony from witnesses and family survivors , poring over police and military files , both here and in the United States , and excavating mass grave sites .
Before suspending operations for the winter , crews had exhumed the remains of 965 victims from 10 mass graves , out of at least 168 probable sites across South Korea .
They only scratched the surface in some cases :
At a cobalt mine in the far south , they penetrated just 10 metres into a vertical shaft , recovering 107 skeletons from among 3,500 bodies believed dumped there .
Some mass killings were carried out before the war ; many came in the first weeks after the June 25 , 1950 , invasion , and others occurred later in 1950 when U.S. and South Korean forces recaptured Seoul and the southerners rounded up and shot alleged collaborators with northern forces .
The executioners at times cold - bloodedly killed families of suspected leftists , the commission has found .
In late 1950 and early 1951 , in Namyangju , 25 kilometres northeast of Seoul , the commission estimates that police and a local militia slaughtered more than 460 people , including at least 23 children under the age of 10 .
Survivor Kim Jong - chol , 71 , said his father , a South Korean border guard , had been forced to work for the conquering northerners , and then was executed by the southerners as a collaborator .
More than a dozen relatives were also killed , including Kim 's grandparents and seven - year - old sister , he said .
" Young children or whatever were all killed en masse , " Kim told The Associated Press .
" What did the family members do wrong ?
Why did they kill the family members ? "
The 15 - member panel , whose unprecedented inquiry will stretch into 2010 , has thus far verified that children were among the victims in at least six mass killings .
In a seventh case , it found , southern leftists killed children of supposed South Korean rightists .

Judicial Watch Files Lawsuit Challenging Hillary Clinton Appointment on Behalf of State Department Foreign Service Officer
Hillary Clinton Constitutionally Ineligible to Serve as Secretary of State
Judicial Watch , the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption , announced today that it has filed a lawsuit against newly sworn - in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on behalf of U.S. Foreign Service Officer and State Department employee David C. Rodearmel , ( Rodearmel v. Clinton , et al. , ( D. District of Columbia ) ) .
The lawsuit maintains that Mrs. Clinton is constitutionally ineligible to serve as Secretary of State and that Mr. Rodearmel cannot be forced to serve under the former U.S. Senator , as it would violate the oath he took as a Foreign Service Officer in 1991 to “ support and defend ” and “ bear true faith and allegiance ” to the Constitution of the United States .
Under the “ Emoluments ” or “ Ineligibility ” clause of the U.S. Constitution , no member of Congress can be appointed to a civilian position within the U.S. government if the “ emoluments ” of the position , such as the salary or benefits paid to whoever occupies the office , increased during the term for which the Senator or Representative was elected .
Specifically , article I , section 6 of the U.S. Constitution provides , “ No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time . ”
The text of the provision is an absolute prohibition and does not allow for any exceptions .
According to Judicial Watch ’s lawsuit , the “ emoluments ” of the office of U.S. Secretary of State increased three times during Mrs. Clinton ’s most recent U.S. Senate term .
That term , which began on January 4 , 2007 , does not expire until January 2013 , regardless of Mrs. Clinton ’s recent resignation .
The lawsuit notes that Congress attempted to evade this clear constitutional prohibition with a so - called “ Saxbe fix ” last month , reducing the Secretary of State ’s salary to the level in effect on January 1 , 2007 .
This maneuver , first used in the Taft Administration , has been more frequently used in recent years by both parties , allowing notably Republican Senator William Saxbe to become U.S. Attorney General in 1973 and Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen to become Treasury Secretary in 1993 .
A similar “ fix ” has been enacted for Senator Ken Salazar to join the Obama Cabinet as Secretary of the Interior .
Judicial Watch ’s lawsuit , however , points out that the legislation “ does not and cannot change the historical fact that the ‘ compensation and other emoluments ’ of the office of the U.S. Secretary of State increased during Defendant Clinton ’s tenure in the U.S. Senate . . . . ” The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is required to give expedited consideration to the lawsuit .
“ This historic legal challenge should remind politicians of both parties that the U.S. Constitution
is not to be trifled with , ” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton .
“ Mrs. Clinton is constitutionally ineligible to serve as the U.S. Secretary of State until at least 2013 , when her second term in the U.S. Senate expires .
We hope the courts will put a stop to these end runs around the Constitution and affirm the rule of law . ”

Enlarge By Will Kincaid , The Bismarck Tribune , via AP Wayne Hauge , left , and Dave Monson discuss their lawsuit Wednesday in Bismarck , N.D. , seeking to make hemp legal .
Two North Dakota farmers will ask a federal appeals court in St. Paul on Wednesday to allow them to grow hemp on their farms , even though the federal government says it 's illegal .
Farmer Dave Monson , a Republican representative in the North Dakota Legislature , says the variety of the cannabis sativa plant grown as hemp is an ideal crop to rotate annually with wheat and barley .
Canadian farmers 20 miles north of his Osnabrock farm do a brisk business selling their hemp to Detroit carmakers who use it inside door panels and for insulation in seats , he says .
Monson says the hemp has no value as a drug because it has a low concentration of THC , the ingredient in marijuana that causes a high .
Hemp fibers , oil and seed can be imported from Canada , Europe and Asia and used to manufacture products in the USA , but growing hemp in the USA is illegal , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says .
" The level of THC in the plant does n't matter .
If there 's any THC in the plant , it 's illegal , " DEA spokesman Garrison Courtney says .
" To get those pieces of stalk that are legal , you have to grow a marijuana plant . "
David Bronner , president of Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps in Escondido , Calif. , says he spends more than $ 100,000 a year to import hemp oil from Canada for his soaps , lip balms and lotions .
" I think the market has explosive potential , " Bronner says .
" As soon as hemp goes into the ground here , it 'll be a massive boost .
If you look at Canada , where they do n't have this draconian , absurd drug policy , there 's mass penetration of hemp into the market . "
The farmers sued the DEA in June 2007 .
They are backed by the North Dakota Legislature , Gov. John Hoeven , a Republican , and the state agriculture department .
In 1999 , the Legislature passed a law allowing farmers to grow hemp , and a licensing process was finalized in December 2006 , Monson says .
On Nov. 28 , 2007 , U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland in Bismarck , N.D. , dismissed the case .
The farmers appealed , hoping for a ruling that hemp " is not subject to regulation by the DEA and that our farmers are n't going to be charged with a crime , " says Tim Purdon , a Bismarck lawyer who represents the farmers .
" It 's really frustrating for these farmers to look across the border and see Canadian farmers growing it and making a living from it , " he says .
The district judge should not have dismissed the case without hearing evidence about the differences between hemp and marijuana , adds Washington lawyer Joe Sandler , who will argue the farmers ' case before the appeals court .
The lawsuit is funded by Vote Hemp , a Washington lobbying group that seeks to legalize hemp farming .
The group has spent about $ 100,000 on the lawsuit , says spokesman Adam Eidinger .
Wayne Hauge , the other farmer who brought the lawsuit , says farming hemp wo n't lead to legalizing marijuana .
" I personally have never smoked marijuana and do n't want to , " says Hauge , whose Ray , N.D. , farm is about 60 miles from the Canadian border in the western part of the state .
" That 's a different agenda .
I want to grow this crop for its economic value . "

The Nosefrida is a remarkably effective tool for sucking snot out of a kid ’s nose .
It ’s basically a flexible plastic tube with a mouthpiece on one end and a snot - collection chamber on the other .
You put the mouthpiece in your mouth , press the open end of the snot - collection chamber against your kid ’s nostril ( it does n’t go very far inside the nose ) , and SUCK .
An inline filter prevents the snot from ending up in your mouth .
The filter only needs to be changed when it gets gunked - up .
Such gunking can be avoided by stopping periodically and blowing the collected snot out into a sink or emesis basin .
Otherwise , if you keep filling up the snot - collection chamber , it eventually makes its way up to the filter .
To clean , I just disassemble it and run warm water through it .
Real easy .
It sounds disgusting and bizarre , but it works like a charm .
If you ’ve got a snotty kid , it ’s the best $ 15 you ’ll ever spend .
My daughter got her first cold when she was three months old .
It was a real nasty one , with lots of nasal congestion .
My wife is a family doctor , and she suggested the standard course of action : spray saline up the kid ’s nose and try sucking the nastiness out with a bulb syringe .
Anybody who ’s ever used a standard bulb syringe knows that it ’s a suboptimal tool for this project , for two main reasons : ( 1 ) A bulb syringe is too small to generate adequate suction to pull thick snot out of a kid ’s nose , and ( 2 ) little kids hate having a bulb syringe stuck up their nostrils .
Can you blame ‘em ?

ATHENS ( Reuters ) - Protesters hung banners from the Acropolis in Greece on Wednesday and called for demonstrations across Europe , in the 12th day of unrest since police shot dead a teenager .
“ Resistance ” read one of two pink banners in Greek , German , Spanish , and English , which protesters unfurled from the stone wall of the ancient hilltop citadel in Athens .
“ Thursday , 18/12 demonstrations in all Europe , ” said another .
Greece ’s worst protests in decades , sparked by the shooting of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos , have fed on simmering anger at high youth unemployment and the world economic crisis .
“ We chose this monument to democracy , this global monument , to proclaim our resistance to state violence and demand rights in education and work , ” one protester , who declined to give his name , told Reuters .
“ ( We did it ) to send a message globally and to all Europe . ”
The demonstrations have sparked sympathy protests from Moscow to Madrid and European policymakers , including French President Nicolas Sarkozy , have expressed concern they might spread as the economic downturn bites and unemployment rises .
Greece ’s powerful industrialists ’ union SEV called for a strong government after Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis , whose conservative party is trailing in opinion polls , came under fire for his hands off reaction to the riots .
“ The economic turmoil is here and will worsen in the following months , ” SEV president Dimitris Daskalopoulos said , “ The country needs a strong , credible and modern government . ”

MORE PROTESTS
About two thousand leftists marched through Athens on Wednesday , chanting “ No sacrifice for the rich . ”
Others occupied the headquarters of the GSEE private sector union federation demanding the release of those arrested in the riots but the intensity of the protests cooled off this week .
Hundreds of shops and cars were wrecked in 10 cities during last week ’s violence .
An estimated 565 shops were damaged in Athens alone , costing 200 million euros and causing more than 1 billion in lost sales during the Christmas shopping period .
The protests have rocked the conservative government , which has a one seat majority , and have driven Greek bond spreads -- a measure of perceived investment risk -- to record levels above German benchmark bonds .
The tourism minister said Greece needed to urgently restore its image .
“ With the 2004 Olympics we proved we are a civilized , safe country .
After the latest events , this has come into doubt , ” said Aris Spiliotopoulos .
Protesters hurled firebombs at a police bus in Athens and another group smashed television sets to protest at the media ’s coverage of the events .
On Tuesday , about 20 students occupied state TV , interrupting a news broadcast to hold up protest banners .
More protests were expected on Thursday , when the ADEDY public sector workers federation goes on a three - hour work stoppage against government policy and the teenager ’s killing .
The walkout will ground all but emergency flights into Greece between 1000 and 1300 GMT , air traffic controllers said , and disrupt urban public transport services .
The policeman who shot Grigoropoulos has been charged with murder and jailed pending trial , while his partner was charged as an accomplice .
He says he fired a warning shot in self - defense against a group of youths but the family ’s lawyer says he aimed to kill without significant provocation .
A hunter has been injured after the deer he shot and apparently killed got back up and attacked him .
Randy Goodman , 49 , thought the two shots he fired from his .270 - caliber rifle had killed the buck which he hit while hunting in Missouri .
Goodman said the deer appeared to be dead - but seconds later the 240 lb animal got to its feet , knocked Goodman over and attacked him with its antlers .
Goodman described the attack as ' 15 seconds of hell , ' as the injured deer tried to gore and stomp on him .
The animal then attempted to flee the scene but the hunter was able to recover and this time shot it twice , after which it really was dead .
After the incident , 49 - year - old Goodman drove himself to hospital and received seven stitches to his head .

If we are going to spend trillions of dollars of taxpayer money , it makes more sense to focus less on the failed institutions at the top of the financial system and more on the individuals at the bottom .
Instead of buying dodgy assets and guaranteeing deals that should never have been made in the first place , we should use our money to A ) repair the social safety net , now badly rent in ways that cause perfectly rational people to be terrified ; and B ) transform the bailout of the banks into a rescue of homeowners .

We should begin by breaking the cycle of deteriorating housing values and resulting foreclosures .
Many homeowners realize that it does n’t make sense to make payments on a mortgage that exceeds the value of their house .
As many as 20 million families face the decision of whether to make the payments or turn in the keys .
Congress seems to have understood this problem , which is why last year it created a program under the Federal Housing Authority to issue homeowners new government loans based on the current appraised value of their homes .
And yet the program , called Hope Now , seems to have become one more excellent example of the unhappy political influence of Wall Street .
As it now stands , banks must initiate any new loan ; and they are loath to do so because it requires them to recognize an immediate loss .
They prefer to “ work with borrowers ” through loan modifications and payment plans that present fewer accounting and earnings problems but fail to resolve and , thereby , prolong the underlying issues .
It appears that the banking lobby also somehow inserted into the law the dubious requirement that troubled homeowners repay all home equity loans before qualifying .
The result : very few loans will be issued through this program .
THIS could be fixed .
Congress might grant qualifying homeowners the ability to get new government loans based on the current appraised values without requiring their bank ’s consent .
When a corporation gets into trouble , its lenders often accept a partial payment in return for some share in any future recovery .
Similarly , homeowners should be permitted to satisfy current first mortgages with a combination of the proceeds of the new government loan and a share in any future recovery from the future sale or refinancing of their homes .
Lenders who issued second mortgages should be forced to release their claims on property .
The important point is that homeowners , not lenders , be granted the right to obtain new government loans .
To work , the program needs to be universal and should not require homeowners to file for bankruptcy .
There are also a handful of other perfectly obvious changes in the financial system to be made , to prevent some version of what has happened from happening all over again .
A short list :
Stop making big regulatory decisions with long - term consequences based on their short - term effect on stock prices .
Stock prices go up and down : let them .
An absurd number of the official crises have been negotiated and resolved over weekends so that they may be presented as a fait accompli “ before the Asian markets open . ”
The hasty crisis - to - crisis policy decision - making lacks coherence for the obvious reason that it is more or less driven by a desire to please the stock market .
The Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. all seem to view propping up stock prices as a critical part of their mission  indeed , the Federal Reserve sometimes seems more concerned than the average Wall Street trader with the market ’s day - to - day movements .
If the policies are sound , the stock market will eventually learn to take care of itself .
End the official status of the rating agencies .
Given their performance it ’s hard to believe credit rating agencies are still around .
There ’s no question that the world is worse off for the existence of companies like Moody ’s and Standard & Poor’s .
There should be a rule against issuers paying for ratings .
Either investors should pay for them privately or , if public ratings are deemed essential , they should be publicly provided .
Nov. 5 , 2008  --
The body of a boy , believed to be a gaming - addicted teenager who has been missing since he ran away from his Barrie , Ontario , home more than three weeks ago , was found today not far from where the boy was last seen .
Brandon Crisp , 15 , ran away on Oct. 13 , when his parents took his beloved Xbox away , and he has not been seen or heard from since .
Barrie Police Service Sgt. Dave Goodbrand said a deer hunter came across the body near a trail in a town north of Barrie , and the coroner has been on the scene since early afternoon .
" At this point we believe it to be Brandon , but we can't confirm , " Goodbrand said .
Brandon 's father , Steve Crisp , told ABC News today that his son was dead and " it 's over . "
In response to the boy 's disappearance , Microsoft Canada had chipped in $ 25,000 Canadian toward a reward for help in finding Crisp .
The Microsoft donation matched the $ 25,000 Canadian raised by local organizations .
The reward totaled $ 41,776 in U.S. dollars .
The outgoing message on the Crisps ' answering machine was still targeted to Brandon this afternoon , pleading with him to come home or contact the authorities .
" We need to know you 're safe , " Steve Crisp said on the message .
" We love you dearly . "
The teen had once been a competitive hockey player who got good grades and enjoyed video games with his friends in typical teenage fashion , his father told ABCNews.com Tuesday , and the 10th grader 's disappearance on Oct. 13 , Canada 's Thanksgiving holiday , has left the family sick with worry .
When the family signed up about a year ago for a subscription to Xbox Live , which allows players to interact with gamers all over the world , Brandon 's hobby turned into an obsession that ultimately led to his fleeing his Barrie home after his father took away the system for good , his father said .
" We 'd be asleep and he'd be up at two or three in the morning , playing this thing , " Crisp said before today 's discovery , adding that they also had a hard time getting him to leave the game to eat dinner with the family .
On Friday , Oct. 10 , the Crisps learned the boy , whose grades were slipping , had skipped school the day before , and they decided to take away his Xbox temporarily , as they had about 20 times before , Steve Crisp said .
But when Crisp saw that Brandon had found the system and resumed playing it while his father was out fishing that weekend , he said he decided to take it away permanently .
" He was very angry , " Crisp said .
When the father and son sat down to talk about Brandon 's obsession with the system , the game " Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare " in particular , Brandon 's response was " OK , I 'm going to leave home then . "
Calling his son's bluff , Crisp said he advised him to take warm clothes when he saw Brandon loading things into a backpack .
He then watched as his only son rode away on his bicycle .
The family , which includes Brandon 's twin sister and older sister , figured he'd blow off some steam with friends and be back that evening .
" I did n't think anyone would run off for a game , " Crisp said .
The Last Sighting
Brandon was last seen on a heavily traveled trail around 5:45 p.m. that evening .
There has been no trace of him since .
His bicycle was found that night with a flat tire .
Police , with Microsoft Canada 's cooperation , had looked into who Brandon may have come in contact with through " Call of Duty 4 , " despite privacy laws to protect gamers .
" At this point the investigation would lead us to believe there is no connection to the Xbox , " Goodbrand said yesterday .
Microsoft Canada issued a statement , saying , " " Like everyone , we are deeply worried about the disappearance of Brandon Crisp .
Law enforcement has contacted Microsoft about this matter and we are cooperating fully with them .
We are unable to comment further on the nature of our cooperation because of the ongoing investigation .
" As has been reported , Microsoft has matched the existing reward of $ 25,000 for information leading to Brandon 's return , " the statement continued .
" Our thoughts are with Brandon , his family and his community and we hope for his swift return . "
Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment about why the company contributed to the reward .
When You Just Can't Stop
Gaming addiction has seen a rise in the last several years , especially among male teens and young men , according to Coleen Moore , coordinator of resource development at the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery in Peoria , Ill .
The gaming addicts typically treated at the institute in both inpatient and outpatient programs are teens between the ages of 16 and 18 and men between 20 and 24 .
Moore said Brandon was not the first teen to become addicted to Xbox Live , a system that she said more and more people in the institute 's programs are mentioning .
" The big thing that is the draw that these guys talk about it being able to create their own personas and compete with others all over the world , " she said .
Gaming addiction progresses like any other addiction , until the person is obsessed with creating the feeling of euphoria the gaming brings , she said .
Some addicts spend up to 20 hours a day gaming , and Moore said one patient remembered turned to cocaine as a stimulant to keep playing .
Moore , who was not familiar with Brandon 's case , said the teen seemed to have the typical progression of addiction , but that his parents did exactly the right thing in setting limits and trying to strike a balance between entertainment and obsession .
But if the teens are not able to stick with those limits , she said , " I would suggest they get some type of professional help . "
Moore said she was surprised , but pleased that Microsoft Canada put up reward money since the industry has typically shied away from addressing the problems of gaming addiction .
" I 'm kind of dumbfounded , " she said .
" They do n't have any responsibility to whether or not someone becomes addicted to it . "
In trying to find Brandon , the Crisps and police had appealed to the local media and , in return , have gotten nationwide interest in his case .
He was also featured in a segment of Fox 's " America 's Most Wanted " television show .
Goodbrand said the entire situation was very strange , noting that Brandon was a good student and came from a good family .
" He 's not a typical runaway , " he said .
Leukaemia targets cells in bone marrow which form blood Scientists have decoded the complete DNA of a cancer patient and traced her disease to its genetic roots .
The Washington University team identified 10 gene mutations which appeared key to the development of the woman 's acute myeloid leukaemia .
Just two of these had been linked to the disease before .
The sequencing technique , described in the journal Nature , could be applied to other cancers and aid the design of targeted drugs .
This achievement ushers in a new era of comprehensive understanding of the fundamental nature of cancer
Dr Francis Collins
Geneticist
The researchers took two samples from the woman in her 50s - who later died from the disease - and examined the DNA for differences .
One sample was taken from healthy skin cells , the other from bone marrow tissue made up of cancerous cells .
They found that virtually every cell in the tumour sample had nine of the key mutations .
Like most cancers , acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) - a cancer of blood - forming cells in the bone marrow - arises from mutations that accumulate in people 's DNA over the course of their lives .
However , little is known about the precise nature of those changes and how they disrupt biological pathways to cause the uncontrolled cell growth that is the hallmark of cancer .
Previous efforts to decode individual human genomes have looked at common points of DNA variation that may be relevant for disease risk .
In contrast the Washington team , using a gene sequencing technique , were able to sift through the three billion pairs of chemical bases that make up the human genome to pull out the mutations that contributed to the patient 's cancer .
True landmark Geneticist Dr Francis Collins , a former director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute , called the study a " true landmark in cancer research " .
This is a very important piece of research , not only for our understanding of leukaemia but for many other types of cancer
Kat Arney
Cancer Research UK
He said : " In the past , cancer researchers have been ' looking under the lamp - post ' to find the causes of malignancy - but now the team from Washington University has lit up the whole street .
" This achievement ushers in a new era of comprehensive understanding of the fundamental nature of cancer , and offers great promise for the development of powerful new approaches to diagnosis , prevention and treatment . "
Three of the newly - discovered mutations were in genes that normally suppress tumour growth , and four were in genes linked to the spread of cancer .
The other appears to affect the transport of drugs into the cells , possibly fuelling resistance to cancer therapy .
The researchers are still looking for other gene mutations which may also play a part .
They also examined tumour samples from another 187 AML patients , but found none had any of the eight new mutations .
Lead researcher Dr Richard Wilson said : " This suggests that there is a tremendous amount of genetic diversity in cancer , even in this one disease .
" There are probably many , many ways to mutate a small number of genes to get the same result , and we 're only looking at the tip of the iceberg in terms of identifying the combinations of genetic mutations that can lead to AML . "
The researchers suspect that the mutations occurred one after another , with each pushing the cell closer to malignancy .
Kat Arney , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " This is a very important piece of research , not only for our understanding of leukaemia but for many other types of cancer .
" Thanks to advances in technology it is now possible to unlock the genetic secrets within cancer cells , which will be the key to better diagnostic tools and treatments in the future . "
Ken Campbell , of Leukaemia Research said : " Although it is very early days , it is realistic to think that these findings could lead to new treatments .
" Its wider application to other cancers may be limited though - the technique is particularly valuable for blood cancers in which the chromosome changes are usually simpler than in solid tumours at the time of diagnosis . "

Le Clezio Sez : " Boo Hitler , Yay Books "
J.M.G. Le Clezio delivered his Nobel Prize Lecture yesterday , and you can read it online here .
You can also watch the video here , if you are French or have been colonized by people who speak French .
In the course of the lecture , Le Clezio speculated that the internet might have prevented the criminal activities of Hitler and calls on rich people to donate more books to poor people .
Here is Le Clezio autographing a chair for some reason :
The most interesting part of his lecture , however , is the complication : the idea that writers create literature because they want to give solace to hungry people and the beat - down , but that hungry people and the beat - down do n't do much reading .
In other words , you may write something good and true , but instead of giving solace to the hungry and beaten , your writing gets un-knotted , re-tied , and re-interpreted .
You may write a paragraph like : " Frank stared at the bright , blinking bags of chips in the convenience store window and fondled the bread knife he had taken from the passed - out drunk in the alley behind the factory .
As he breathed , he could feel the skin of his stomach brush against the bones of his back .
All he would have to do is leap over the counter , stab the stoned clerk in the neck , and then he could fill sacks and sacks with chips and candy and cake and medicine : all those glorious , healing pills .
Those blinking , bright bags of chips were a neon sign that said : " YES , GET ME . "
But the knife in Frank 's hand was so cold ; as cold as the bags were hot .
" But a guy like Frank is never going to read that paragraph .
Instead , somebody studying to be an English teacher or lawyer will read it while sipping flavored coffee , and a tear will come to their eye , and they will think : " I guess it is not so bad that my pretty puppy pooped on the pretty shag carpet .
" Le Clezio says keep writing anyway .
Even though we are lost in a dark societal hell with no chance of survival or authentic communication , we are keeping language alive for the chance -- someday -- that we might live in a human world that reflects the ( imminent - yet - out - of - reach ) reality of justice .
Teenage girls will be allowed to buy the Pill without a GP check - up
The Pill will be available without prescription in two areas of London ( posed by model )
Teenagers will be able to buy the Pill over the counter from the chemist for the first time , without the need for a check - up by a GP .
Two areas of London with among the country 's highest rates of teenage pregnancy will pilot the scheme next year .
The Pill will initially be available without a prescription only to those above the legal age of consent , but the scheme could be extended later to include those under the age of 16 .
Pharmacies across the country will start handing out the Pill if the pilots in Southwark and Lambeth primary care trusts are deemed a success , Pulse magazine reported last night .
The plan was criticised by pro-life groups , which warned that women could be at risk of blood clots because pharmacists would not carry out the same health checks as doctors .
The morning - after pill is already available at pharmacies without direct authorisation from a doctor .
But , until now , the Government has held off from allowing chemists to sell the Pill over the counter .
It has changed its mind following fears that women were stopping taking the Pill because they could not get an appointment with their GP to get a repeat prescription .
Last year , Health Minister Lord Darzi insisted ' robust ' standards would be put in place to ensure that staff were up to the job of handing out the Pill .
Jo Holmes , head of primary care delivery at Southwark PCT , said : ' We 've worked with King 's College London to develop a course for pharmacists to offer access to the Pill , which could be used by other PCTs .
' We have six pharmacists who will be able to deliver the service .
We expect the service to be fully up and running by June or July . '
Dr Imogen Shaw , a GP who specialises in gynaecology in Finchingfield , Essex , said : ' Teenagers are the ones who find it difficult to access the Pill , so I would imagine they would be the primary cohort to make use of it . '
Although Britain's rate of teenage pregnancies has fallen from the peak years of the late 1990s , it is still the second highest in the Western world after the U.S .
Norman Wells , of the pressure group Family and Youth Concern , said : ' This initiative shows yet again that the Government is more interested in getting young people to use contraception than it is in discouraging them from engaging in sexual activity in the first place .
' There is no evidence that increasing young people 's access to contraception results in lower teenage conception rates or reduces abortion rates . '
A Department of Health spokesman said : ' Any woman who receives contraception from a pharmacy without a prescription can still expect a full consultation with a health professional such as a pharmacist or a nurse .
' We want to help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies without undermining patient safety . '

The National Wildlife Federation has credited the Turkey Point nuclear power plant in Florida for helping save endangered crocodiles by creating a makeshift sanctuary for the reptiles within their 6,800 - acre network of canals for the past 30 years .
[ social_buttons ]
In 1985 , only 19 crocodiles lived around Turkey Point , but now around 400 live among the canals , which are used to cool to nearby nuclear power plant .
The species was changed from endangered to threatened in 2007 by the US Fish & Wildlife Service .
Florida Power & Light , which owns and operates the plant , discovered in 1978 that the crocodiles were using the area as a breeding ground and immediately hired their own marine biologists to study the rare saltwater reptiles .
” This is a good story for a change , ’ said FPL ’s biologist Joe Wasilewski .
“ The species has rebounded enough that there ’s a chance for future generations to see them . ”
FPL partakes in the Florida Everglades Mitigation Bank , a coalition which helps protect and restore 13,500 acres of wetlands .
Across the state , the power company maintains 22,000 acres of wildlife preserves , protecting the habitats of 17 endangered species .
So what do you think , do you agree with the National Wildlife Federation and commend FPL ’s efforts , or do the potential downsides of nuclear power plants outweigh these benefits ?
And call me crazy , but is n’t this how Godzilla happened ?

Some iPhone developers are still raking in large piles of cash with their apps , and recently a fart application made nearly $ 10,000 in a single day .
Joel Comm , developer of iFart Mobile , published download statistics of his app , and this week it stood at No. 1 overall with over 13,000 downloads .
The app costs a dollar , and Apple takes 30 percent of the pie .
So that amounts to about $ 9,200 in profit for the developer .
That 's pretty impressive , considering Apple previously did n't believe fart applications met the standards of the App Store .
In September , Apple rejected a similar novelty app called Pull My Finger on the grounds that it had " limited utility . "
Just recently Apple reversed that decision and approved a number of other fart apps as well .
A fart app is the most downloaded iPhone application this week .
Is this a means to celebrate or feel depressed ?
You decide .

Trials showing a positive treatment effect , or those with important or striking findings , were much more likely to be published in scientific journals than those with negative findings .
Trials showing a positive treatment effect , or those with important or striking findings , were much more likely to be published in scientific journals than those with negative findings , a new review from The Cochrane Library has found .
“ This publication bias has important implications for healthcare .
Unless both positive and negative findings from clinical trials are made available , it is impossible to make a fair assessment of a drug ’s safety and efficacy , ” says lead researcher , Sally Hopewell of the UK Cochrane Centre in Oxford , UK .
The international team of researchers carried out a systematic review of all the existing research in this area .
In addition to showing that negative results were published less often , they found that if these results were eventually published , they would take between one and four more years to appear in journals than studies showing positive results .
Results from one of the five studies in the review indicated that investigators and not editors might be to blame .
The reasons most commonly given for not publishing were that investigators thought their findings were not interesting enough or did not have time .
“ The registration of all clinical trial protocols before they start should make it easier to identify where we are missing results , ” says Kay Dickersin from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , USA , another of the researchers on this project .
One of the other researchers , Kirsty Loudon , based in Scotland , adds , “ Registration of trials and their results would help people conducting systematic reviews to look at both published and unpublished evidence , to reach reliable conclusions . ”
The researchers say their study also highlights the need for a worldwide commitment to the disclosure of the findings of clinical trials .
Mike Clarke of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland , says , “ The World Health Organisation recently found widespread support for the development of such a process . ”
Andy Oxman from the Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health Services concludes , “ Healthcare decisions need to be based on all the evidence , not just the most exciting results . ”

Voters in at least 10 swing states are receiving hundreds of thousands of automated telephone calls  uniformly negative and sometimes misleading  that the Republican Party and the McCain campaign are financing this week as they struggle to keep more states from drifting into the Democratic column .
Senator John McCain , the Republican nominee for president , has denounced such phone calls in the past :
In the 2000 primaries , Mr. McCain was a target of misleading calls that included innuendo about his family , and he blamed them in part for his loss to George W. Bush .
This January , too , in South Carolina , Mr. McCain described the calls against him as “ scurrilous stuff , ” and his campaign set up a “ truth squad ” to debunk them .
On Friday , a Democratic official in Minnesota said he had received one of these so - called robocalls and had tracked it to a company owned by a prominent Republican consultant , Jeff Larson .
According to published news reports , Mr. Larson and his previous firm helped develop the phone calls in 2000 that took aim at Mr. McCain .
A spokesman for the McCain campaign could not say Friday night whether it had contracted with Mr. Larson ’s current company , FLS Connect .
Phone messages left for Mr. Larson were not answered Friday , nor were messages left at a subcontractor , King TeleServices , which is making the actual calls to voters in Minnesota .

The Pentagon ’s acting Inspector General says that despite the foreseeable need for armored vehicles in Iraq that could withstand roadside bombs , and despite the increasingly obvious need for such vehicles as the guerrilla war unfolded , the Pentagon was slow to deploy such vehicles .
The article does not mention the infamous exchange between Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and troops in the field on this issue in 2004 :
‘ One soldier , identified by The Associated Press as Army Spc. Thomas Wilson of the 278th Regimental Combat Team , a Tennessee National Guard outfit , asked Rumsfeld why more military combat vehicles were not reinforced for battle conditions .
“ Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to uparmor our vehicles ? ”
Wilson asked . ’
Rumsfeld maintained that the Department of Defense was ordering armored Humvees as quickly as it could but that the factories could only produce so many .
The factory owners then came out and said that no , if the DoD ordered more , they could easily ramp up production .
I wonder if we ’ll ever really know why that crew took the screwy decisions they did .
I have a strong suspicion that there were ulterior motives .
In any case , the IG says their decisions got a lot of US soldiers and Marines killed or wounded .
The British military , which has still not managed to conclude a Status of Forces Agreement with the al - Maliki government , may withdraw from Iraq by June , 2009 .
The US military is expected to take over the British base at Basra airport .
Troops are needed in the south to guard fuel and supply convoys going up to Baghdad from the south .
Mohammad Abbas of Reuters describes the situation in Basra as it prepares for provincial elections .
Although security is improved , the situation is still difficult :
‘ it is heaving with garbage and unemployment is rife .
Waterways are clogged with waste , and the stench in even some genteel areas is overpowering .
Most streets are potholed .
Until a government crackdown in late March , militias and gangs ruled the city , and even now some of Basra ’s elite go shopping with an escort of soldiers and armored cars .
People are reluctant to venture out at night , when Basra largely becomes the preserve of packs of stray dogs , their barks echoing in the darkness .
Basra ’s potential has contributed to its decay as rival groups in Iraq ’s Shi’ite south fought for control , scaring away foreign investment and expertise .
Allegations of oil - smuggling and corruption abound , and bickering among the incumbent local politicians has held up development .
Desperately needed cash has been returned to the central government because of delays in spending it . ’
Abbas reports that in the Jan. 31 provincial elections , Basrans will be able to vote for individual politicians , not just for party lists , and that security is good enough that candidates may actually campaign .
In the provincial elections of Jan. 31 , 2005 , it was too dangerous to campaign , and voters often did not know for whom they were voting .
The Basra Province council has been dominated since 2005 by the Islamic Virtue Party ( Fadhila ) , which is Sadrist but follows Ayatollah Muhammad Ya’qubi rather than Muqtada al - Sadr .
It shares power with the Islamic Supreme Council of Abdul Aziz al - Hakim .
The Islamic Mission Party ( Da’wa ) will run independently in this election , so that the council may be more diverse .
Basra is seeking to become a Regional Government or autonomous region , as allowed by the 2005 constitution .
If the measure passes , the provincial council will have 100 % claim on all new oil fields developed in the province , rather than having to share the profits with the central government .
Reidar Vissar discusses this initiative here and also here .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that ten percent of Basra voters will have to sign a petition for the referendum on this issue for it to be held .
Al - Zaman reports in Arabic that Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army has taken up a cultural struggle , to argue Iraqi youth into rejecting secular currents .

For the past few days I have been using KDE 4.1 exclusively .
In fact , I uninstalled most of my KDE 3.5 applications because I wanted to get a real feel for what KDE 4.1 can do .
Now , even the KDE development team would agree that it is not 100 % complete .
By that I mean it does not have every feature from KDE 3.5 , but it certainly seems pretty darn close .
In terms of fancy screens shots the KDE team has done a nice job of this so I point you here to see some of the magic .
The Good
First , I will talk about what I really like about KDE 4.1 .
The new look and feel on KDE is certainly a welcome improvement .
Lots of various things have animations such as selecting things in the new KMenu and changing between settings in different dialogs .
These transitions provide not only some nice eye candy for onlookers , but serve to show the user that they are changing contexts .
I think this is very important especially for new users to help ease them into the environment .
Also , KDE 4.1 supports some compositing features , but I was not able to test those due to issues with my graphics card / X .
It does seem to suppose an alternate rendering scheme which seems use the CPU , but my processor is not fast enough to make it run smoothly .
Also , a lot of my favorite KDE apps have been ported .
Specially , Akregator , Kpdf ( now called Okular ) , Kwallet , and many more .
Akregator and Okular have a nice new appearance , and it is good to see them with a new look .
Just as before KDE has a helpful System Settings feature which allows you to change quite a few useful settings and configure all or most of the things KDE 3.5 used to allow for .
Thankfully , KDE has switched away from artsd , which I could never get to work , and with the new Phonon backend it can use any number of audio backends such as xine or gstreammer .
From my limited interaction with dolphin , the file manager , I like what I see .
It is intuitive to use and has a number of different views for you to use when trying to get through your files .
It also has another interesting feature that I noticed .
It lets you tag and leaves comments about your files and folders .
In fact , you can even rate them .
This ties in with the “ Nepomuk Semantic Desktop ” which , if enabled , allows you to search your file system based on the tags and whatnot that you assign to your files .
I must admit that I do most of my file management with a terminal still , but I think that feature has definite advantages if you like the graphical approach .
For instance , say you have lots of photos in different folders .
You could tag them and have a much easier way to locate them 2 or 3 years down the road .
I do n’t really use konqueror , but it is still alive and well .
I ca n’t say much more than that because I have n’t used it enough to have an opinion either way 🙂 .
The Not So Good
On the other side of things , if you require every last feature from KDE 3.5 than KDE 4.1 is not for you because they have n’t all been implemented yet .
For instance , it does not support setting the background on a dual screen setup such that it spans both screens .
A little work with GIMP “ fixed ” that problem for me by splitting the picture in half and setting each screen to each half , but that is a bit impractical .
Also , for whatever reason , the compositing effects were not working so well and enabling them was a bit of a pain .
I ’m not sure whether to pin this on KDE or whole ATI graphics drivers issue when it comes to X .
The plasmids , the new KDE widgets , are a really cool idea , but some of it is a bit frustrating .
As an example , I accidentally deleted the main bar with KMenu / Pager /etc , and it took me about 30 minutes to an hour to get everything back in working order .
I think these minor bugs and annoyances will be worked out in future releases , but it was disappointing just the same .
Final Thoughts
Ultimately , I am extremely happy with KDE 4.1 .
I have been looking forward to KDE 4 and 4.1 does anything but disappoint .
In fact , I ’m switching over to use it as my primary desktop environment on both my laptop and desktop machines .
KDE 4.1 is not for everyone though , specifically those who are waiting for every last feature of KDE 3.5 .
Some things in KDE 4.1 take a little getting used to and some have complained about this .
I do n’t mind however , because ultimately I like what the KDE team has done , and sometimes I think people get very stuck in their ways and do n’t want to move away from “ the way it used to be ” .
KDE 4.1 does n’t completely redfine desktop environments , but it sure does give them a fresh new look 🙂 .
KDE 4.1 levaes me eagerly awaiting KDE 4.2 !

Republicans have yet to provide significant evidence of voter fraud , which McCain said is \ " maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . \ "
GOP offers scant proof of voter fraud
Chisun Lee is a reporter for ProPublica , America 's largest independent , nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest .
For weeks , Republican leaders have warned that widely reported problems with fake voter registrations could result in a flood of phony votes in pivotal states .
Advertisement
But Ronald Michaelson , a veteran election administrator and member of the McCain - Palin Honest and Open Election Committee , said in an interview that he could not name a single instance in which this had occurred .
“ Do we have a documented instance of voting fraud that resulted from a phony registration form ?
No , I ca n’t cite one , chapter and verse , ” he said .
The claims and counterclaims about fraudulent voting have emerged as a prominent issue in the 2008 campaign .
Sen .
John McCain declared in the final presidential debate that ACORN — the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , the low - income advocacy group whose temporary staffers submitted thousands of faked applications — “ is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
Republican elected officials and lawyers for state Republican parties have made similar claims in court and in statements to the press .
So far , however , they have failed to provide significant supporting evidence .
A review of prosecutors ’ statements and documents filed by Republicans in the most serious new cases alleging voter fraud shows that none offer an example in which a fraudulently registered person managed to cast a valid vote .
While several cases argue that such frauds are possible , none sketched a scenario for how massive numbers of people could fake registrations and then vote .
Asked for specifics about the dangers of fake registration , Ben Porritt , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , provided links to 13 news clips and a 2003 Missouri state auditor ’s report .
Eleven of the cases did not involve registration fraud .
Two recounted how felons appeared to have cast illegal votes under their own names .
The lone example of a forged registration leading to an illegitimate vote comes from The Wall Street Journal ’s John Fund , who in April 2006 wrote that a community organizer had improperly registered a noncitizen , and “ someone eventually voted in [ the noncitizen ’s ] name . ”
Michaelson , who served for 27 years as executive director of the Illinois Board of Elections , said the sharp exchanges over registration fraud have undermined voters ’ confidence in the electoral system .
“ The fact that so many of these illegal registrations are being made public raises a perception in the minds of people , ’’ he said .
“ That ’s more of a general concern .
You do n’t want to perpetuate the idea that our election process is lacking integrity . ”
Asked whether his own party was responsible for fostering that perception , Michaelson said , “ Well , it does n’t help .
It has captured the attention of a lot of people . ”
Why do it , then ?
“ Maybe it ’s because there ’s nothing else to talk about , ” he said .
Michaelson could not cite a single real example of how registration fraud has led to voting fraud .
He said that an election - rigging scheme starting with phony application forms would not make much sense .
Michaelson joined the McCain team when asked by its general counsel , Trevor Potter , whom he knew from their days working together at the Federal Election Commission .
Michaelson explained why the mere perception of widespread fraud can do public harm :
“ When reports are circulating in the media that this one group has turned in 5,000 applications and 2,000 of them are invalid , for the minimally informed voter , they say , ‘ Oh my gosh , what ’s happening to our process ?
Our process is lacking integrity . ’
It just plants seeds of doubt in the minds of people who do n’t understand the process very well .
“ That ’s just not a very healthy atmosphere , ” he said .
This week , the Ohio GOP launched an ad claiming “ hundreds of thousands of new voter registrations are questionable ” and asking , “ Could Ohio ’s election be stolen ? ”
The implied link between registration and voting fraud has ranged beyond sound bites .
It has driven Republicans ’ invocation of legal power to scrutinize voters , demands for U.S. Justice Department intervention and court orders , and criminal investigations .
Fake registrations an unlikely vehicle for fraud
Numerous election experts , including Barnard College political scientist Lorraine Minnite and Justice Department veteran Gerald Hebert of the Campaign Legal Center , told ProPublica that fake registrations were an unlikely and unwieldy means of stealing an election .
Such a scheme would have to involve a substantial crew of fraudsters — tens of thousands of people — willing to risk the hefty prison sentences and fines if caught .
Michaelson agreed that the scenario is implausible .
“ We have to distinguish between voter registration fraud and voter election fraud , ” he said .
He said that officials “ inundated at the last minute ” with piles of applications can let phony registrants “ slip through the cracks ” and get on the voter rolls .
But he could not name a type of voting fraud that would begin with the filing of false registrations .
The McCain campaign has asserted that phony registrations could facilitate fraud on absentee ballots .
“ Voter registration fraud can quickly turn into vote fraud — especially in the case of absentee balloting and in states that do not require photo identification to vote , ” the campaign wrote in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey calling for a federal investigation .
( The Associated Press , quoting two “ senior law enforcement officials , ” recently reported that an inquiry is under way .
Justice Department spokesperson Laura Sweeney told ProPublica she could n’t “ confirm or deny ” an investigation . )
Michaelson said absentee ballot scams have typically involved political operatives telling legitimately enrolled people whom to vote for .
Another member of McCain ’s Honest and Open Election Committee , Harvard law professor and former U.S. solicitor general Charles Fried , stepped down last week after voting absentee for Obama - Biden .
He said by e-mail that the campaign ’s positions on voter fraud had not figured in his decision .
“ It was all about Sarah Palin who is spectacularly unqualified , ” Fried wrote .
“ My decision had nothing at all to do with the justified outrage against the shenanigans of ACORN and the like . ”
GOP bid for voter lists could spawn eligibility challenges
Republicans have gone to court in Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , and Ohio to obtain the names of new registrants .
Their target often has been lists of names flagged when states compared their voter rolls to other data bases , such as motor vehicle registrations and Social Security .
Those checks , required under a new federal law , have already been shown to be notoriously error - prone .
Critics have said that disclosing the lists to a political party would enable mass eligibility challenges that could cause confusion at crowded polling sites .
The GOP sought a list of more than 20,000 new registrants in Wisconsin .
Among those tagged as suspect were four of the six retired judges who make up the state ’s bipartisan election board .
The Wisconsin Republican Party ’s brief warned that , if the presidential election is very close , “ the deciding votes may well be cast by ineligible voters registered illegally . ”
It alluded to “ criminal behavior ” involving registrations , citing factual support consisting of three news accounts : one about a woman charged with submitting phony forms , one saying registration workers were being investigated for possible fraud , and one quoting a Republican spokesperson saying the hiring of former felons to collect voter applications — even if not illegal — “ does n’t smell right . ”
The Wisconsin trial judge rejected the lawsuit on technical grounds , but noted that she was unpersuaded by the GOP ’s mentions of “ criminal activity . ”
Wisconsin Attorney General J. B. Van Hollen , a Republican official who initiated the failed suit , announced Tuesday that he would deploy more than 50 state law enforcement agents and collaborate with local prosecutors to guard against fraud on Election Day .
It was unclear what the agents might do , and Van Hollen ’s office did not return a call from ProPublica .
Prosecutors are probing possible voter fraud in Ohio after a judge rebuffed a GOP attempt to obtain lists of names of registrants who had been flagged by database checks .
A Republican filing in that court case cited as its sole evidence a New York Post article reporting that one man – after being told by election officials to stop “ repeat registering ” – had “ breezed into Ohio election offices ” and had “ reregistered with a fake address and cast a paper ballot . ”
The GOP filing said “ these bogus registrations can lead , and in fact have led , to fraudulent absentee voting . ”
Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph Deters , the southwest Ohio regional chair of the McCain campaign , launched a grand - jury investigation involving several hundred new voters identified in the database checks .
He told The Associated Press that he ’d received “ widespread complaints of fraud , ” but declined to discuss details .
Local election officials said they had n’t heard any such complaints .
Deters could not be reached for comment .
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) last week persuaded President Bush to ask the Justice Department to revive the Ohio legal challenge for greater scrutiny of new registrants .
Otherwise , he warned , “ thousands , if not tens or hundreds of thousands , of names whose information has not been verified ... will remain on voter rolls .
...
And there is a significant risk — if not a certainty , that unlawful votes will be cast and counted . ”
The New York Times reported that informed sources say Justice will not take up the cause .
Todd Rokita , the Republican secretary of state in Indiana , recently sent federal and state prosecutors a letter demanding a criminal investigation into voter registrations involving ACORN .
Rokita wrote , “ This is not simply registration fraud .
This is voter fraud .
...
Fraudulent registrations are the first step in ... rendering an inaccurate tally on Election Day . ”
In his letter — portions of which were redacted — he cited a 2003 local election marred by absentee ballot fraud .
His office did not respond to a phone message and detailed email asking about the link between phony registration applications and phony ballots .
Scholars who have authored books documenting election fraud — political scientists R. Michael Alvarez of the California Institute of Technology , Thad Hall of the University of Utah and University of Kentucky historian Tracy Campbell — told ProPublica they could not think of an example of registration - driven voter fraud .
Voting rights advocates in recent years have worked to debunk assumptions that elections get stolen because individuals fake their eligibility .
They have said that election fraud most commonly involves party operatives bribing legitimate voters or partisan poll workers manipulating ballots .
The modern antifraud movement , calling for scrutiny at the individual voter level , was spearheaded by Republicans after the hairline - close 2000 presidential election , as journalist Jeffrey Toobin has described at length .
A five - year , nationwide voter - fraud investigation by the Bush Justice Department yielded 86 convictions as of 2006 — some for multiple voting or vote buying , and many of people who claimed not to have realized that their citizenship or criminal record mattered .
McCain adviser Michaelson believes that the real way to prevent stolen outcomes — or the perception of them — is to abolish the partisan oversight systems that prevail in most states .
Officials , he said , “ are the final barriers to election fraud .
But we have districts where it ’s really hard to find a legitimate Republican or a legitimate Democrat .
Even if on paper you have [ bipartisan ] checks and balances , you really do n’t . ”
“ The problem is when you have a razor - thin margin of victory like in Florida 2000 , ” Michaelson said , “ then these individual instances of fraud that otherwise would be accepted as part of the imperfect election process — elections are messy — just become very , very important . ”
“ Frankly , ” Michaelson said , “ all election administrators hope for landslides in their jurisdictions . ”

Although Instance_eval can be a great tool for creating clean DSLs it does , unfortunately , suffer from a few shortcomings .
These shortcomings are caused by the ‘ change in self ’ of the block and may , in some circumstances , lead to surprising behaviour .
_why detailed a lot of these shortcomings in his blog post and proposed a wonderful solution : Do n’t Change Self .
_why ’s idea was to add the functionality that the instance_eval was to provide directly to the binding of the block itself .
Using this technique we get the best of both worlds : we get the clean interface for our DSL and we eliminate the surprising and annoying behaviour of instance_eval in relation to local instance vars and methods .
How did _why do it ?
_why first created a little C extension called ‘ Mixico ’ which makes it possible to ‘ unmix ’ modules from inheritance chains .
His replacement for instance_eval , called mix_eval , works as follows :
Get the binding of the block .
Mix the Module containing the functionality we need into the binding .
Yield to the block Unmix the Module from the binding ( Using Mixico ) .
The above does work well and is a great and original idea but there are still a few problems with it .
The biggest problem ( in my opinion ) is that you must encapsulate the functionality you need in a Module ; this results in the following syntax when invoking mix_eval :
mix_eval ( my_module ) { .../* the block */ } #compare this to instance_eval instance_eval {... /* the block */ }
This limitation is due to the fact that Mixico only works with Modules ; it is not really possible ( notwithstanding the recent rb_mod_mixin_object patch ) to mix in Objects or Classes into the block binding .
Another problem is that mix_eval is not thread - safe .
A thread - safe mix_eval
One solution to the thread - safety issue was discovered by coderrr ( http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2008/11/14/making-mixico-thread-safe/).
His solution was to duplicate the binding of the block and perform the mix_eval on the duplicate .
However a run-of - the - mill duplicate is not a good solution if the user needs to modify the binding itself .
The ‘ duplicate ’ was instead made to be ( effectively ) an IClass of the binding .
That is its m_tbl and iv_tbl pointers were set to the method table and ivar table of the original binding .
coderrr ’s solution worked as follows :
Get the binding of the block Make an IClass from the binding Mix the Module containing the functionality we need into the IClass .
Instance_Eval the block in the context of the IClass Unmix the Module from the IClass Reset the iv_tbl and m_tbl pointers of the IClass ( to prevent a GC crash )
As far as I can tell coderrr ’s solution is thread - safe ( and very clever too IMO ) .
Dup_eval
Dup_eval is heavily based on coderrr ’s work but with the realization that since we ’re dealing with a duplicate we no longer need the machinery of Mixico .
That is , since the IClass is a duplicate of the actual binding we can simply discard it once we ’ve finished and let it be GC’d ( no need to unmix any Modules ) .
Another feature of Dup_eval is that it is not limited to mixing in Modules .
It makes use of another small extension called Object2 module that is capable of mixing in Objects and Classes .
As a result Dup_eval provides two methods : a straight forward dup_eval ( ) that implicitly mixes in self and a dup_eval_with ( ) method that lets you specify any number of Classes / Objects / Modules to mix into the binding .
Note that the dup_eval ( ) syntax is identical to instance_eval :
# dup_eval ( ) syntax ( implictly mixes self into the block binding ) my_object .dup_eval { /* ... the block ... */ } # dup_eval_with ( ) syntax ( does not implictly mix in self ) my_object.dup_eval_with(mod1 , obj1 , class1 ) { /* ... the block ... */ }
Here is how Dup_eval works :
Get the binding of the block Make an IClass from the binding Mix in the Object ( s ) ( or Class ( es ) or Module (s ) ) into the IClass ( Using Object2 module ) Instance_Eval the block in the context of the IClass Reset the iv_tbl and m_tbl pointers of the IClass ( to prevent a GC crash ) Discard the IClass
Summary
Dup_eval is just another attempt at expanding the power and flexibility of Ruby and is provided as - is in the hope it will aid or interest other Ruby developers .

Hexagonal prism
This is a snow crystal in its most basic form .
Such crystals are usually so small that they can barely be seen with the naked eye .
This is how most snowflakes start out life - before sprouting branches from their corners and forming more elaborate structures .
Simple prism snowflake
This is similar to the previous type , although the facets of this one are decorated with various indents and ridges .
Stellar plate snowflake
These are thin , plate - like crystals with six broad arms that form a star - like shape .
Their faces are often decorated with amazingly elaborate and symmetrical markings .
Plate - like snowflakes form when the temperature is near - 2 °C or near - 15 °C .
Such snowflakes are common .

Sectored plate snowflake
This is a stellar plate snowflake , but with particularly distinctive ridges that point to the corners between adjacent prism facets .
Stellar dendrite snowflake with branches and side branches
These are fairly large crystals , typically 2 - 4 mm in diameter so easily seen with the naked eye .
These are the most popular snow crystal type , seen in holiday decorations everywhere .
This snowflake has fernlike stellar dendrites - the branches of the stellar crystals have so many sidebranches that they look like ferns .
These are the largest snow crystals , often falling to earth with diameters of 5 mm or more .
Despite their large size , these are single crystals of ice - the water molecules are lined up from one end to the other .
The best powder snow , where you sink to your knees while skiing , is made of stellar dendrites .
These crystals can be extremely thin and light , so they make a low - density snowpack .
Hollow column snowflake
This is a hexagonal column with conical hollow regions in the ends .
These crystals are very small , so you need a good magnifier to see the hollow regions .
Needle snowflake
Such snowflakes are slender columns that grow when the temperature is around - 5 °C .
On your sleeve these snowflakes look like small bits of white hair .
One of the amazing things about snow crystals is that their growth changes from thin , flat plates to long , slender needles when the temperature changes by just a few degrees .
Why this happens remains something of a scientific mystery .
Capped column snowflake
These crystals first grow into stubby columns .
They are then blown into a region of the clouds where the growth becomes plate - like .
The result is two thin plate - like crystals growing on the ends of an ice column .
12 - sided snowflake
This is actually two snowflakes joined together - one rotated at 30 degrees relative to the other .
Such snowflakes are quite rare .
Triangular crystal snowflake
These are formed when plates grow as truncated triangles , when the temperature is near - 2 °C .
These crystals are also rare .
Rime crystal
Clouds are made of countless water droplets and sometimes these droplets collide with and stick to snow crystals .
The frozen droplets are called rime .

Donald Duck and Daisy Duck were spending the night together in a hotel room and Donald wanted to have sex with Daisy .
The first thing Daisy asked was , ' Do you have a condom ? '
Donald frowned and said , ' No . '
Daisy told Donald that if he did n't get a condom , they could not have sex .
' Maybe they sell them at the front desk , ' she suggested .
So Donald went down to the lobby and asked the hotel clerk if they had condoms .
' Yes , we do , ' the clerk said and pulled one out fromunder the counter and gave it to Donald .
The clerk asked , ' Would you like me to put that on your bill ?
' No ! '
Donald quacked , ' What kind of a pervert do you think I am ? '

A very pretty young speech therapist was getting nowhere with her
Stammerers Action group .
She had tried every technique in the book
without the slightest success .
Finally , thoroughly exasperated , she said
' If any of you can tell me the name of the town where you were born ,
without stuttering , I will have wild and passionate sex with you until
your muscles ache and your eyes water .
So , who wants to go first ?'
The Englishman piped up .
' B -b-b-b-b-b-b- irmingham ' , he said .
' That 's no use , Trevor ' said the speech therapist , ' Who 's next ?'
The Scotsman raised his hand and blurted out 'P - p- p-p-p-p-p-p-p-aisley ' .
' That 's no better .
There 'll be no sex for you , I 'm afraid , Hamish .
How
about you , Paddy ?'
The Irishman took a deep breath and eventually blurted out ' London '.
' Brilliant , Paddy ' said the speech therapist and immediately set about
living up to her promise .
After 15 minutes of exceptionally steamy sex , the couple paused for
breath and Paddy said ' - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - d - erry ' .

An American , German , and a Slovak get captured by canibals after their plane crashed into the ocean and everyone else died .
They are rounded up by the tribe and the chief tells them :
- According to our tradition , you will be given two days to save your life .
I will give you these two small glass balls each and if you can do something I have never seen before with them , your life will be spared .
Otherwise , we will eat you .
With that , they walk each of them to a tent and leave them there .
Two days later , the chief goes to the American .
The American has taught the balls to levitate .
Wherever he moves , they fly behind him .
- I 've seen this a million times !
And they cook him and eat him for lunch .
Then he goes to the German 's tent .
The balls are jumping up and down , powering a crude clock .
- This is old .
And boring !
And they roast him on fire and eat him for dinner .
The the chief then goes to the Slovak 's tent .
In a few seconds , he runs out screaming :
- I have NEVER seen such thing !
He broke one ball and lost the other one !!!

The Northwest braced for blizzards Friday night while cities from Milwaukee , Wisconsin , to Boston , Massachusetts , were cleaning up after a major storm delayed air travel and created havoc on the ground .
A commuter waits at a Detroit , Michigan , bus stop Friday morning .
" This is essentially the reincarnation of the same storm that brought the heavy snow to parts of California , southern Nevada and northern Arizona , " Steve Corfidi , lead forecaster with the weather service 's Storm Prediction Center in Norman , Oklahoma , told CNNRadio .
Icy roads created from storms this week paralyzed much of the greater Seattle , Washington , area , where schools were closed and bus routes were suspended Friday as roads were too icy to navigate .
Two charter buses carrying 80 people that collided and skidded off a road were pulled to safety , CNN affiliate KOMO reported .
The buses crashed through a metal railing and hung precariously over Interstate 5 for several hours before tow trucks pulled them back on the road , KOMO reported .
" We hit it and everyone is in shock for a minute , and [ the driver ] says ' go to the back of the bus . '
And people threw each other out the windows , " passenger Tamera Vasquez told KOMO .
Saturday was expected to bring heavy snows in Washington , damaging winds and power outages to a region still recovering from storms earlier in the week .
Hurricane - force winds are possible in the eastern foothills of Snohomish , King and Pierce Counties .
Further west , several inches of snow are possible in the greater Seattle - Tacoma - Everett metro area Saturday afternoon .
Toward the Olympic Mountains , they could be measuring new snowfall in feet .
Flights at most airports in the Midwest and Northeast were up and running after experiencing delays as long as three hours throughout the day .
But storm warnings and watches remained in effect for most of region .
Corfidi said the storm is expected to maintain intensity into Saturday , continuing east and " spreading a swath of very heavy snow and freezing rain " into Pennsylvania and New York .
" There could easily be up to a foot of snow over parts of Illinois , northern Indiana , perhaps into parts of Michigan and southern Wisconsin , eastward into parts of New York and Pennsylvania , " Corfidi said .
In Milwaukee , snowfall closed the airport for several hours and cut into local business hours for retail shops during the busiest shopping season of the year .
Malls and shopping centers in Milwaukee , Glendale , Wauwatosa and Greendale opened later than usual , dealing another blow to retailers already struggling with a severe economic downturn .
To compensate , some stores in the area , including Kohl's , Boston Store , J.C. Penney and Macy's are staying open until midnight on some days , the Journal - Sentinel Online reported .
" The snow has me concerned , " Southridge Mall manager Mary Wenger told the newspaper .
Another four to seven inches of snow is expected over the weekend .
In New Hampshire , still reeling from an ice storm last week , crews worked feverishly to restore electricity service to more than 30,000 customers remaining in the dark , CNN affiliate WMUR - TV in Manchester reported .
Southern New Hampshire could get 10 new inches of snow before midnight Friday , WMUR said .
Elsewhere , police in Buffalo , New York , shut down the city 's Skyway highway because of winds and snow , CNN affiliate WGRZ - TV reported .
Western New York had several inches of snow on the ground by noon , the station reported .
To the north in Ontario , Canada , southbound Highway 400 was shut down outside Toronto after an multivehicle accident in near whiteout conditions , CNN affiliate CTV reported .
" Lots of blowing snow .
Visibility is next to nothing , " CTV senior cameraman Tom Podolec reported from the scene .
Ontario Provincial Police reported 70 accidents in less than five hours Friday morning .
The system should move quickly , Corfidi said .
It was not shaping up as an extraordinary event , he said .
" It is December , and winter storms certainly raise their ugly heads this time of year , " Corfidi said .

Editor ’s note : I recorded this as a podcast for Productive Flourishing long after I originally published this post .
I hope you enjoy it , and if you ’d like to hear more episodes of the podcast , you ’ll find them in the show ’s archives .
Creatives have a talent that perhaps exceeds our ability to create : the ability to convince ourselves that the props we ’ve set up to keep us from creating are real .
There ’s always organizing , list - making , office - cleaning , chores , research , or toenail clipping to be done .
I often wonder if that ’s why so many creative people resort to meta - doing so quickly – after all , we can always come up with creative ideas , lists , dreams , and next actions .
That ’s one part of what we do that we love .
Ideas are fun .
Doing something with those ideas and sharing them with others – well , not so much sometimes .
While we ’re meta - doing , we ’re in a comfortable space .
No one is evaluating our work , that demon of a critic that we envision is at bay , and we can continue to tell ourselves that we ’re doing something productive .
We ’re planning or organizing or clearing our head or whatever .
In other words , we ’re crafting a believable fiction for ourselves that puts layers of obstacles between us and the creative work we do .
And since the story has to be believed only by the creator , we can remain in our safe zone .
But I ’m Researching !
The way I see this tendency manifest itself the most in creatives is with “ research . ”
We read other writers ’ work , we look at other painters ’ paintings , other coders ’ code , other peoples ’ business ideas – and we do some more research .
We collect research that discusses the research of others .
And then we label the research , categorize it , file it , and put it in the other piles of research that we have – which , by the way , we need to come up with a better way of filing that research , and we need to see what that old research has to do with the new stuff , and … and … and .
It ’s a prop , folks .
Yes , part of the creative process requires that we research whatever we ’re thinking about , but if you find yourself nodding your head at what I ’m saying , you know that there ’s a point at which you have enough information to do something and there ’s a point at which you ’re using “ research ” as a way to get around creating .
No amount of information or inspiration is going to solve the problem – for the problem has nothing to do with information .
You are a creator , not a researcher .
What you may not realize is that research , at a certain point , gives that scared part of you even more reason to be scared .
Those “ experts ” and their “ massive amount of work ” dwarf your abilities and contributions – what ’s the point of your trying ?
Yet another lie you tell yourself and believe nonetheless .
Just Start Creating !
If I ’ve called you out , you ’re no doubt thinking , “ Oh crap – what now ?
Where do I start ? ”
Pick a topic or idea – it does n’t matter which one – and start doing something with it .
If you ’re a writer , commit to picking a topic and write 300 words about it .
If you ’re a designer , commit to free - handing the frame of the idea in your head .
If you ’re a painter , start the broad strokes on the canvas .
If you ’re a coder , define a problem or function and code the solution .
Whatever you do , create something in the real world today , right now , for an hour .
Even better , give yourself two hours to get some real progress on it .
Make it crappy , but make it .
You do n’t have to keep it , love it , or share it , and you can undo anything that you ’ve done .
But you ca n’t undo or get back the time you ’ve spent creating fictions for yourself .
Now go and create something .
You ’ll feel better .

According to a new CBS poll :

Ironically , a CBS 5 poll eleven days prior found a five - point margin in favor of the measure 's opponents . "

This is a dangerous turn , considering opponents of proposition 8 were originally leading in the polls .

Paperless Schools and Linux Notebooks for Every Kid
by Ostatic Staff - Jun. 27 , 2008
I was very interested in this piece from Computerworld U.K. , titled " Can we give every school child in the U.K. a Linux notebook and still save money ? "
It provides a cost breakdown of what it would take to give every student a Linux notebook , compared to the costs schools in the U.K. currently face for software licenses , other technology fees , and printing and photocopying .
According to the author of this story , the fees for printing and photocopying alone at schools are staggering -- to the point where if electronic materials replaced much of the printed materials , there would be enough money to give each student a low - cost Linux notebook .
Would this work in the U.S. ?
According to the Computerworld U.K. piece , at a typical secondary school in England the number of paper sheets passing through faxes , photocopiers and printers comes to 4,450,000 per year .
In the school that the author focused on , this came out to 8,000 copies per child , per year .
If this seems ridiculously overstated , I happen to have two kids in school , one entering high school and one in 5th grade .
They are in school at least 200 days a year .
On an average day , they bring home about 20 sheets of printed materials in their overstuffed backpacks .
This already comes out to 4,000 sheets for each kid , per year , and that 's just what they bring home .
There are more printed materials in their classrooms each day , and many more generated from the central operations of their schools .
I would say that the Computerworld figure of 8,000 sheets per student , per year , might be a bit high for a U.S. student , but not outrageously so .
Anyway , if you go through the whole calculation in the Computerwold post , the costs for paper , toner and all the rest of the expensive items needed for paper - driven schools vastly eclipse what it would cost to buy each student a Linux notebook computer .
( Asus Linux notebooks are very popular now , come loaded with open source applications and no software licensing fees , and can be had for under $ 350 . )
If a U.S. school could actually go largely paperless , and distribute its materials electronically , I do n't doubt that each kid could have a Linux notebook , and the school would end up saving money .
That said , though , the fact that the Pied Pipers of the paperless office never proved right is instructive here .
Kids are very used to the interface and usability metaphors of working with paper , and in their early school years they have to work with a lot of paper to develop handwriting skills , etc .
In all likelihood , it would be undoable to go largely paperless .
Some ideas look better on paper than they do in reality .
In the world of software engineering , the emphasis is typically on evolution .
You build a good small thing and layer more functionality on top , slowly evolving the framework into something bigger and better than it was originally .
This takes a lot of upfront planning , to make sure that the framework has enough hooks to allow easy extension .
That ’s how most JavaScript libraries began as well , and YUI is no different .
Now that YUI 3 has been previewed , there ’s been a lot of discussion around the direction of the library .
I ’m an adjunct member of the team , but certainly not responsible for the direction of YUI as a whole ; there are some very capable engineers already in that slot .
When I first heard about the YUI 3 approach , I was at once excited and scared .
Excited because I saw the possibilities that the new library had baked - in , but scared that I ’d not get to use it because the upgrade path was non-linear .
The new Yahoo !
homepage adopted YUI 3 as its core library ( and I wrote about it ) last year .
Over the course of developing the page , we went through a lot of trials and tribulations , from a lack of documentation to learning new paradigms .
These were not unexpected as we were adopting a pre-release version of YUI 3 that was n’t really intended for production use .
Once we got past the initial wave of development , however , our engineers really started to enjoy using YUI 3 .
We found it to be more expressive , succinct , and easier to use than the 2.x version of the library .
I ’ve heard some people complain that YUI 3 is too different from YUI 2 , and that making such a different library is a mistake .
I actually believe that this was exactly the right move at exactly the right time and give the YUI team a lot of credit for having the guts to do it .
In a world where evolutionary programming is the preferred approach , YUI decided for a revolutionary approach .
Web development has grown by leaps and bounds in the past four years .
The discipline had really stagnated before the term “ Ajax ” got everyone excited about web development again .
In that time , the needs of developers have changed and grown .
New best practices have emerged and preferred development patterns have been formalized and documented .
We ’ve all learned a lot about what works and what does n’t , which makes this the perfect time to revisit JavaScript libraries .
As with other libraries , YUI started out based on web developer needs .
The needs have changed , so why should n’t the library ?
Why would n’t you look back at the past four years , see all the mistakes and lessons learned , and make a library that addresses it all ?
That ’s precisely what the YUI team did .
They looked at all the things YUI 2 could n’t do and all the things they wanted the next version to be capable of .
The result is something that takes the best parts of YUI 2 , plus some helpful tactics like method chaining ( a la jQuery ) , and adds in some great forward - thinking ideas to create a new library that still feels very much like YUI .
Is there some pain involved in upgrading to YUI 3 ?
Yes .
But major steps forward typically involve some pain ; revolution is never easy .
The question is n’t about the pain involved , it ’s about the utility you get in return for the pain and if that ’s worth it .
Only you can answer that question for your web application .
It ’s the same process if you ’re going to change from one JavaScript library to another .
The YUI team ’s decision was a tough one , but again , one that I whole - heartedly support .
Evolution is much less painful , but it typically ends up with bloat .
It ’s the responsibility of framework developers to honor past APIs , so a wrong choice in method naming , argument order , or data structure becomes written in stone ( see Crockford ’s latest post for more ) .
You can not undo a bad decision in an API that ’s already been deployed , you can only add new functionality that ( you hope ) will one day get used more than the old functionality .
In the end , you the library ends up with vestigial functionality that ca n’t be removed .
By adopting a revolutionary approach , YUI is able to change everything , rebuild from the ground up without any expectation of old functionality being in the place that it was or working in the same way .
It ’s a clean slate where the team can design the solutions of the future without needing to worry about breaking the mistakes of the past .
And keep in mind , if you ’re using YUI 2 , you can go right on using it ; no one is going to take away your YUI 2 .
It will continue to live on and be available at GitHub for you to download , use , and even submit changes to .
There ’s still a large community of experts on YUI 2 , its implementation , and extension ; that wo n’t go away either .
No one is forcing you to upgrade to YUI 3 , but if you do , I think you ’ll be pleasantly surprised .

Until a matter of months ago , very few Israelis realised that their army fired flares to light up Beirut 's Sabra and Shatila refugee camps while Lebanese Christian militiamen committed the notorious massacre of Palestinian civilians there in 1982 .
But Ari Folman , who as a 19 - year - old soldier fired some of the flares , makes their descent through the sky over Beirut 's beachfront one of the recurring images of Waltz With Bashir , his " animated documentary " that premiers in Britain this week .
In Israel , the film has rekindled discussion about the divisive invasion of Lebanon that was initially billed by Ariel Sharon , who was defence minister at the time , as a limited push to halt PLO rocket attacks , and the extent of Israeli responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila massacre where the estimated number of victims ranged from 700 to more than 3,000 .
Folman has said he had no idea the massacre was being committed when he shot the flares .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The killings by Phalangist militiamen dispatched into the camps by Israel came after their leader , Bashir Gemayel , president - elect of Lebanon , was assassinated in a bombing wrongly blamed on Palestinians .
An Israeli state commission of inquiry set up as a result of a tide of public protest in the massacre's wake found that Mr Sharon , today comatose from a stroke nearly three years ago , bore " personal responsibility " for not having foreseen the danger that the Phalangists would commit the slaughter .
He was forced to give up the defence portfolio , something that did not prevent him from being elected as premier in 2001 and re-elected in 2003 .
Lebanon , for its part , has never seriously investigated the massacre .
The film has been widely acclaimed in Israel .
One reviewer , Eitan Weitz , writing for the website Parshan ( Commentator ) , termed it " required viewing " for those aged 16 and 17 nearing their mandatory military service , for army reservists in their thirties and for mothers of soldiers .
But not everyone is happy about the film 's screening abroad .
Gerald Steinberg , a political scientist at Bar Ilan University with right - of - centre views , voiced concern even though he has not seen the film .
" The Israeli audience knows the atrocities were committed by Lebanese Christian militiamen and can sort out how much responsibility is ours and how much is theirs .
Foreign audiences will be blaming Israel for everything and this could reinforce that . "
Watch a trailer for the film
A flaw in the movie is that it gives the impression that the massacre lasted only one night and was stopped the following morning .
It began the evening of 16 September 1982 and ended on 18 September .
Some Israeli viewers say Folman lets Israel off too easily .
" The Israeli soldiers are shown as being good , as being people who are tormented by what is going on , " says Ronit Shpiner , 35 , a psychologist from Jerusalem .
" Ultimately , the moral responsibility is taken off of them even though those who saw the slaughter should have stopped it . "
She added : " The movie depicts the soldiers as the victims of the massacre because they were traumatised by it . "
A bartender , Lidya Ophir , 26 , said : " I think the movie is saying that probably the Israeli army is just as responsible as the people with the guns inside the camps . "
Folman says the movie aims to dissuade young people from fighting in wars .
" I hope that young people , when they watch Waltz With Bashir will see how stupid all wars are , a useless idea , a creation of tiny little leaders with big egos , " he wrote in an email response to The Independent .
" They will see in Waltz With Bashir that there is no glory in war , no bravery in war , nothing .
They will never want to be the guy in the movie .
And that is unlike a lot of American anti-war movies , where they show you that war sucks , but the guys in the movie are so cool . "
Mr Sharon is shown only briefly in the film , wolfing down steak and eggs , his nose twitching as he talks on the phone to the Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and to a commander in Lebanon .
His former spokesman , Raanan Gissin , takes issue with the depiction .
" He never gave orders while eating , " he said .
Mr Gissin denied Israel had any responsibility in the killings , saying they were " probably a Syrian - instigated plot " and recalled a statement by Mr Sharon that the inquiry 's findings put " a mark of Cain " on Israel 's forehead .
For many people , the most powerful part of the film is the recollection by an Israeli journalist Ron Ben - Ishai of a conversation he had with Mr Sharon during the massacre .
Mr Ben -Ishai , stationed in Beirut as Israel Television 's war correspondent , had heard from army officers at a dinner he hosted that a massacre was being committed .
Disturbed by the reports , he called Mr Sharon at his ranch in southern Israel but the defence minister showed little interest and did not act to stop it .
Regarding Israel 's degree of responsibility , Mr Ben - Ishai says : " It is like the Allies in the Second World War who could have stopped the slaughter in the death camps but did n't . "
For the Israeli historian Gershom Gorenberg , the movie brought back memories of the protest in which he participated to press Mr Begin to implement the inquiry commission 's findings .
" The fact that under public pressure Israel created a commission of inquiry and Sharon was dismissed indicates there was a significant degree of a country insisting on an accounting , " Mr Gorenberg said .
" The movie raises for us the question of whether that accounting went far enough . "
TOWER , Minn. , Dec. 22 ( UPI ) --
Scientists could learn about Martian water life by plumbing a spring in an iron ore mine in Minnesota 's Iron Range , University of Minnesota researchers say .
The researchers say microorganisms in the lowest levels of the spring could be a boon for scientists interested in studying possible life on Mars , the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Monday , because the mine water was held by rock formed 2.7 billion years ago when water was plentiful but oxygen was n't .

Scientists said they found bacteria after noticing formations emerging from boreholes miners drilled some 50 years ago in the northern Minnesota mine .
Salty water lacking oxygen united with air to create dynamic iron oxide structures , they said .
Calvin Alexander , a geology and geophysics professor , said he wondered what parallels could be drawn to Mars , believed to have an iron oxide - rich soil , the Pioneer Press said .
The researcher said formations found in the mine are similar to some in images of the Martian surface .
" There are rimstone dams in the cave growing from strong brines -- and we see rimstone dams on Mars , '' he told the newspaper of dams formed by water running over the edge of a pool and depositing material at the lowest point on the edge .
" This could potentially explain how liquid water runs on the surface of Mars under current conditions . ''
Alexander and other university scientists said they 've applied for grants to study the microorganisms , water and formations created in the mine .

To be a little more concrete , all arrays larger than ~3 k are effectively pinned in GHC right now , as in they are never copied .
If the array is unboxed , then it is never traversed by the GC either , so large unboxed arrays have basically zero GC cost .
There 's no need for any help from the programmer , it 's done automatically by the GC .
For smaller arrays , as John says there 's a tradeoff in whether to pin them or not .
Pinning avoids copying in the GC , but might lead to fragmentation .
Pinning is necessary if you want to pass the address of the memory to an FFI call at any point , which is why bytestring pins its arrays .

Citigroup was bailed out by the US government in November Struggling US banking giant Citigroup has announced plans to split the firm in two , as it reported a quarterly loss of $ 8.29 bn ( £ 5.6bn ) .
It said it would realign into two new firms , Citicorp and Citi Holdings .
Citicorp will handle the company 's traditional banking work , while Citi Holdings will take on the firm 's riskiest investment assets .
Last autumn , Citigroup had to be rescued by the US government in a bail - out deal totalling $ 45 bn .
The government also agreed to guarantee up to $ 306bn ( £ 205 bn ) of risky loans and securities on Citigroup 's books .
' Ongoing efforts ' " Given the economic and market environment , we have decided to accelerate the implementation of our strategy to focus on our core businesses , " said Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit .
" This will help in our ongoing efforts to reduce our balance sheet and simplify our organisation .
" We are setting out a clear roadmap to restore profitability . "
Citigroup 's net loss for the last three months of 2008 works out at $ 1.72 per share , worse than analyst expectations of $ 1.31 .
Its quarterly revenues were down 13 % to $ 5.6bn , which Citigroup said reflected " the impact of a difficult economic environment and weak capital markets " .
" I think people knew it was going to be bad , but I 'm surprised it 's this bad , " said Matt McCormick , portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati .
Good and bad Analysts say the split essentially puts Citigroup 's solid and profitable consumer banking interests in the hands of the new Citicorp , while the bad investment debts that forced it to seek government help go into Citi Holdings .
This will enable Citicorp to return to profitability much quicker than would have been possible for Citigroup as a single firm .
CITIGROUP SPLIT Citicorp - to have responsibility for universal banking operations Citi Holdings - to take on the firm 's brokerage and investment interests , and a special pool of loss - making assets
The rise and fall of Citigroup Meanwhile , the bosses at Citi Holdings will have the arduous task of sorting through the mass of bad debt , picking out what can be salvaged .
Citigroup said it was now looking for a " strong manager " to head Citi Holdings .
Redundancies
For 2008 as a whole , the bank made a net loss of $ 18.72 bn .
It blamed the losses on having to write - off bad debt and the cost of making redundancies .
The firm cut 52,000 jobs last year as its losses mounted against the backdrop of the sharp downturn in the US mortgage market and the resulting global credit crunch .
" We are committed to helping the financial markets recover as quickly as possible , " added Mr Pandit .
The firm added that it also expected further departures from its board of directors .
It was announced last week that director Robert Rubin , a former US Treasury Secretary is to leave the firm .
Bank of America Citigroup 's announcement comes after news that rival Bank of America is to receive $ 20bn in fresh US government aid and $ 118bn worth of guarantees against bad assets .
The emergency funding will help the troubled bank - the US 's largest - absorb the losses it incurred when it bought Merrill Lynch .
Bank of America has already received $ 25bn in capital injections from the Troubled Assets Relief Programme , known as Tarp , the bail - out fund designed to rescue banks reeling from the financial crisis .
In another development , the Irish government has said it is to nationalise the Anglo Irish Bank after its funding problems continued .

Ben Affleck , who ’s hosting “ Saturday Night Live ” this week , was rehearsing a skit this afternoon mocking Keith Olbermann when Olbermann himself got past security to watch , according to a source with knowledge of the incident .
A source described the skit as “ savage , ” in portraying Olbermann as a deranged person living at home with his mother .
Affleck , said a source , became uneasy with Olbermann in attendance at the 3 p.m. , closed - set rehearsal .
But Olbermann , through a spokesman , was complimentary of his first time being mocked on " SNL " — a position his MSNBC colleague Chris Matthews has been in over the years .
“ I ’m not Sarah Palin , ” Olbermann said .

Former CIO sues Diskeeper claims he was fired for not participating in Scientology training
[ Update : mirrored , and probably more reliable links for complaint and motion to strike .
Ray
Hill kindly mirrored the documents here , as well . ]
Alexander Godelman and Marc Le Shay , two Diskeeper employees ( Godelman was CIO and Le Shay hired as the Automation Planning Officer ) have filed a complaint in the Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that Scientology training was a condition of employment and that their refusal to participate led to their dismissal .
According to the complaint , “ [t ] he working conditions and work environment at DISKEEPER were inextricably intertwined with the Scientology religion such that a non-Scientologist cannot escape constant impositions of said religion . ”
When Godelman complained that these programs ran counter to his own religious belief ( Judaism ) , former Diskeeper CEO and current Chairman Craig Jensen told Godelman that his attendance at the “ training courses ” was “ not negotiable , ” adding that Godelman would become more intelligent and his personal life would “ improve drastically . ”
Jensen also warned Godelman to not “ complain about the process ” in emails , which Jensen feared would be “ misconstrued ” and / or “ taken out of context . ”
Le Shay was eventually fired after he refused to attend and participate in a course series entitled “ Basic Study Manual ” and after Godelman interceded on Le Shay ’s behalf , Godelman was also terminated .
The complaint alleges five causes of action–three based on Diskeeper ’s alleged violation of California ’s Fair Employment and Housing Act ( FEHA ) : namely , discharge due to religious discrimination , discharge in violation of public policy , retaliation against persons opposing wrongful practices .
A fourth cause of action claims that Diskeeper violates California Labor law , which prohibits employers from retaliating against persons refusing to participate in activity which would result in a violation of a federal or state statute or regulation .
A fifth cause of action alleges that Diskeeper failed to maintain its statutory obligation to prevent discrimination .
In response to Godelman and Le Shay ’s 3rd amended complaint , Diskeeper filed a Motion to Strike portions of Plaintiffs ’ complaint , specifically , Plaintiffs ’ requested remedy for …
“ … prospective injunctive relief in the form of a prohibitory and / or mandatory injunction requiring Defendants to cease , desist and forever refrain from forcing or requiring any employee , as a condition of employment , to study , adopt and / or apply the so - called “ Hubbard Management Technology ” and / or the related “ Hubbard Study Technology ” in the workplace , according to proof at trial [ . ] “
Diskeeper argues in its motion that these injunction requests should be struck from the Complaint because Diskeeper is permitted to introduce religious training in the workplace and therefore any injunction which broadly prohibits religious practice in the workplace is unconstitutional .
It would be helpful at this point to explain the purpose of a motion to strike , which is rarely filed .
A party will sometimes move to strike language in a pleading which is scandalous and has no relevance to the complaint or relief requested .
Filing a motion to strike is also a useful if one wanted to stall , buy time , or bleed the opposing side of legal fees , because it extends the time to serve an Answer to the Complaint .
While Diskeeper ’s argument may actually have some merit and may ultimately succeed at trial , a motion to strike will likely be viewed by the Court as an improper procedural tool to confront this particular argument .
Diskeeper will eventually be permitted to make their argument , but not at this stage of the litigation .
For California law on motions to strike , see the California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 435,436 .
What ’s most notable about Diskeeper ’s motion , however , is Diskeeper ’s implicit admission that Hubbard Management and Study Technology are both religious in nature , else why would they advance the argument that Diskeeper has a protected interest in providing religious training to employees ?
In footnote 4 of the motion , Diskeeper claims that it in no way concedes that Hubbard Management and Study Technology are religious , but to anyone familiar with both Scientology and Hubbard ’s supposedly secular “ technologies , ” the two brands are basically indistinguishable , and indeed , the establishment of supposedly secular fronts was intended by Hubbard to be a recruiting tool .
It will be interesting to see what happens next but a trial seems likely .

For the most part , America ’s editorial cartoonists have gotten better at drawing Obama over the last year .
They ’re no longer depicting him as a generic black guy but as an unique individual with his own distinctive features .
( I ’m sure there ’s a dissertation topic in there somewhere about how this somehow mirrored many white Americans ’ evolving views of candidate Obama . )
But there are some still some stragglers , whom I feel obligated to call out — in the name of improving the quality of political satire , of course .
Not that good editorial cartoonists have to be good caricaturists :
The Washington Post ‘s Tom Toles , who is for my money the most original of the newsprint cartoonists , draws Obama like he has a bow tie stuck behind his head .
But at least it kinda , sorta looks like him .
What bugs me are the cartoonists who still do the random - black - dude thing or use some kind of slapdash combo of Obama ’s most prominent features ( “ Big ears ?
Check !
Angular chin ?
Check !
Longer than average torso ?
Check ! ” ) .
Or worse .

If six years of driving in Los Angeles has taught me one thing , it ’s that everyone here drives drunk constantly .
The city ’s sprawling layout and sheer size makes regularly cabbing financially impractical and our public transportation blows .
Driving under the influence is a blasé part of LA culture .
You get good at it .
Only celebrities are stupid enough to get caught .
So it ’s easy to forget how the real world functions sometimes .
Case in point – I ’d been in Minnesota for less than 24 hours last summer while visiting my parents when I got pinched for boozin ’n ’ cruisin . '
I spent 36 hours staring at a jail cell wall ( the Christian bible my only reading material option ) , my dad ’s license plates got yanked and shredded , my driver ’s license got clipped , I was fined $ 1000 and I had to wear one of those Lindsay Lohan alcohol - sensing anklets for two weeks for some nonsensical reason .
It was a shameful and obnoxious ordeal .
Though I do finally have an answer to the eternal question , “ Can I ever be bored enough to read the Bible ? ” Apparently not .
Some might have emerged from this experience a better person , realizing they had no one to blame but themselves .
But I know better .
It ’s LA ’s fault .
See , despite the bevy of alcoholic degenerates that comprise my friend base , I only know two people who have gotten DUIs in LA .
One ran into seven parked cars – SEVEN – and got apprehended while attempting to push his destroyed vehicle into a “ hiding place . ”
The other led the police on a 30 - minute chase up towards Six Flags , none of which he can recall because he was so colossally shitfaced .
Me ?
I got pulled over in MN cause I accidentally had my fog lights on .
To put it simply - LA has conditioned me into thinking you need to be tossing flaming babies out your window to get pulled over .
Unfortunately the po-po in cities without notorious cop shortages have nothing better to do at 2 am then pull your ass over .
Fortunately the solution here is obvious : Los Angelenos need special licenses that allow us the same drunk driving privileges elsewhere in America that we experience here .
I ’m not saying drunk driving is n’t dangerous .
It is .
But we let old people , complete idiots , teenage girls , and even people with no legs behind the wheel .
I fail to see the difference .
Of course drunk driving is a privilege , not a right .
You gotta prove yourself .
There ’ll be a section on your license exam where you ’ll pound shots , then perform a variety of aptitude tests – backing up , headlights activation , red - light awareness , lane fidelity , Taco Bell drive - thru etiquette – and then you ’ll receive a grade indicating your proficiency up to a certain blood - alcohol level .
If anything , I will be remembered as a hero for alcoholics rights .
Musically speaking , it is often said that songs written in minor keys are sadder or more melancholy than songs written in major keys .
So why , if Christmas is a time of joy and celebration , are so many Christmas carols in minor keys ?
Think about it .
There are a lot of them .
Here ’s a list just off the top of my head :
“ Carol of the Bells ”
“ God Rest Ye Merry , Gentleman ”
“ O Little Town of Bethlehem ”
“ Angels from the Realms of Glory ”
“ It Came Upon a Midnight Clear ”
“ The First Nowell ”
“ O Holy Night ”
“ The Little Drummer Boy ”
“ I Wonder as I Wander ”
“ O Come , O Come , Emmanuel ”
“ We Three Kings ”
“ What Child is This ? ”
“ Do You Hear What I Hear ? ”
“ Silent Night ”
“ Away in a Manger ”
There are also quite a few others that are less well - known .
The most probable ( and most boring ) explanation for this fact is that the original Christmas carols were or were based upon medieval liturgical music , which was usually written in scales most modern music theorists would classify as minor .
Later songwriters simply copied the style because it sounded “ Christmassy . ”
My own ( wildly speculative , completely uninvestigated , and definitely unsubstantiated ) theory is that the slightly dark and pensive mood created by the use of minor keys in these carols is , like the Christmas tree and the yule log , a throwback to Europe ’s pre-Christian , pagan past , an expression of half - remembered rituals meant to get our cultural ancestors through the long , dark , winter nights .
Such rituals might not have been so festive in nature ….
Happy Holidays !

VICE PRESIDENT
Dick Cheney said this week that he directly approved waterboarding to torture terror suspects .
" I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared , " Cheney told " ABC News . "
Asked if he believes the simulating of drowning is an appropriate technique , he said , " I do . "
Last week , a bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report concluded that the 2003 Abu Ghraib detainee abuse was not just the result of a few rogue soldiers .
It said : " Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques and subsequent interrogation policies and plans approved by senior military and civilian officials conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees in US military custody .
What followed was an erosion in standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely . "
Those items help cement this White House as among the most cancerous in American history .
Cheney told us after 9/11 that the administration would protect us by working on " the dark side . . . in the shadows in the intelligence world . "
Cheney , Rumsfeld , and President Bush turned the dark side into a blind eye , the shadows into a shroud , and obliterated intelligent discourse on terrorism with raw fear .
That was only the warm - up for twisting intelligence to invade Iraq for weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
For eight years the administration never feared trampling truth and justice , even as Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2004 about Abu Ghraib , " Anyone who recommended that kind of behavior that I have seen depicted in those photos needs to be brought to justice . "
At the moment , the administration faces no serious repercussions for decisions that resulted in many times more deaths in Iraq than here on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Rumsfeld went from disgrace to a visiting fellowship at the Hoover Institution .
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz went from miscalculating the need for hundreds of thousands of troops in Iraq as " wildly off the mark " to counting the planet 's dollars at the World Bank - until corruption ended his presidency there .
Bush is sure to regale us about compassionate conservatism in his sugar - coated presidential library and Cheney will mumble from some undisclosed bunker about being the great liberator .
All they currently face is the judgment of history .
It was something of a consolation for history that President - elect Barack Obama named Eric Shinseki to be the next secretary of Veterans Affairs .
Shinseki was the general who made the Iraq troop estimate that Wolfowitz criticized .
And at least we have some facts to go with the fiction .
The Senate report released jointly by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and John McCain of Arizona said Rumsfeld 's authorization of techniques " was a direct cause of detainee abuse . "
It also said that Bush 's presidential order saying the Geneva Convention for humane treatment of prisoners of war did not apply to al Qaeda " impacted the treatment of detainees . "
Cheney and the report give us fresh clarity on their obfuscations .
For instance , two years ago , Cheney was asked on a conservative radio talk show , " Would you agree a dunk in water is a no - brainer if it can save lives ? "
Cheney responded , " Well it 's a no - brainer for me . "
The White House immediately trotted out the late White House spokesman Tony Snow and vice - presidential spokeswoman Lee Anne McBride to convince the press that Cheney was not referring to waterboarding .
McBride said , " The vice president does not discuss any techniques or methods that may or may not have been used in questioning . "
Snow was challenged by reporters that it defied common sense to deny that a " dunk in water " was waterboarding .
Snow still asserted , " he was n't referring to waterboarding .
He was referring to using a program of questioning , not talking about waterboarding . "
Pummeled by the press over this parsing , an exasperated Snow said , " I 'm telling you what the vice president 's view is , which is it was n't about waterboarding .
Period . "
The not - so - funny thing is that Cheney 's " no- brainer " remark was an honest window into his brain .
True to the eight years of this administration , even the truth must be covered with a lie .

A week and a half ago , I unsubscribed from all of my feeds in Google Reader .
Looking around at my other sources of information , I resolved to process my email only once a day , refused to pick up any newspapers , and resisted the temptation to read any nonfiction for a week .
I feel like I ’ve come back from a two - week vacation .
Information : a need that feeds on itself
Until I cancelled my RSS feeds , I had no idea just how frequently and reflexively I was typing “ gr , ” my keyword bookmark for Google Reader , into the Firefox address bar .
For the first couple of days on the Low Information Diet , stopping myself from check my feeds was unsettling .
Typing “ gr ” was like an autonomic response to boredom and anxiety .
If I had n’t unsubscribed from the feeds , I probably would ’ve found an excuse to read them anyway .
Fortunately , since I did , only an empty GReader came up .
By the middle of the week , I was completely over RSS , and wondered how many hours I had spent either reading feeds , or surfing through sites based on information I had come across in those feeds .
I ’ve gone back to reading nonfiction , but now I visit my favorite blogs directly , at what will probably wind up being two or three times per week .
RSS has convinced me that information is a need that feeds on itself .
The more information you find , the more information you seek , and the more you seek , the more you find .
That circularity , being “ in the loop , ” is unscalable .
Increased awareness of what information is “ out there ” to be learned or miss out on induces loss aversion .
The hunger for information increases while the number of hours in the day remains the same .
Getting back to zero base
I think everyone should renounce his or her intake of information for at least one week .
The Low Information Diet should be familiar to anyone who ’s read The 4 - Hour Workweek .
It consists of :
No web surfing
No excessive email checking
No RSS
No news ( really , the world will still turn )
No non-entertainment television ( ideally no television )
No nonfiction books
What ’s allowed : a one - hour indulgence each day of any of the above .
Music and fiction are also fair game .
I did n’t do the one - hour indulgence myself , since it was too easy for me to relapse .
You can always go back to devouring information for information ’s sake , but if you stick to a full week , you ’ll almost certainly drop some information sources from your permanent diet .
Now that I ’m going to blogs on an as - needed basis instead of reading them just because they ’re in my RSS reader , I enjoy reading them more , since there ’s less sense of obligation .
Some of the information we consume is important , some of it was important , and some of it might be important .
The best way to objectively determine what ’s relevant is stopping the flow of information entirely for a finite period .
As long as you ’re trying to keep up with incoming information , there ’s no way to have sufficient perspective to distinguish between the content with high relevance and the content that ’s consumed out of habit .
The less frequently you keep up with new developments in a given field of interest , the more perspective you ’ll have on them .
You can join every social network du jour , or wait a few months to see which few have traction , then join those .
Value investors make as much or more money with less work than day traders .
You can read the news analysis columns of newspapers every day , or get more in - depth analyses from weekly news magazines .
Bloggers who check traffic and subscription stats daily overreact to minor fluctuations .
Some issues and events need time to play out before any meaningful patterns or relationships can be detected .
The point of diminishing returns
Just as there ’s a point of diminishing returns with too much information , the same holds for too little information .
The best way to find out how little is too little is to get back to zero base .
By taking in no information , the sources you genuinely miss will make themselves known , but they ’ll probably be far fewer than you expect .
I noticed that it was harder to brainstorm topics for the blog last week , since some of what I write is a reaction to what others in the bloggosphere are saying .
So I read those blogs weekly and will check others occasionally .
Just before starting a Low Information Diet , everything you ’re currently reading or listening to seems essential rather that habitual .
It ’s hard to imagine giving up even half of your daily reading .
After a week , you ’ll probably go back to reading between 10 - 20 percent of your original .
You start becoming aware of the opportunity costs of consuming more information than you can act on .
Try it for a week and see what content you allow back into your life .

" Connell ... was apparently told by a close friend not to fly his plane because his plane might be sabotaged , " 19 Action News reporter Blake Renault said .
" And twice in the last two months , Connell , who is an experienced pilot , canceled two flights because of suspicious problems with his plane . "

Not being a pilot or aviation expert , I have a theory after watching and listening to the video .
Witnesses say they " heard " the plane going down = engine running .
This , coupled with the flaming trail of debris suggests the plane did not run out of fuel .
The near - freezing temperature could have caused icing on the wings , and that could bring down a plane .
It is a plausible explanation .
I do n't doubt elections in America have been rigged for years and computerized elections are a curse on democracy , but sometimes an accident is just an accident .

the guy was on an instrument approach to runway 23 and crashed 3 miles away from the runway , which on a normal ILS glideslope would have him somewhere around 600 feet above ground .
ILS approaches usually have a 4 percent slope .
He had flown 2 1/ 2 hours from college park maryland .
He had an onboard GPS navigation unit which gives him almost perfect situational awareness .
I highly doubt he was lost or confused about his position .
2 1/2 hours in a piper saratoga is nowhere near any range limitation .
The only rational explanation for fuel exhaustion would be if one of his tanks became unusable or he had a fuel leak .
Fuel leaks are exceedingly rare , very noticable , and rarely lead to mishaps .
As for other types of sabotage , if his plane were sabotaged , why would it take 2 1/2 hours for the mishap to occur ?
And why would it finally take effect coincidentally during the most dangerous phase of flight , landing ?
Much more likely sabotage would take effect on takeoff .
Turns out it was broken to overcast 500 feet , with freezing rain reported in the area .
So he's in the clouds at night in icing conditions .
Far more likely in this case is a much more tragically routine accident pattern - in a hurry to get home on a friday night to his family ( 4 kids ) and pushed his luck .
He departed later than he wanted by about 20 minutes .
He tried to sneak through marginal weather and iced up , got disoriented in the clouds , or induction icing on the engine .
http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N9299N
This kind of thing happens far too often .
There is almost nothing in this accident scenario that seems off - kilter to me , except for why such a smart guy is flying that plane at that point in time .
Approach - to - land at night in bad weather is the most dangerous flying there is , not that it is really that dangerous , just relatively speaking .
The only way that situation could have been worse is if he were over water or over mountains .
My information comes from news reports , the FAA accident synposis , and flight plan information on his a / c available at www.flightplan.com
I am an instrument rated pilot and an owner of a different type of plane ( which hardly makes me an expert )
This aircraft had dual garmin 530/430 and on board weather detection , which in this case would help him detect lightning ( not ice ) .

According to Connell 's former GovTech President Randy Cole , Connell had flown this route scores of times and had sophisticated anti icing equipment on the plane .
He said that Connell was an overly cautious pilot who could handle almost any situation .
The crash occurred at 5:54 , when the visibility was 9 - 10 miles and no other plane reported any problems .
Connell was cleared for approach , told to go to 3000 feet and then told to center his plane when approach showed him to the left of centerline .
He did not respond and then declared an emergency .
The State Police said that there was no remarkable weather at the time of the crash and no precipitation , as the footage verifies .
In another YouTube video , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFIWwjkSV4E, at 3:36-:38 , taken at the crash site , you can see the airport rotating beacon when the cameraman pans toward the airport , again showing that the visibility was very good --- 3.3 miles to the airport according to the State Police .
These reports of low visibility and deteriorating weather are disinformation to keep people from asking tough questions .
Same thing about those accusing the blogs of being conspiratorialists .
Remember , Connell told Spoonamore to make arrangements for him to meet with John Conyers so he could tell all because he was " afraid that Bush and Cheney would throw [ him ] under the bus . "
After Spoon made those arrangements , Conyers ' staff dropped the ball and failed to ever talk to Connell .

Early reports had the first responders locating a receipt in Connell 's wallet that said he had breakfast in DC on Friday morning .
http://www.thesuburbanit...-Township-airplane-crash
Yet after that inferno , how was anyone going to find an intact wallet or body ?
Seeing the receipt would go a long way to understanding WHERE and WITH WHOM Connell had breakfast that Friday morning before his death .
And if it was in an exceedingly public place or hotel someone might remember ....

Stop talking about " out of gas " .
No credible person EVER said anything about being out of gas .
Hopefully this video will clear that up .
He never ran out of gas .
He was not out of gas .
The only person who started this lie about being out of gas is Larissa from Raw Story and this gas nonsense is still repeated days and days later .

Induction icing does seem to be the ticket being that witnesses heard both sputtering and high rpms from the plane at the same time .
One pilot said it all , if you turn on the induction intake heater too late and it's already iced , it will suck a big chunks of ice and clog the intake partially or totally , or too much water into the intake all at once reducing the air fuel mixture , a predicament that he would not want to find himself in .
BUT , he said most experienced pilots would have that heater on if the air temp .

" Connell , as the pilot of the small single engine plane , was the only passenger on board . "
==================================================
So ... was he a pilot or a passenger ?
Hopefully SOMEBODY was flying the airplane .

It crashes , explodes and burns for a full 10 minutes , yet we are to believe they found his wallet with a receipt for breakfast that morning as well as two suitcases , that he was dressed in a blue suit and that he was autopsied .
Also , these people commented they heard the plane " accelerate " before they heard the explosion .
Other " eyewitness " accounts first put out were that the neighbors heard " sputtering " like the plane was running of gas .
It ca n't be both .
If it ran out of gas why the explosion ?
How could it be both sputtering AND accelerating ?
This is a homicide .

JD Aron -- thanks .
I read the article at the thesuburbanite , which is out of Akron , Ohio .
It raises some question :
This article states : 1 . The plane crashed in the front yard of an unoccupied home and slid coming to rest near some pines , and that debris from the crash was scattered over 100 yards .
Only the garage of the empty house caught fire .
All other reports I 've read say the plane hit the house engulfing both in flames .
But we read here that the plane crashed in the front yard not the house , and that only the garage caught fire .
The video above confirms that there were what appears to be smaller fires inside the garage portion of the house , but the main burn was the plane -- and it was a burning inferno located several yards from the house .
Witnesses said they first heard an explosion and then ( presumably saw ) a burst of flames .
2 . The coroner stated that Connell was wearing a business suit and that investigators had found receipts in Connell 's wallet indicating he had breakfast that morning in Washington DC .
Questions :
After watching the above video , how could they have found Connell 's wallet intact , much less determined what he was wearing ?
And other than the so - called wallet , what did they do to positively identify the body as that of Connell ?
Are they planning to do a DNA test to positively determine the identity of the crash victim ?
If not , why not ?
3 . Another article stated that a law enforcement official on the scene immediately identified Connell as the victim and lone occupant of the plane .
I wondered how the officer could have made that determination so quickly considering the body had probably been burned beyond recognition in the crash .
The above video would tend to confirm this .
But now we hear about this wallet being found AND that they were able to determmine that Connell was wearing a suit .
Was his body found IN the plane or somewhere else non the scene ?
4 . According to the director of communications at the Akron Canton Airport , the crash occurred while Connell was en route to runway 23 .
Since Connell had been in radio contact with the airport , why would he not radio the airport immediately when he found himself in trouble ?
Or did he ?
And if he did , why is that information not being released ?

Someone should also look a little more closely at the College Park , MD airport .
College Park is known as one of the " DC Three " general aviation airports whose operations were severaly curtailed after 9/11 .
College Park is within the Air Defense Identification Zone ( ADIZ ) Washington , a zone where pilots must be background screened , and pre-cleared to fly in .
Pilots also must file flight plans in advance with the TSA and stick to them ( I believe Lockheed Martin runs that program ) .
College Park has suffered severe hardship as the result of the Federal Government 's heavy handedness on security , and as such , only about 50 pilots now operate out of that field .
" Transient " aircraft operations ( pilots who do not home - base their aircraft at College Park ) are also rare .
Point of all this --- if Mike Connell was one of only 50 users of that airport , and he was a frequent visitor , then someone at College Park might have something to say .
Bonus - here 's a video of the airfield operator lamenting the flight ops restrictions at his field :

If there was ever any doubt Americans are fully subjected to corporate media , not news media , this case , this incident , conclusively proves the case .
I am astounded there have been no " friends and family " statements .
Not one of Connell 's contacts prior to his flight home have appeared .
Why not ?
At this point , it becomes important to bring in the editors of our corporate media to explain why they chose to silence this incident .
Maybe the plaintiff attorneys will find useful information as to who dictated the news censorship on this matter .

Hi all
Please watch out for the changes in the online stories .
it seem that they are adding part and minus-ing other part
I started watching ( reading )
Plane crash in ohio right from the start and no mention of spuddering noises .
this what was first said " State Highway Patrol Lt. Eric Sheppard said Mr. Connell 's plane was in communication with the airport control tower just before the crash , but he could not detail whether the radio transmissions were calls for help . "
and
'' We have no reason to believe at this point it was anything other than an unfortunate crash , '' Sheppard said .
Charles Starkey , a former Navy pilot and director of safety for a Cleveland - area private jet company , said Friday night 's cloud cover and misty , cold conditions presented challenges for even the most experienced pilots .
In a 30 - minute time frame around the crash , the weather deteriorated quickly as visibility around the airport diminished from nine miles to a little over one mile with a low ceiling .
In such cases , pilots typically are forced to rely on the plane 's instruments rather than their own vision , which can contribute to crashes , Starkey said .
'' It 's easy to get disoriented , especially if you 're not very experienced at it , '' he said .
'' You 've got to ignore the various things your body can be telling you and rely on your instruments .
It 's very challenging . ''
But NO ONE in any of the reports .
Said spudder !
( my thuoght )
The web is agreat thing , BUT unlike a printed newspaper to make a correction you must print it the nexted day .
The web can be changed with a click and its gone

So , he rented or leased this plane ?
How could he have an intimate knowledge of it ?

Conspiracy theories are fun , but the only thing that makes this even newsworthy or even discussion worthy is it was a political operative ...
As someone familiar with flying small aircraft , this is pretty much the stereotypical set of circumstances for a small plane crash ( all the ingredients compound the situation so when something does go wrong , the odds go way up for a crash ) ...
Single engine , flying at night under IFR , icing conditions and crash on approach .
I do n't think the ear witnesses can be considered credible until they are qualified .
I mean honestly , to a lot of people a prop plane losing altitude sounds like sputtering when it is not .
If it were engine out you can still land , though I would hate to have to glide that in under IFR .
Oh , and yea , what is so hard to believe about intact wallet ?
Do n't cook much , or use fire much ?
Sheesh , it would take a lot more than 10 minutes for a wallet ( leather ? ) in a pocket , likely between a seat cushion and moist flesh to burn .
Gas fires burns from the surface down .
Everything in the plane would be ash if it burnt long and hot enough to destroy a wallet tucked in under the butt .
So far there is nothing suspicious about the event if you replaced the person in question with any other person .
Until there is something suspicious , this is just hyperbole , rumors and unqualified speculation .
Sorry !

OK GUYS , LETS GET THE FACTS RIGHT .
THE PLANE WAS A PIPER SARATOGA , NOT EQUIPPED TO FLY IN ICING CONDITIONS .
OUR cHIEF PILOT ARRIVED INTO AKRON CANTON AN HOUR EARLIER AND SAID THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL ICE ON APPROACH AND IT GOT WORSE FROM THAT TIME ON .
THE PLANE DID NOT RUN OUT OF GAS , HENCE THE POST IMPACT FIRE .
I SAW THE HOUSE ( WHICH HE DID NOT IN FACT HIT ) AND THE SIDING WAS MELTED FROM THE FIRE .
HE WAS NOT A HIGH TIME INSTRUMENT PILOT .
IT WAS PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING :
1. FLIGHT INTO ICEING CONDITIONS
2. SPATIAL DISORENTATION
3. DARKNESS
4. LOW TIME INSTRUMENT EXPERIENSE .
ALSO AS STATED IN AN EARLIER POST , " THE ENGINE MAY NOT HAVE PROVIDED ENOUGH THRUST OVER THE WINGS .
THE WINGS WILL FLY WITH OR WITHOUT ENGINE THRUST , OTHERWISE A PLANE WILL NOT GLIDE .
AS FOR THE FIRE BURNING THE VICTIM , I HAVE A FRIEND WHO WORKS FOR THE SHERRIFS DEPT WHO WAS THERE AND SAID HE WAS THROWN FROM THE PLANE AT IMPACT .
THE PLANE BROKE INTO MANY PIECES AT IMPACT .

I think it remarkable how restrained the comments have been .
Very little in the realm of whacky conspiracy theories here and so I really hesitate to suggest anything like the following ... but I will anyway .
I 'm sure you pilots all remember the incidents at LAX and maybe other airports 10 - 15 years ago when pilots complained of being blinded by laser lights .
The pilot looking out his windshield is a sitting duck on the long approach .
I seem to recollect that the FAA took it quite seriously and that reports came out claiming that juveniles were playing with laser pointers .
Well today we know that our technical ability and weaponry has advanced well beyond a professor 's laser pointer .
I remember seeing a gadget on TV that the police can use to cause a car to stall by creating electrical shorts .
At one point , quite active in street protests , I remember learning about the new " crowd control " weapon that can beam intense microwaves into a crowd , causing extremely high body temperatures , disorientation and painful discomfort over a broad area .
I imagine a focused beam could do quite a bit of damage .
Of course , just as with election fraud , any such technologies used in a crime would only be used occasionally so as not to arouse suspicion , but would be saved for special cases , such as a real threat to those in power , and they would leave little forensic evidence .
I hate to bring any suspicion onto those in power but did anyone in the vicinity of the airport notice any brief static on their radios ?
If I am way off base fine , but it seems to me clear that the enemy is within and the sooner we rout it out the better .

Soon the laser could be zapping missiles out of the sky ( Image : Jim Shryne / USAF )
IMAGINE swarms of aircraft patrolling the skies , zapping missiles , aircraft or even satellites in low Earth orbit with invisible , ultrapowerful laser beams .
Such laser battles in the sky may not be such a long way off , after a megawatt laser weapon was fired from an aircraft for the first time .
Although the Airborne Laser ( ABL ) was fired from a stationary plane at a target on the ground just a few metres away , the test marked a milestone for the weapon , developed by aerospace firms Boeing , Lockheed …
In part 1 of Christian 's article about program design , Thibs described realistic goals , proper training splits , the correct number of exercises per muscle group , and proper exercises .
Today , he 'll finish off with explanations of exercise order , rest intervals , recovery , and special methods .
Step 7 – Select the Proper Exercise Pattern
Exercise distribution within a workout has two components :
Basic structure ( horizontal / straight sets , alternating , vertical / circuit ) Exercise order within a chosen structure
The basic structure of the program is how you perform each exercise or set in relationship to the others .
Horizontal / Straight Sets Structure
This is your '' usual ' ' distribution pattern , whereby you perform all the sets of an exercise before moving on to the next .
For example :
Exercise Sets Reps Rest A Bench Press 4 10 90 sec. B T - Bar Row 4 10 90 sec .
In this routine , you 'd perform all four sets of the bench press ( with 90 seconds of rest between sets ) before moving on to the T - bar row .
Alternating Structure
This approach , popularized by coach Poliquin , has the advantage of letting you do more work with less rest , without sacrificing performance ( I also like it because it lets me get out of the gym that much quicker ! ) .
In this distribution pattern , you alternate sets between a pair of exercises that target different muscle groups ideally an agonist / antagonist pair .
For example :
Exercise Sets Reps Rest A1 Bench Press 4 10 45 sec. A2 T - Bar Row 4 10 45 sec .
In this case you 'd perform one set of A1 ( bench press ) , rest for 45 seconds , perform one set of A2 ( T - bar row ) , rest for 45 seconds , then go back to A1 and repeat until you 've performed 4 sets of each exercise .
The actual rest intervals between two sets of bench press are about the same as with straight sets , even though you 're only resting for 45 seconds .
Vertical / Circuit structure
Here you perform one set of three or more exercises one after another , in a circuit , then repeating the circuit if necessary .
For example :
Exercise Sets Reps Rest A1 Dumbbell Bench Press 2 12 30 sec. A2 Dumbbell Squat 2 12 30 sec. A3 Seated Row 2 12 30 sec. A4 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift 2 12 30 sec. A5 Preacher Curl 2 12 30 sec .
Note that a circuit does n't have to be composed of all the exercises in your workout .
You can perform a circuit of four exercises , for example , then two normal exercises performed in either an alternating or straight set fashion .
Circuits are best suited for body composition / fat loss training where you keep your intervals down to as little as 10 seconds between stations .
But circuit training is also a highly efficient way to train for strength and power as well by increasing the intervals to as much as 2 or 3 minutes .
This allows you to perform far more work in less time than it would take for straight or alternate sets , while still having plenty of recovery time between sets of the same exercise .
Exercise Order
Once you 've chosen your training structure you need to arrange the exercises you 've chosen in a logical and effective order .
The most important rule to remember is the most neurally demanding exercises for a muscle group should be performed before the less demanding ones .
For example , you should perform the squat earlier in the workout than a leg extension .
There are few exceptions to this rule , one being when you want to pre-fatigue a hard - to - recruit muscle by isolating it before a compound movement .
Take all the exercises for one muscle group and arrange them in order of difficulty .
For example , if you 've selected the following exercises for your chest :
Cable Crossover
Bench Press
Dumbbell Incline Press
Then the correct order would become :
Bench Press
Dumbbell Incline Press
Cable Crossover
Rule of thumb : primary exercises before secondary , which go before auxiliary , which go before remedial ones .
If you have two exercises from the same category ( i.e. two primary or two secondary exercises ) , the exercise in which you use the most weight goes first .
Depending on the structure ( horizontal , vertical , alternating ) you use , the actual order of exercises might change .
If you 're using straight sets you can either perform all exercises for the same muscle group one after the other , then move on to the next muscle group .
In this case the order would be :
A. Chest primary
B. Chest secondary
C. Chest auxiliary
D. Triceps primary
E. Triceps secondary
F. Triceps auxiliary
This is okay if you 're training one large muscle group ( chest , back , or quads ) and one or two small muscle groups in a workout .
If you 're training two large muscle groups ( e.g. chest and back ) , it 's not the best option , as the CNS will be fried by the time you get to the second muscle group .
If you 're training two or more large muscle groups , or your whole body , then it 's better to arrange all the exercises in order of difficulty , regardless of the muscle being trained .
First group all of the exercises by category ( primary , secondary etc. ) , and then order them so that the larger muscles are being worked first .
In this example , you have chosen the following exercises for your full - body workout :
Bench Press
Military Press
Chin-Up
Front Squat
Romanian Deadlift
Barbell Curl
All of these are primary exercises , so they should be ordered according to the size of the muscle involved , like so :
A. Front Squat
B. Romanian Deadlift
C. Chin-Up
D. Bench Press
E. Military Press
F. Barbell Curl
If you 've also selected secondary exercises , the same rule applies : group by category ( primary before secondary ) , then order the exercises in each category according to the size of the muscle group involved .
For example , say you choose to use :
Bench Press ( primary )
Leg Press ( secondary )
Bent - Over Barbell Row ( primary )
Seated Dumbbell Press ( secondary )
Snatch - Grip Deadlift ( primary )
Hammer Curl ( secondary )
You first group the exercises by category :
Primary Movements :
Snatch - grip deadlift
Bent - over barbell row
Bench press
Secondary Movements :
Leg Press
Seated DB Press
Hammer Curl
Then arrange by muscle group size :
A. Snatch - Grip Deadlift
B. Bent - Over Barbell Row
C. Bench Press
D. Leg Press
E. Seated Dumbbell Press
F. Hammer Curl
If you 're using the alternating structure ( most often with an antagonist split ) , then your first step is to order the exercises for each muscle .
For example , let 's say that you 're working chest and back and you select these exercises :
Chest
Decline Dumbbell Flies
Decline Bench Press
Incline Dumbbell Press
Back
Lat Pulldown to Front
Bent - over Barbell row
Chest - supported Rear Deltoid Raise
The correct order for each muscle becomes :
Chest
A. Decline Bench Press
B. Incline Dumbbell Press
C. Decline Dumbbell Flies
Back
A. Bent - Over Barbell Row
B. Lat Pulldown
C. Chest - Supported Rear Deltoid Raise
Since the workout calls for an alternating exercise structure , the workout looks like this :
First Exercise Pairing
A1 . Decline Bench Press
A2 . Bent - over Barbell Row
Second Exercise Pairing
B1 . Incline DB Press
B2 . lat Pulldown
Third Exercise Pairing
B1 . Decline Dubbell Fly
C2 . Chest - Supported Rear Deltoid Raise
Finally , if you 're doing a circuit structure , you have a number of options depending on your goal .
In a strength , size , or power circuit with relatively long rest intervals between stations , the same rule applies as for straight sets : group by category , then order by muscle group .
In a lactate - inducing circuit aimed at fat loss , which jumps from one exercise to the next with very little rest in between , you 're taxing your metabolic system rather than your nervous system , so exercise order is somewhat less critical .
However , you should be careful to arrange the exercises in such a way that they do n't interfere with each other , alternating exercises to minimize the cross -over effect .
For example , if your first exercise is a seated dumbbell shoulder press , following it with a bench press variation would not be a very good idea because this exercise hits the same muscle groups .
Priority exercises
The Olympic lifts ( snatch , clean and jerk ) and their respective variations always precede every other exercise in your program .
The snatch
The clean
These exercises , involving the whole body in a complex movement pattern that rely heavily on the CNS , must be prioritized whenever they are included in your program .
This may seem obvious , but I 've seen programs for professional sports teams that prescribed snatches afterdeadlifts , squats , bench presses and rows !
Ouch !
Remember : when you 're using the Olympic lifts in a program , always put them first .
If you perform more than one lift , snatches should come before cleans , which should come before jerks .
Here 's a mnemonic to help you remember the correct order :
Step 8 – Selecting Rest Intervals
The amount of rest between sets is directly dependent on your One Goal .
Remember these rules :
The nervous system takes longer to recover than the muscles and metabolic processes .
Incomplete recovery of the metabolic processes can increase growth hormone production and might have significant body composition effects .
Incomplete recovery can also force the body to recruit more motor units , although they might be of the slow - twitch variety .
If all you 're after is size , though , this could be interesting .
Complete CNS recovery is necessary for optimal strength performance .
So if you 're training for strength , you 'll need to take longer rest periods to maximize the quality of your lifting efforts .
The right interval length depends on the intensity of your efforts , as well as on the exercise performed ( you recover faster from a set of triceps kickbacks than from a set of squats ) .
The following table illustrates the impact of various rest intervals :
Impact of the Length of the Rest Intervals on Recovery
Rest CNS Metabolic Key Points Best Suited For 20 - 30 sec .
Negligible 30 - 50 % Metabolite accumulation and oxygen debt , both of which can lead to the release of hGH and other growth factors Fat Loss
( strength - endurance zone ) 30 - 60 sec. Small ( 30 - 40 % ) 50 - 75 %
Some significant metabolite accumulation .
More metabolic rest = capacity to use more weight when training in hypertrophy zone Fat Loss and Muscle Gain
( strength - endurance and hypertrophy zones ) 60 - 90 sec. 40-60 % 75-90 %
Good compromise between metabolic accumulation and sufficient recovery to perform heavier work Muscle Gain
( hypertrophy zone ) 90 - 120 sec. 60 - 75 % 100 % Allows you to maintain work capacity between hypertrophy - inducing sets Muscle and Strength Gains
( hypertrophy and functional hypertrophy zones ) 2 - 4 min. 80-100 % 100 % Full neural recovery and strength potentiation , allowing maximal lifting Strength Gains
( absolute and limit strength zones )
Depending on your One Goal and the intensity zone you select , the ideal rest intervals would be :
Relative Strength Zone ( 1 - 3 reps ) : 3 - 4 min. between sets
Absolute Strength Zone ( 3 - 5 reps ) : 2 - 3 min. between sets
Functional Hypertrophy Zone ( 6 - 8 reps ) : 90 - 120 sec. between sets
Hypertrophy Zone I ( 9 - 10 reps ) : 60 - 90 sec. between sets
Hypertrophy Zone II ( 11 - 12 reps ) : 45 -60 sec. between sets
Strength - Endurance Zone ( 13 - 20 reps ) : 30 - 45 sec. between sets
Endurance - Strength Zone ( more than 20 reps ) : 30 sec. or less
Again , these are guidelines .
Some people need less rest while others need more .
For the great majority , this will work fine , so start there and adjust as needed .
Notice that I say " between sets of a single exercise . "
This means that if , for example , you 're working in the hypertrophy zone you 'd need to take 60 to 90 seconds of rest before performing a second set of the same exercise .
For straight sets , this is quite straightforward :
A. Bench Press : 4 x 10 reps , 90 sec. rest interval
Four sets of ten reps each , resting 90 seconds between each set .
Piece of cake ( or steak , if you prefer ) .
If you 're doing alternating sets , it 's a bit more complicated , but not much .
Let 's alternate bench press with T - bar row :
A1 . Bench Press : 4 x 10
A2 . T - Bar Row : 4 x 10
We still need 90 seconds of rest ( time spent not exercising ) before starting a second set of the same exercise .
We can get this by putting a 45 sec. rest interval between exercises .
A1 . Bench Press : 4 x 10 , 45 sec .
A2 . T - Bar Row : 4 x 10 , 45 sec .
Now we have 90 seconds between each set of bench press , and 90 seconds between each set of rows .
But our workout density is higher , which gives the session a more profound metabolic ( fat loss and body composition ) effect .
If you 're circuit training for fat loss , you 'll be working in the strength - endurance zone .
If so , simply use the interval length specified above 10 - 45 seconds ) between each station .
Lactate - inducing circuit training should be considered energy system work ( cardio ) with weights , rather than " weight lifting . "
Step 9 – About Recovery Days
I do n't care how tough you think you are , or how hardcore you fancy yourself to be .
The basic rules of physiology still apply to you .
One of those rules is that muscular growth does not occur in the gym .
In the history of mankind , nobody has ever packed on a pound of beef while training .
When you stagger home from the gym after your workout , you 're actually worse off then you were before you started : you damaged your muscles , depleted your energy stores , and fatigued your nervous system .
It 's only when you let your body recover that progress of any kind starts to happen .
During the recovery period , your body will rebuild its muscle tissue bigger and stronger ( muscle hypertrophy or tissue remodeling ) , it will restore and even over - replenish its energy stores ( surcompensation ) and the nervous system will become more efficient at recruiting motor units ( neural efficiency ) .
In other words , all the good stuff happens when you 're not training .
However , a lot of people do n't give their bodies enough recovery days to let that progress set in .
I have a theory about why this is , and once again , it goes back to the fact that training is an emotionally - charged activity .
We can be so impatient when it comes to building the body of our dreams .
We want to be big and ripped with superhuman strength , and we want it now !
The more passionate we are about our dream , the more irrational we become , and the more work we 're willing to do in the gym .
We can't help it , we were raised to believe that the more time we spend on something , and the harder we work on it , the better the results will be .
Our parents and teachers exhorted us to exert ourselves at our studies until exhausted .
Our coaches filled our ears with pithy slogans like , " success only comes before work in the dictionary ! "
And when we went off to work , we soon learned that the longer hours we put in , the fatter our paychecks became .
Who can blame us for thinking that the same would apply to training ?
Well , stop thinking it right now , because it 's wrong , wrong , wrong .
The cold fact is , no matter how long or hard you train , without proper recovery you will never optimize your progress .
In fact , you may even begin to regress , if you work out so much that you exceed your recovery capacity .
The sad thing is , when people see their hard - earned gains slipping away through over - work and under - recovery , what 's the first thing they do ?
They do even morefrigging work !
They think their problem is that they just were n't training hard enough .
I 'll say it one more time .
You must get rid of the notion that " lack of results = lack of work . "
In most cases , especially among highly motivated individuals , lack of results = improper work / recovery ratio .
The point of this diatribe is to give you a forceful reminder that when designing a program , you should always include enough recovery days to allow your body to adapt , rebuild and improve .
Understand , however , that " recovery day " is not always just a day off .
There are three levels of recovery .
Let 's look at each .
Active recovery
This means performing some physical activity that is n't stressful on the system .
It could be playing a sport , taking a walk , doing some low - intensity cardio or even low - intensity weight training .
This type of recovery can be helpful as it increases blood flow to the muscles and keeps the metabolism running high .
Just resist the temptation to overdo it .
Many people are stimulus junkies who turn even a light recovery session into an intense workout !
This is especially true if weight training is used as an active recovery tool .
Let me repeat myself : active recovery work must not constitute a stress on the system .
So when recovering with weights , we 're talking high reps ( 12 - 20 or even more ) , not going anywhere near failure .
Some people will also make the mistake of performing a high - intensity activity like intervals training of sprints on their recovery days .
Intervals , sprints , plyos and such represent a pretty considerable stress on the body , either on the CNS or on the metabolic processes .
As a result they do not allow the body to recover optimally from training .
Bottom line : any activity that is physically demanding should not be done on an active recovery day .
Passive Recovery
This is your " day off , " meaning that you avoid physical activity .
But let 's not be stupid about this .
You 're allowed to walk , climb stairs and carry things .
You do n't have to ride around on one of those little electric carts that fat people use , and if your wife asks you to take out the trash , do n't try to dodge it by saying , " But Thibs said no physical activity . "
A passive recovery day is nothing more or less than a day on which you do n't train .
And that 's all I have to say about that .
Assisted Recovery
This third level involves using methods that enhance the body 's capacity to recover from training stress .
It may take the form of massages , epsom salt baths , contrast showers , and other such techniques .
I suggest that you read my article 7 Secrets to Rapid Recovery for more information .
This type of recovery day is especially useful if for some reason ( too much stress , excessive training , improper recovery , etc. ) you find yourself starting to accumulate fatigue and have problems recovering from your workouts .
In most cases the following applies :
Active Recovery : Use mainly when you are focusing on CNS - based training ( heavy weights , explosive movements with relatively low volume ) ; with this type of training the muscles and metabolic processes are not severely taxed but the CNS takes a beating .
Low - intensity work ( not neurally demanding ) can thus be successfully used without fear of over - stressing the metabolic processes .
Do not use when undergoing a high - volume phase as the muscles and metabolic processes are already severely taxed .
Passive Recovery :
These days can be used with all types of training .
Assisted Recovery :
You may be tempted to use these methods all the time , to become a " recovery machine . "
However , as with training , the body adapts to recovery methods and if you use them all the time they lose their effectiveness .
They are better kept for when your body is under severe stress .
They are especially useful when the muscles are under tremendous strain ( high volume of relatively intense work ) .
Step 10 – About Special Methods
As I said before , training is a highly emotional endeavor .
In our frenzy to transform ourselves , we want maximum results in minimum time , so when we read about a special training method ( e.g .
Cluster sets , rest / pause , pre-fatigue supersets , post - fatigue supersets , drop sets , chains , bands , weight releasers , etc. ) , our first irrational instinct is to throw them right into our training programs , expecting them to work miracles for us .
Yes , these methods will help stimulate more gains .
No , they should n't be used all the time .
Most people actually do n't need these methods at all to progress optimally : beginners and most intermediate lifters can maximize their progress simply by focusing on the basics performed with effort and dedication .
It is those more advanced individuals , those for whom every micron of progress seems to take eons to occur , that really need these methods .
The more advanced you are , the better adapted your body is to physical stress .
As a result , it takes a much bigger physiological stimulus to trigger appreciable gains .
This is where advanced methods really shine .
You should include them in your program onlywhen they are needed , to keep your progress going at a satisfactory rate .
Using these methods too soon ( when you do n't really need them ) can actually impair your long - term progress .
While advanced individuals need advanced techniques and techniques for optimal growth , beginning and intermediate trainees do not .
The body is very adaptable , and can get used to any training method .
Once this happens , the effectiveness of the technique is greatly diminished .
By using your most advanced techniques from the beginning , when you do n't need them , you can limit your long term progress by rendering these techniques ineffective when you do need them .
I 'm not saying you have to include advanced techniques in your program .
Start by learning how to plan the basics .
When you 're good at that , you can gradually add in more advanced stuff .
But do it gradually , first to avoid overloading the system , second to be able to assess the individual effect of each method ; if you throw in 3 or 4 advanced methods at a time , it 'll be hard to tell for sure which one was responsible for your gains .
Conclusion
If you have carefully read this entire article , then right now you 're probably thinking , " Damn , that was a long article ! "
But hopefully you were n't overwhelmed , and are just raring to give this method of program design an honest go .
After you 've written a few programs " by the numbers , " the steps will become second nature for you , and writing new programs will be a breeze .
One caveat , however , before we close .
I imagine that one or two of you are just chomping at the bit to look up every training program I ( or Chad , or Coach Poliquin , or any of the other Testosterone coaches ) have written , and gleefully post in the forums somewhere , " ah - ha !!
I found a program that is n't exactly like the one that Thibs ' Program Design article recommends !
Well , duh .
This article shows you how to design basic and effective programs .
The coaches here at Testosterone tend to present you with slightly more advanced programs , and in order to do that , we sometimes bend the rules a bit .
Realize , though , that in order to bend the rules ( without ruining the efficacy of the program ) , you must first understandthe rules .
If you want to write advanced programs , do what we all had to do : put in the time and effort to become really efficient at designing basic programs , then learn to add in more advanced techniques as needed .
In other words , you really need to graduate from high school before thinking about writing your doctoral dissertation .
Just take it slowly , progress step by step , and before you know it you 'll be designing your own sound , efficient and effective training programs .
And if you post those programs in the Locker Room for my evaluation , the chances are excellent that I will not cringe .
Happy designing !
Newark Officer : “ I can do whatever I want ! ”
Images from WCBS-TV
A Newark police officer has been suspended after a nasty altercation with a WCBS - TV photographer on Sunday which resulted in the photographer ’s arrest .
Cameraman Jim Quodomine was filming a peaceful demonstration from a public sidewalk when Special Officer Brian Sharif approached Quodomine , ordered him to stop filming , then lunged at him and grabbed his camera .
Sharif then put Quodomine in a choke hold and lead him to a squad car .
It ’s unclear why Officer Sharif felt filming the march was a problem .
On the footage , a woman ’s voice can be heard saying “ You ca n’t arrest him ! ”
To which Officer Sharif responds , “ I can do whatever I want ! ”
That is a perfect example of the sort of unchecked egoism of certain police officers that leads to incidents like this .
Understandably , there was public outcry , with Newark Mayor Cory Booker saying he was “ very dismayed about what happened . ”
( Mayor Booker is well known for trying to clean up the corruption and reputation of the troubled city . )
Wait , but here ’s the kicker :
The officer , Brian Sharif , has been the source of controversy in the past .
Last year , he made news after giving a 75 - year - old woman four tickets — including one for careless driving — after she pulled out of a funeral home and accidentally went down a one - way street .
This guy not only needs anger management classes , he needs to not be on the police force .

( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama issued a warning Sunday to officials around the country who want to fund projects with federal dollars : no more business as usual .
Decisions on projects wo n't be made " simply based on politics , " President - elect Obama said on " Meet the Press . "
In an interview on NBC's " Meet the Press , " Obama said : " What we need to do is examine :
What are the projects where we 're going to get the most bang for the buck ?
How are we going to make sure taxpayers are protected ?
" You know , the days of just pork coming out of Congress as a strategy , those days are over . "
Later , at a news conference in Chicago , Illinois , Obama said in his recent meetings with the National Conference of Governors , there was a " strong bipartisan " consensus that " we 've got to get people working on some key projects that have been sitting there for a long time . "
Infrastructure , energy programs and school construction projects will get people working and ultimately help build a stronger economy , he said .
But , he added : " We are not going to simply write a bunch of checks and let them be spent without some very clear criteria as to how this money is going to benefit the overall economy and put people back to work .
We 're not going to be making decisions on projects simply based on politics and -- and lobbying . "
The president - elect faced questions about a possible bailout of the auto industry , which he supports with caveats .
" It makes no sense for us to shovel more money into the problem if you have not seen an auto industry that is committed to restructuring -- restructuring that , frankly , should have been done 10 years ago , 20 years ago , 30 years ago , " he told reporters .
He added : " Congress is doing the exact right thing by asking for a conditions - based assistance package that holds the auto industry 's feet to the fire , gives them some short - term assistance , but also insists that that assistance leads to some very difficult choices involving all the stakeholders ... including management , labor , shareholders , creditors , and so on . "
Asked whether he supports Sen. Christopher Dodd 's call Sunday for General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner to step down , Obama did not respond directly .
But he said generally that " if this management team that 's currently in place does n't understand the urgency of the situation and is not willing to make the tough choices and adapt to these new circumstances , then they should go . "
In the NBC interview , recorded Saturday , Obama slammed executive compensation packages in the industry as " out of line " compared to Japanese auto companies .
" Now , it 's not unique to the auto industry .
We have seen that across the board .
Certainly we saw it on Wall Street , " he said .
" And part of what I 'm hoping to introduce as the next president is a new ethic of responsibility . "
Facing a financial crisis that is " going to get worse , " Obama said his top priority is building a recovery plan " equal to the task . "
He gave no specifics , saying his economic team is " crunching the numbers . "
Despite the nation 's massive debt , Obama said he wo n't be focusing on building a balanced budget at the start of his administration .
" We understand that we 've got to provide a blood infusion to the patient right now to make sure that the patient is stabilized .
And that means that we can't worry short term about the deficit .
We 've got to make sure that the economic stimulus plan is large enough to get the economy moving , " he said .
Part of that movement means taking big steps to fix the mortgage crisis , he said , adding that he is " disappointed that we have n't seen quicker movement " by the Bush administration on that front .
Asked whether he has " personally conveyed " that disappointment to the administration , Obama said only : " We have specifically said that , moving forward , we have to have a housing component to any actions that we take . "
Throughout his campaign , Obama vowed to raise taxes on couples earning more than $ 250,000 and individuals making more than $ 200,000 while lowering taxes for all others .
Asked whether that is still his plan , Obama said " we do n't yet know what the best approach is going to be . "
" But the overall thrust is going to be that 95 percent of working families are going to get a tax cut and the wealthiest Americans ... are going to give up a little bit more , " Obama said .
He did not say when that may happen .

Bailout Flashback : Ron Paul in ' 79
In 1979 Congressman Ron Paul gave a speech on the House floor in opposition to the bailout of Chrysler .
His words are extremely relevant to the new round of bailouts being discussed today .
Some excerpts :
“ Do we in Congress have the authority , either moral or constitutional , to cause this suffering ?
I can find no provision in the Constitution authorizing Congress to make loans or loan guarantees to anyone , let alone to major corporations .
Nor have I yet seen a valid moral argument concluding that we , as representatives of all the people , have the right to tax the American people – most of whom receive less in wages and benefits than Chrysler workers – to support a multibillion - dollar corporation .
What right have we – and I pose a serious question that deserves an answer – what right have we to force the American taxpayers to risk their money in a business venture which private investors dealing in their own funds have judged to be too risky ?
Chrysler paper is now classified ; that means that any private investor who is handling funds for his depositors , shareholders , or clients may be judged as violating his fiduciary responsibilities should he invest in Chrysler .
Do n’t we have a trust equally important from the American people ?
Are we not betraying their trust by voting for a Chrysler bailout ?
I believe so . ”
And
“ Last year there were 200,000 bankruptcies in this country , according to U.S. News & World Report .
Yet we have selected only the largest for our aid .
This is discrimination of the crassest sort .
We ignore the smaller victims of this government ’s policies simply because they are small .
Only the largest , those with the most clout , the most pull , get our attention .
This aristocracy of pull is morally indefensible .
What answer can be given to the small businessman driven into bankruptcy by government regulations when he asks :
“ You bailed out Chrysler , why not me ? ”
No justification can be given for this discrimination between the powerful and the powerless , the big and the small .
It is an axiom of our legal system that all citizens are to enjoy the equal protection of the laws .
That axiom is violated daily by our tax laws , and now by this proposed corporate welfare plan for Chrysler .
Apparently some citizens are more equal than others .
That is a notion I reject , and I hope you do , too .
I urge you to reject this proposal for all the reasons I have stated . ”
I highly encourage you to read the whole speech .

You might consider pointing out that when Iacocca took control of Chrysler , he did it for a salary of $ 1 a year .
He said that 's all he deserved if he could n't pull out the company .
It also was n't a gov't .
' bailout ' - it was a loan .
And Chrysler paid it back .
The difference is , the gov't gave them the $ $ then with conditions and expectations and Chrysler had honor enough to turn around .
Now ... hey , it 's 30 years later .
Honor ?
What 's that ?

Bailout 2008 , a poem by David Jeffrey
Like a bloodied warrior ,
laying broken and torn .
Like a dying soldier , hopeless and forlorn .
But the blood , it be green ,
the color of money .
And the soldier is an economy ,
and it is anything but funny .
Broken are it's people and shattered are their dreams .
Thanks to the ultra rich and their full proof schemes .
It is a tragedy with more pain to come .
Finance will be Hell , and their wills will be done .

ARMING OUR ENEMIES
I 'm really starting to notice [ 2002 ] how Orwellian the United States ' and the rest of the free - world 's relationship is with Russia and China .
In " 1984 " Orwell said " the three super - states prop one another up like three sheaves of corn " , and that they never fight against each other .
Instead they use the nations of the " Disputed Territories " as their battle - grounds .
Look at poor Afghanistan , the epitome of a " Disputed Territory " if ever there was one .
During the ten years that the Russians were bombing it , the United States , Canada or Britain did nothing to come to its defense .
See FEEDING FREEDOM'S FOES .
Then after Afghanistan defeated the Russians - with help from Saudi Arabia 's Osama bin Laden - the so - called Taliban from Pakistan moved in .
And what did the Western World do about this ?
Did they start bombing Pakistan , home of the Taliban ?
No , they started bombing Afghanistan " looking for " the Taliban .
Do n't you ever ask youself : " If China and Russia are our friends - communist tyrannies though they are - then who are our enemies ? "
Do n't you ever wonder against whom - if not China and Russia - the nations of the free world are planning to use their trillion dollar weapons ?
We actually fought on the sides of USSR and China in WWII and helped destroy their enemies , Germany and Japan .
And why do we SHARE our advanced technology - both conventional and nuclear - with China and Russia ?
And why , whenever we go to war - be it declared or undeclared - is it always against nations ARMED by China or Russia , but never China or Russia ?
For example , while we were at war against Korea it was being armed by Russia & China .
And while we were at war with Vietnam , it was being armed by Russia and China .
And during and since those wars we 've been feeding their people and rebuilding their societies , even though they still hold our soldiers prisoner .
And why is Korea left alone to develop TANGIBLE nuclear weapons , with help from - you guessed it - China , Russia and the United States , while Iraq is bombed for SUSPICIONS of developing nuclear weapons , newspeakingly referred to as WMDs for " weapons of mass destruction " [ which they were ultimately proven not to have ] ?
Actually , I 'm asking these questions rhetorically , because deep down I know the answer .
Orwell explained it all in " 1984 " , and if people want to brush - up they can find his explanation at 6 .
Super - States .

* North Korea : Nuclear Program .
MacNeil / Lehrer Productions
... After extended negotiation , North Korea and the United States entered into the " Agreed Framework " on Oct. 21 , 1994 .
Under the deal , North Korea would suspend all work at the Yongbyon complex , end all efforts to enrich plutonium for weapons and open its facilities to international oversight .
In exchange for these moves , the U.S. would supply North Korea with two light water reactors ( LWRs ) to generate electricity , and low - cost oil to help with energy needs until the reactors are built .
The agreement also promised a lifting of most economic sanctions against North Korea , and improved diplomatic relations with the United States ....
" If the two light water reactors slated to be built in North Korea are operated to optimize power production , they will discharge about 500 kg of reactor - grade plutonium a year in highly radioactive spent fuel .... Oil deliveries began in early 1995 .... The U.S. , South Korea , Japan and several other countries came together to form the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization ( KEDO ) to build the reactors ....

The American Government ordered the military commanders not to bomb Chinese bases or supply lines , even though American troops were in danger of destruction .
The reason given : this might bring China into the war , and believe it or not , our country had turned down the Chinese anti-Communist forces offer of 33,000 troops to help defeat the Chinese and Korean Communists .
Also , and I do n't suppose you 've read this in many history books , American forces were protecting the Communist - Chinese coasts .
The American fleet was ordered to protect Red China against the anti-Communist Nationalist raid , and our seventh fleet was ordered to protect shipments of military supplies for the Red Chinese forces killing American boys . )

Russia , China and Pakistan supplied crucial parts to North Korea 's covert nuclear weapons programme , American officials said yesterday ...
Two USA State Dep't officials were in Beijing yesterday - and will be in Moscow tomorrow - urging China and Russia to use diplomatic and economic leverage on North Korea to stabilise the situation of the Stalinist state 's disclosure that it 's developing weaponized uranium .
USA says the technology for the gas centrifuges needed to make weapons - grade uranium came from Moscow , Beijing and Islamabad .

New York Times , Oct 19 , 2002
Just as the crisis with Iraq is heating up , the USA is on the verge of a serious confrontation with another member of the " axis of evil , " North Korea .
North Korea recently admitted that it is conducting a secret program to produce nuclear bomb - making material .
A nuclear - armed North Korea would pose a serious threat to the 37,000 American troops in Korea and to the security of South Korea and Japan .
It would undermine the global non-proliferation regime ...
The USA helped North Korea with its nuclear production ...
In 1993 , North Korea became the first country to announce its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty leading to a terryfing crisis ...
In 1994 USA signed an Agreed Framework with North Korea to help it construct two nuclear reactors for electricity and provide monthly shipments of heavy fuel oil .

* THE AREA 51 BASE ( What is it and what 's inside ? ~ from http://www.area51zone.com/base.shtml)
The Groom Lake Base is this top - secret military base located 90 miles north of Las Vegas ( which is in Nevada ) .
It 's in grid number 51 of the Nevada Test Site , so it 's called Area 51 .
The United States Air Force Flight Test Center controls the base .
It 's best known for testing exotic aircraft and weapons .
The base was created in 1954 as a place to test the secret U - 2 spyplane that was used to fly missions over the Soviet Union .
Then it started to house the SR - 71 , A - 12 and D - 21 drone .
The F - 117A was tested there , also .
In the 1980 's the base increased in size , along with the runway ( which increased to the present 6 miles ) .
Then , mysterious lights began to appear , and armed guards known as the cammo dudes started patrolling the border .
The government closed many viewpoints from which the Area 51 base could be seen .
In 1989 , a" physicist " named Bob Lazar claimed that he worked at a base south of Area 51 and also claimed that Area 51 was testing extremely advanced aircraft and UFO 's they got by trading with the aliens .
Since then , Area 51 has been thought to be the test center of captured UFOs because of the lights in the night sky .
Obama Criticized From the Left , Praised by the Right
President - elect Obama is getting criticized from a group of voters and it is n’t the voters you would think .
Sure there has been criticism from the right ( myself included naturally ) but according to this article Barack Obama is facing his harshest criticism from the far left which is critical of several of Obama ’s actions since becoming the president - elect .
Segments of Obama ’s more radical supporters — mostly those who were quick to embrace the most liberal viable candidate — are not happy with his most recent political ploys .
In their eyes , Lieberman betrayed the party by criticizing now President - elect Barack Obama and , even worse , by backing John McCain for president and speaking at the Republican Convention .
And the possibility that Clinton will be added to the high level position of secretary of state is a far cry from Obama ’s call for “ Change . ”
Here are some of the comments made by some of the people referenced in the article linked to above :
There is a particular feeling of betrayal , as Jane Hamsher , editor of FireDogLake , exemplifies : The Senate Democratic caucus do n’t [ sic ] hate Lieberman , they hate you .
They hate you for having the temerity to think you could take down a sitting US Senator , or hold him accountable for his actions .
Take that , you …you …plebe .
Still , we do what we do .
The number of people who want Lieberman held to account grew exponentially during the 2008 election , and those who stood up to defend him might be surprised at how much political capital they expended in doing so .
And from Chris ” I get a thrill up my leg ” Matthews :
I do n’t understand it . …
Why would he pick her ?
I thought we were done with the Clintons .
She ’ll just use it to build her power base .
It ’s Machiavellian .
And then we ’ll have Bill Clinton , too .
I thought Obama did n’t want drama .
He ’s already got [ chief of staff Rahm ] Emanuel and [ transition team leader John ] Podesta .
He ’ll have even more drama with her .
She ’s just a soap opera .
If he does n’t pick her , everyone will say she ’s been dissed again , we ’ll have to live through that again .
And here are more :
One blogger , again at DailyKos , writing under the pseudonym “ fatcatnichols , ” was enraged by at the prospect of Hillary Clinton joining Obama ’s administration .
It ’s very painful for me to watch Obama , the person I was so inspired by , transform himself from a “ clean break from the 1990 ’s ” to the Bill Clinton freak show .
This is not what I voted for .
Barack Obama has been completely overshadowed by the Clinton ’s over the last few days .
I hardly remember Obama ’s landslide victory , subsequent mandate for Change , and his potential to give us a fresh start .
I ’m still hoping Obama does n’t choose Hillary , but all indications are that he will … and I am just about to throw up .
Ian Welsh at FireDogLake notes the rising anti-Clinton sentiment : [ T ] here are a lot of Progressives who wo n’t like [ Clinton as Secretary of State ] much , given Clinton ’s record of supporting the Iraq war and voting for the stand alone resolution making Iran ’s Republican Guards a terrorist organization , which made a part of the Iranian military “ terrorists . ”
Clinton was definitely more hawkish than Obama was during the primary season , and during her career .
The far left fears that the president - elect is n’t about to provide the change that he promised and they are on the attack .
They chose the candidate who they felt was different from the others and they have watched him fill his staff with former Clinton staffers and they are not happy .
Republicans seem to be much happier about the Clinton pick than the Democrats .
They had feared a Bill Richardson or John Kerry pick .
Meanwhile president - elect Obama is gaining praise from an unlikely source , Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell .
McConnell expressed appreciation that Obama ’s pick for White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , visited Capitol Hill this week to talk to Republicans ahead of the new Congress convening on January 6 , two weeks before Obama is sworn in as president .
“ I think the new administration is off to a good start , ” the Kentucky senator said .
“ They ’re saying , in my view , all the right things … that they want to govern in the middle and tackle big things . ”
This has got to incense the far left also , the Republican senate leader saying that president - elect Obama is off to the right start has got to justify their negative feelings of what Obama has done so far .
Barack Obama faces a tough challenge , the far left controls the Democrat party and Obama ran as a far leftist during the primary in order to secure the nomination .
He was then able to hide what I believe are his true hard left policies during the general election in order to gain the support of the moderates .
If he governs from the center as Mitch McConnell believes he will Obama risks losing the far left .
However if Obama turns too far left he risks losing the moderates who broke for him and handed him the election .
The Republican leader claims that Obama is off to a good start , but if you ask the far left they would disagree .
Somehow we have entered the bizarro world .

If you miss class , do n’t ask me if anything important happened .
Lecture happened .
If you did n’t want to go – your money , your grade .
What do you expect anyways ?
That I ’m going to answer , “ Yes , actually , on the one day you missed I decided to give a pop quiz that counts for 50 % of your grade .
Oh yeah , and then we discussed the answers to the final and then I gave everybody cookies .
Too bad you missed it .
” I do n’t really like it when I see you guys in the bathroom .
I ’m always afraid I ’ll fart or something , and then it ’ll be around the department and I ’ll get some lame nickname like Dr. Farts .
On a similar topic , how do you know when I fart in my office ?
Invariably , there ’s a knock on my door immediately afterwards , and I have to answer it while trying to position my body for maximal obstruction of air .
And , it ’s kind of a catch 22 .
It ’s not like I can go to the bathroom and fart , because of the above issue .
I ’m a better liar than you .
It ’s because I ’m really smart .
When I was an undergrad , I got out of all sorts of things for all sorts of reasons .
Deaths in the family , tears on command , cars breaking down , feigning symptoms of depression , you name it , I used it .
I know when you ’re trying to bullshit me .
Do n’t try .
And while I ’m very sympathetic if it ’s legitimate , I ’m a bitch if you lie to me .
I ’m also a good writer .
And the thing is , good writers notice writing style .
If you try to plagiarize , I will be able to tell .
And , I will give you hell for it and I will report you and you will be sorry because I will make you re-write the paper and take an ethics course to boot .
I ’m not actually all that good at keeping my mouth shut .
Please do n’t tell the other faculty what I say , unless it ’s good and about them ; or it ’s something you learned that you thought was really neat that also does not clash with their theoretical viewpoint , because they ’re sensitive about that .
Please do n’t get offended by my jokes .
See , they ’re funny , only , as it turns out , not to conservative Christians , most Republicans , and ultra feminists .
If I ’m late for a meeting and rushing out of my office , or if I ’m trying to eat lunch in between classes , or if I ’m out with friends on a Friday night , I might not be all that keen to answer questions about the upcoming midterm .
I might be grouchy .
Just so you know .
This here ’s for the boys .
If you ’re flunking my class , do n’t make sly little suggestions about what you might to do earn an A .
You ’re flunking my class .
Why would I think your performance would be better in any other areas ?
Incompletes are for students who , for legitimate , documented reasons , could n't finish the class .
If you do n't like your grade , you can't take an incomplete .
I will do my best to give the first midterm before the drop deadline , and all other midterms before rather than after holidays .
If you take the midterm and do badly , and then do n't drop the class , and then come back 3 months later and try to play it like you were never in my class and you want me to sign a petition , I wo n't .
If you ask me to sign the petition before the drop deadline , I will happily .
If the administration gives you shit about it , I 'll cause a ruckus .
If I see you out on the town on a weekend night and you want to buy me a drink , you ca n’t currently be in my classes or ever take any of my classes again .
Ever .
Then maybe you can buy me a drink .
Allright probably .
Okay .
If you ’re out on the town drunk and want to yell at me about your grade , then please do n’t ever take any of my classes again .
If I set up extra office hours to tutor you , and you do n’t show up , I will secretly hate you .
Also , I will refuse to set up any other office hours outside of regularly scheduled ones .
Oh , and any subsequent emails from me will be cryptic and I ’ll wait an extra day to respond .
Just because I seem cool does n’t mean my tests are easy .
I tell you all the first day the classes are hard .
Here , I am not lying .
Believe me .
Reading all the material and going to class does not guarantee you an A unless you ’re super - duper smart .
You actually have to study too .
At the beginning of the term , when I say , “ I wo n’t hand you a grade , but I ’ll help you work to get the grade you want , ” that does n’t mean that if you flunked all the midterms and you show up the day before the final I can do anything other than feel bad and tell you to get a good night ’s sleep .
When you tell me , “ I ’m getting kicked out of college because of the grade I got in your class , ” this makes me feel bad , but it also makes me wonder if this is the first bad grade you ’ve gotten in college , and what kind of slave driver is supporting you that would cut you off for one bad grade .
When you come to office hours week after week because you ’re worried about your grade , and you use all the study suggestions that I tell you to , and I really honestly believe that you ’re trying hard but you ’re still getting a bad grade , I will wish I had the guts to gently tell you that not everyone is meant for college , but I wo n’t .
I will feel bad instead and continue to tutor you .
When you ask a stupid question in class I will not repeat the most horrible thing I ever did to a student the first year I was teaching , which was to laugh at a question .
However , I do reserve the right to later tell my friends and to laugh then .
Sorry , but sometimes I just have to .
Your name and any identifying information will not be used .
Please ask all the questions you want to in class .
Really .
I learn from my mistakes .
If I see anyone so much as roll an eye , I will pull them aside after class and tell them that ’s inappropriate .
I ’m kind of a talker .
I like to tell stories .
Please , if you figure this out , do not use it to postpone lecture , and hence , the amount of material you will be responsible for .
Please vote .
And when you do , consider what cuts in educational funding do to your tuition .
They are not unrelated .
If you work for me on a project , and you do a good job , I will write you a kick - ass letter of recommendation .
If you work for me and do a lousy job , I will writer a letter that , while not direct , will let the program you are applying for know what kind of a student you are , and I will show you this letter before I send it because I will feel guilty .
Remember that things like , “ She was often on time , ” or , “ From my conversations with him , it is clear that he very much wants to go to graduate school , ” are not really compliments .
And , please , if you like my class , if you feel that it changed the way you think , if you learned a lot , if you were challenged , please tell me .
In this age of limited resources and time , that ’s what keeps me going .
I love teaching , and I ’m clearly not in it for the money .
All this above is just my bitch - session to get it out of my system before school starts .
Almost always , I only hear from people who are angry at me .
Tell me if you got something out of my class .
I really really need it sometimes .
Actually , the last item goes for all your teachers .
Back in the day , when computer graphics ranged between non-existent and lousy and system specs called for RAM amounts usually less than 256k , and floppy disks were still ... floppy , games that relied mostly upon the user 's imagination provided the biggest bang for their software buck .
Instead of the up , down , left , right , B , A , etc. , it was all about typing in verbose commands like Look , Take , Get , Kill , and so on .
However , where these games lacked in the graphics and gameplay perspective ( at least from the modern perspective ) , there 's one thing that they often got right - simulating the mindset of the jerkwad dungeon master .
First , consider the " classic " Zork II .
I 'm sure that I 'll catch hell in the comments , but I absolutely hate this game .
Now , I do n't have a problem with the storyline or lack of graphics , no , I hate Zork II because it 's the type of sadistic game that sets you up to fail .
Basically , you could get to one point in the game , unable to proceed because you do n't have a certain item ... and you can't go back unless you have an old game save .
Activision got what they deserved for buying Infocom .
Well , from what I can tell , there 's this Orb , and the idea of the game is to " quest " for it .
Awesome !
Eager to learn more about this gem , the best I could do was find an ancient comment on Slashdot confirming its existence .
FTA :
" Theus , a level twenty - Raver , finds himself cornered by two fierce Chimera during his exploration of level ten .
With lighting quick dexterity he makes five mighty swings with his Vorpal Blade , slaying both attackers .
He considers himself lucky - not only that he has survived , but he is able to remove the Chimeras ' Mithril Cloak . "
IF I were a " level twenty Raver " I would n't be crawling around in any dungeon - I 'd be partying ...all...night...long .
Ok , so if I reach " Grand Master " status in the CompuServe Adventure Tournament , and the big prize is 2 whole hours of free access ?
Is n't that like 12 bucks or something ?
How much time will I end up burning to get said status ?
Personally , I 'd say " no thanks " , but considering the popularity of modern MMORPG sites , I 'd guess that this promotion was hot like lava at the time .
Not long ago , Washington state 's Department of Ecology was making noises about not letting people wash their cars at home because " what goes on the street goes into the creek . "
Now the state is on the opposing side of Seattle 's efforts not to let harmful chemicals wash into the freshwater streams feeding into Puget Sound .
Seattle is not using salt to clear the roads because it does n't want the salt flowing into waterways .
As well , the city 's snow plows have rubber - edge blades that can clear snow , but can't get the ice off the road .
Seattle 's DOT cheif says the city is trying to " create a hard - packed surface " of snow .
It will then lay sand down over the hardpack in order to offer enough traction to cars , and employ a soy - based de-icer only good for temps below 32 degrees .
The hitch : only 4 - wheel - drive and front - wheel - drive cars with chains have any traction .
That means that even the police can't drive on many roads .
If the police make a call to a location on a hill , they park at the bottom and walk up the hill .
As well , the police are having to respond to literally hundreds of collisions and disabled vehicles
The state DOT has taken a much different tack : it is using sand , salt , metal - edged plows , and chemical de-icer in its battle with the elements .
Seattle is now experimenting with a " silver bullet " concoction that is saltwater from a cheese factory , calcium chloride , and de-sugared molasses .

Politics - Federal Rae Withdraws , Ignatieff is Liberal Leader By Ryan McGreal
Published December 09 , 2008
Michael Ignatieff will be the new leader of the Liberal Party of Canada .
The stars all aligned behind Michael Ignatieff 's steamroller bid to take leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada before the new Parliamentary session opens on January 26 .
The Liberals , including outgoing lame duck Stéphane Dion , agreed on the need to replace their leader before the new Parliamentary session opens on January 26 , and Michael Ignatieff was a shoo - in once Dominic LeBlanc dropped out and backed him .
Bob Rae , the other high - profile candidate to lead the Liberals , agreed with the need to fast - track the process but until today contested its narrowness , saying such an important vote should go out to all Liberal members , not just the party caucus .
Yet given the clear majority support for Ignatieff in the party caucus , it 's hard not to conclude that Rae 's real grievance was that he could n't win this way .
In any case , Rae has conceded his leadership bid , presumably deciding that the beleagured Party 's need for solidarity trumped his desire to protract the leadership selection process .
The unfortunate fact is that Bob Rae would be disastrous as leader of the federal Liberals .
He simply cannot escape the legacy with which he is saddled in the public consciousness .
Millions of voters loathe Bob Rae and would rather stay home than vote for a Liberal candidate while he is the party leader .
It would be like the recent election - but even worse .
This is particularly unfortunate because Rae has a much better political track record than most people think and would otherwise make an excellent leader of a centre - left progressive party that could actually win a majority in the House of Commons and form a relatively stable new government .
Rae 's Hijacked Legacy
I 've written before that Bob Rae would make a great Liberal Leader .
He 's a smart , pragmatic ( some would say ruthless ) centre - left coalition builder with a long history of working the Parliamentary system to his advantage .
It was Rae who pulled the plug on Prime Minister Joe Clark 's ill - fated Progressive Conservative government of 1979 when , as the NDP 's finance critic , he attached a no -confidence rider to Clark 's budget bill .
It was also Rae who finally finally broke the uninterrupted 42 - year run of Progressive Conservative governments in Ontario .
After the PC Party won the 1985 Provincial election with a minority , Rae and Liberal leader David Peterson agreed to a two - year Liberal - NDP Accord that promptly defeated the newly - elected PC government in a motion of no confidence and formed a shared government with a more progressive agenda than the Liberals would have had themselves .
When the NDP narrowly won the 1990 election , they inherited an economy sliding rapidly into the worst recession in decades and managed to alienate nearly the entire province as they abandoned campaign promises , ran huge deficits to respond to the recession , tripped on a series of gaffes and minor scandals , and finally lost their own base as they struggled to regain control over provincial finances in their last two years .
Big business and the corporate media always despised the NDP , and their expensive but underwhelming stimulus spending , coupled with Rae 's " social contract " and the hated " Rae days " for public sector workers , pissed off nearly everyone else .
Proving that a good compromise leaves everyone mad , they went down in ignominous defeat in 1995 to the Conservative Party 's faux - populist " Common Sense Revolution " .
Big -Tent Progressive or Partisan Liberal ?
Rae left provincial politics in 1996 and gradually completed his transition from a left - wing firebrand to a centre - left " middle way " liberal .
It was only a matter of time until he joined the federal Liberal Party , and in 2006 he announced that he wanted to unite the centre - left federal parties under a progressive banner to appeal to a majority of Canadians .
So it 's no surprise that Rae embraced the recent federal Liberal - NDP coalition and is its most vocal promoter during Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's seven - week snooze button on democracy .
Yet the coalition is unlikely to survive Ignatieff 's ascension to the leadership of the Liberals .
On the advice of his handlers , he has kept his distance from the coalition .
More recently , he has made noises to indicate that the Liberals will not vote to topple Harper 's government in January as long as the budget includes significant concessions to the Opposition .
Instead , we can expect the Liberals to follow centrist John Manley 's advice to focus first on rebuilding the party , filling its campaign coffers , modernizing its structure and preparing a new election program " just in case it is needed " so the Liberals can campaign and win on their own terms without the help of the NDP .
This may be better for the Liberal Party as such , but it will almost certainly lead to another government formed from a party with a minority of seats and further instability from a fractured House of Commons - particularly since Ignatieff represents the more centrist , cautious , Red Tory wing of the Liberal Party .
A Liberal - NDP coalition running as such in an election may well have a better chance of winning a majority - of the popular vote as well as seats in the House of Commons - and a strong mandate to form a progressive government that reflects the values of most Canadians .

When biologist Roland Anderson of the Seattle Aquarium pulled back the tank 's lid , I was n't sure whether it was to let me get a look at Steve or to let Steve get a look at me .
Clearly , Steve was looking — his big hooded eye followed me , and a single five - foot - long arm reached out to the hand I held above the water 's surface .
The arm inched up past my wrist to my shoulder , its suckers momentarily attaching and releasing like cold kisses .
I could n't help feeling as if I was being tasted , and I was , by tens of thousands of chemoreceptors .
And I could n't help feeling as if I were being studied , that a measuring intelligence lay behind that intent eye and exploring arm .
Finally , when the arm 's fingerlike tip reached my neck , it shot back like a snapped rubber band .
Steve curled into a tight , defensive ball in the corner of the tank .
His skin texture changed from glassy smooth to a fissured moonscape ; his color changed from mottled brown to livid red — which seemed to signal anger — and he squinted at me .
Had something alarmed or offended him ?
Perhaps we were both a great mystery to each other .
Three - year - old Pandora , a giant Pacific octopus at the Seattle Aquarium , weighs about 45 pounds .
Each of her eight arms is about five feet long and lined with 200 suckers , which she uses not only to feel but to taste .
" This octopus prefers native littleneck clams to Manila clams [ a variety that was introduced into Puget Sound ] , " says Roland Anderson , a biologist at the aquarium .
An octopus also has sharp eyesight .
Octopuses and their cephalopod cousins the cuttlefish and the squid are evolutionary oxymorons : big - brained invertebrates that display many cognitive , behavioral , and affective traits once considered exclusive to the higher vertebrates .
They challenge the deep - seated notion that intelligence advanced from fish and amphibians to reptiles , birds , mammals , early primates , and finally humans .
These are mollusks , after all — cousins to brainless clams and oysters , passive filter feeders that get along just fine , thank you , with a few ganglia for central nervous systems .
Genetic studies show that mollusk ancestors split from the vertebrates around 1.2 billion years ago , making humans at least as closely related to shrimps , starfish , and earthworms as to octopuses .
And so questions loom :
How could asocial invertebrates with short life spans develop signs of intelligence ?
And why ?
Although biologists are just beginning to probe these questions , those who observe the creatures in their natural haunts have long extolled their intelligence .
" Mischief and craft are plainly seen to be the characteristics of this creature , " the Roman natural historian Claudius Aelianus wrote at the turn of the third century A.D. Today 's divers marvel at the elaborate trails the eight - leggers follow along the seafloor , and at their irrepressible curiosity : Instead of fleeing , some octopuses examine divers the way Steve checked me out , tugging at their masks and air regulators .
Researchers and aquarium attendants tell tales of octopuses that have tormented and outwitted them .
Some captive octopuses lie in ambush and spit in their keepers ' faces .
Others dismantle pumps and block drains , causing costly floods , or flex their arms in order to pop locked lids .
Some have been caught sneaking from their tanks at night into other exhibits , gobbling up fish , then sneaking back to their tanks , damp trails along walls and floors giving them away .
That Steve was named Steve was also revealing : Octopuses are the only animals , other than mammals like cuddly seals , that aquarium workers bother to name .
So Anderson , Seattle 's lead invertebrate biologist , began to wonder :
If keepers recognize octopuses as individuals , how much difference is there among individual octopuses ?
Might these bizarre - looking mollusks have personalities ?
And if so , how else might their evolution have converged with ours across a billion - year chasm ?
Meanwhile , in the waters off Bermuda , Canadian comparative psychologist Jennifer Mather was asking similar questions .
Mather had observed an Octopus vulgaris , the common Atlantic octopus , catch several crabs and return to its rock den to eat them .
Afterward it emerged , gathered four stones , propped these at the den entrance and , thus shielded , took a safe siesta .
The strategy suggested qualities that were n't supposed to occur in the lower orders : foresight , planning , perhaps even tool use .
When Mather and Anderson met at a conference , they discovered they had stumbled onto similar phenomena and began collaborating .
Other scientists had already tested the ability of octopuses to solve mazes , learn cues , and remember solutions .
They had found that octopuses solve readily , learn quickly and , in the short term , remember what they have learned .
Mather and Anderson delved deeper , documenting a range of qualities and activities closely associated with intelligence but previously known only in advanced vertebrates .
Some of their work has been controversial , and some of their conclusions have been disputed .
But other researchers are now confirming their key points and logging even more startling findings .
Anatomy confirms what behavior reveals : Octopuses and cuttlefish have larger brains , relative to body weight , than most fish and reptiles , larger on average than any animals save birds and mammals .
Although an octopus brain differs from a typical vertebrate 's brain — it wraps around the esophagus instead of resting in a cranium — it also shares key features such as folded lobes , a hallmark of complexity , and distinct visual and tactile memory centers .
It even generates similar electrical patterns .
Electroencephalograms of other invertebrates show spiky static — " like bacon frying , " says neurophysiologist Ted Bullock of the University of California at San Diego , who nonetheless found vertebratelike slow waves in octopuses and cuttlefish .
The pattern , he says , is " similar to but weaker than that of a dog , a dolphin , a human . "
Researchers at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research in Austria recently found one more telling indicator : Octopuses , which rely on monocular vision , favor one eye over the other .
Such lateralization , corresponding to our right - and left - handedness , suggests specialization in the brain 's hemispheres , which is believed to improve its efficiency and which was first considered an exclusively human , then an exclusively vertebrate , attribute .
The mystery deepens .
According to the social theory of intelligence articulated by N. K. Humphrey and Jane Goodall , complex brains blossom in complex social settings ; chimps and dolphins have to be smart to read the intentions of other chimps and dolphins .
Moreover , such smarts arise in long - lived animals : Extended childhoods and parental instruction enable them to learn , and longevity justifies the investment in big brains .
But many cephalopods live less than a year , and the giant Pacific octopus , which has one of the longest documented life spans , survives for only four years .
Their social lives are simple to nonexistent : Squid form schools , but they do n't seem to establish individual relationships .
Cuttlefish gather while young and later on to mate , but they do n't form social structures .
Octopuses are solitary ; they breed once , then waste away and die .
Females tend their eggs , but the tiny hatchlings are on their own .
As cephalopod - respiration expert Ron O'Dor of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia wonders , " Why would you bother to get so smart when you 're so short - lived ? "
For Jennifer Mather , pursuing those questions marks a convergence of childhood and adult passions .
Mather grew up in Victoria , British Columbia , along a biologically rich shoreline .
" I got fascinated with intertidal life , " she recalls .
" I always thought I 'd study mollusks . "
In college , she took an animal - behavior class and had an epiphany : " Most people in comparative psychology compare humans and other primates , " she observes , which leaves the field wide open for studies of mollusk behavior and cognition .
" And if you talk about mollusk behavior , you 're talking about cephalopods . "
Mather landed in an unlikely spot for marine research : at the University of Lethbridge in landlocked Alberta , which has n't had any cephalopods since the Devonian Period .
But in the 1980s academic jobs were scarce .
Mather then found a lab with Anderson in Seattle and a field base near a secluded coral reef off Bonaire , an island in the Netherlands Antilles .
There she leads an international investigation of communication and interactions among Caribbean reef squid — the first long - term study of a wild cephalopod population .
Open Sesame - Billye , a giant Pacific octopus , has a brain the size of a walnut .
But she can solve puzzles she would never encounter in the wild , such as opening a glass jar to remove the fish inside .
At right , ( 1 ) Billye is offered the jar .
( 2 ) She grasps the jar and , in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , manipulates it into position and twists .
( 5 ) The top is released .
Biologist Roland Anderson says he was not surprised that Billye could perform such a complex task .
" Back in the ' 50s , " he says , " Jacques Cousteau found that octopuses could open a corked bottle .
He would put the cork in the bottle with a little hole in the top , and the octopus would reach inside and remove the cork . "
In Seattle , Mather and Anderson have pursued octopuses .
Perhaps their most startling and controversial finding is that individuals show distinct personality traits , the first ever measured in an invertebrate .
They found that octopuses confronted with the same threat alerts and food stimuli react in different ways .
One might flee , but another might fight or show curiosity .
That sets them apart from other invertebrates , says Shelley Adamo , a psychologist at Dalhousie who has studied both cephalopods and insects .
For example , individual crickets may behave differently at different times — singing today and silent tomorrow .
But they do n't have consistent patterns that set one cricket apart from another .
Personality can be a controversial word .
Some behavioralists call such labels anthropomorphic , while others contend that it 's anthropocentric to presume other animals cannot have personalities .
Some of Mather and Anderson 's peers feel more comfortable with the findings than the terminology .
" They do good work and ask interesting questions , " says cephalopod researcher John Cigliano of Cedar Crest College in Allentown , Pennsylvania .
" But I 'm not entirely convinced .
It 's a tricky business just coming up with a definition of personality . "
David Sinn , a graduate student at Portland State University , followed up Mather and Anderson 's personality work with a more extensive study that they coauthored .
That study avoided the " p " word , charting the emergence of key " temperamental traits " in 73 lab - bred California octopuses .
It found considerable temperamental variation and distinct developmental stages .
Like mammals , Sinn 's octopuses were more active and aggressive when young and grew more alert to danger as they matured — evidence that their behavior was learned .
Previous researchers tested octopuses in artificial mazes ; Mather and Anderson found ways to observe learning and cognition in more natural circumstances .
They charted the efficiency and flexibility with which giant Pacific octopuses switch strategies to open different shellfish — smashing thin mussels , prying open clams , drilling tougher - shelled clams with their rasplike radulae .
When served clams sealed with steel wire , for example , octopuses deftly switched from prying to drilling .
Tool use was once commonly invoked as uniquely human .
Scientists know better now , but they still cite it as evidence of distinguishing intelligence in chimpanzees , elephants , and crows .
Mather describes several ways octopuses use their water jets as tools : to clean their dens , push away rocks and other debris , and drive off pesky scavenger fish .
In 1999 she and Anderson published an even more sensational claim : that octopuses engage in play , the deliberate , repeated , outwardly useless activity through which smarter animals explore their world and refine their skills .
Amateur aquarists were the first to suspect that octopuses played .
While still in high school , James Wood , now a marine biologist at the University of Texas 's marine lab in Galveston , watched his pet octopus grab , submerge , and release her tank 's floating hydrometer as if she were a toddler with a bath toy .
She also spread her mantle and " bubble surfed " the tank 's aerator jets .
Anderson tested for play by presenting eight giant Pacific octopuses with floating pill bottles in varying colors and textures twice a day for five days .
Six octopuses examined the bottles and lost interest , but two blew them repeatedly into their tanks ' jets .
One propelled a bottle at an angle so it circled the tank ; the other shot it so it rebounded quickly — and on three occasions shot it back at least 20 times , as if it were bouncing a ball .
One respected cephalopod expert is n't convinced .
Jean Boal , an animal behaviorist at Millersville University in Pennsylvania , is acutely aware of the dangers of getting carried away when studying these charismatic megamollusks .
She previously worked at the Zoological Station in Naples , a wellspring of cephalopod research .
In 1992 Graziano Fiorito , a researcher at that lab , announced a bombshell : Octopuses could learn by watching other octopuses .
Such observational learning , a hallmark of intelligent social animals , seemed impossible .
And it probably was .
Other researchers , including Boal , have been unable to reproduce Fiorito 's results .
Some questioned his methodology , and for a year or two the controversy cast a pall on research into octopus learning .
Boal subsequently withdrew her own initial findings of complex learning by octopuses .
She has since carved herself a niche as the field 's designated skeptic , often questioning conclusions and urging more rigor .
" My bias is to build a case slowly , with careful science , " Boal says quietly .
" That 's not the case with all cephalopod biologists . "
She does n't rule out the possibility that octopuses play , but she questions whether the bottle - jetters did : " It could reflect boredom , like a cat pacing . "
One authority on play behavior , psychologist Gordon Burghardt at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville , says that as Anderson and Mather describe it , the bottle - jetting would qualify as play .
Boredom , he says , can be " a trigger for play . "
And other confirmation is emerging .
Doubting the Seattle findings , Ulrike Griebel of the Lorenz Institute recently conducted more extensive trials .
She offered common octopuses varied objects , from Lego assemblies to floating bottles on strings ( a favorite ) .
Some octopuses took toys into their nests and toted them along while fetching food — acquisitive behavior that Griebel says " might be an early stage of object play . "
Meanwhile , Anderson has been investigating another phenomenon little - noted in invertebrates : sleep .
Until recently , only vertebrates were believed to sleep in the full metabolic sense .
But Anderson has observed that octopuses , ordinarily hypervigilant , may sleep deeply .
Their eyes glaze over , their breathing turns slow and shallow , they do n't respond to light taps , and a male will let his delicate ligula — the sex organ at the tip of one arm — dangle perilously .
Stephen Duntley , a sleep specialist at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis , has videotaped similar slumber in cuttlefish , with a twist :
Sleeping cuttlefish lie still , their skin a dull brown , for 10 - to 15 - minute stretches , then flash bold colored patterns and twitch their tentacles for briefer intervals .
After viewing Duntley 's footage , Anderson suggests the cuttlefish might merely be waking to check for threats .
But Duntley says the cycling resembles the rapid eye movement sleep of birds and mammals , when humans dream .
If invertebrates undergo a similar cycle , Duntley argues , it would affirm " that REM sleep is very important to learning . "
Would it also suggest that cuttlefish and octopuses dream ?
" That 's the ultimate question , " Duntley responds .
The ultimate question , with octopuses as with other sentient creatures , may be how we should treat them .
In 2001 Mather argued in The Journal of Applied Welfare Science that people should err on the humane side , since some octopuses " very likely have the capacity for pain and suffering and , perhaps , mental suffering . "
If captive cephalopods suffer mentally — or even get " bored , " as Boal puts it — then they should benefit from enrichment : amenities and activities that replicate elements of their natural environment .
Mather , Anderson , and Wood have urged enriched environments but have no experimental evidence that it makes a difference .
Recently that evidence came from a French study that even the skeptical Boal calls " beautiful work . "
Ludovic Dickel , a neuroethologist at the University of Caen , found that cuttlefish raised in groups and in tanks with sand , rocks , and plastic seaweed grew faster , learned faster , and retained more of what they learned than those raised alone in bare tanks .
Performance rose in animals transferred midway from impoverished to enriched conditions and declined in those transferred to solitary confinement .
" Octopuses can bend their arms in every direction , " says biologist Jeff Christiansen of the Seattle Aquarium .
" In order to move , they have to work muscles against themselves because they lack bones for the muscles to pull on . "
Other evidence suggests that solitary octopuses , like solitary orangutans , may communicate more with others of their species than researchers previously realized .
Cigliano found that California octopuses that were kept together quickly established hierarchies and avoided wasteful , dangerous confrontations ; the weaker animals seemed to recognize and yield to the stronger ones , even when the latter were hidden in their dens .
The flip side of communication is deception , another hallmark of intelligence .
And some octopuses and cuttlefish practice it .
Male cuttlefish adopt female coloring , patterns , and shape — to mate surreptitiously with females guarded by larger rivals .
And the Indonesian mimic octopus fools predators by impersonating poisonous soles and venomous lionfish , sea snakes , and possibly jellyfish and sea anemones .
And so , piece by piece , Mather , Anderson , and other researchers fill in the puzzle .
A picture emerges of convergent evolution across a billion - year gap .
One after another , these precocious invertebrates display what were supposed to be special traits of advanced vertebrates .
But one question nags :
Why would short - lived , solitary creatures acquire so many of the cognitive and affective features of long - lived , social vertebrates ?
Mather proposes " a foraging theory of intelligence . "
She says that animals like octopuses ( or humans ) that pursue varied food sources in changeable , perilous habitats must develop a wide range of hunting and defensive strategies .
That takes brainpower .
" If you find yourself foraging in a complex environment , where you have to deal with many kinds of prey and predators , " she says , " it makes sense to invest more in cognition . "
Temperamental variation — call it personality — also helps a species survive in a volatile , supercompetitive milieu by ensuring that different individuals respond differently to changing conditions , so some will thrive .
Even semelparity , the live - fast - die - young strategy of growing quickly and throwing everything into one breeding blast , may serve that end by assuring rapid turnover and regeneration .
Although cephalopods are an ancient order , shell - less cephalopods are relatively recent arrivals — about 200 million years old , like mammals and teleost , or bony , fishes .
Before that , ammonites and other shelled cephalopods ruled the seas , but competition from the nimble , fast - swimming teleosts wiped out all but the relic nautilus .
The cephalopods that survived were the zoological counterrevolutionaries that turned the vertebrates ' weapons against them .
They shed their shells and became speedy , like squid , or they became clever and elusive , like octopuses and cuttlefish .
Octopuses , naked and vulnerable , took to dens , as early humans took to caves .
Like humans , they became versatile foragers , using a wide repertoire of stalking and killing techniques .
To avoid exposure , they developed spatial sense and learned to cover their hunting grounds methodically and efficiently .
Mather and O'Dor found that the Bermudan O. vulgaris spends just 7 percent of its time hunting ; Australian giant cuttlefish spend 3 percent .
In short , octopuses came to resemble us .
Their hunting done , they huddle safely in their dens , a bit like early humans around campfires .
" You have to wonder what they think about while they 're tucked away , " says O'Dor .
Do they muse on the cruel turns of evolution , which have left them all dressed up with big brains but with no place to go and little time to use them ?

The real junk is inside National Geographic
Tomorrow evening , the National Geographic Channel is going to hit cable viewers with a huge dose of drug propaganda cloaked as investigative reporting in a three - part special that will look at Heroin , Meth and Marijuana .
I have to admit , I had high hopes for it as I went to check out the preview .
With anti-drug crusaders like Joe Biden recently admitting that the War on Drugs is not living up to its promises , maybe America ’s anti-drug tide has finally started turning into a drug - embracing rush .
Will I be so lucky ?
Meth being my personal favorite , I watched this episode first .
The preview started off all right , pointing out exactly what makes meth so damn enjoyable , confirming that it is much more effective than cocaine ( a drug long considered by The eXiled as “ fool ’s meth ” ) .
But when the preview started talking about addiction and prevention , it became clear that this was just another run -of - the - mill anti-drug crusade video series , a more CGI - intesive version of what I was forced to watch in my high school Health Education class .
It was not just sad , it was infuriating .
The prohibition of drugs is one of the most blatant assaults on our liberties , and yet no one is speaking up for drug - users ’ rights .
Illegal immigrants are getting rights , gays are on the cusp of being allowed to marry and , the way things are going , Mormons will push through the legalization of polygamy before we get around to talking about drugs .
Drug hate is so entrenched in our society and political system , it ’s hard to know where to start hacking away at it .
So let me start with a quote by H.L. Mencken , the only American consistent in his hate for the Puritan values that are to blame for our ridiculous drug laws :
“ [ The ] democratic state … almost always shows a strong tendency to be also a Puritan state .
Puritan legislation , especially in the field of law , is a thing of many grandiose pretensions …
The Puritan , discussing it voluptuously , always tries to convenience himself ( and the rest of us ) that it is grounded upon altruistic and evangelical motives — that its aim is to work the other fellow ’s benefit against the other fellow ’s will .
Such is the theory behind Prohibition , comstockery , vice crusading and all its other familiar devices of oppression .
That theory , of course is , false .
The Puritan ’s actual motives are ( a ) to punish the other fellow for having a better time in the world , and ( b ) to bring the other fellow down to to his own unhappy level .
And bring the other fellow down they do .
As the preview for the National Geographic ’s heroin segment gratuitously shows , amid a lot of painful footage of crusty track mark close - ups , hardcore junkies live in squalor and misery .
Getting their next fix is the sole purpose of their lives .
They do anything for it .
Women give blowjobs to truck drivers , men strip copper pipes and rob houses .
All this is true .
But their alleged fall from grace is not a function of their addiction .
A lot of people are able to fit their addictions into their daily routine , or better yet , to handle their highs .
The reason they descend into hell is the fact that they are addicted to an illegal drug .
Take functional alcoholics .
You do n’t see too many of them giving handjobs for booze or stealing TVs to buy another 40 oz .
Alcohol is too cheap and easy to get to cause that kind of behavior .
You can be drunk all day for five dollars and get booze refills while you put some gas into your car .
That kind of carefree addiction leaves plenty of time for work , wife and kids .
But make booze illegal , expensive and difficult to get and you ’ll turn most Americans into sniveling , pathetic junkies roaming the streets in search of booze and spending all their time and money on it .
Hardcore alcoholics would never be able to hold their shit together .
So why should the heroin addicts ?
The Europeans are starting to figure this shit out .
The Swiss just announced they are going to give smack out to addicts for free .
FOR FREE !
Why ?
Because the drugs are not an addict ’s main problem .
The hard knock reality of the illicit drug market are to blame for their sorry state .
Here ’s a quote from an Independent article about the program :
The addicts attend one of the country ’s 23 heroin centers and , in groups of four , inject themselves under the watchful eye of a nurse .
They leave after a few minutes — those with jobs going back to work .
Did they just say , “ work ” ?
Junkies going to work ?
Yep .
It just goes to show that when you free a junkie from having to constantly scheme about where and how they ’ll get the cash for their next fix , a miracle occurs .
All of a sudden , they turn into upstanding citizens .
Like hundreds of millions of functional alcoholics all around the world , they go to work , pay taxes and raise families .
Some may even do a little volunteering at the local church .
Make drugs free , and everyone lives in harmony .
This setup should also please the anti-drug crusaders .
During the trial stage of the Swiss smack soup kitchen program , a third of the people who signed up — all of them hardcore junkies with more than a decade of addiction — got off the drug .
They realized that heroin was boring the shit out of them .
After being high for ten years straight , how could it not ?
Clarity on drugs !
A little legalization goes a long way .
We just need to go further .
All drugs must be legalized immediately .
Here is the preview to National Geographic ’s drug - hating special :

Timidity Does Not Convince
The only arguments that hold water , in terms of programming language suitability , are bold , finished projects .
Not a mini-Emacs written in Haskell .
Not a Sudoku solver in Prolog .
Not a rewrite of some 1970s video game using Functional Reactive Programming .
They need to be large and daring projects , where the finished product is impressive in its own right , and then when you discover it was written in language X , there 's a wave of disbelief and then a new reverence for a toolset you had previously dismissed .
And now , two of my favorite bold projects :
Wings 3D
Wings started as an attempt to clone Nendo , a 3D modeller designed around simplicity and ease of use .
Nendo development and support had dried - up , and enthusiasm for Nendo fueled Wings 3D development .
So now there 's a full - featured , mature 3D modeller , with a great focus on usability , and it 's written entirely in Erlang .
Without a doubt it 's the antithesis of what Erlang was designed for , with the entire program running as a single process and intensive use of floating point math .
But it clearly works , and shows that there are benefits to using Erlang even outside of its niche of concurrency - oriented programming .
SunDog : Frozen Legacy
SunDog was an elaborate game for the Apple II .
A 1MHz 6502 and 48 K of memory look more like a platform for simple arcade games , not the space trading and exploration extravaganza that was SunDog .
And though assembly language was the norm for circa -1984 commercial games , the authors -- Bruce Webster and Wayne Holder - - chose to implement the majority of the game in p-code interpreted Pascal .
I found a justification in an old email from Bruce :
Wayne and I had some long discussions about what to use to write SunDog ( which actually started out being another game ) .
We considered assembly , FORTH , and Pascal ; BASIC was far too slow and clumsy for what we wanted to do .
We ended up ruling out FORTH for issues of maintenance ( ours and lack of a commercial vendor ) .
I pushed for -- and we decided on -- Apple Pascal for a few different reasons , including the language itself ; the compactness of the p-code ; and the automatic ( but configurable ) memory management of the p-System , which could swap " units " ( read : modules ) in and out .
Pascal made the large project easier , not harder , though it was a struggle to keep the game within 48KB .
And that 's how it should be : choose the language that lets you implement your vision .

There is one type of interview question I see pretty frequently that drives me absolutely bonkers .
I ’ve never actually been given this queston myself , but I ’ve worked at a lot of companies that like to ask it ( I ’ve been lucky ) .
Just recently , a friend of mine who has been interviewing mentioned some of the questions he was given ; one of them fit this description and all I could do was feel bad for the poor guy .
There ’s no way he answered it correctly , despite being a very capable software engineer .
I refer to this question as the “ Career In A Bottle Question ”
The Career In A Bottle Question
Very often this question is actually given prior to an interview , as something you submit to a company after passing an initial phone screening but before they bring you in .
The question takes a form similar to the following :
Write a program that will [ anything ] .
Please write it as though it were going into production .
It ’s the second sentence that does a candidate in .
Why ?
Because there is no right way to answer the question .
More specifically , there is a right way to a single interviewer , but you have a 50/50 chance .
Allow me to elaborate by making this concrete .
Imagine the question is as follows :
Write a program that calculates what phase the moon is in for a given date ( the input ) as though your code were going to be used in production .
If I , as an interview candidate , were to see a question like this , my mind would go through the following thought process :
Well , that ’s actually a really simple algorithm .
Read a date from commandline , do a little calculation , print out the phase .
But wait , they said they want it to be like production code .
So I should probably design it in a more object - oriented modular manner than just some procedural script .
And when I write production code , I unit test it , so I should write some unit tests .
And with all that code , I ’m going to need a build file …
Jesus , this seems like overkill for a 10 line script .
It ’s the last sentence that destroys me , and many other capable programmers .
On the one hand , production code needs tests , it needs a build , it needs to be well designed , and it needs to work .
On the other hand , the problem I was given is a 10 - liner , and it seems like overengineering to do anything more .
If I write the simple script version , will the interviewer think that I write one - off production code without tests ?
If I write the full system , will the interviewer think that I overengineer everything I write and anyone who maintains my code will have to deal with an overly complex system ?
I have no way to know .
I have no idea what the interviewer ’s expectations are , so I have to guess .
I have , essentially , a 50/50 shot at guessing correctly .
To make matters worse , my answer will likely go through a number of different interviewers , and I have a 50/50 shot at having guessed correctly with each of them .
Assuming that a single “ no ” from one of the interviewers means I do n’t get a job offer , having 2 interviewers gives me a 25 % chance of success .
Three interviewers gives me a 12.5 % chance .
A team of 6 or 7 interviewers ( extremely common in up - and - coming companies ) gives me virtually no chance at all .
Generally the conversation about the interviewee ’s qualifications goes like this :
Interviewer 1 : I really liked his answer to this question .
He has a good design , good unit test coverage , and a fast build .
Interviewer 2 : Yeah but he wrote this future - proof ten - class system for a simple math function .
Why did he write code for requirements he was n't given ?
I do n't want to hire someone that 's going to spend 2 weeks writing something that should take a day .
Interviewer 1 : Yeah , I guess I can see that .
He did write an awful lot of code .
Interviewer 2 : Let 's keep looking .
You ca n’t possibly have written something to please both of these interviewers without hitting the magical , arbitrary middle - ground exactly between the two of them .
If there was a third interviewer , you ’d have virtually no chance .
What ’s Going On Here ?
Fundamentally , the reason this question is bad is that there is a mismatch between two of the constraints .
On the one hand , the interviewer is told to code as though it were something he were assigned at work , but at the same time a programmer would never get such a simplistic task .
Interviews are tricky , because you ca n’t tell your candidate to reinvent your product for you in the interview .
Questions need to be simplified to make the interview process manageable , but once something becomes simplified it leaves the realm of something you ’d actually have to write in production .
As a result , there is no way to word a question like this without making it conflict with itself .
Essentially , this question breaks down because it ’s testing too many of the candidate ’s skills simultaneously .
What the interviewer wants to know here is :
How are the candidate ’s algorithmic skills ?
How are the candidate ’s design skills ?
How are the candidate ’s testing skills ?
How are the candidate ’s Java / Ruby / C# / Whatever skills ?
Occasionally , these questions are worded in a way to also test a candidates familiarity with a framework as well , such as an additional constraint of “ Use Spring ” or something of that nature .
The problem is that you ca n’t get the answer to all of these questions while keeping the questions manageable in scope and size .
Good design skills mean a high degree of modularity and encapsulation , but testing modular code means writing more tests than is appropriate for an interview .
Good algorithm skills mean writing simple procedures that perform a task , but simple procedures do not lend themselves to the scope that give insight into a candidate ’s design skills or language knowledge .
How To Change The Question
If you ’re a company looking to hire , do n’t ask the Career In A Bottle question or you ’ll wind up passing on a number of highly qualified candidates .
The only people who will get in are the ones who just so happen to hit the magic compromise between the ideal responses of all of your team members .
It turns what should be a game of skill into a game of luck .
Instead , figure out what you ’re trying to ascertain , and ask direct , focused questions centering around those topics .
If you want to know a candidate ’s algorithm skills , ask a question fitting this template : “ Write a method that takes a [ something ] and determines [ something else ] .
Use any language you wish . ”
By saying that you only want a method , you are removing any concerns the candidate might have about your expectations regarding class design and testing .
By saying the candidate can pick any language , you are making sure they are n’t wasting mental power on remembering language specifics or APIs .
The answer you want from the candidate should be whiteboarded pseudocode , easy to read and functionally correct .
If you need to say something like “ pretend that there ’s no something - or - other method , ” feel free .
If you want to know a candidate ’s design skills , describe the requirements of a large - scale system and ask that they draw UML describing the classes in the system , how they interact , what extends what , what ’s an interface , etc .
The question should sound similar to “ Sketch the design a system that [ something ] . ”
By saying sketch , you ’re making it clear that you do n’t want any code .
You want method names , class names , and so forth .
The candidate should give you boxes , arrows , and method signatures on a whiteboard , though I would n’t be too strict about the adherence to the UML standard unless it ’s important to your company .
If you want to know a candidate ’s testing skills , then YOU should be the one drawing boxes and arrows on a whiteboard .
Sketch out a system with classes and methods and ask how the candidate would test your system .
Ask about how he or should would strive for complete test coverage on a unit test .
Ask about functional tests and integration tests that test multiple aspects of the design .
The candidate should answer this question with , in my opinion , words only .
Descriptions and methodologies , without writing anything down .
If you want to know a candidate ’s language skills , then and only then should you give an assignment .
Pre -interview assignments are n’t good at determining anything other than a candidates ability to write code in a specific language and work with the API for that language .
Asking language and API questions during an in - person interview is pointless since it tests a skill that developers do n’t need unless your company ’s internet connection dies and all of your books catch fire suddenly .
The best way to give a programming assignment is for YOU to actually provide some code .
Provide an interface and a test or a program that uses an implementation of that interface .
Ask the candidate to provide the implementation .
This way , the candidate can actually compile and run the code to make sure it does what it should ( an ability he or she would have in real life ) .
It also gives you control over what you want to make sure the candidate is familiar with .
If it ’s important to you that the candidate be familiar with the java collections library , write an interface that passes various collections around .
Weeding Out
The biggest objection someone may have to my suggestions above is probably that the purpose of the assignment is to weed out candidates before everyone has to take time out of their day to interview someone in person .
I believe that you can actually convert the information you wish to gather from a programming assignment into information you can easily gather with a phone screening .
The algorithm question can simply have the complexity of the question decreased to a point where you could describe the algorithm with words alone , over the phone .
The same goes for the design and test questions - you can make the system under discussion less complex and the questions and answers can be transmitted through speech alone .
And you can still do language / API / framework familiarity testing by giving a programming assignment following the specifications described above .
In my experience , following these suggestions may make the interview process take slightly longer than you may like , but the end result is that you severely decrease the number of false negatives .
Those qualified candidates that you are n’t hiring because of bad questions are getting jobs elsewhere , and it may be your competition .
Do n’t throw good programmers away because you ’re too impatient to ask narrowly - scoped questions .
Do n’t ask the “ Career In A Bottle ” question .
Update : Some people have pointed out that you can simply ask the interviewer what he or she is expecting from you .
While this is usually a decent workaround , I ’ve often seen the attitude taken that figuring out what “ production ready ” means is part of the question .
One particular horror story I ’m aware of from a friend has him asking the interviewer ‘ Do you want me to include tests ? ’ and having him respond ‘ Do you not normally test your production code ? ’
If you were to insist on asking a question like this , adding additional information to the description such as “ I ’m expecting unit tests and a build file ” makes it far more palatable .
I still feel that the question is fundamentally flawed because it attempts to ask too many questions simultaneously , and would be better split into a few more narrowly - focused questions .
What happened
An online poll found that 20 percent of teens had sent X - rated photos or videos of themselves to a boyfriend or girlfriend , or posted them online .
A third of young adults ages 20 to 26 said they had done it .
( USA Today )
What the commentators said
This is nothing to panic about , said Tracy Clark - Flory in Salon .
“ Sexting ” — sending nude photos by cell phone — raises legitimate concerns — especially when the images get shared with unintended viewers .
But it does n’t mean technology is turning kids into amateur porn stars .
It just shows that sexual experimentation , like everything else , has “ gone digital . ”
So , said Erin Manning in BeliefNet , it ’s OK for teens to trade X - rated photos and pornographic text messages as long as nobody gets hurt ?
Maybe if you see zero value in “ such virtues as modesty , chastity , or restraint . ”
But , even in this day and age , there are people who object to this kind of behavior on moral grounds .
Yes , and some of them are called parents , said Stacey Garfinkle in The Washington Post online .
But there are ways for moms and dads to discourage sexting , and they do n't even have to ban camera phones .
Just make sure your kids know messages and pictures they send over the Internet or on cell phones are never truly private .
And go digital along with them , monitoring their behavior and friends in cyberspace the same way you do in “ real life . ”
Foreclosure at the Mall
The recession 's latest victim might just be that shopping center down the road .
Dec. 30 , 2008  --
Forget those 50 - percent - off signs .
This winter you are likely to see a new sign at your local mall : " Going Out of Business . "
And that means big trouble for mall owners already struggling to survive .
The nation 's shopping center owners are facing a recessionary double whammy : consumers who are spending less and real estate investors who are holding back money used to finance their operations .
And some analysts say that , in the next two months , those forces will collide , sending some mall owners into bankruptcy .
Do n't expect your local mall to necessarily close its doors -- although some of the 3,500 across the country might -- but it could very likely be owned by somebody else by the spring .
" They have significant problems by and large , " said George Whalin , president and CEO of Retail Management Consultants .
In just six to eight weeks , Whalin said , " there are going to be a significant number of retailers that will go bankrupt .
There 's no doubt about that .
...
We 've just never seen anything as bad as this . "
Michael P. Niemira , chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers , said the industry has " really been battered by every part " of this recession .
First , housing stores saw problems .
Then apparel .
Now every store , including the once - immune luxury retailer .
" Clearly , there are lots of problems in the retail industry and they range from the weakness in consumer demand to the debt issues that some companies are facing , " Niemira said .
Back in August , Niemira predicted that sales would grow as much as 1.7 percent this holiday season .
Now , he estimates a decline of 1.5 percent to 2 percent .
Sales during the final week of shopping were down 1.8 percent from last year .
That makes this year " the weakest holiday season since at least 1970 , " Niemira said in a statement this morning .
He said stores are doing everything from slashing prices to laying off workers to try to stay afloat .
Retailers , he said , account for 9 percent of the nation 's jobs but represent 25 percent of the recent employment declines .
Stores Go Bankrupt
Big chains , including Linens 'N Things , Circuit City , Whitehall Jewelers , Mervyn's and Steve and Barry 's have already filed for bankruptcy .
Other big retailers , including Talbots , Fashion Bug , Ann Taylor , J. Crew and Liz Claiborne have either announced store closings or scaled back or delayed expansion plans .
Retailers may close 73,000 stores in the first half of 2009 , according to the shopping center council .
None of that is good news for mall owners who rely on those retailers for rent , which they use to pay off the massive loans to build or buy the malls in the first place .
As mall owners try to refinance existing loans , they find themselves struggling to get investors to give them money and -- like many homeowners -- they find their real estate is worth less than it was just a few years ago .
Whalin said the first major blow to malls came in August 2005 , when Macy 's bought out rival May Department Stores .
In one giant move , retailers , such as Marshall Field's , Filene 's , Hecht's , Foley 's , Robinsons - May and Kaufmann 's all fell under the Macy 's flag .
A mall that once had Macy 's anchoring one end and Filene 's at the other suddenly had two Macy's .
The company quickly moved to close its redundant stores and the malls lost large tenants .
" The value of their real estate has diminished for a variety of reasons , certainly not the least of which was Macy 's gobbling all the regional department stores and essentially closing some of those stores and struggling with others , " Whalin said .
But it 's not just big chains that are shutting their doors as we fall deeper into a recession .
At the beginning of 2006 , just 7.3 percent of retail spaces -- from malls to strip malls to stand - alone stores -- were empty , according to the National Association of Realtors .
That figure now hovers just below 10 percent and for next year , the group forecasts a 12.4 percent vacancy rate .
And after a disappointing Christmas shopping season , those numbers could climb ever higher .
The amount of money spent at the nation 's retailers from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve was down 5.5 percent to 8 percent compared with last year , according to MasterCard SpendingPulse , which tracks retail sales for all forms of payment , including check , cash and credit card .
Falling Rents
Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors , said that in the coming year he anticipates a 7 percent drop in retail rents as a larger supply of vacant stores comes on the market .
" The property owners will be competing , trying to draw the tenants by offering much lower rents , " Yun said .
" A combination of a rising vacancy rate and falling rents will naturally mean that the property prices will be coming down . "
Some big chains are already asking for leases to be renegotiated and others are likely to when their leases expire in the next year or two , Whalin added .
But that 's only half of the picture .
Most malls are owned through large real estate investment trusts or REITs .
The two biggest are Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties .
These real estate companies -- and especially General Growth -- are now being hurt by the credit crunch .
In 2004 , General Growth spent $ 12 billion to acquire mall owner Rouse .
The deal including assuming $ 5.4 billion in Rouse debt .
To pay for the deal , the company borrowed heavily .
But then the credit markets froze and now General Growth -- which owns more than 200 shopping centers -- has roughly $ 27 billion in debt and no way to refinance .
Just last week , the company got a reprieve on a debt - payment deadline .
The forbearance gives it a bit of breathing room and keeps the company out of bankruptcy , for now .
Many analysts are watching Jan. 30 and Feb. 12 -- dates when the company might be forced to make two large debt payments .
Mounting Debt
To help raise cash , General Growth -- the country 's second largest mall owner -- announced in October it would try to sell its retail properties in Las Vegas , which include the Fashion Show Mall , Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian , and the Shoppes at the Palazzo .
" I do n't see that they 're through the woods here yet , " Whalin said .
" A lot of smaller mall companies are suffering in the same way . "
Niemira said General Growth is " the poster child " for the credit troubles facing the industry .
" Those owners that took on too much debt have ultimately paid the price .
At this point it 's not clear how that will all play out , " he said , noting that " the stock prices of some of these firms have really taken a huge hit . "
Just a year ago , shares of General Growth traded at 38.73 .
They closed Monday at 1.21 -- that 's a fall of nearly 97 percent this year .
But do n't expect the malls themselves to close .
Both Whalin and Niemira said the properties are profitable ; it 's just that some mall owners have too much debt to ride out the recession .
" The regional mall is here to stay as part of the retail environment , " Whalin said .
" It is n't going to go away anytime soon . "

The federal government has been trying to persuade pregnant and breast - feeding women to limit their intake of fish because of mercury contamination .
Now some federal scientists are arguing that these women should actually increase their fish consumption .
The behind - the - scenes disagreement is fierce and raises serious questions for consumers .
The current official advice from the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency is that pregnant and nursing women and young children can safely eat up to 12 ounces  roughly two servings  of most fish a week , but should limit their intake of albacore tuna to 6 ounces a week and avoid entirely four species of fish containing high levels of mercury .
Now the two agencies are at loggerheads over the two - serving limit .
The F.D.A. has circulated a draft report suggesting that the vast majority of fetuses and infants would actually benefit if their mothers ate more than two servings of fish a week because fish contain highly beneficial nutrients that aid in brain development .
The F.D.A. ’s scientists argue that those benefits outweigh any potential harm .
Those contentions are sharply disputed by specialists at the E.P.A. who charged that the report had “ serious scientific flaws , ” relied on questionable models and should not be used as a basis for decision - making .
That is a strong indictment that must be answered before the public can place any confidence in the F.D.A. ’s judgment .
The Hawk - 10 uses specific microwave frequencies to extract oil and gas from plastics ( Image : Global Resource Corporation )
A US company is taking plastics recycling to another level – turning them back into the oil they were made from , and gas .
All that is needed , claims Global Resource Corporation ( GRC ) , is a finely tuned microwave and – hey presto !
– a mix of materials that were made from oil can be reduced back to oil and combustible gas ( and a few leftovers ) .
Key to GRC ’s process is a machine that uses 1200 different frequencies within the microwave range , which act on specific hydrocarbon materials .
As the material is zapped at the appropriate wavelength , part of the hydrocarbons that make up the plastic and rubber in the material are broken down into diesel oil and combustible gas .
Advertisement
GRC ’s machine is called the Hawk - 10 .
Its smaller incarnations look just like an industrial microwave with bits of machinery attached to it .
Larger versions resemble a concrete mixer .
“ Anything that has a hydrocarbon base will be affected by our process , ” says Jerry Meddick , director of business development at GRC , based in New Jersey .
“ We release those hydrocarbon molecules from the material and it then becomes gas and oil . ”
Whatever does not have a hydrocarbon base is left behind , minus any water it contained as this gets evaporated in the microwave .
Simplified recycling
“ Take a piece of copper wiring , ” says Meddick .
“ It is encased in plastic – a kind of hydrocarbon material .
We release all the hydrocarbons , which strips the casing off the wire . ”
Not only does the process produce fuel in the form of oil and gas , it also makes it easier to extract the copper wire for recycling .
Similarly , running 9.1 kilograms of ground - up tyres through the Hawk - 10 produces 4.54 litres of diesel oil , 1.42 cubic metres of combustible gas , 1 kg of steel and 3.40 kg of carbon black , Meddick says .
Less landfill
Gershow Recycling , a scrap metal company based in New York , US , has just said it will be the first to buy a Hawk - 10 .
Gershow collects metal products , shreds them and turns them into usable pure metals .
Most of its scrap comes from old cars , but for every ton of steel that the company recovers , between 226 kg and 318 kg of “ autofluff ” is produced .
Autofluff is the stuff that is left over after a car has been shredded and the steel extracted .
It contains plastics , rubber , wood , paper , fabrics , glass , sand , dirt , and various bits of metal .
GRC says its Hawk - 10 can extract enough oil and gas from the left - over fluff to run the Hawk - 10 itself and a number of other machines used by Gershow .
Because it makes extracting reusable metal more efficient and evaporates water from autofluff , the Hawk - 10 should also reduce the amount of end material that needs to be deposited in landfill sites .
I had to laugh when I read fellow Skeptologist Brian Dunning ’s article about the UFO True Believer ™ Stan Friedman hating him .
What an elite club !
Friedman is no fan of me , either .
A few years ago I wrote an article for Sky and Telescope magazine about UFOs , basically making the same claim I made here last week : if all these UFO sightings we hear about were real , the majority of them would be seen by amateur astronomers .
Friedman took exception to that ( shocker , I know ) .
In his internet newsletter ( subscription required ) , he said : “ Plait among other gems says about Amateur [ sic ] astronomers [ sic ]
‘ Logically , they should be reporting most of the UFOs ’.
This is logic ? ”
Um , yeah , Mr. Friedman , it is .
Maybe you should acquaint yourself with it .
Note that this is all he said , just dismissing my point without actually saying anything about it .
I know , it ’s hard to believe that someone with such stature in the UFO community would make a claim with no evidence , and dismiss a claim that does have evidence !
Mr. Friedman has company , too .
I got an email from a reader named Chris Rutkowski , who also posted his thoughts to an internet newsletter .
He does Friedman one better ( just barely ) by actually addressing my claims about amateur astronomers , but blows it when it comes to logic .
Rutkowski basically says that amateurs do in fact report UFOs , and so I am wrong .
The problem is , this does n’t show me wrong .
It misses the point entirely , which is the majority of UFO reports would be made by amateur astronomers if these were in fact alien spaceships .
I do n’t care if you can find a handful of reports from astronomers .
This shows conclusively that the majority of UFOs reported are not flying saucers , but misidentified mundane objects .
I have said this , over and over , very clearly , but the “ UFOologists ” ca n’t seem to understand it .
And then they accuse me of being closed - minded .
That part slays me .
They cannot imagine that aliens are n’t visiting us , and every light in the sky is a spaceship , and I ’m the one who has a closed mind .
Sheesh .
Rutkowski piles bad argument after bad logic , too .
He also says :
There are a few other problems with Plait ’s reasoning .
One is that amateur astronomers are n’t interested in moving lights in the sky any more than they are in identifiable aircraft .
The ones I hang out with want to do some specific imaging of nebulas and galaxies , and spend a lot of time looking through eyepieces with tiny fields of view .
Of course , many have now switched to computer - guided scopes and spend their time in warm - up rooms , often miles away from the telescope itself .
Professional astronomers are even worse in terms of observation .
Few actually DO any optical observations .
Many have n’t looked through a telescope or spent any time looking at constellations since their undergraduate days .
There ’s so much wrong in there it ’s hard to know where to start .
I can dismiss the entire argument about professional astronomers , because I never talked about them in my article .
I know most pros do n’t do much actual sky observing , so I never brought them up .
That ’s a straw man argument on Rutkowski ’s part .
And he ’s completely wrong about amateurs .
Amateurs are n’t interested in moving lights ?
What a crock !
Of course they are !
They observe satellites , and meteors , and are very interested in airplanes , to make sure they do n’t screw up any pictures they are trying to take of the night sky .
If you actually go to a star party with amateur astronomers , you do see them looking through telescopes , of course .
But they are also just looking up , using their eyes .
All amateurs do that .
I do that !
I do n’t think Rutkowski knows very many amateurs astronomers .
I know a few hundred , and have been to dozens of star parties .
If he ’d like to compare notes , I ’m all ears .
Or eyes , in this case .
I recount these two tales of woe not just to entertain you , but to show you what we as skeptics are up against .
People who want to believe are prone to ignoring contrary evidence , and may twist logic to the breaking point ( and beyond ) if it suits them .
We all do this — in fact , it ’s one reason true skeptics are even harder on themselves when they are investigating a topic they themselves wish to be true .
It ’s too easy to fall into logical traps when you have a stake in the outcome .
What Rutkowski said sounds true enough , unless you know better ( or someone who does know better tells you ) .
That ’s one part of what makes it so hard to be an activist skeptic .
We rely on reality , which means we have to play by the rules .
The same is not true for antiscientists , who are free to make up anything they want .
Antiscience is not a fair fight .
But we can not cheat ; we ’re not allowed .
All we can do is never tire , never waver , and always make sure that the evidence is on our side .
And you know what ?
It always is .
The co-founder of the company behind the Rock Band series of computer games has suggested that the programmes are helping to encourage gamers to pick up real musical instruments .
Buy an electric guitar now
Alex Rigopulos of Harmonix said in the New York Times Freaknomics blog that he has been told by numerous music instructors that they have received more pupils in recent years following the success of Rock Band and Guitar Hero .
" By giving people a taste of what lies on the other side , we 're inspiring them to invest themselves in learning the instrument for real , " he remarked .
" The game is n't a substitute , it 's a stimulus , " Mr Rigopulos added .
He was responding to suggestions that games such as Rock Band may be discouraging people from taking up instruments such as the electric guitar and drums .
Last month , Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic admitted in his Seattle Weekly column that he struggled to play the bass part for one of his band 's own songs , In Bloom , on Rock Band 2 .

Montreal , December 17 , 2008 – Here 's another argument against intelligent design .
An evolutionary geneticist from the Université de Montréal , together with researchers from the French cities of Lyon and Montpellier , have published a ground - breaking study that characterizes the common ancestor of all life on earth , LUCA ( Last Universal Common Ancestor ) .
Their findings , presented in a recent issue of Nature , show that the 3.8 - billion - year - old organism was not the creature usually imagined .
The study changes ideas of early life on Earth .
" It is generally believed that LUCA was a heat - loving or hyperthermophilic organism .
A bit like one of those weird organisms living in the hot vents along the continental ridges deep in the oceans today ( above 90 degrees Celsius ) , " says Nicolas Lartillot , the study 's co-author and a bio-informatics professor at the Université de Montréal .
" However , our data suggests that LUCA was actually sensitive to warmer temperatures and lived in a climate below 50 degrees . "
The research team compared genetic information from modern organisms to characterize the ancient ancestor of all life on earth .
" Our research is much like studying the etymology of modern languages so as to reveal fundamental things about their evolution , " says professor Lartillot .
" We identified common genetic traits between animals , plant , bacteria , and used them to create a tree of life with branches representing separate species .
These all stemmed from the same trunk – LUCA , the genetic makeup that we then further characterized . "
Reconciling conflicting data
The group 's findings are an important step towards reconciling conflicting ideas about LUCA .
In particular , they are much more compatible with the theory of an early RNA world , where early life on Earth was composed of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , rather than deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .
However , RNA is particularly sensitive to heat and is unlikely to be stable in the hot temperatures of the early Earth .
The data of Dr. Lartillot with his collaborators indicate that LUCA found a cooler micro-climate to develop , which helps resolve this paradox and shows that environmental micro domains played a critical role in the development of life on Earth .
From RNA to DNA : Proof of evolution
" It is only in a subsequent step that LUCA 's descendants discovered the more thermostable DNA molecule , which they independently acquired ( presumably from viruses ) , and used to replace the old and fragile RNA vehicle .
This invention allowed them to move away from the small cool microclimate , evolved and diversify into a variety of sophisticated organisms that could tolerate heat , " adds Dr. Lartillot .

( CNN ) -- A Pennsylvania woman told police she was attacked at an ATM in Pittsburgh by a robber who became angry when he saw a John McCain bumper sticker on her car , a spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh Police Department said Thursday .
Police cannot confirm whether a man attacked this woman because she had a McCain sticker on her car .
Public Information Officer Diane Richard said police cannot substantiate her story , however , and the investigation is ongoing .
Richard said the 20 - year - old told investigators a man approached her Wednesday night at an ATM in the city 's East End , put a blade to her neck and demanded money .
She said she gave him $ 60 and stepped away from him , Richard said .
But the woman said the man " became very angry " when he noticed her car had a bumper sticker supporting the GOP presidential nominee , according to Richard .
The woman said he punched her in the back of the head , knocked her to the ground and " continued to punch and kick her while threatening her , " the spokeswoman said .
Before he left , the woman said , he carved the letter " B " into her face with a knife , according to Richard .
There was no indication what the " B " indicated .
The alleged assailant fled on foot , Richard said .
" We , the police , cannot substantiate this yet , " she said .
" This is what she told police . "
Do n't Miss Police face cuts as economy falters
The woman , who is not from Pittsburgh , refused medical attention , Richard said , although she told the investigating officer she would see a doctor Thursday .
There was no update on her condition , she said .
Richard said the woman described her alleged attacker as a dark - skinned African - American , 6 feet 4 inches tall with a medium build and short dark hair , wearing dark clothing and shiny shoes .
McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker told CNN that McCain and running mate Sarah Palin " spoke to the victim and her family after learning about the incident earlier this afternoon . "
Hazelbaker said the campaign would not offer more detail out of respect for the woman 's privacy .
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama responded to the report with a statement saying , " Our thoughts and prayers are with the young woman for her to make a speedy recovery , and we hope that the person who perpetrated this crime is swiftly apprehended and brought to justice .

The Canadian people are not only constituents , we are politicians ' neighbours .
Neighbours do n't get rich off the backs of one another .
Politicians will be given a pension of $ 1,000 / year for every year they serve .
So , if a politician served six years in government , that person will receive a pension of $ 6,000 / year .

I 'm starting a new political party -- The Neighbour Party of Canada -- which will be a radical departure from the business - as - usual politics in the petrie - dish - of - corruption , Ottawa .
At the risk of sounding like a doe - eyed granola - eater who might seem more apt to elect a sandal his political leader , I think it 's time we get back to the idea that all Canadians are our neighbours -- not constituents , not underlings , not Rabble , not the Great Unwashed .
Neighbours .
Neighbours look out for one another .
If the car of my neighbour across the street is stuck in the snow , I help her push it out .
If my neighbour a few doors up needed me to watch his kids one evening because he had to run off to some emergency , I 'd do it .
When my lawnmower broke , my next door neighbour offered the use of hers .
So , it 's time the elected swine of this country get back to the idea that they are representing their neighbours , spending their neighbours ' money , making policy that affect their neighbours ' lives .
What would the Neighbour Party of Canada do if elected to power ?

British archaeologist uncovers hoard of 1,300 - year - old gold coins under a car park in Jerusalem
A hoard of more than 1,300 - year - old gold coins has been unearthed under a car park in Jerusalem , the Israeli Antiquities Authority revealed .
Archaeologists said the collection of 264 coins found in the ruins of a 7th century building , the end of the Byzantine period , was one of the largest uncovered in Jerusalem .
' We 've had pottery , we 've had glass , but we 've had nothing like this , ' said British archaeologist Nadine Ross , who made the discovery on Sunday .
Treasure hoard : Nadine Ross , a British volunteer for Israel 's Antiquities Authority , holds coins she helped unearth in Jerusalem
The coins date to the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius , who ruled from AD 610 to 641 .
Rare find : Some of the 264 gold coins found in Jerusalem
On one side they bear a likeness of the emperor wearing military garb and holding a cross in his right hand .
On the reverse is the cross .
Experts said they were minted at the beginning of Heraclius 's reign , before the Persians conquered Byzantine Jerusalem in AD 614 .
' This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem – certainly the largest and most important of its period , ' said site directors Doron Ben - Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets .
' Since no pottery vessel was discovered adjacent to the hoard , we can assume that it was concealed inside a hidden niche in one of the walls of the building , ' they said .
Until now , the only hoard of gold coins from the Byzantine period that had been discovered in Jerusalem consisted of five gold coins , they added .
At the time the coins were minted Anglo - Saxon England was split into several kingdoms including Mercia and East Anglia .

Egyptian border guards have opened fire on Palestinians who broke through the Egyptian border to escape Israel ’s attacks on Gaza .
An Egyptian security official said there were at least five breaches along the nine - mile border and hundreds of Palestinian residents were pouring in .
At least 300 Egyptian border guards have been rushed to the area to reseal the border , the official added on condition on anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press .
A resident of the Gaza Strip side of the border , Fida Kishta , said that Egyptian border guards opened fire to drive back the Palestinians .
Residents have also commandeered a bulldozer to open new breaches .
Palestinians reported several people were wounded by the gunfire .
Israeli aircraft earlier bombed the border area in an apparent attempt to destroy cross border tunnels used to smuggle weapons and contraband into the Gaza Strip .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Nearly one in five U.S. mortgage borrowers owe more to lenders than their homes are worth , and the rate may soon approach one in four as housing prices fall and the economy weakens , a report on Friday shows .
About 7.63 million properties , or 18 percent , had negative equity in September , and another 2.1 million will follow if home prices fall another 5 percent , according to a report by First American CoreLogic .
The data , covering 43 states and Washington , D.C. , includes borrowers nationwide , even those who took out mortgages before housing prices began to soar early this decade .
Seven hard - hit states -- Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia , Michigan , Nevada and Ohio -- had 64 percent of all “ underwater ” borrowers , but just 41 percent of U.S. mortgages .
“ This is very much a regional problem , and people tend to forget that , ” said David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor ’s , who expects home prices nationwide to fall another 10 percent before bottoming late next year .
“ Most of the country is not in bad shape , ” he continued .
“ Things seem to be stabilizing in Michigan , but the big bubble states -- Florida , California , Arizona and Nevada -- are still very overpriced . ”
About 68 percent of U.S. adults own their own homes , and about two - thirds of them have mortgages .
JPMorgan Chase &
Co , one of the biggest mortgage lenders , on Friday offered to modify $ 70 billion of mortgages to keep a potential 400,000 homeowners out of foreclosure .
Bank of America Corp , which bought Countrywide Financial Corp in July , also has a large loan modification program .

HOME PRICES , ECONOMY UNDER PRESSURE
U.S. home prices fell a record 16.6 percent in August from a year earlier , with declines in all 20 major metropolitan areas measured by the S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Indices .
Foreclosure filings rose 71 percent in the third quarter to a record 765,558 , according to RealtyTrac .
Meanwhile , the Commerce Department said gross domestic product fell at a 0.3 percent rate in the third quarter .
Some experts expect the worst U.S. recession since the early 1980s .
Yet despite a series of expensive government programs to spur lending , mortgage rates are rising , making it tougher to borrow or refinance .
The rate on a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage jumped this week to 6.46 percent from 6.04 percent a week earlier , Freddie Mac said .
Meanwhile , borrowing costs on hundreds of thousands of adjustable - rate mortgages are expected to reset higher in the coming months .
The problem may be particularly serious for borrowers with rates tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate , or Libor , which is abnormally high relative to benchmark U.S. rates .
Last week , Wachovia Corp said borrowers with its “ Pick - a - Pay ” ARMs and living in or near Stockton and Merced , California , owed at least 55 percent more on their mortgages , on average , than their homes were worth .
Wells Fargo & Co is buying Wachovia .
NEVADA HARD HIT , NEW YORK AT RISK
First American CoreLogic , an affiliate of title insurance and real estate services company First American Corp , said states with large numbers of homes with negative equity either had rapid price appreciation , many homes bought with subprime mortgages or as speculative investments , steep manufacturing declines , or a combination .
Nevada was hardest hit , where mortgage borrowers on average owed 89 percent of what their homes were worth , and 48 percent had negative equity .
Michigan was second , with an 85 percent loan - to - value ratio and 39 percent of borrowers underwater .
New York fared best , with an average 48 percent loan - to - value ratio and just 4.4 percent of mortgage borrowers with negative equity .
But Wyss said this could change as financial market upheaval transforms Wall Street .
This month , New York City Comptroller William Thompson estimated that the city alone might lose 165,000 jobs over two years .
“ We ’re going to see home prices coming down pretty significantly in New York , ” Wyss said .
“ A lot of people are losing jobs , and wo n’t be getting their usual bonuses , and that leaves less money for housing . ”
The government 's decision to ignore scientific advice has been controversial
The reclassification of cannabis from a Class C to a Class B drug means a higher maximum jail sentence for possession .
Announcing the move in May 2008 , then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said there was " uncertainty at the least " on the future impact on young people 's mental health as a result of using cannabis .
Therefore she was going to " err on the side of caution and protect the public " by upping the classification level , she said .
Cannabis users in the UK tend to smoke the drug in " joints " although it can also be eaten in " hash cakes " or drunk ( the active ingredient is soluble in milk ) in " hash coffee " .
There are three sub-species of the cannabis plant from which the drug can be derived - sativa , indica and ruderalis .
All three grow indigenously in Asia and each is said to produce a different kind of " high " .
The plant has been used in various forms as an intoxicant since Assyrian times , but today it is usually produced in herbal form ( " grass " or " weed " ) or as a resin ( " dope " ) .
Cannabis and the law Possession of Class B Drugs ( including cannabis and amphetamines ) carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail Possession of Class C drugs ( including ketamine and GHB ) carries a maximum sentence of two years in jail Supply of Class B and C drugs can attract a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail Hippies Cannabis use in Britain was very limited until the 1950s , when it was brought to the country in slightly larger quantities by West Indian immigrants .
The plant had been introduced to the new world by plantation workers from the Indian subcontinent .
The hippy sub-culture of the mid to late 60s spread the drug 's use .
Cannabis has been illegal in Britain since 1928 , when a law derived from the International Convention on Narcotics Control came into effect .
The convention was mainly concerned with controlling the Far East 's opium problem , but cannabis was also included by the League of Nations in its list of substances which member states should seek to control , at the behest of Egyptian and Turkish delegates .
The law was applied in a rather erratic manner throughout the UK until the Misuse of Drugs Act in 1971 , which introduced the drug classification system and sentencing guidelines .
In 2004 , the then Home Secretary David Blunkett approved the reclassification of cannabis from Class B ( which it had been since the 1971 act ) to Class C .
The move followed a report from the Home Affairs Select Committee and advice from an independent panel of experts - the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) .
Cannabis penalties
In England and Wales , a first offence of possession of cannabis will usually attract a warning With " aggravating factors " , such as smoking in the presence of children or public order offences , arrest is likely An £ 80 spot fine ( penalty notice of disorder - PND ) is proposed for a second offence A third offence will usually mean arrest and a court appearance In Scotland , all offences have to be reported to the Procurator Fiscal Possession of small amounts of cannabis is usually dealt by a Fiscal Fine ( not included on someone 's criminal record ) or no action being taken
No formal guidelines apply in Northern Ireland PNDs are not introduced there , but in practice police procedure closely follows England and Wales Source : Release Reclassified Mr Blunkett said he hoped the move would free the police to concentrate on more " serious drugs " .
Advice to forces in England and Wales said possession of the drug in small quantities would normally be dealt with by an informal warning or caution .
In May 2008 , however , the home secretary announced that she would reverse the 2004 decision and put cannabis back into category B .
The move went against the ACMD 's latest recommendations , but was , she said , necessary because of research linking heavy use of the drug with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses .
Ms Smith said she was particularly concerned over the rise in consumption of super - strength strains of cannabis , such as " skunk " .
The Home Office say such strains account for 80 % of all cannabis seizures in the UK .
There are plans to introduce a " three strikes " system for cannabis possession , where a warning will be followed by an £ 80 spot fine ( called a " penalty notice of disorder " ) and a third offence will render a person liable to arrest and prosecution .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The spot fine proposal , as part of a list of 21 more offences for which police could impose penalties , is due for further consultation after magistrates expressed concerns about taking offences away from the courts system .
But the government says it wants spot fines for cannabis possession " as soon as possible " .
The BBC News website and Radio One 's Newsbeat spoke to people about the reclassification : PROFESSOR DAVID NUTT , ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF DRUGS " Some individuals do get unpleasant mental reactions but they are relatively small in number .
" We are not convinced that moving it to Class B with the possibility of five years ' imprisonment for possession will have any beneficial effects .
" There are potential risks of criminalising people who are using a drug which does n't harm other people , only themselves .
" Alcohol is more harmful [ than cannabis ] - to the population , certainly , and to the individual , possibly . "
MARJORIE WALLACE , MENTAL HEALTH CHARITY SANE
" We support the proposal to reclassify it as a Class B drug .
" Cannabis , especially in its more toxic varieties , can double the chance of developing severe mental illness in a significant minority of people , particularly the young , whose brains are still developing .
" While we do not yet know the cause of psychotic illness , or the ways in which drugs such as cannabis may trigger breakdown , relapse , and worsen outcomes , we need to maintain a clear message that it is dangerous to the 10 - 20 % of people who may be at risk but do not know it . "
DANNY KUSHLICK , DRUGS POLICY THINK TANK TRANSFORM " Nobody is going to be put off smoking cannabis by the decision to reclassify it .
" It 's a decision that has been taken for political reasons , to trump the Tories ' law and order agenda , rather than for any scientific reason .
" Our position is - if cannabis can be dangerous to a few , yet two million people regularly smoke it - we should have a regulated and supervised market for it , rather than putting its distribution in the hands of criminals . "
DET CH SUPT ANDY WEST , LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE
Det Ch Supt
West was in charge of the investigation into the murder of Stevie Barton , a student who was killed by paranoid cannabis user Marc Middlebrook in 2007 .
" [ Reclassification ] will send out a message .
" People are far more prone now to take cannabis , alcohol and other substances and get completely paralytic drunk and bombed out of their minds .
" It 's not right .
We 've all got to take some responsibility for our actions .
That decision [ to downgrade cannabis in 2004 ] , in my mind , made it a lot easier for people to excuse their own bad behaviour . "
MARTIN BARNES , INDEPENDENT DRUGS CHARITY DRUGSCOPE
" We remain concerned that the government rejected independent expert advice on cannabis classification - a worrying precedent has been set .
" There is no evidence that moving the drug to Class B will of itself reduce levels of use , harm or availability nor is there evidence that the public wants to see tougher penalties for cannabis possession , particularly for young people .
" Cannabis is a harmful drug and we do need to be vigilant .
Using the classification system to ' send out a message ' is a blunt and questionable approach , particularly if it risks undermining ... credibility . "
STATEMENT FROM MAGISTRATES ' ASSOCIATION
" The singling - out of possession of cannabis for disposal through a PND [ penalty notice of disorder ] sets it aside from the other Class B drugs and sends an unacceptable signal to those who use it .
" The significant campaign by the Magistrates ' Association and other agencies to reclassify the drug will be undermined if this is implemented . "
BOB , CANNABIS USER
Bob is a 45 - year - old IT worker who lives in a town on the Kent coast and has been using cannabis for 26 years .
He says he smokes " five to 25 " joints a day .
" What I 'd like to ask politicians is what harm am I doing by staying in , rolling a few spliffs [ joints ] and watching television ?
" Maybe I should be out down the pub , getting pissed , getting in punch - ups and shouting my head off ?
That seems the establishment 's preferred option .
" The only harm I do is to my own lungs .
The fact that I 'm considered a criminal is , I think , a fundamental breach of my human rights . "

PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE —
A specialized military unit to respond quickly to nuclear , chemical , biological or other catastrophes will be activated today .
The 4,700 - person force is trained for search and rescue , decontamination , medical care , aviation , communications and logistics .
It ’s called a Consequence Management Force and includes personnel from the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines .
Two similar units are scheduled to start up in the next two years .
Evidence is emerging of a wave of reprisal attacks and killings inside Gaza that have left dozens dead and more wounded in the wake of Israel 's war .
Among the dead are Palestinians suspected of collaborating with the Israeli military .
Others include criminals who were among the 600 prisoners to escape from Gaza City 's main jail when it was bombed as the war began .
Their attackers are thought to be their victims ' relatives .
During and after the war , there have also been attacks on security officials from Fatah , the bitter rival of Hamas , the Islamist movement in control of the Gaza Strip .
One witness told the Guardian how her brother , a Fatah military intelligence officer , was shot three times in the legs in an apparent punishment attack by gunmen from Hamas 's armed wing .
The Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported yesterday that several Palestinian agents working in Gaza for the Israeli security services during the war had been killed , and cited one source as saying that agents were " intercepted " by Hamas because their intelligence had been used " carelessly " by the military .
Palestinians in human rights organisations are reluctant to speak publicly about what is a sensitive issue , but one respected human rights worker in Gaza said he believed between 40 and 50 people had been killed in reprisal attacks since the start of the war .
But there was not yet enough evidence to suggest this was an organised campaign by Hamas , he said .
" We do n't know who 's doing the killing , " the worker said .
" Some are individuals , some might be from Hamas .
It 's been happening over several days , all across Gaza .
It 's not all necessarily Hamas actions against Fatah . "
Another human rights worker put the figure at between 25 and 30 documented cases of reprisal .
A human rights group in Ramallah , in the occupied West Bank , and funded by the Fatah - led Palestinian Authority , has protested .
" A number of citizens have been extra-judicially killed during and after the Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip , " the Independent Commission for Human Rights said in a statement .
" Fire was opened on affected citizens at a close distance .
In addition , individuals in official uniform or masked persons opened fire on people 's legs , severely beat others , imposed house arrests , and threatened to punish citizens along with their families if they would not comply . "
Hamas dismissed the claims but said it had arrested suspected collaborators , apparently as part of an effort to reassert control over Gaza .
" The internal security service was instructed to track collaborators and hit them hard , " said Ehab al - Ghsain , a spokesman for the Hamas interior ministry in Gaza .
" They arrested dozens of collaborators who attempted to strike the resistance by giving information to the occupation about the fighters . "
One woman from near Zeitoun , south of Gaza City , described how masked men with ID cards showing they were members of the Izzedin al - Qassam Brigades , the Hamas armed wing , shot her brother in the legs .
The family had fled the house but returned on 18 January , the first day of the Israeli ceasefire .
At 8 pm several gunmen appeared at the gate asking for her brother , a 36 - year - old Fatah military intelligence officer who had not been working since Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007 .
The men searched the house for weapons , but found none and later left .
Early the next morning they returned .
" They started firing in the air , " said the 23 - year - old sister , who declined to give her name for fear of further attacks .
" They asked him to put his hands up .
They fired one shot into his left knee .
He fell to the floor and started screaming and saying : ' I did n't do anything . ' "
He was then shot in the right leg and again in the left .
" They were holding us back and we were watching him bleeding , " she said .
The victim is now in a Cairo hospital after two operations on his legs .
She said several of his Fatah colleagues had been targeted : " It 's a kind of revenge on Fatah .
They thought they were responsible for what was going on in Gaza . "
Separately , Hamas is believed to have stopped Palestinians reaching an Israeli field hospital on Israel 's side of the border at Erez .
" We do n't care about it , " said Hassan Khalaf , Hamas 's deputy health minister .
" They are just claiming they care about human beings but they do n't . "

... you take the blue pill -- the story ends ... you take the red pill ... and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes .
-- Morpheus in The Matrix
Talk about your red pills .
J.M. Robertson herein challenges not only the historical authenticity of the canonical accounts of the founding of Christianity , but also Buddhism , Hinduism , Jainism , Zoroastrianism , and Judaism .
He answers the question implicit in Kersey Graves ' 1875 screed , The World 's Sixteen Crucified Saviors .
Why so many similar stories of savior figures in world religion ?
At the dark heart of this mystery , according to Robinson , is a prehistoric drama involving human sacrifice ( particularly , of children ) , cannibalism , and regicide .
The purpose : to implore the gods , or to expiate collective sin .
As time passed , the rituals were softened , and turned into symbolic equivalents ( such as the scapegoat and the eucharist ) , while retaining the tragic end of the narrative .
A culture hero , born under portents , dies , often under torture , in order to save all humanity .
These and other tropes ended up embedded in our tales of the founders of major religions , from Buddha to Jesus .
Robertson pulls in historic , ethnographic and folklore data from hundreds of carefully cited sources .
He covers examples from antiquity such as Mithraism , Manichaeism , and Apollonius of Tyana .
In the final section he universalizes his study and focuses on Native America , particularly the Aztec .
The conclusions of this book remain highly controversial , but the sheer mass of evidence accumulated demands consideration .
This will be a thorny book for believers , but a revelation for free - thinkers .

Having enacted a $ 152 billion “ stimulus ” bill a year ago that stimulated nothing but the national debt , Congress is about to do it again .
This time the price tag will be $ 875 billion — or more .
While the various interest groups disagree over what the hundreds of billions should be spent on , they all buy into the superstition that government spending boosts “ demand ” .
In fact , it does no such thing .
A year from now , when the “ stimulus ” has disappeared without a trace and unemployment is higher than it is now , economists will be claiming that the “ stimulus ” bill was too small , or was spent on the wrong things , or that “ consumers saved the money instead of spending it ” .
Superstition is notoriously impervious to facts .
The definition of “ insanity ” is , “ doing the same thing over and over again , expecting a different result ” .
Given the failure of “ stimulus ” everywhere and every time it has been tried ( the U.S. in the 1930s , 2001 , and 2008 , Japan in the 1990s , etc. ) , Keynesianism is actually a form of insanity .
Accordingly , let ’s call the belief in stimulus “ stimulunacy ” and the people who believe in stimulus “ stimulunatics ” .
As they battle to the death over the specific allocation of the spending ( infrastructure , aid to the States , food stamps , tax rebates , etc. ) the stimulunatics ignore the one thing that all such plans have in common .
The very first step in every “ stimulus ” program is for the government to go out into the market and sell bonds .
When the government sells bonds , it takes money — and therefore demand — out of the economy .
Then , some time later , the government puts the money back into the economy in the form of spending or tax rebates or whatever .
Later , when the data becomes available , economists are shocked , shocked to find that “ consumers saved their rebates ” or “ business investment fell by an unexpected amount ” , or “ imports increased ” , thus completely negating the “ stimulus ” .
Their hopes dashed , but their belief in “ stimulus ” unshaken , the stimulunatics then call for more “ stimulus ” .
The fact is that for the government to be able to sell the bonds in the first place , consumers have to save , or businesses have reduce their investments , or foreigners have to sell more in the U.S.
Otherwise , where would the dollars to buy the bonds come from ?
“ Wait ! ” the stimulunatics cry .
“ What if the Federal Reserve buys the bonds with newly - created money ?
Wo n’t that increase demand ? ”
The answer is , “ Sure — but then you do n’t need the ‘ stimulus ’ program . ”
Demand is created by money , and as soon as the Fed creates more money , it creates more demand .
Government “ stimulus ” spending is irrelevant to this process .
“ But wait ! ” the stimulunatics protest .
“ What if the banks wo n’t lend out the newly - created money ?
What if we are in the dreaded ‘ liquidity trap ’ ?
What if the Fed is ‘ pushing on a string ’ ? ”
The answer to this one is , “ There is no such thing as a ‘ liquidity trap ’ . ”
The “ liquidity trap ” fantasy had its genesis in the peculiar practice of conducting monetary policy against an interest rate target .
If a central bank is targeting an interest rate and it gets “ behind the curve ” , it can lower its target to zero and still not be creating enough money to prevent deflation .
This is what happened to Japan during the 1990s .
Japan ’s economy sank into a deflationary recession that went on for more than ten years .
During this period , Japan , which must have lots of stimulunatics in positions of power , borrowed and spent trillions of yen on “ stimulus ” programs .
The only effect of these programs had was to drive Japan ’s national debt up to more than 120 % of GDP , about three times higher than that of the U.S .
Eventually , the Bank of Japan abandoned its interest rate target and simply started creating more yen ( so - called “ quantitative easing ” ) .
It was quantitative easing , not Japan ’s enormous “ stimulus ” programs , that eventually eased Japan ’s deflation and recession .
The lesson is that if you need more demand , you need more money , not government “ stimulus ” programs to move the existing money around in circles .
There is no limit to the Fed ’s ability to create money , so there is no limit to its ability to create demand .
The Fed creates money by buying assets .
It is true that the newly created money appears in the form of bank reserves .
However , it is also true that the Fed buys each asset from someone .
That someone formerly owned the asset , and now they have money .
Having just been the seller in the transaction involving the asset , that person is in a position to be the buyer in another transaction .
If this person decides to stuff the newly - created cash in a mattress , the Fed can just keep buying assets until it gets the level of demand that it wants .
“ But wait ! ” the stimulunatics cry .
“ If the Fed creates a lot of new money , wo n’t that produce inflation ? ”
The answer to this is , “ Very possibly .
This is one of the problems with an undefined dollar .
But ‘ stimulus ’ spending does nothing to solve this problem . ”
Because the dollar is an undefined “ floating ” currency , there is no way to know how the demand the Fed creates will express itself .
The Fed can force nominal GDP to rise , but it currently has no control over how much of the increase comes in the form of inflation and how much as real economic growth .
The undefined , unstable dollar is actually the most fundamental economic problem we face , and was the underlying cause of the current economic / financial crisis .
A stable dollar is a prerequisite for a stable , growing , prosperous economy .
So , we must stabilize the dollar .
But what if we do that and the economy still is n’t growing fast enough ?
While it is not possible for the Federal government to stimulate “ demand ” , it is possible to stimulate private business investment .
It is private business investment that directly creates both employment and GDP growth .
The most potent way to stimulate private business investment in the U.S. would be to abolish the corporate income tax .
Based upon recent CBO numbers , eliminating the entire corporate income tax would cost only about $ 326 billion the first year .
This is less than half of the money that the stimulunatics are planning to pour down their various rat holes this year .
Stabilizing the dollar and eliminating the corporate income tax would ignite an economic boom of staggering proportions .
This would be real economic stimulus , not Keynesian stimulunacy .

The Original Macintosh : 108 of 127 Are You Gonna Do It ?
Author : Andy Hertzfeld Date : February 1985 Characters : Burrell Smith , Steve Jobs Topics : Management , Quitting Summary : Burrell quits
Apple , but fails to live up to his threat
No matter how much resolve you could muster , it was still difficult to quit Apple if Steve wanted you to stay .
You 'd have to sit down with him for a reality distortion session , which was often effective at getting people to change their minds .
One day , a few of us were talking about strategies to overcome Steve 's persuasiveness .
" I 've got it ! " , said Burrell .
" I know the perfect way to quit that will nullify the reality distortion field . "
Of course we wanted to know how he could do that .
" I 'll just walk into Steve 's office , pull down my pants , and urinate on his desk .
What could he say to that ?
It 's guaranteed to work . "
We laughed , thinking that not even Burrell would have the guts to do that .
A year and a half later , it finally was time for Burrell to quit , after months of scuffling with Bob Belleville and some of the other managers , who wanted to cancel the " Turbo Mac " project ( a redesigned , faster Mac based on a semi-custom chip , with an internal hard drive ) that Burrell was working on with Brian Howard and Bob Bailey .
Burrell told Bob Belleville ( who was probably relieved , since he knew that Burrell did n't respect him ) and the human resources department that he was quitting , and then made an appointment to see Steve that afternoon .
When he walked into Steve 's office , he was surprised to see Steve grinning at him .
" Are you gonna do it ?
Are you really gonna do it ? " , asked Steve .
Somehow , word about the urination threat had gotten back to Steve , and he was genuinely curious if Burrell would go through with it or not .
Burrell looked Steve in the eye .
" Do I have to ?
I 'll do it if I have to . "
Steve 's expression gave him the answer , so Burrell turned and walked out of the office , no longer an Apple employee .
" I 've got it ! " , said Burrell .
" I know the perfect way to quit that will nullify the reality distortion field .

Out - of - place metal objects
The puzzled rock hunters sent their find to the Charles Fort Society , who specialize in investigating things out of the ordinary .
The Society made an X - ray examination of the cylinder object enclosed in the fossil - encrusted rock , and found further evidence that it was indeed some form of mechanical apparatus .
The X - rays revealed that the metallic shaft was corroded at one end , but on the other end terminated in what appeared to be a spring or helix of metal .
As a whole , the ' Coso artifact ' is now believed to be something more than a piece of machinery :
The carefully shaped ceramic , metallic shaft and copper components hint at some form of electrical instrument .
The closest modern apparatus that researchers have been able to equate it with is a spark plug .
However , there are certain features - particularly the spring or helix terminal - that does not correspond to any known spark plug today .
The rock in which the electrical instrument was found was dated by a competent geologist at 500,000 years old .
The rock strata appear to be full of metal ' surprises . '
The Illinois Springfield Republican reported in 1851 that a businessman named Hiram de Witt had brought back with him from a trip to California a piece of auriferous quartz rock about the size of a man 's fist , and that while showing the rock to a friend , it slipped from his hand and split open upon hitting the floor .
There , in the center of the quartz , they discovered a cut-iron nail , six - penny size , slightly corroded but entirely straight , with a perfect head .
the quartz was given an age of over one million years .
In 1865 , a two - inch metal screw was discovered in a piece of feldspar unearthed from the Abbey Mine in Treasure City , Nevada .
The screw had long ago oxidized , but its form - particularly the shape of its threads - could be clearly seen in the feldspar .
The stone was calculated to be 21 million years in age .
Twenty years earlier , in 1844 , Sir David Brewster made a report to the British Association for the Advancement of Science which created quite a stir .
A nail of obvious human manufacture had been found half - embedded in a sandstone block excavated from the Kindgoodie Quarry near Inchyra , in northern Britain .
It was badly corroded , but identifiable nonetheless .
The sandstone was determined to be at least 40 million years old .
In the fall of 1885 , at an iron foundry owned by the sons of Herr Isidor Braun located in Schondorf near Bocklabruck , Upper Austria , a workman named Riedl was breaking up a block of Tertiary brown coal that had been mined from the pits at Wolfsegg , near Schwannstadt , and was about to be used to heat the foundry 's giant smelters .
As the block disintegrated into several pieces , out dropped a strange cube - like object .
In 1886 , mining engineer Dr. Adolf Gurlt made a report to the Natural History Society at Bonn , Germany and noted that the object , coated with a thin layer of rust , is made of iron , measures 2.64 by 2.64 by 1.85 inches , weighs 1.73 Ibs. , and has a specific gravity measurement of 7.75 .
Four of the iron ' cube 's ' sides are roughly flat , while the two remaining sides - opposite each other - are convex .
A fairly deep groove was incised all the way around the object , about mid-way up its height .
Other early studies on the iron artifact were in scientific journals of the day as Nature ( London ; November 11 , 1886 , page 36 ) and L'Astronomie ( Paris ; 1886 , page 463 ) .
A plaster cast was also made before the turn of the century - important because the original object subsequently suffered from handling , and from being disfigured by samples having been cut from it by investigators for research .
The cast is kept in the Oberosterreichisehes Landesmuseum in Linz , Austria , where the original object was also exhibited from 1950 to 1958 .
The iron cube is presently in the custody of Herrn O.R. Bernhardt of the Heimathaus Museum in Vocklabruck .
In 1966 - 67 , the iron ' cube ' was carefully analyzed by experts at the Vienna Naturhistorisehes Museum , using electron - beam microanalysis .
They found no traces of nickel , chromium or cobalt in the iron - which means the object was not of meteoric origin .
No sulfur was detected either , ruling out the chance of it being a pyrite , a natural mineral that sometimes forms geometric shapes .
Because of a low magnesium content , Dr. Kurat of the Museum , and Dr. R. Gill of the Geologisehe Bundesanstalt of Vienna , are of the opinion that the object was made of cast - iron .
In 1973 , Hubert Mattlianer concluded from yet another detailed investigation that the object had been made from a hand - sculptured lump of wax or clay pressed into a sand base , this forming the mold into which the iron had been poured .
The final conclusion , then , is that the strange object is definitely man-made .
What is not explained is what it was doing encased in coal dating to the Tertiary - 60 million years old .
In 1968 , French speleologists Y. Druet and H. Salfati reported finding unusual metal nodules entombed in an Aptian chalk bed in a quarry at Saint - Jean de Livet .
The nodules are reddish brown , wafer - shaped and hollowed at the ends , measuring from 3 to 9 centimeters long and 1 to four centimeters wide .
The two investigators at first thought the nodules were fossils until they discovered their metallic nature .
Next , they theorized they were residue from a meteor - but careful study showed the nodules were too uniformly shaped to be of natural origin .
Chemical analysis showed a carbon content consistent with modern forging and casting techniques .
But what had these man-made objects been doing in chalk beds dating toward the end of the Cretaceous - over 120 million years ?
As Druet and Salfati concluded , ' These objects , then , prove the presence of intelligent life on earth long before the limits given today by prehistoric archaeology . '
On June 9 , 1891 , Mrs. S.W. Culp of Morrisonville , Illinois was shoveling coal into her kitchen stove when a large lump broke in two and out from the center of it fell a gold chain .
The chain was about 10 inches long , made of eight carat gold , weighed 8 pennyweight , and was described as being ' of antique and quaint workmanship . '
The Morrisonville Times of June 11 reported that investigators were convinced the chain had not simply been accidentally dropped in with the coal :
One portion of the coal lump still clung to the chain , while the part that had separated from it still bore the impression of where the chain had been encased .
The Times could only comment , ' Here is one for the student of archaeology who loves to puzzle his brain over the geological construction of the Earth from whose ancient depth the curious are always dropping out . '
In this case , the ' curious ' ' dropped out ' of a piece of coal from the Pennsylvanian era - over 300 million years old .
Similar events produced another metal object of even greater age .
In 1912 , two employees of the Municipal Electric Plant of Thomas , Oklahoma , were shoveling coal into the plant furnaces , using fuel which had been mined near neighboring Wilberton .
One chunk of coal was too large to handle , so the workmen took a sledge hammer to it .
Once it broke open , however , the workmen found that the chunk contained an iron pot , and upon its removal , the two coal halves bore the ' mold ' of the pot in its interiors .
Both employees signed affidavits testifying to the authenticity of the discovery , and the iron pot was subsequently examined by several experts - every one of which was most reluctant to comment on the pot , and the circumstances surrounding its discovery .
This was most understandable , since the object came from coal dated from 300 to 325 million
years .
One more find that must be mentioned in the out - of - place metal category takes us - once again - to the deepest level of fossil life .
On June 13 , 1880 , a reporter for the Inverness Courier named Walter Carruthers was vacationing near Loch Maree and Victoria Falls , in Scotland , and - being an amateur rock hunter - decided to explore the geology of the area .
Between 300 and 400 yards above Victoria Falls , and immediately beside the last of the three lesser falls on the west side of the stream , Carruthers noticed peculiar impressions in the rock .
The rock was a l6 x 16 - foot exposed surface of Torridon Red Sandstone , placed in the Cambrian age .
The impressions consisted of two continuous flat bands side by side , between 1 1/4 and 1 1/ 2 inches wide and about 1 / 4 inch deep , running unnaturally straight through the flat layers of sandstone in situ , and perfectly distinct for 16 feet , disappearing on the west side under the superimposed rock , and broken only where portions of the sandstone had been weathered out .
A few weeks later the curious ' bands ' were also observed by a colleague of Carruthers , Mr. William Jolly , Her Majesty 's Inspector of Schools for the region .
Carruthers had thought the impressions to have been the creation of some highly unusual living creature , but Jolly recorded that ' the continuous even breadth and square section of the bands would seem to render this impossible . '
Jolly further noted , ' The double band resembles nothing more nearly than the hollow impression that would be left by double bars of iron placed closely together . '
Jolly 's observation was corroborated years later when micro-specks of iron oxide were taken from the impression cavities .
The superintendent thought , however , that perhaps the iron bands had at one time been inserted into the rock , ' to clasp some structure to it ' - but other findings discount this .
First , the bands occur high above the Falls in an almost totally inaccessible place , where a ' structure ' would serve little purpose .
Second , the bands are only one - quarter of an inch deep , so that anything ' clasped ' to them would not hold for long .
Third , parallel on either side of each band are tin ) ?
ripple marks in the sandstone , indicating the presence of the original iron bands had caused turbulence patterns in the sand during the time the sand had been laid down by water , and before it had turned to stone .
Fourth , the sandstone in the impressions show tiny striations which are really the preserved grain marks of the iron - again , indicating the metal had been impressed in the primordial sand , before solidification took place .
And finally , fifth , one portion of one of the bands bends back into the subsurface , and careful excavation revealed the presence of iron oxide totally encased by the surrounding sandstone .
Jolly also found other band impressions in the same locality :
There is a third band that runs alongside the other two , but is much less distinct and is not continuous .
Two more lines , about 2 feet lower down on the rock surface , are only 7 feet long , and two more are higher up , running 3 feet long .
Jolly also saw still more bands on an outcropping of the same sandstone on the other side of the stream , again parallel to one another - one 3 feet , another 6 feet , and smaller portions of several others .
What purpose these iron bands served , we can only guess .
What we do know , however , is that all the bands were very uniform in width and thickness , with squared edges , and the grain marks they left indicate they were rolled and cut - all of which points to precision manufacturing by machine production .
But this is totally impossible , if we are to believe the geologists , for the sandstone in which the bands occur is Cambrian - 600 million years old , by their own measurements .
Who , pray tell , was running an iron mill at a time when there was supposedly only tiny invertebrate creatures ruling the world ?
Two days later , participants were brought back in , and told either that all lineup suspects had denied the theft , or that one or another had confessed .
Then they were asked to rate their confidence in their initial identification ( or no- identification ) and change it if necessary .
Overall , a confession changed confidence in every case , and identifications in many .
If someone other than their original choice confessed , almost two - thirds of those witnesses changed their identification to the confessor .
If the person they identified confessed , their confidence went up from six to eight - and - a - half .
Even among witnesses who correctly chose no one from the first lineup , 50 percent changed their mind after a confession from a specific suspect .

Bob Quick :
In charge of inquiry which has seen Tory Damian Green arrested The head of Britain 's counter - terror squad has apologised " unreservedly " to the Conservative Party .
Met Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick claimed on Sunday the party had mobilised the press against him .
But on Monday he said he had reflected on his comments and apologised " for any offence or embarrassment " caused .
The Tories have accepted the apology for the " deluded comments " from Mr Quick , who is heading a probe into the Home Office leaks to the Tories .
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said the apology " draws a line under the matter " .
If you make a mistake , the best thing to do is correct it as quickly as you can
David Cameron
Conservative leader
Profile : Bob Quick Q&A : Damian Green arrested Mr Grieve refused to say whether or not he thought Mr Quick should continue in charge of the leaks inquiry , telling the BBC Mr Quick should make the " professional judgement " himself about whether he still had the " necessary objectivity " to continue .
And asked what he thought had prompted Mr Quick 's comments , Mr Grieve said : " I can only assume that he was both angry and stressed because of the possible compromising of his security , and that as a result he came out with these intemperate and in truth completely deluded comments about the Conservative Party . "
Mr Quick , who is heading the leaks investigation which saw senior Tory MP Damian Green arrested last month , said on Sunday he had been forced to move his family after a published newspaper article put them at risk .

" The Tory machinery and their press friends are mobilised against this investigation , " the Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner told reporters .
" I think it is a very spiteful act , possibly to intimidate me away from investigating Mr Green , and I feel it has put my family at risk . "
He later withdrew claims that the Conservatives had acted in a " corrupt " way , and issued the full apology on Monday in a statement .
" I have now reflected on the comments I made yesterday at a difficult time for me and my family .
I wish to make clear that it was not my intention to make any allegations , and retract my comments , " he said .
' Perfectly happy ' Conservative leader David Cameron had earlier called during an interview on London 's LBC radio for Mr Quick had " to withdraw what is a completely baseless allegation ...
I am sure he will want to do that because in life , if you make a mistake , the best thing to do is correct it as quickly as you can " .
He added that he was " perfectly happy " to work with Mr Quick on a professional basis , but added that he thought the investigation into Mr Green was " misconceived and the sooner it comes to an end the better , and I suspect it will fairly shortly " .
HAVE YOUR SAY Mr Quick 's remarks show unthinking bias and poor judgement from a man whose position demands total impartiality .
George Miller , Hampshire Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , asked about the row during a visit on Monday , said : " I know Bob has now retracted some of the things that he said over the weekend and I think the most important thing is that he is able to get on with the job of keeping this country safe , which is what he does day in , day out as our most senior counter - terror police officer . "
The acting commissioner of the Met , Paul Stephenson , said he was pleased that " a line has now been drawn under this matter " .
But Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said Mr Quick should step back from his role leading the leak inquiry .
" For the sake of the Met it would make sense for someone else to be overseeing the remainder of this inquiry , " he said .
The arrest of Mr Green and the search of his home and offices prompted a political row .
There was an outcry among MPs from all parties that the police action represented a fundamental breach of their right to hold the government to account .
Police had been asked by the Cabinet Office to investigate alleged leaks from the Home Office .

Terrorism is a two - prong attack :
The first part is the assault itself , the seemingly random destruction and slaughter of innocent people .
The second part is the response of the victims :
If the attack is truly successful , the victims will retaliate by betraying their own standards of conduct , demonstrating to the world that they are just as bad as the terrorists said they were .
In that sense , the members of the Bush Administration were the perfect patsies for the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The response to those attacks has included the open - ended incarceration of hundreds of suspected terrorists without evidence , charges , lawyers , trials , or any concept of due process ; the widespread use of torture and humiliation in violation of international law and common human decency ; and the unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion of Iraq .
In dragging this country into its darkest and most morally reprehensible era , the Bush Administration has done more damage to America than Osama bin Laden could possibly have imagined .
This horrifying descent is brilliantly described by journalist Jane Mayer in The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals ( Doubleday , 2008 ) .
The dynamics of the Bush Administration will doubtlessly be analyzed by historians for centuries to come .
At the top is a man incapable of analytical thought and possessing only a rudimentary moral sense , and he plays a relatively minor role in The Dark Side .
The biggest villains in this book are Vice President Chaney , the man who provided the title ( “ We ’ll have to work sort of the dark side , if you will ” — p. 9 ) and particularly his legal counsel and ( later ) Chief of Staff David Addington .
Cheney ’s experience in the Nixon and Ford administrations apparently convinced him that in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandals , too much power had been stripped from the Executive branch , particularly during wartime .
Cheney believed
There was too much international law , too many civil liberties , too many constraints on the President ’s war powers , too many rights for defendants , and too many rules against lethal covert action .
There was also too much openness and too much meddling by Congress and the press .
( p. 7 )
Cheney seems to have found his perfect ally in David Addington , who storms through this book like a grotesque bully , enraged at even the slightest manifestation of humanity as “ squishy ” thinking .
At various times , a seeming savior shows up ( like virtually everyone in this book , a hardcore Republication ) appalled by what the Bush Administration has been doing , only to be ridiculed and swatted down by Addington and persuaded to rethink his career goals .
Addington is the force behind the most shameful legal opinions of the Bush Administration — Colin Powell said flatly “ He does n’t believe in the Constitution ” ( p. 87 ) and Powell ’s chief of staff Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson indicated Addington has “ no scruples ” ( p. 125 ) and thus could easily manipulate “ someone who does n’t read a lot or pay attention to the details ” ( ie , Bush ) .
Addington was clearly a dominating influence over Alberto Gonzales ( a man evidently not comfortable in the deep end of the pool ) , and found a companion - in - arms in John Yoo .
Yoo ’s specialty was the area of presidential power during war .
Unlike most mainstream academics , he likened the president ’s powers to that of British kings , arguing that America ’s founders had meant for presidents to be able to wage war almost as unilaterally .
( p. 51 )
How much power does John Yoo think the President has in wartime ?
The right to torture is absolute : “ It ’s the core of the commander in chief function .
They [ Congress ] ca n’t prevent the president from ordering torture . ”
When asked , for example , whether a law could prevent the president from “ crushing the testicles of the [ interrogated ] person ’s child ” he responded “ I think it depends on why the president thinks he needs to do that . ” ( p. 153 )
White House lawyers are supposed to inform their bosses when a particular plan is illegal and should n't be pursued .
The lawyers in the Bush White House seem to function more like mob lawyers :
When their bosses want to do something illegal , the lawyers simply help them break the law .
The Dark Side is particularly strong in its analysis of torture .
Many centuries ago , torture was a normal part of the judicial process , but it began being viewed as immoral during the Enlightenment over two centuries ago .
( See Chapter Two of Lynn Hunt ’s fascinating Inventing Human Rights : A History for more background on this moral evolution . )
Opposition to torture and the granting of civil rights to defendants has thus been part of fundamental American principles and ideals from the time of Enlightenment - influenced documents like the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution .
Prior to the Bush Administration , when we thought about torture in the United States , we might have thought about backrooms of police stations , but for the use of torture as a matter of official public policy , we really need to go back to the Salem Witch Trials in the late 17th century .
Jane Mayer documents a great deal of torture — in U.S. run prisons outside the United States , in the prison at Guantánamo Bay , and the prison at Abu Ghraib .
Most Americans still believe that the shocking photographs taken at Abu Ghraib were just a few guards messing around .
But what they were doing was part of official American policy .
Mayer demonstrates how Rumsfeld wanted Major General Geoffrey Miller , the commander in Guantánamo , to “ Gitmoize ” Iraq , and
in a break with traditional military doctrine , Miller advocated using ordinary military police officers who worked as guards in the prison to participate in the interrogation process , even though they had not been trained for this .
The guards , he wrote , “ must be actively engaged in setting the conditions for successful exploitation of the internees . ”
Miller also recommended using military dogs for interrogation .
( p. 241 )
I ’m not sure he intended for the guards to take photographs of the process , however .
It is not only the immorality of these activities that is so shocking .
From a legal viewpoint , torture is incredibly stupid .
Once the Bush Administration began torturing prisoners , and shipping them to other countries to be tortured some more , they essentially gave up on due process .
A prisoner whose rights have been violated cannot be successfully prosecuted , even in a military tribunal , and evidence obtained through torture cannot be used to prosecute someone else .
The vast majority of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay will never be prosecuted .
Torture would be wrong even if it sometimes yielded good information .
But even that ’s in doubt , because when people are tortured , they will say just about anything .
After the CIA rendered Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi to Egypt where he was tortured , he described a fictitious relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda — information that was then used by the Bush Administration in building the case for the war against Iraq .
“ We ’ve learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb - making and poisons and deadly gasses . ” ( p. 135 -6 ) said President Bush in a speech on October 7 , 2002 .
What they learned was simply wrong , and the major justification for invading Iraq was completely bogus .
What ’s most astonishing is that the members of the Bush Administration deepest into the torture culture knew that they were doing something illegal , and they often tried to protect themselves from being prosecuted for war crimes .
Yet , they just ca n’t stop .
Even when Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act ( introduced to the Senate by John McCain ) , President Bush signed it on December 30 , 2005 only with an Addington - drafted “ presidential ‘ signing statement ’ suggesting that Bush would only enforce the new law ‘ in a manner consistent with ’ his constitutional role as commander in chief , ” which in Addington ’s view allowed unlimited powers .
In presenting a torture - loving America to the rest of the world , the Bush Administration has caused an incalculable amount of harm .
Mayer quotes Eric Haseltine , the former top adviser on science and technology to the Director of National Intelligence :
I came away from my many visits to the Middle East convinced there is a widespread belief that if America abuses prisoners , then there can be no true freedom for anyone … .
It seemed to me that our greatest sin in the eyes of Muslims was not invading the Middle East , or even our support of Israel : our greatest sin was robbing Muslims of hope .
( p. 331 )
The Dark Side is a gripping history of a very un-American chapter in American history .
One is left wondering just how the United States can begin the long climb out of the moral cesspool that was the Bush Administration .
I have come to the conclusion that it ’s necessary for us to demonstrate to the world ( and to ourselves ) that the past seven years have been an aberration , and that rogue regimes in this country will not be tolerated .
In other words , the “ community of law - abiding citizens [ should join ] in prohibiting , investigating , and prosecuting all acts of torture and in undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual punishment ” as George W. Bush said on June 26 , 2003 , in a statement on the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture . ( p. 238 )
I think the new Justice Department has an obligation to begin a full investigation into war crimes committed during the Bush Administration , and to bring criminal charges if necessary .
I ’m not talking about prosecuting the grunts on the ground who committed the actual acts .
I ’m talking about the people who gave them permission to violate international law and the laws of the United States .
Everybody knows at whose desk the buck stops .
Police believed Weatherley was doing something with his hands in his lap and thought that he might have a weapon .
Weatherley , of Promontory Way , North Arm Cove , attracted attention parked in a no-stopping zone before noon on October 26 .
Weatherley saw the police and drove away , despite them flashing their lights .
The chase lasted five to 10 minutes , with a top speed of just 20 kmh , before Weatherley was stopped at Centenary Drive , Newcastle .
He refused to leave the car .
Four officers used batons and capsicum spray to remove him .
Hollywood Church of Scientology Security Guards Kill Man
The security guards at the Hollywood Church of Scientology facility claim that they acted in self defense yesterday when they killed a man who turned up outside their church building with two samurai swords .
Police report that the man who was killed had previous connections to the church .
The disgruntled man had two swords that he was waving at the three guards .
Fearing for their safety , one of the guards shot him dead with a semi automatic handgun .
The incident was caught on camera so it should be interesting to see if law enforcement officials call it self defense after reviewing the video .
Seems a little scary that the Church of Scientology employs security guards who wield semi automatic weapons .

Maybe they were just thinking about the honeymoon booty .

Cheney 's Contempt for the Republic As Vice President Dick Cheney goes public in exit interviews about his vision of expansive executive powers , it 's getting clearer how close the American Republic came to suffering major deformity – if not destruction – in the past eight years .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
It is also apparent that the risks to the Republic are not over , unless incoming President Barack Obama repudiates many of the executive powers that Cheney and his boss , George W. Bush , made central to their governing style .
In a revealing Dec. 21 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday , Cheney disclosed that he briefed congressional Republican – and Democratic – leaders about the administration ’s program of warrantless wiretapping inside the United States and that the leaders , presumably including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , endorsed the spying .
This so - called “ terrorist surveillance program ” fit with the Bush - Cheney view that the President wields virtually unlimited powers during wartime , even a conflict as vaguely defined as the “ war on terror . ”
Though Cheney cited constitutional precedents from the Civil War and World War II to justify his position , what has made the “ war on terror ” such an insidious basis for asserting the broadest presidential powers is that it is amorphous both in time and space .
Unlike conventional wars that have beginnings and ends – as well as battlefronts – this “ war ” is theoretically everywhere and never - ending .
That means that the principles of a Republic – with constitutional limits on executive power and “ unalienable rights ” for everyone – would not just be suspended during a short - term emergency but essentially be eliminated forever .
In the interview , Cheney argued that the bridge to this new paradigm of an all - powerful Executive was crossed with the de facto granting to the President of the authority to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack .
“ I think that what we 've done has been totally consistent with what the Constitution provides for , ” Cheney told Wallace .
“ The President of the United States now for 50 years is followed at all times , 24 hours a day , by a military aide carrying a football that contains the nuclear codes that he would use and be authorized to use in the event of a nuclear attack on the United States .
“ He could launch the kind of devastating attack the world has never seen .
He does n't have to check with anybody ; he does n't have to call the Congress ; he does n't have to check with the courts .
He has that authority because of the nature of the world we live in .
It 's unfortunate , but I think we 're perfectly appropriate to take the steps we have . ”
Justifying Everything
In Cheney ’s view , it is now the threat of terrorism that justifies other executive powers – everything from spying on Americans and ignoring habeas corpus to torturing detainees and launching military strikes around the world .
“ I think in wartime , when you consider [ the President ’s ] responsibilities as Commander - in - Chief , clearly that means command of the Armed Forces .
It also , when you get into use of forces in wartime , means collecting intelligence .
“ And therefore , I think you 're fully justified in setting up a ‘ terrorist surveillance program ’ to be able to intercept the communications of people who are communicating with terrorists outside the United States .
I think you can have a robust interrogation program with respect to high - value detainees .
“ Now , those are all steps we took that I believe the President was fully authorized in taking , and provided invaluable intelligence , which has been the key to our ability to defeat al - Qaeda over these last seven years . ”
Cheney also argued that the President ’s wartime powers trump laws passed by Congress .
“ The Congress has -- clearly has the ability to write statutes and has certain constitutional authorities granted in the Constitution , ” Cheney said .
“ But I would argue that they do not have the right by statute to alter presidential constitutional power .
In other words , you can't override his constitutional authorities and responsibilities with a statute . ”
Cheney ’s chief regret appeared to be that the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly rejected the administration ’s argument that these presidential powers allowed Bush to ignore fundamental individual rights incorporated in the Constitution , such as the writ of habeas corpus , an ancient legal principle requiring a government to show cause for imprisoning a person .
“ I think that , frankly , the basic decision they [ the Supreme Court justices ] made was wrong , ” Cheney said .
“ But it 's their authority .
The vote was 5 - 4 . ”
In other words , Cheney was suggesting that the replacement of one more justice from the court ’s moderate wing by the likes of John Roberts or Samuel Alito – Bush ’s two appointees – would have swung the Supreme Court into a historic reinterpretation of the Constitution .
Essentially , such a Supreme Court would have made the President all powerful and eliminated the founding U.S. principle of “ unalienable rights ” for individuals , protected by a government based on checks and balances .
Under that new paradigm – of an endless “ war on terror ” and an Executive who decides whether someone is or is not an “ enemy combatant ” – the key pillars of the American Republic would have been in ruins .
Instead of a Republic in which citizens possessed fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution – as the Founders envisioned – Americans would become , in effect , subjects to a monarchical President , who would apportion – or deny – freedoms as he would see fit .
Congressional Blessings Beyond his legal arguments , Cheney noted that after 9/11 , this new paradigm of presidential power was favored by most Americans and embraced by many members of Congress , at least in private .
“ Go back and look at how eager the country was to have us work in the aftermath of 9/11 to make certain that that never happened again , ” Cheney told Wallace .
The Vice President also disclosed that many congressional leaders , including some who have publicly criticized his expansive views on presidential power , privately went along with the administration ’s actions , such as the warrantless surveillance program .
Cheney : “ Well , let me tell you a story about the ‘ terror surveillance program . ’
We did brief the Congress and we brought in – “ Wallace : “ A few members . ”
Cheney : “ We brought in the Chairman and the Ranking Member , House and Senate [ Intelligence Committees ] , and briefed them a number of times up until -- this would be from late ' 01 up until ' 04 , when there was additional controversy concerning the program .
“ At that point , we brought what I describe as the ‘ Big 9 ’ – not only the Intel [ Committee ] people , but also the Speaker , the Majority and Minority Leaders of the House and Senate , and brought them into the Situation Room in the basement of the White House .
“ I presided over the meeting .
We briefed them on the program and what we 'd achieved and how it worked , and asked them , should we continue the program .
They were unanimous , Republican and Democrat alike , all agreed , absolutely essential to continue the program .
“ I then said , do we need to come to the Congress and get additional legislative authorization to continue what we 're doing ?
They said , absolutely not , do n't do it , because it will reveal to the enemy how it is we 're reading their mail .
“ That happened .
I mean , we did consult .
We did keep them involved .
We ultimately ended up having to go to the Congress after The New York Times decided they were going to make the judge review all their -- make all of this available , obviously , when they -- in reacting to a specific leak .
“ But it was a program that we briefed on repeatedly .
We did these briefings in my office ; I presided over them .
We went to the key people in the House and Senate Intel Committees , and ultimately the entire leadership , and sought their advice and counsel and they agreed we should not come back to the Congress . ”
Continued Dangers
Cheney ’s description of a high - level bipartisan consensus on a program that ignored the clear legal requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act suggests that the threats to American liberties go deeper than simply the aggressive actions by the Bush administration .
It means that – among others – House Speaker Pelosi who served as both the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and as House Minority Leader would have been part of Cheney ’s program of White House briefings .
In 2008 , Speaker Pelosi joined in supporting a compromise bill fashioned by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D - West Virginia , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , that granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that collaborated with Bush ’s warrantless surveillance .
Although that bill – and an earlier one approved by the Democratic - controlled Congress in 2007 – effectively legalized Bush ’s apparent lawbreaking , Pelosi argued that one of the strengths of the 2008 bill was that it restated the principle that the President must abide by the FISA law , a paradoxical argument for legislation that ensured that the previous violation of law would go unpunished .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Dems Legalize Bush ’s Crimes . ” ]
When the bill reached the Senate in early summer 2008 , Sen. Barack Obama was one of the Democrats who voted for it , prompting sharp criticism from many in the Democratic “ base ” that Obama was flip - flopping on his earlier protests against Bush ’s illegal spying program .
Now , with less a month before Bush ’s presidency ends , Vice President Cheney has thrown down the gauntlet , again , regarding whether Pelosi , Obama and other Democrats actually will repudiate the Bush - Cheney concept of an imperial presidency .

Left :
This is the same graphic I discussed yesterday , “ How much do you trust the following information sources ? ”
Yesterday , we highlighted the findings from Forrester ’s latest report on consumer trust .
Although there has been quite a bit of discussion on Twitter , on Josh ’s comments ( read former colleague Peter Kim ’s comments ) there ’s been a mixed bag or reviews from Read Write Web and eWeek .
So it ’s out in the open : most corporate blogs are trusted , and the reasons are very obvious .
Let ’s examine the graphic that was provided :
First , review this graphic in a separate window , let ’s start at the bottom and move our way up .
Right above corporate blogs , consumers nearly equally do n’t trust social networking site profiles from a company or brand , no surprise , it ’s often the equivalent of a corporate blog .
Strange that consumers do n’t trust personal blogs ?
We actually saw other findings from data that supports that blogs are not trusted .
Then , moving up the graphic , we start to see an increase in trust from mainstream mediums like email from a company or brand , Wikis , radio , mainstream news websites , and print magazines .
Finally , you start to see an uptake from social networking profiles of people you know , print newspapers , and then the yellow pages .
So , Who Do Consumers Trust ?
Perhaps what ’s most interesting is that the top three are : Email from people you know , consumer product ratings and review , and search engines .
77 % trust email form someone they know .
Makes sense , people we know in our truly intimate of circles are those who we keep closest .
Websites that have a “ Share this via ” email may be a good start , using the vendor Share This is a good start .
Also , this suggests that marketers should start to think about letting other types of content be easily shared from email address to email .
We ’ve always known that email was the first digital social network that mattered .
60 % trust consumer product ratings and reviews : I find both logical but we ’ve some ways to go .
Right now , we ’re leaning on reviews from individuals that may not be in our trust circle .
So as the social graph and eCommerce engines start to tie , we ’ll soon have access to reviews of products from our direct network of folks we really know .
Razorfish has eloquently helped to visualize this concept with this presentation .
50 % : Say they trust portals / search engines :
In Google We Trust , is that Charlene Li frequently used to tell me , and it still holds true .
When you look closely , the search engine results in Google are really social recommendations .
How so ?
The Google algorithm ( while I ’m over simplifying ) puts a great deal of weight on how humans organize , link , and create content .
So in summary , when you look closely , people trust each other .
If you ’re not up to date on Forrester ’s POST methodology , now is the time to learn , I ensure each of my clients knows it on my daily inquiry calls .
For the most part , this methodology is available in public and has been published on blogs and in slideshare , what ’s key is that we understand the common framework of terms , particularly the five objectives : listening , talking , energizing , supporting , and embracing
As Josh alluded to in his comments , it ’s time to focus on energizing ( word of mouth ) , and maybe supporting ( customers helping each other ) –rather than talking ( brands telling consumers )
Let 's take a look at what " Al - Qaeda " has accomplished so far : 1 ) two entire countries turned over the western oil interests , Afghanistan now run by former Unocal consultants 2 ) 3000 dead American civilians in NY , many more sickened by toxic and carcinogenic air , dying of cancer and other diseases , since Bush ordered EPA to tell them air was fine 3 ) 6000 ( approx ) dead Afghani civilians , tens of thousands more starved to death , frozen , maimed and missing arms , legs , eyes , though the countryside is in utter chaos .
CIA - run heroin production which Taliban stopped , now skyrocketing .
4 ) 700,000 ( approx ) dead Iraqi civilians , with triple or quadruple that number permanently maimed , terrorized , displaced , dislocated .
Robbed of all their possessions of a middle class lifestyle , or farming lifestyle , or whatever .
Iraq being carved up by GLOBAL oil interests , with American companies in the lead , not simply to acquire oil for the US market , but to prevent other countries from buying oil directly without subservience to the Washington Consensus , i.e. neo-liberalism , or as Poppy Bush said , " What we say , goes . "
5 ) 2500 +
American troops dead ( which Kissinger called soldiers stupid animals to be used as cannon fodder for political games ) , probably 20,000 + maimed and psychologically damaged ( do n't mention psychologically maimed Iraqis ) , many with permanent injuries , but do n't worry , we 'll cut veterans benefits ( as in the past ) so taxpayers are n't affected
( according to Time , " ... founders of the Chowder and Marching Society , formed in 1949 by 15 fractious young Republicans of the House [ [ Nixon and Ford among them ] to oppose monthly bonuses for war veterans , ... " ) ( see Bonus Marchers shot by Army ) 6 ) 600 +
Lebanese civilians dead , Shiite , Sunni , Druze , and Christians of all sects , mostly farmers , shepherds , and the very poor in the cities , based loosely off America 's War against Al - Qaeda , and with Al - Qaeda offering to " help " Hezbollah , Hz refusing Al - Qaeda 's help ( i think Hz is a legit resistance , as opposed to Al - Qaeda ) 7 ) uncounted numbers ( mostly Arabs , and American troops , but worldwide ) who will die from cancer and other conditions and have an epidemic of birth defects , due to dumping radioactive waste ( depleted uranium ) all over Iraq , Bosnia , Lebanon 8 ) a few hundred dead Israelis , civilians and soldiers as one American officer said about the staged Pearl Harbor event , " It was a cheap price " http://www.silverbearcafe.com/infamy.html
( Lieutenant Commander Joseph Rochefort , head of the Navy ’s Mid-Pacific Radio Intelligence Network . )
Gosh , it looks like this Al - Qaeda Project , rather than being good for Arab liberation , actually serves the role getting them killed and dominated by foreigners .
Who Benefits ?
entirely predictable
Since Al - Qaeda was undeniably , irrefutably an American - British Intelligence creation in the first place ... Hmmm ...
Makes you wonder .
Arab people must be saying , with friends like him , who needs enemies ?
If I were an oil speculator / investor , I 'd be sending Osama a case of Old Malt Scotch for Christmas .
Who 's he working for anyhow ?!!
( The current President is literally an American Intelligence creation ... by his father .
And John Kerry , like Bush and like Heinrich Himmler , is admittedly a member of Skull and Bones ... only he and Bush told a giggling Tim Russert they can't talk about it . )

William Colby , former Director of the CIA , once admitted ( to Congress ) : " The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media . "
This means that potentially EVERYTHING we watch and read and listen to is filtered or shaped by the CIA as a form of disinformation AND social engineering .
Bill Casey , below , agrees .
" We 'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false . " -- William Casey , CIA Director ( from first staff meeting , 1981 ) http://mtracy9.tripod.com/cia_media.htm
THIS IS A hot article on the topic a snippet from Carl Bernstein 's famous 1977 article entitled " The CIA & The Media " from Rolling Stone
There are many , many articles which go even deeper and deeper , into CIA - media , and CIA terror operations overseas and COINTELPRO type domestic operations .
" From 1945 to the end of the century , the United States attempted to overthrow more than 40 foreign governments , and to crush more than 30 populist - nationalist movements struggling against intolerable regimes .
In the process , the US caused the end of life for several million people , and condemned many millions more to a life of agony and despair . "
-- meticulously documented books , Killing Hope and Rogue State by William Blum
According to William Colby , Gladio " stay - behind " secret NATO paramilitary organizations in Western Europe were " a major program " .
This was the 40 year campaign of clandestine terror .
Wikipedia )
The Pentagon and CIA have outsourced many of the tactics of disinformation to specialists : Madison Ave , Hill and Knowlton Group , Rendon Group , etc. are nothing if not slick .
Hill and Knowlton were architects of disinformation on the Gulf War , on the payroll of Kuwaiti oil families .
It is illegal for a foreign govt to stage a giant political PR campaign on the US public , but Bush I did n't care .
The Rendon Group is one of the major PR companies that helped Bush II sell the 2003 Iraq War and the War on Terror .
This is NOT just a single marketing campaign , but an international system of coordinated narrowcasting , branding , and controlling thought via a variety of news viewpoints , both mainstream and " alternative " .
Whistleblowers who happen to get headlines are usually part of the " limited hangout " marketing .
Otherwise , they would remain unheard .
( Rather than getting into " spooky " descriptions , I prefer to describe this as in common " business " terms , marketing strategy to control the public . )
If real whistleblowers are too damaging , they get iced .

answer to the question , if THEY control the media , why did THEY expose Abu - Gharaib and everything bad ?
A snake slithers sideways .
An army attacks at the flank , not head on .
The appearance of democracy is important .
Not Bush 's reputation .
Abu Gahraib was buried by Nick Berg 's timely beheading anyhow .
Dissent and even outrage is fine , helpful if it makes things seem " democratic " , but overall public perception must be managed and stroked .
Is the CIA working FOR America ?
No they 're lookin out for Number One -- themselves , and their bosses and allies .
how much the Nazi- lovin ' Intelligence sector loves America : google McCormack - Dickstein
The 1933 plot to overthrow America and install a fascist dictatorship .
Known as the Bankers ' Plot .
Same people who helped Hitler later formed the CIA .
The only reason it did n't happen is they picked a General who was too honest .
They claimed to be patriotic about America , but like Mussolini was patriotic about Italy .
Crackdown .
Dictatorship .
For their benefit .
Brute Force alone does n't work that well , they found .
It 's better to manipulate much of the public into wanting dictatorship or believing dictatorship is democracy , than imposing it by force and terror alone .
Force is inefficient compared to Television and Music and School .
The Nazis actually learned that from America , via Edward Bernays , the father of modern propaganda and marketing .
Century of Self , a BBC movie , is a pretty good exposé on Bernays effects , as far as that goes .
Learn how they trick us .
see www.Takeoverworld.info/conquest.html for more quotes in their own words I have to admit , Brzezinski's plan for EXITING Iraq sounds very intelligent , and it was posted by
I have to admit , Brzezinski's plan for EXITING Iraq sounds very intelligent , and it was posted by IVAW Brzezinski recently described his plan in this must - watch interview on PBS NewsHour .
Brzezinski proposes what he describes as " pulling out in an intelligent fashion . "
This plan has four parts : 1 ) " Talk at length with the Iraq leadership as to when we have to leave .
Those who say , ' We do n't want you to leave , ' are the ones who leave when we leave .
The real leaders , probably not living in the Green Zone , will say , ' Yes , leave . '
I suspect Sistani is among them . "
2 ) " Then , announce jointly a date , but a date set jointly . "
3 ) " Let the Iraqi government convene a conference of all of Iraq 's Muslim neighbors about stabilizing Iraq and helping it to stabilize .
Most of them will want to be helpful , maybe even Iranians . "
4 ) " We then announce as we 're leaving a donors conference of interested countries in Europe and the Far East who benefit from Iraqi oil on helping to rehabilitate Iraq .
I think this would enable us to leave and still say we achieved basically what we wanted -- the removal of Saddam -- though not a secular , stable , united Iraq under a perfect democracy because that , frankly , is a fantasy . "
This Ain't Your Momma's CIA ( puff piece , but nasty despite a positive spin ) A Cold War CIA report on covert action stated : " There are no rules in such a game .
Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply . " the Agency removed Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala by dropping Coke bottles filled with gasoline to simulate bombing , spreading disinformation over the airwaves --- " It is not true that the waters of Lake Atitlan have been poisoned --- and creating the false impression that the left - leaning government was under siege .
( pure psyop , massive psychological intimidation to overthrow a democracy through terror ) ( this later led to mass slaughter of at least 50,000 by our replacement government )
At the same time , it served as an international endowment for the arts , trying to spread democracy by funding everything from Jackson Pollock 's splatter painting to the magazine Encounter , edited by Stephen Spender and Irving Kristol .
William Kristol , his son , is the head of PNAC , the neo-con think tank charging through the Middle East .
the CIA sent millions of dollars to the Solidarity movement in Poland by way of the international arm of the AFL - CIO .
" make the economy scream , " as Richard Nixon had instructed CIA Director Richard Helms to do in Chile 30 years before .
Excellent analysis of G8 War. from Break for News
More Confirmation .
As they subliminaly set the scene in Afghanistan .
They expect this little NATO
handover ceremony to be repeated in due course -- in Iraq .
therefore the end game is going to be NATO forces all over the globe “ making peace ”
If you support American troops , what about swearing an oath to defend America and the Constitution and ordered to fight under foreign leadership --- the NATO flag ?
The G8 game plan was to send in NATO troops for " peacekeeping " .
In Vietnam , the euphemism was pacifying , pacification .
Dead people tend to be passive .
But first American troops had to go in to the meatgrinder and get chewed up and sacrificed in Iraq and Afghanistan , along with hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians .
After Americans " pacify " everyone --- as Kissinger said , " Military Men are just DUMB STUPID ANIMALS to be Used as Pawns in Foreign Policy . " --- then NATO comes in to maintain order so the proper long - term looting can begin .
CONSIDERING what Al - Qaeda accomplished for the Arabs ,
let 's look at what the Zionists accomplished for Jews : ZIonists had openly declared " War " on Germany in the newspaper .
This exposed unarmed non-Zionist Jews to be shot and gassed , and then left them behind .
Zionists set up Jewish Councils or Judenrat which encouraged Jewish Resistance to back down and reported more radical Jews to the Nazis .
Zionists broke the Euro trade embargo with Nazi Germany , they met with Nazis including Adolf Eichmann .
They diverted donations from saving Jewish lives to helping build up Israel , and Chaim Weitzman was quoted as saying " One cow in Jerusalem is worth a thousand Jews in the Diaspora ( the rest of the world ) "
The betrayal of Euro Jews by Zionists is detailed by True Torah Jews and Jews Against Zionism -- look it up .
I now have seen indications that Hitler was not the main impetus in charge of killing Jews .
Heinrich Himmler and Ludendorff and others were in charge of the Holocaust .
This is not Holocaust Denial .
The Jewish Holocaust was real .
Hitler was the puppet of Himmler and others , partly due to torture and fear of his own life , probably partly due to willingness .
Who was Heinrich Himmler ?
The head of German Nazi SS Intelligence , and literally an occultist worshipper of Lucifer , member of Skull and Bones .
They found a child 's skull in his altar .
Who was Himmler meeting with ?
British and American Intelligence , many of whom were also occultist worshippers of Lucifer in Skull and Bones .
What Americans ?
Rockefeller , Ford , IBM , Dupont , William Hearst ( newspapers ) , Allen Dulles ( founder of the CIA ) , and many other top Wall Street Industrialists and Finance people .
Some other key Wall Street guys included Dulles ' top men George Herbert Walker ( moneyman ) and that lowly tire salesman son- in - law Prescott Bush , who his son George Herbert Walker Bush became CIA director in 1974 , as well as many of these guys also being in Skull and Bones , an organization based on occult worship of Lucifer .
What are the odds the Bush Sr. and Jr. are both admittedly members of Skull and Bones , yet they are devout Christians at the same time ?
Is n't Lucifer - worship and Christianity incompatible ?
for DEEPER info go here : http://www.jfkii.com/ and for God 's sake buy my friend John 's friggin movie !!
It 's GOOD , and it 's not some Democrat partisan trash .
There are some strong similarities in these roles of Zionists and Al - Qaeda .
Who put the Zionists on the map ?
Britain and America .
Who put Al - Qaeda on the map ?
British - born Brzezinski working for America .
I 'd venture that Zionists are about as unhealthy for Jewish lives as Al - Qaeda is for Arab lives , although it does n't seem like that on the surface right now .

Murray , Utah --
Some people just can't wait to open their Christmas presents .
That apparently was the case with a short and very fast thief who went to a store in Murray , grabbed a present and made a clean getaway on all fours .
At Smith 's Food & Drug in Murray , a popular place these days is the manager 's office , where they have the surveillance video .
" You had to see to believe it , but it happened .
So , it 's crazy , " said Tracy Jacobson , with Smith 's Food & Drug .
A suspicious character entered through the front door .
" I 've never seen him shop in here before ; brand new customer , did n't even have his Fresh Value card , " store manager Roger Adamson said .
What happened next is already becoming legend .
" I mean , how likely is that ?
For a dog to walk into a store , go down the pet aisle , get his bone and walk out ? "
Jacobson said .
Let 's reconstruct the crime a step at a time : Entering at the checkout area , the dog approached a young girl .
" He just kind of sniffed the customer up , and then headed down the aisle , " Adamson said .
At that point , he had a decision to make : Left ?
No dog food .
Right ?
Dog food .
He turned right and went straight to aisle 16 , the dog food aisle .
There are so many fun Christmas presents he could have picked , but he seemed to know exactly what he was after .
He grabbed a rawhide bone and headed down the aisle , only to be confronted by the manager .
" I looked at him .
I said , ‘ Drop it ! ' "
Adamson said .
" I decided I wanted to keep all my fingers , so I did n't try to take it from him .
He looked at me , and I looked at him , and he ran for the door and away he went , right out the front door . "
Marshall Tanner with Alpha Dog Training says the culprit 's sense of smell is 100,000 times better than the typical crook .
" [ He ] smelled the rawhide bone , grabbed it and walked out of the store , thereby being a shoplifting dog ! "
Tanner said .
At last word , the dog was still at large , presumably enjoying his Christmas gift .
" He 's enjoying the heck out of it , " Tanner said .
The value of that bone is $ 2.79 .
Merry Christmas , Balto , wherever you are !

Google Play Services is a very important tool that comes pre-installed on Android devices .
The tool is linked to the Android system and this is the reason why we suggest you to NOT disable it or else some of the applications might stop working properly .
The Google Play Services is also automatically checking if there is an update for an installed application such as Google Maps .
This way , you will not need to regularly check if there is an update for an application that you have installed on your device .
As soon as an update is available for an application that ’s installed on your Android device , you will get either notified or the update will be automatically installed ( it depends on how you have set your device to react to updates ) .
Google Play Services : How To Disable It
You can disable the Google Play Services by heading to the device ’s Settings -> Applications ->
All -> Google Play Services ->Disable .
As we ’ve told you above , Google Play Services is a very important tool on Android and if you disable it some of the applications , including those related to Google , will not function properly .
Google Play Services 11.0.38
The latest Google Play Services version that has just been released is 11.0.38 and it can already be downloaded and installed on your device .
The installation file has a size of 33.09MB , meaning that it is 2.11 MB larger than the installation file of the previous version .
Google Play Services 11.0.38 : How To Install On Your Android Device
First of all , you will need to enable the “ Unknown Sources ” option from your device ’s Settings ->Security .
After that , you will need to download the Google Play Services 11.0.38 APK ( installation ) file from the internet .
However , make sure that the website you ’re downloading it from it is trusted , in order to not end up with a malware on your device .

No Deposit Bonus Rules
After you have picked a casino bonus whether it is spins or cash , you will need to follow the rules the casino has specified in their terms .
If you do not , your cash out will be rejected , so it is important to look them over closely and abide by their rules .
Normally this will include game restrictions and amount of times you must wager the bonus .
Commonly this is 50 x to 100 x the amount given or won on the free spins .
Choice of No Deposit Online Casinos
You have the option of select free casino cash to be added to your account or some highly sought after free spins on slot games .
The cash is a good option if you wish to experience many different types of games , however it is given only by a certain group of casinos usually which might not be the best software .
The spins are given on Microgaming casinos that offer a larger selection of machines and have amazing progressive jackpots which has been won majority by Canadians .
The largest online jackpot was won by a player from Ontario , Ca which exceeded 20 million .
Other have won on the free Canada spins promotions or small deposits .
Just because you accepted the free money you can still accept a matching casino bonus and earn loyalty points that you are able to cash out for extra free credits .
Now all you must do is decide on which casino you want to play at , claim the bonus and begin playing .
For user within the USA there is limited amount of no deposit casinos you will be able to play at which you can view on our USA casino page .
The no deposit bonuses are not limited to just these two countries , but others can join as well depending on gaming laws within your country .
Playing at online casinos is a wonderful form of entertainment as long as you are responsible when playing .
Hitting that large sum can be extremely exciting , just do n’t be discouraged if you are unable to cash out all winning at once , some of the places do have daily limits on withdraws .
With more than 1 million dollars spent in R&D , Brandon 's software company was n't keen on paying an outside firm to develop its new product 's site .
The product manager , however , was adamant that the company outsource .
" The last thing we want to do is risk our huge investment , " the product manager reasoned .
" Not only could our developers overcomplicate things , but they could very well neglect key features such as search engine optimization and usability , either of which would be disastrous to a successful product launch . "
While the developers certainly excelled at building complex Web - based applications , a simple HTML - only Web site was n't quite their forte .
The software company hired an interactive marketing firm to build a new site .
Blank Pages
After a few months , the marketing firm delivered the new site .
All told , it looked pretty good :
The site shared the look and feel of the company 's existing Web site , but with its own unique color and layout .
In addition , the copy that marketing developed was nicely presented around screenshots of the product .
Brandon decided to peek behind the scenes to see how the marketing company put the page together .
When he viewed the page 's source code , he was surprised to see a mere 128 bytes of HTML .
< html > < head > < script src=" code.js " ></ script > </head > < body onLoad=" assemblePage ( ) ; " > </ body > </html >
Curious as to the kind of JavaScript voodoo that 's required to build a full - fledged Web page out of a single method call , Brandon opened up code.js .
What he discovered was a strange , custom - built templating system that relied entirely on client - side JavaScript .
The assemblePage ( ) function ran when the page loaded used XmlHttpRequest ( or AJAX ) to get a file called header .
html , which was then inserted into the page dynamically .
Then the process continued with leftsidenav.html , rightsidenav.html , middle .html and footer .
html .
Actual content was loaded the same way , after inspecting the request URL .
What this all meant for users without JavaScript enabled - including many search engine spiders , such as the GoogleBot - was a big blank page .
Against his better judgment , Brandon continued to dive further in the code .
Clearly proud of their JavaScript skills , the marketing firm 's developers took another interesting approach to implementing the " contact us " form .
Rather than submitting the HTML - based form through a POST to some form - mailer script , the " Submit " button triggered a JavaScript function called buildSqlStmt ( ) .
In horror , Brandon watched the function parse the HTML form and build a SQL INSERT statement .
It would then use AJAX to send the SQL statement directly to the server .
Hoping the developers had some sense to restrict database permissions , parse the statement or at the very least ensure that it did n't contain words such as " DROP , " " DELETE , " " UPDATE , " or " ALTER , " Brian looked at the server side handler : execSqlStatement.ashx .
And , of course , the handler offered no protection .
It blindly executed the SQL statement against the database .
Marketing Matters
Brandon brought these concerns to the product manager , who was n't at all pleased that a developer was sticking his nose into " marketing matters . "
After several requests , the product manager finally agreed to schedule a conference call .
" I 'm curious , " Brandon said .
" Does our new Web site support Google indexing ? "
" Absolutely , " the marketing firm 's rep answered .
" That search box on your site - we 're actually using Google to do that , for free , all thanks to our search engine optimizations ! "
As the rep spoke , the product manager glared at Brandon for asking such an asinine question .
" Thanks , " Brandon responded , feigning sincerity .
" I was wondering because , when I visited the page with NoScript , it was just blank .
I figured that if I could n't see it , the GoogleBot could n't either . "
" Oh , " the rep said , clearly disconcerted .
" Well , uhh ... Hold on a sec . "
A minute later , the rep returned , adding : " Our developer just advised that we should probably remove the search box on the site . "
" OK , " Brandon replied .
" Another concern I had was SQL injection .
On the contact us page , if you ... "
" Wait a second , " interrupted the rep .
" Did you say SQL injection ?
You guys really do n't have to worry about that .
I mean , really , that 's only a problem for the government and huge corporations . "
" Yes , but it 's not that hard to prevent ... "
The marketing rep interrupted again : " You see , Brandon , we 're employing a brand - new technology called AJAX that makes your pages load lightning - fast , form submissions quicker and be more responsive .
It 's a win - win for everyone . "
Brandon was n't quite sure how to respond to that .
The product manager saw that as the perfect opportunity to thank the marketing rep for addressing Brandon 's concerns and ended the call .
Fortunately , Brandon was able to sneak in a handful of fixes and patches to the Web site so that it could be indexed and not brought down by a SQL - injection attack .
As for the marketing firm , the word was that it was already working on version 2 of the site .

A federal judge has fined a Belize - based company $ 8,000 for each day it continues to flout his order to halt a major internet operation alleged to have duped more than 1 million computer users into buying bogus malware protection .
US District Judge Richard D. Bennett wrote in a ruling late last week that Innovative Marketing is in civil contempt for failing to comply with a temporary restraining order to stop its scareware campaign and turn over financial records .
The judge imposed the fines after Sam Jain , the company 's chief executive , and four other defendants failed to appear at a hearing .
The rulings come in a case filed by the US Federal Trade Commission .
It outlines a scheme that 's breathtaking for the degree of treachery and sophistication the defendants are accused of sowing to plaster the net with ads designed to trick viewers into paying $ 100 to install malware masquerading as anti-virus protection .
The ads , which appeared on high - traffic websites , pimped a variety of rogue titles including WinFixer , WinAntivirus , DriveCleaner and ErrorSafe .
The suit also named ByteHosting Internet Services , an Ohio - based firm the FTC alleges provided call center service and other support Innovative Marketing needed .
ByteHosting relied on Innovative Marketing for almost all of its revenue , according to the FTC .
On Tuesday , the FTC gave ByteHosting and its owner , James Reno , until January 23 to respond to the allegations .
According to an article by The Business Courier , Reno denied the charges and said he was unable to pay for a lawyer or travel to Baltimore because all of his company 's assets have been frozen . ®
When Kurt Vonnegut died last month , I was prompted to buy his collection of short essays , " A Man Without a Country , " which turned out to be even more delightful than the flap copy promised it would be .
At the risk of a copyright infringement , I 'm excerpting , without permission , explicit or otherwise , my favorite passage in its brief entirety below :
" No matter how corrupt , greedy and heartless our gonvernment , our corporations , our media and our religious and charitable institutions may become , the music will still be wonderful .
If I should ever die , God forbid , let this be my epitaph : THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WAS MUSIC
Now , during our catastrophically idiotic war in Vietnam , the music kept getting better and better and better .
We lost that war , by the way .
Order could n't be restored in Indochina until the people kicked us out .
That war only made billionaires of millionaires .
Today 's war is making trillionaires out of billionaires .
Now I call that progress .
And how come the people in countries we invade can't fight like ladies and gentlemen , in uniform and with tanks and helicopters and gunships ?
Back to music .
It makes practically everybody fonder of life than he or she would be without it .
Even military bands , although I 'm a pacifist , always cheer me up .
And I really like Strauss and Mozart and all that , but the priceless gift that African Americans gavee the whole world when they were still in slavery was a gift so great that it is now almost the only reason many foreigners still like us at least a little bit .
That specific remedy for the worldwide epidemic of depression is a gift called the blues .
All pop music today -- jazz , swing , be - bop , Elvis Presley , the Beatles , the Stones , rock - and - roll , hip - hop , and on and on -- is derived from the blues .
A gift to the world ?
One of the best rhythm - and - blues combos I ever heard was three guys and a girl from Finland playing in a club in Krakow , Poland .
The wonderful writer Albert Murray , who is a jazz historian and a friend of mine among other things , told me that during the era of slavery in this country -- an atrocity from which we can never fully recover -- the suicide rate per capita among slave owners was much higher than the suicide rate among slaves .
Murray says he thinks this was because slaves had a way of dealing withh depression , which their white owners did not :
They could shoo away Old Man Suicide by playing and singing The Blues .
He says something else which also sounds right to me .
He says the blues can't drive depression clear out of a house , but can drive it into the corners of any room where it 's being played .
So please remember that .
Foreigners love us for our jazz .
And they do n't hate us for our purported liberty and justice for all .
They hate us now for our arrogance . "
Over the last week I ’ve been talking about Newsletters a little .
We ’ve covered reasons start a newsletter and how I ’ve increased my newsletter subscriber numbers 10 fold .
Today I want to finish this informal mini-series on newsletters off with some tips for actually writing a newsletter .
How to Write an Email Newsletter
Let me say up front that much of what I write below could equally be applied to ‘ how to write a successful blog ’ ( or in fact could be applied to many mediums of communication ) .
1. Define Your Goals for the Newsletter
This is perhaps the most important thing that I ’ll say in this post because virtually everything else flows from this .
What do you want to achieve with this email newsletter ?
Is it about :
driving traffic to your blog ?
developing community among your readers ?
building a list to ‘ sell ’ to ?
reinforcing your brand ?
making money from advertising sold in the newsletter ?
Something else ?
When you subscribe to a few different bloggers newsletters it becomes quite evident that different bloggers are taking quite different approaches .
For example Chris Brogan ’s newsletter is much more about providing his subscribers with lots of new original content ( it is well worth subscribing to if you ’re into social media and building online communities ) .
He explores a theme each week .
On the other hand my photography newsletter is more about highlighting key articles and discussions on my blog and forums from the last week .
The reason our newsletters are so different is that we have different goals .
My main goal is simply to drive traffic back to my blog .
I find that many of my readers are not using RSS ( quite a few do but there is a sizable proportion of them that have never heard of it ) and so my newsletter is a way of hooking these readers into ‘ subscribing ’ and reminding them to check out fresh content each week .
Chris on the other hand seems to be using his newsletter to give his most committed readers something extra .
This builds and reinforces his brand , builds community and gives those of us who subscribe a feeling of being on the inside of what he ’s thinking ( scary as that might sound ) .
So work hard on defining what you want to achieve with your newsletter .
It can have numerous goals ( for example I use mine to drive affiliate sales from time to time and to build a sense of community ) but keep your primary goal as the main focus .
2. Communicate What Your Newsletter is About to Potential Subscribers
I subscribed to a newsletter a couple of weeks ago because on the subscription page it said that it gave weekly unique , insider tips from the blogger .
However in two weeks I ’ve had 6 emails and they ’ve all been affiliate promotions ( with no insider ‘ tips ’ ) .
There ’s nothing wrong with promoting affiliate products in a newsletter but if you promote it as having original content – provide it .
If your newsletter is going to be largely updates form your blog and a way for readers to stay in touch with that do n’t hide that fact .
It is better to get fewer subscribers who are expecting what you ’ll deliver than having people subscribe to find out that you ’ve tricked them into joining your list .
3. Establish a Voice and Have Consistency
There are no real ‘ rules ’ when it comes to how to write a newsletter .
In the same way that you can write in almost any ‘ voice ’ on a blog you can write in almost any style in a newsletter .
I personally try to keep my newsletter ‘ voice ’ pretty similar to my blog ( personal , as though I ’m speaking to someone ) and I find this effective ( it means that those who enjoy your blog will enjoy your newsletter ) .
My main advice with developing your voice in a newsletter is not to chop and change it too much .
As with a blog – readers come to expect a certain type of communication from you and so when you change things up a lot it can take away from what you might have already built up in terms of connection with readers .
This does n’t mean you can experiment and / or evolve your voice over time but it does mean that you should try to have some sort of consistency in what you present to readers .
This extends to the design and flow of your newsletter also .
I try to stick to the one format over time and find that readers enjoy this consistent approach .
A Comment about ‘ Hype ’ – One important tip to note when it comes to thinking about your ‘ voice ’ is to avoid the ‘ hyped up ’ style that has been used for years by a lot of internet marketers .
I ’m sure a small number of people still get away with this but I find that most users of the web these days are quite suspicious of this style .
Use your newsletter to build relationships and speak to people in a personal way and you ’ll build a list that will stick with you ( and trust you ) over the long haul .
4. Build Value
In the same way that people will not stay subscribed to your blogs RSS feed if it does n’t provide value to them in some way – people wo n’t stay subscribed to your newsletter if it is n’t meeting a need that they have .
This ‘ value ’ and meeting of ‘ needs ’ can take on many forms .
It could be writing original content , giving insider information that you do n’t publish on the blog , could be pointing out tools or resources and can even be simply pointing out ‘ what ’s hot ’ on your blog .
The key is to watch how users interact with the different parts of your newsletter ( see what I write about ‘ tracking results ’ below ) and listening to their feedback .
When you do this you ’ll soon see what they find useful and what they do n’t .
An Important Note about Uniqueness of Content From Your Blog – I see some bloggers say that rehashing what is on your blog in your newsletter is not a good strategy .
They argue that if it ’s not new and unique content in your newsletter that readers wo n’t subscribe .
While I think this applies in some circumstances it has not always been my experience .
My biggest newsletter ( my photography one ) has 45,000 + subscribers and 90 % of it is simply pointing readers to new posts on the blog and forum .
Again – this comes down to knowing your blog ’s goals .
Even rehashing your blog ’s content can be ‘ useful ’ for some readers who do n’t have any other way to subscribe to that blog !
5. Scannable Content
It is important to have scannable content in almost every online medium including blogging – but when it comes to email I find it even more important .
If you ’re using HTML emails you can do this with color , images , bolding , italics , lists , headings etc – but if you ’re using Plain text emails you need to get a little more creative .
Consider using symbols and characters , CAPS for headings , line breaks etc to draw the eye down the page .
Again – track different techniques and layouts to see what works best .
6. Track Results
Depending upon the newsletter tool that you use to publish your emails you should have access to be able to track how people are engaging with your newsletter .
Aweber ( the tool I use ) gives a large variety of stats but so do many other quality newsletter tools .
Some tools give more advanced reports than others but most will at least allow you to track how many people open your newsletters ( this can help you to experiment with subject lines ) and what links are being clicked on by how many people in your posts .
Note : Aweber is the tool I use – also check out Get Response – a tool that many bloggers are using with real success .
Paying attention to what links get clicked is a fascinating and productive thing to do .
It not only helps you to work out how to write an effective newsletter ( and how to improve it ) but it gives you incredible insight into what topics your readers are interested in reading more about and what types of language they respond to .
I look forward to analyzing these stats each week and have many times written followup posts on topics that I see a lot of people clicking on in my newsletter .
7. Subject Lines and Opening Lines Matter
When it comes to blogging the most important words that you ’ll write are your blog ’s title ( they can mean the differences between your post being read or not ) .
When it comes to your email newsletter your subject line really acts as your ‘ title ’ .
I ’m still working on what subject lines work best .
I find that some readers seem to respond best when the subject line is the same each week ( they look for the email each week and like consistency ) while others become blind to the same thing each week .
I ’d be interested in your thoughts on which is best .
Another thing to note is that what you put at the top of your newsletter will almost always get higher ‘ conversion ’ than what you put at the bottom .
The links you have in your opening paragraph will get clicked more , the affiliate campaigns that you have at the top will convert better , the content that you have first will get read more .
It ’s the same concept as placing content ‘ above the fold ’ on a web page – what ’s up top gets the most eyeballs !
8. Use a Reliable Newsletter Service
This is a lesson I learned the hard way .
In my early days of newsletters I used a free newsletter service called Zookoda .
I ’m not sure how it performs these days while it worked well at the start it slowly deteriorated in terms of how reliable it was .
Emails would n’t go out on time and the newsletters that were getting through to those who had subscribed was fewer and fewer every week .
Switching to Aweber saw drastic improvements in how many of my emails were being delivered ( and I mean drastic ) .
The ‘ cost ’ of using a free service may not have been monetary ( well not directly ) – but it was significant because it meant that I was missing out of connecting with thousands of readers each week .
9. Use Double Opt in Newsletter Services
It is very important to only ever start a newsletter that uses Double Opt in techniques to gather subscribers ( ie the person needs to subscribe and then confirm that subscription from an email to them ) .
You can do your brand terrible damage by adding people to your newsletter list without permission or by buying lists of email addresses .
Having double opt in systems does decrease your actual subscriber numbers and causes some headaches – but it is important .
Similarly – give people a way to opt out of your newsletter and use a service that includes your postal address in the newsletter .
These things are the law in many parts of the world and if you do n’t adhere to them you run the risk of not only hurting your reputation with potential readers but suffering the consequences of breaking the law .
3 Bonus Newsletter Tips from Chris Brogan
I used Chris Brogan ’s newsletter as an example above so thought I ’d drop him a note to see what tips he ’d give for budding newsletter developers .
Here ’s what he replied with :
Give useful information more than news .
People * say * they like news , but what they really want are actionable items .
Chunk the text in the newsletter so that it ’s VERY easy to read .
Make it very lightweight .
Write it personably , because this encourages two way interactions , and if your newsletter has a side intent of helping you do business , every two - way touch is a chance for someone to grant you permission to talk business .
If you have a newsletter / s – what tips would you add ?
" I realized there was a penalty and I called an official over , " Hayes said , according to the newspaper .
" He said the penalty was two shots and that I had to finish the hole with that ball and then change back to the original ball . "
Hayes shot a 74 Wednesday and a 71 on Thursday , putting him in good shape to finish in the top 20 and advance to the final qualifying stage in December .
But on Thursday night in his hotel room , Hayes realized that the errant golf ball might not have been on the approved list .
" It was a Titleist prototype , and somehow it had gotten into my bag , " he said , according to the Journal Sentinel .
" It had been four weeks since Titleist gave me some prototype balls and I tested them .
I have no idea how or why it was still in there . "
Hayes had a choice :
He could have said nothing and kept playing , with no one aware of his mistake .
Or he could turn himself in and let his mistake cost him a 2009 PGA Tour card .
He chose the latter .
J.P. Hayes , pictured earlier this year , accepted the consequences for using an unapproved golf ball during Q - school last week .

" I called an official in Houston that night and said , ' I think I may have a problem , ' " Hayes said .
" He said they 'd call Titleist the next day .
I pretty much knew at that point I was going to be disqualified . "
As for his decision to turn himself in ?
" I would say everybody out here [ on the PGA Tour ] would have done the same thing , " Hayes said , according to the report .
Hayes , 43 , is refusing to blame his caddie for the error , saying he should have spotted the errant ball because it did not have a model name on the seam .
" [ The caddie ] kind of wanted to take some of the blame , but he knows I 'm anal about my equipment , " Hayes said , according to the report .
" I go through my bag every night .
I want to know what 's in there .
It 's almost therapeutic for me . "
According to the report , Hayes said that if the hole had been a par - 4 or a par - 5 , he would have known he had the wrong ball right away , because he uses the label to help him align his driver on tee shots .
" But it was a par - 3 and I do n't use the label to line up on par - 3s , " he said , according to the Journal Sentinel .
" It was my mistake .
I had no choice but to take my medicine . "
Business of the House : Government Information ( Unauthorised Release ) ( 4 Dec 2008 )
Andrew Mackinlay ( Thurrock ) ( Lab ) : : A little while ago I had a hand in getting the Prime Minister to reaffirm the Wilson doctrine , and he extended it to modern electronic surveillance .
On the face of it , it would appear that the Wilson doctrine has been abrogated by the police in this case .
Clearly , the e-mails of the hon .
Member for Ashford ( Damian Green ) were looked at .
I venture to suggest that he was listened in to , and ... 4 Dec 2008 : Column 143 Jacqui Smith : I am sorry my hon .
Friend has not received the reply to the letter , which I sent him yesterday and in which I made it clear that the Wilson doctrine as outlined by the Prime Minister has not been abrogated .
[...]
Mr. Parmjit Dhanda ( Gloucester ) ( Lab ) The Home Secretary has been clear and unambiguous today .
Will she go further on the point of my hon .
Friend the Member for Thurrock ( Andrew Mackinlay ) about the Wilson doctrine ?
Can she reassure all hon .
Members that our home numbers , work mobiles and the phones that we use in this House are covered by the Wilson doctrine , as well as our e-mail accounts ?
Jacqui Smith :
As I have suggested , the Wilson doctrine applies , and it applies as outlined by the Prime Minister .
4 Dec 2008 : Column 151
Remember that the Wilson Doctrine is interpreted very narrowly by this Labour Government - the " seizure of evidence " by the Police , when they grab someone 's computer is not " interception of emails " in transit , although the end result in terms of betraying confidential information can be the same .
Since the whistleblower leak inquiry covers the last couple of years or so , what exactly were the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command granted access to , with respect to the Parliamentary email system ?
Were the Police granted access to all of the emails sent and received via Damian Green 's Parliamentary email account ?
Were these emails restricted to only the ones sent to or from the Home Office whistleblower Christopher Galley ( if , indeed , any such emails actually exist at all ) , or were other emails from or to constituents , or correspondents of Damian Green , also scooped up in the data trawl ?
Were the Police granted access to the entire Microsoft Exchange server or shared folders containing correspondence from more than one MP and their constituents ?
Were they granted access to archives or backups , going back 2 or more years ?
There are separate questions about any content of any such emails i.e.
Interception ( which is supposedly covered by the Wilson Doctrine ) and any email server logfiles which potentially betray the identities of other whistleblowers or other confidential journalistic contacts i.e. Communications Traffic Data .
The latter is not covered by the Wilson Doctrine , but it should be .
It appears that Damian Green 's Parliamentary email account was suspended on the Thursday of his arrest .
The Speaker of the House of Commons , Michael Martin appeared to be clueless and not in command of any facts about exactly what privacy , confidentiality and privilege breaches there had , or had not been , regarding the Parliamentary email system .
DNA sequencing is complex , and teaching students how it works can be quite a challenge .
It often helps to use analogies , and give real life examples people are familiar with .
At the University of Toronto they have found the perfect analogy to explain how DNA sequencing works : BitTorrent .
A growing number of Internet users know that BitTorrent is a great tool to download large files such as movies and music albums .
While BitTorrent itself is based on economic principles , only a few know that it can also be used in biology class , since it ’s a great analogy for DNA sequencing .
In a course on ‘ Organisms in their Environment ’ taught by Prof John Stinchcombe at the University of Toronto , this resemblance is used to help students to understand this complex matter .
One of Stinchcombe ’s students told TorrentFreak that he was “ pleasantly surprised ” when he saw BitTorrent being linked to his course material , and shared the slides with us .
Similar to BitTorrent , the first step is to chop the material into small pieces ( with enzymes ) .
After that , all the pieces are put back together again with computer algorithms , thereby reconstructing the DNA .
Similarly , with BitTorrent the pieces are also put back together again , reassembling the file that ’s being shared .
The whole analogy is of course a little oversimplified , but it did at least grab the attention of some of the more tech savvy students .
The slide at the bottom of the post is the one that Prof John Stinchcombe used to compare DNA sequencing to an “ everyday life ” example , with The Pirate Bay as one of its applications .
Is this news ?

WASHINGTON 
What would happen if terrorists attacked the United States at the start of Barack Obama 's presidency ?
The Bush administration does n't want to wait to find out .
It 's planning to test the incoming government 's readiness next month in a series of tabletop exercises involving top Bush and Obama officials .
OBAMA TEAM : Obama 's completed Cabinet a diverse mix EMPLOYMENT : 330,000 applicants vie for administration jobs Concerned about the first handoff of presidential power since Sept. 11 , 2001 , the White House also is preparing briefing books and office manuals designed to bring the incoming Obama administration up to speed in a hurry .
" This is the first wartime transition in 40 years , and it 's probably the first transition in a couple of centuries in which our homeland itself has been under threat , " says White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten , who 's supervising the effort .
The goal is to " make sure that those who are coming in are as well prepared as they can be to deal with an actual threat here in this country . "
Although Obama 's emerging team includes many former Clinton administration officials and members of Congress , most have not served in the executive branch since the Department of Homeland Security was created .
That makes it critically important that they quickly understand the federal government 's terrorism - response capabilities .
White House officials have not said what specific scenarios will be played out in next month 's exercises .
One overriding concern since 2001 has been the possibility that Washington comes under attack .
In that case , plans would need to be in place for the replacement of key government officials .
" They would be smart to be thinking about these things , " says John Fortier , executive director of the Continuity of Government Commission , created by Congress in 2002 to help plan for terrorist attack aftermaths .
" You face a lot of perverse scenarios . "
Norman Ornstein , a presidential and congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has participated in similar tabletop exercises , says the Bush administration 's preparation efforts are " fabulous . "
" No president coming in in the past has had a ready - made crisis management process in place , " Ornstein says .
The briefings and test - runs on domestic terrorist attacks are just part of a broad White House effort to make this the smoothest transition of power in history .
" This … is n't about good manners , " Bolten says .
" It 's about preparing the next administration to deal with the challenges that the country faces .
It 's about our responsibility to the public more than it is about our responsibility to each other . "
Over the past month , federal agencies have hosted scores of meetings with members of Obama 's transition team and prepared reams of documents — manuals for key White House offices , briefing books for key federal agencies and issue briefs on pending policy matters ranging from the threat of pandemic flu to relations with North Korea .
" This is not intended as the administration 's attempt to dictate what the next administration does , " Bolten says .
" It 's intended completely in the spirit of , ' Here 's what we know , you take it from here . ' "
That passing of the torch began at the top the week after Election Day , when President Bush hosted Obama in the Oval Office .
Neither the 43rd nor the incoming 44th president has revealed much about that private talk or any phone conversations they have had since then .
" I was impressed by the questions he asked , " Bush said last week .
" And I told him I would n't reveal them , so that if he ever asked for my advice again , he would feel comfortable doing it . "
Bolten says that Bush and Obama " have already established a good relationship of candor . "
Similar relationships are forming between outgoing and incoming officials .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , for instance , has met and dined with Obama 's choice for the job , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Perhaps the most robust transition was organized by Bolten for his successor , Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Ill .
Earlier this month , Bolten invited the 16 living former White House chiefs of staff to breakfast at the White House " to meet the newest member of the club and provide some counsel . "
Thirteen showed up , including two who date to the Ford administration — Vice President Cheney and his mentor , former secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
" I 'm glad that Rahm had the benefit of so much wisdom around the table , " Bolten says .
" Everybody around that table was pulling for the next administration and specifically wishing Rahm well , and explicitly making themselves available to him . "

Hundreds Rally to Save Market / Octavia Bike Lane
In a powerful show of opposition to a plan that calls for removing the eastbound Market Street bike lane and concrete island at Octavia Boulevard , hundreds of bicyclists , their supporters and local and state elected officials gathered today at the dangerous intersection to loudly urge the MTA to scrap its idea for a shared lane .
" This would indeed be a step backwards , " said State Senator Mark Leno .
" When I first heard about it I thought this is about as counterintuitive as it comes .
Automobile users are breaking the law by turning right so we ’re going to penalize those who are legally using the bike lanes . "
Leno was joined by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano and Supervisors Bevan Dufty , Ross Mirkarimi and David Campos .
State Senator Mark Leno supports a Planning Department vision for the intersection .
" I am frankly tired of this kamikaze corner here , " said Ammiano .
" I think the solution … might have been well intended but it totally misses reality .
Reality is taking the lane is going to cause more carnage , more bad will , and let ’s face it , more rebellious behavior because you know how we are . "
Dufty said he planned to call for a hearing on the issue next month before the San Francisco County Transportation Authority .
" Bicyclists never asked to have a freeway touch down at Market Street here , " said Dufty .
" This is the major thoroughfare for bicyclists to get to work downtown and I really think that this change would absolutely undermine it . "
Mirkarimi directed some of his criticism at law enforcement , pointing out the numerous SFPD and CHP units that turned out at the rally to enforce the no right turn law .
" If we would have as many officers here enforcing this intersection as we have today , my god , I believe that we on the budget committee would be happily surprised by the revenue that is being generated based on the penalty infractions that would be solved just by enforcement right there . "
Leah Shahum , the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition , which organized the rally , said it was the largest turnout she has ever seen for a protest at the intersection .
An estimated 200 people showed up .
SFBC members demonstrate what a colored bike lane would look like at Market / Octavia .
Shahum supports a Planning Department vision for the intersection , which calls for a raised , colored bike lane and extended safety barrier .
To partly illustrate what it would look like , SFBC members used green chalk paint to color a portion of the bike lane .
The plan to remove the bike lane must get the okay from Judge Peter J. Busch because of the current bike injunction .
It ’s unclear what Busch will do January 22nd but he rejected a similar plan in April .
This time , to support its argument a shared lane is needed to reduce collisions , the SFMTA has presented more documentation and the plan has the backing of the SFMTA Board .
Campos called on the Board of Supervisors to provide more oversight of the MTA .
" I think it ’s very important for the Board of Supervisors to keep a
close eye on what the MTA does and I want to send a clear message that
we are going to pay close attention , " Campos said .
" If
they do n’t do the right thing , we need to think about what legislative
solutions can be put in place so that we do n’t see ourselves back in
this position again . "
Bicycle advocates have made it very clear they do n’t support the status quo at the intersection but credit the bike lane and concrete barrier with dramatically reducing the number of illegal right turns .
At least 15 collisions have been reported at the intersection in the last three years , according to the MTA .
" We ’ve still got a problem at this intersection .
It ’s still scary and it ’s still dangerous .
All we ask is that we not move backwards by taking away this bike lane , " said Shahum .

Here ’s a computer ad from 1956 – it ’s for Univac computers , a brand name that was as synonymous with “ computer ” in the same way that “ Xerox ” was once synonymous with “ photocopier ” :
Here ’s the text of the ad .
If it seems a little strange to your modern sensibilities , it ’s because it ’s ad copy from the era of Mad Men — that ’s just how advertising was back then .
Note that lack of technical jargon or specs , neither of which would ’ve been useful back then , when very few people would ’ve known what they meant :
“ You ’re Trying to Divide by Zero ” A scientist , testing a formula on Univac recently , was amazed to see the computing system stop , then automatically type the reproof : “ You ’re trying to divide by zero . ”
A quick check proved that Univac , as always , was right .
This graphic demonstration points out just one of the many Remington Rand refinements in the art of computer programming and operation .
For Univac has been trained to spot human errors .
It can now carry out commands given in simple business English .
It can even manufacture its own program of instructions automatically – at electronic speeds , with unparalleled accuracy .
These skills have been developed as a direct result of Univac ’s unique position in the field of electronic data - processing .
Because , with every Univac delivered goes 10 years ’ experience in electronic computing … 5 years ’ experience in the commercial type of data - processing .
This wealth of background in programming and operation is unobtainable elsewhere .
The unprecedented savings of Univac data - processing have been proved by solving actual consumer problems – not by working out theoretical solutions with non-existent computers .
You can be sure that , when you install the Univac , you ’ll get under way faster , surer and more economically because the System has already handled similar work .
Univac is now at work in leading organizations throughout the country .
And , in today ’s competitive market , the company which cuts its overhead first comes out on top .
So do n’t wait until 1957 … 1958 … or 1959 to cash in on the tremendous savings available to you now with the Remington Rand Univac System .
Some observations :
Error messages : while old hat to even modern laypeople , must ’ve seemed like a great leap forward back then .
while old hat to even modern laypeople , must ’ve seemed like a great leap forward back then .
“ Univac , as always , was right . ”
Can you imagine even Apple ’s blowing - sunshine - up - your - ass ads making that claim about their machines today ?
Can you imagine even Apple ’s blowing - sunshine - up - your - ass ads making that claim about their machines today ?
“ It can now carry out commands given in simple business English . ” I ’m guessing that they mean COBOL .
One era ’s technological wonder is another era ’s coding horror .
[ Update : Looks like I got my programming language timelines wrong .
“ mistercow ” points out on Reddit that COBOL did n’t appear until 1959 and suggests that the “ commands in simple business English ” language is probably FLOW - MATIC , one of COBOL ’s predecessors . ]
“ … with every Univac delivered goes 10 years ’ experience in electronic computing … 5 years ’ experience in the commercial type of data - processing " .
These short timeframes may seem quaint , but keep in mind that the concept of what is computable is n’t even 100 years old yet .
You should also note that web applications are only slightly older than 10 years and that XMLHttpRequest , which makes Ajax possible , turns ten in the new year ( it was released by Microsoft as an ActiveX object for Internet Explorer 5 for Outlook Web Access in 1999 ) .
And finally , two things that a programmer in today ’s economy should keep in mind .
It ’s almost as if they ’re special messages sent through time :
“ The unprecedented savings of Univac data - processing have been proved by solving actual consumer problems – not by working out theoretical solutions with non-existent computers . ” “ … in today ’s competitive market , the company which cuts its overhead first comes out on top . ”
Although these statements were made back when computers were rare and extremely expensive and well before there was a computer on every office desk – in fact , well before computers could even fit on desks – they hold true today .
If you ’re a programmer looking to make a living in 2009 , it ’ll pay to develop applications that solve actual problems and either help people make money or save it .
To borrow a line from Don Dodge at Startup Empire , make sure your applications are aspirin ( must - haves ) , not vitamins ( nice - to - haves ) !

SAN DIEGO 
Over the last two years , some of this city ’s darkest secrets have been dragged into the light  city officials with conflicts of interest and hidden pay raises , affordable housing that was not affordable , misleading crime statistics .
Investigations ensued .
The chiefs of two redevelopment agencies were forced out .
One of them faces criminal charges .
Yet the main revelations came not from any of San Diego ’s television and radio stations or its dominant newspaper , The San Diego Union - Tribune , but from a handful of young journalists at a nonprofit Web site run out of a converted military base far from downtown ’s glass towers  a site that did not exist four years ago .
As America ’s newspapers shrink and shed staff , and broadcast news outlets sink in the ratings , a new kind of Web - based news operation has arisen in several cities , forcing the papers to follow the stories they uncover .
Here it is VoiceofSanDiego.org , offering a brand of serious , original reporting by professional journalists  the province of the traditional media , but at a much lower cost of doing business .
Since it began in 2005 , similar operations have cropped up in New Haven , the Twin Cities , Seattle , St. Louis and Chicago .
More are on the way .
Hitler 's pub dart bomb :
The secret Nazi weapon drawn up to terrorise Britain
The drawings for the ' Silent Dart ' were found in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin .
Towards the end of the war Hitler became increasingly desperate to find ' weapons of terror ' which he could use against the Allies
By Daily Mail Reporter
With deadly accuracy and at speeds of up to 700 mph , it could have pinpointed Nazi targets and wreaked havoc on Britain .
At least , that is what German scientists believed as they plotted this weapon of terror .
Hitler became increasingly desperate for a way to thwart his enemies at the end of the Second World War .
And so the Nazis dreamed up the Silent Dart .
The glider would be released from a larger aircraft .
Guided by a Luftwaffe pilot inside , the dart would dive towards the ground carrying its 1,000 kg bomb .
At the last moment , the pilot would release the bomb and inflate a huge balloon attached to the craft .
As the bomb hit its target , the balloon was supposed to whisk the glider far up above the danger area , so it could travel to safety .
The plans , which have come to light more than 60 years after their creation , may sound implausible - but pencil drawings of the dart found by the Allies in July 1945 show that for the Nazis , it may have seemed a real possibility .
These previously unseen drawings were rescued from Hitler 's Chancellery at the end of World War II .
The glider carrying the bomb has been designed in the shape of a pub dart
The bombs would have been guided by a Luftwaffe pilot such as this one photographed during a raid over London
Auctioneer Richard Davie , who is selling the sketches , said : ' There is no date on the plans so we do n't know whether they were not acted upon because there was no time , or whether there was another reason .
' The glider would have used the flying principle of a pub dart .
It would be released from a mother ship and then directed by a pilot , which is not a job I would want .
' Then as the pilot released the bomb a balloon would simultaneously inflate and this would add stability and elevation to the glider .
' This enabled the pilot to get away from the blast so he could make safety and then have another go - unlike a Kamikaze pilot .
' It would have worked a bit like a Kamikaze mission but without the death of the pilot .
' The designs were found at the Reich Chancellery , in Berlin , at the end of the war and have rarely been seen since . '
The drawings were discovered by Richard Rex , who had been sent to Germany to help establish a medical dispensary for use during the Potsdam Conference .
The drawings are undated but go into detail about how the cockpit should be constructed and where the various instruments should sit
Rescue workers and policemen pull a woman from the wreckage of a surface shelter which was destroyed by a flying bomb .
The V1 and V2 bombs were all put into operation towards the end of the war
This is a Nazi flying bomb in flight immediately after release .
The conference had been convened to decide how defeated Germany was to be governed in the post - war world .
They belonged to his family and were then sold to a private collector who is in turn selling them , International Autograph Auctions explained .
Retired Air Commodore Graham Pitchfork , who is an aviation historian , said : ' Towards the end of the war a lot of highly unusual projects were developed by the Nazis .
' However implausible this might appear to us , German scientists were renowned for their resourcefulness and invention .
' While this sounds an implausible way of getting a bomb on target the Germans were increasingly desperate by the end of the war .
' They were desperate to find a terror weapon which is why they developed the V1 , V2 and the V3 . '
The plans , which are thought to be worth between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 , will be sold in London on Saturday .
Mr Bush said nations must stand together amid the global financial crisis
US President George W Bush has said the serious global financial crisis demands a serious global response .
He spoke after talks with heads of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in Washington .
At the White House , Mr Bush pledged the G7 most industrialised nations would take robust action together .
On Friday , G7 finance ministers agreed to take moves to free the flow of credit , back efforts by banks to raise money and revive the mortgage market .
Announcing no new policies , Mr Bush said : " We must ensure the actions of one country do not contradict or undermine the actions of another .
" In an interconnected world , no nation will gain by driving down the fortunes of another .
We are in this together .
We will come through it together . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

He was joined by G7 finance ministers from Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , as well as IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn and World Bank President Robert Zoellick .
Amid widespread fears of a global recession , Asian , European and US markets continued to panic sell on Friday despite rate cuts and cash injections by central banks .
Late on Friday , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the US planned to invest directly in banks in a programme of partial nationalisation , the first since the 1930s , following a similar UK move .
[ We must ] redirect the markets so that they serve the people , and not ruin them
Angela Merkel
German Chancellor
Peston : Global fix needed Q&A : Why the big market falls ?
Timeline : Global credit crunch G7 finance ministers earlier did not rule out adopting another part of the British plan - to guarantee borrowing between banks - as they issued a five - point communique in Washington .
They also kept open the possibility of further cuts in interest rates and taxes .
But BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker , in Washington , says there is some disappointment that the G7 plan lacks detail .
Meanwhile , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be no common financial rescue fund for Europe , like the US bail - out of Wall Street .
The two spoke on Saturday in eastern France where they were commemorating the 50th anniversary of Franco - German reconciliation after World War II .
Chancellor Merkel said " there is no question of a European fund " , while Mr Sarkozy said such a move would pose " gigantic problems " in terms of co-ordination between European nations .
The German leader said governments must " redirect the markets so they serve the people , and not ruin them . "
The two leaders said a common approach to the financial crisis would emerge from a Paris summit on Sunday of 15 eurozone leaders .
Gordon Brown , prime minister of the UK , will hold talks with Mr Sarkozy in the French capital before the meeting .
The heads of the EU 's four biggest economies - Britain , France , Germany and Italy - held a first crisis summit last week but were split over the need for a common plan .
Analysts say another week of plunging stock markets has focused minds and the real test of this weekend 's scramble by world leaders to shore up the international financial system will come once markets reopen again on Monday .

Question Time , the BBC 's premier political debate programme chaired by David Dimbleby , was in Washington on Thursday 30 October for a US election special edition .
The panel included adviser to Barack Obama , Elizabeth Edwards , executive director of John McCain 's campaign in New York , Christopher Nixon Cox , author and journalist Clarence Page , historian Simon Schama and political consultant Cheri Jacobus .
As well as BBC One , the programme can also be seen on BBC World News .
See TV schedules .
ELIZABETH EDWARDS
Career : Elizabeth Edwards is a senior adviser on health care to the Barack Obama campaign .
She is the wife of former senator John Edwards who was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2004 and who was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination this year .
She worked as a bankruptcy lawyer in North Carolina and , following the death of her son in a car crash in 1996 , subsequently devoted much of her time to running the charitable foundation set up in his name .
She campaigned with her husband when he successfully ran for the Senate in 1998 and was seen as an influential voice in the failed Kerry / Edwards campaign that lost out to President Bush in 2004 .
The day after John Kerry conceded defeat in November 2004 , Elizabeth was diagnosed with breast cancer .
She has since campaigned enthusiastically for health care reform in the US , arguing for mandatory health insurance to help the 47 million Americans who are not covered at present .
She clashed publicly with the McCain campaign earlier this year when it criticised her health care plans , saying : " He has not spent a single day not protected by a federal health plan , not a single day of his entire life , and yet he denigrates this care . "
After news broke of her husband 's extramarital affair , she criticised the media coverage saying : " Our family has been through a lot , some caused by nature , some caused by human weakness , and some - most recently - caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences . "
CHRISTOPHER NIXON COX Career : Christopher Nixon Cox is the executive director of Senator McCain 's presidential campaign in New York , and has been heavily involved in campaigning in the neighbouring key swing state of Pennsylvania .
He is the grandson of former Republican President Richard Nixon , and took an early interest in Republican politics , volunteering for the presidential campaigns of Bob Dole and George W Bush .
He is a co-founder and managing partner of OC Global Partners , a financial advisory company that specialises in assisting business transactions in the Middle East and throughout eastern Asia .
He says he believes that the Republican Party is reinventing itself from within , and he has been pleased to recruit a lot of young people , women and people from ethnic minorities to his team .
He says he has been " highly impressed by the character " of John McCain : " He 's served his country honourably .
He says what he means and he speaks the truth .
He 's a real leader and he 's prepared to lead this country from day one . "
CLARENCE PAGE Career : Clarence Page is a Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist and author .
He currently writes a nationally syndicated political column for the Chicago Tribune and has covered the presidential race extensively .
He joined the Tribune in 1969 and was subsequently drafted to serve as an army journalist in the Vietnam War , where he served until 1971 .
He went on to take part in a Pulitzer - winning investigation into voter fraud in Chicago , as well as being honoured by the American Civil Liberties Union for his columns on constitutional rights .
He received the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1989 .
His first book Showing My Color : Impolite Essays on Race and Identity became a bestseller .
Commenting on the unique nature of this year 's presidential race , Page said at the weekend : " Obviously these days the economic crisis on Wall Street and Main Street has eclipsed all other issues .
As one friend put it , when your house is on fire , you do n't care about the race or religion of the firefighter who shows up to put it out . "
SIMON SCHAMA Career : Simon Schama is a professor of history and art history at Columbia University in New York , and the author and presenter of numerous television series .
He has been resident in the USA since 1980 , when he took up a post at Harvard University .
He wrote and presented the BBC series A History of Britain as part of the millennium celebrations which ran to 15 episodes and three spin - off books .
His latest project is the BBC series The American Future : a History , which looks at the 2008 presidential race from a historical perspective .
He has been outspoken in his support for Barack Obama and wrote in the Daily Mail recently : " What Obama offers is the rarity of a leader who understands the moment as a rebirth of the nation .
In his strongest speeches he says the people can re-invent America without losing its imperishable virtues .
This can happen and must happen . "
He criticised John McCain 's threat to withdraw from the first presidential debate last month , writing : " He evidently thinks that the American people will believe the worthiness of debate is a sign of weak government .
He has it exactly wrong .
Explaining to the American people what has gone amiss and , much more importantly , what can be done to repair the disaster is precisely what the candidates should be doing . "
CHERI JACOBUS
Career : Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political consultant and strategist based in Washington D.C.
She graduated from West Virginia University with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism and founded her own consultancy in 1998 .
She has worked across numerous Congressional campaigns and was a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee during the Clinton era .
She has echoed the criticism of the media by Republican vice presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , writing last week : " The electorate has been largely duped by a liberal activist media - far worse than mere left - wing bias - and the consequences could be disastrous . "

Microsoft force - installs Firefox extension
I have n’t worked with Visual Studio and .NET for a while , but in my current project that ’s the platform .
I downloaded a necessary update , and as it turned out , Microsoft hit a new low …
Background
The update I installed was Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 , and naturally it was needed as an update to Visual Studio .
In that page there ’s a long list of the software that will be installed , which are all Visual Studio components .
What happened
What came as a complete surprise to me is that it also installed an extension in Firefox , mentioned nowhere in the documentation and not as an optional install in the installer .
Ok , bad and annoying enough , but things were about to get worse …
Trying to uninstall it from the Add - ons menu ( Tools > Add-ons in Firefox ) , the Uninstall button is disabled !
Yes , my dear developers , Microsoft has actually and intentionally made it impossible to uninstall it !
Such behavior and thinking goes completely opposite to the nature of the web , and it ’s definitely not the stance of any other Firefox extension – or any software whatsoever , actually !
No developer in his or her right mind would do this to an end user , so I ’m sure it ’s some “ clever ” middle management guy who thought this up …
How to remove it
Against what many people think , though , it can be uninstalled – but by nothing less than hacking the actual registry of Windows !
Open your Start Menu and choose Run .
Type in regedit and press enter / click OK .
Within there , you have to look for something called HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SOFTWARE \Mozilla \Firefox\extensions and delete the key there ( for Windows Vista 64 - bit HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions ) .
When you have done that , type in about : config in the address bar in Firefox , accept the warning and then remove general.useragent.extra.microsoftdotnet and microsoft.CLR.clickonce.autolaunch .
And , to finish it off , open Windows Explorer and go to \WINDOWS \Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5 \Windows
Presentation Foundation \DotNetAssistantExtension\ to remove the last remnants of the evil extension .
Instructions thankfully found through Remove the .NET Framework Assistant 1.0 from Firefox .
BAD Microsoft
Microsoft , this is just not how to do things .
Just since your own web browser is so hard to extend , do n’t mess up good competing products – fix your own shit .
And seeing that this problem has been around since last August just makes me even more mad , because Microsoft does n’t lift a finger to even offer a single option to avoid this .
Microsoft killed Firefox !
You BASTARDS !

We can compare our energy levels to , let 's say , an air in a car tire .
If the tire has no holes , it can keep the air inside for years .
If the tire has a hole , even a tiny one , it will deflate with time and all your efforts to pump it up will be useless until you plug that hole .
The same applies to your energy level .
Before deciding where to begin to increase it , I would recommend looking at your energy zappers first .
No matter how strenuously energy boosting you do , the energy will just continue to drain until you plug your " holes " .

Check out these energy zappers and see how many apply to you .
1 Lack of sleep
Sleep is a time for replenish the energy , repair and restoration of body muscles and tissue .
So a poor night sleep is the biggest and fastest energy zapper .
One bad night can spoil the next 24 hours of your life .
When it comes to sleep , both quantity and quality matter .
Lack of sleep , disrupted sleep , and irregular sleep patterns have a dire effect on energy levels , creativity , mental alertness , general wellbeing and health .
People who are unable to sleep properly at night tend to be weary most of the time and lack the ability to concentrate .
What to do ?
Simply trying to go to bed earlier will fail in most cases .
If you go to bed when you are not enough sleepy it takes a long time to fall asleep .
The very attempt to force yourself to sleep actually awakes you , making it even more difficult to fall asleep .
Go to bed when you are sleepy and get up at the same time every morning .
If you got not enough sleep one night , you will feel drowsy earlier and get more sleep the next night .
If you are full of energy and are n't exhausted , you may need somewhat less sleep hours .

2 Weekend oversleep
Do you look forward to the weekend to sleep yourself out ?
Carrying a sleep debt throughout the week with the hopes of paying it off on the weekend is a bad strategy .
Studies have found sleeping longer than usual on weekends can disrupt your body 's natural sleep schedule ( circadian rhythm ) 1 .
What to do ?
I think the key here is to establish your sleep schedule and have a will - power to follow it on weekends .
3 Clutter , mess and disorganization
Our cluttered , disorganized and unpleasant surroundings can drain us of more energy than we realize .
According to the American Demographic Society , Americans waste more than 9 million hours each day looking for lost and misplaced items !
Looking for lost or misplaced stuff is a huge physical drain .
Being long looking for necessary thing adds emotional drain .
And trying to remember where all things are is a big mental drain .
Just being in a cluttered room makes a person tired .
A cluttered environment tends to clutter your mind .
What to do ?
Clean your clutter and organize your environment .
Give everything a storage place .
Throw out items you no longer need or love .
Some areas you might consider giving a clean - up : work - place , home , wardrobe , computer .
4 Procrastination : unfinished tasks and projects
Everything undone , incomplete or unresolved in your personal or professional life drains your energy .
As long as affairs are left unfinished they continue to distract you .
Procrastination is quite toxic .
I have noticed if there is something I have left undone it keeps running through my mind until it is done .
This causes needless energy spending .
What to do ?
Try outsourcing your life .
See which tasks can be eliminated or delegated .
Decide what you are n't going to do .
Focus on what is really important and can actually be done .
Also , do n't put off till tomorrow what you can do today .
5Anger
Anger can be a powerful destructive force .
It drains your energy and makes you waste your time in negative thinking .
Most people have some difficulty handling their anger .
The problem is usually not the anger itself but the ways in which it is expressed .
Some people express their anger in aggressive ways , such as breaking things , lashing out at others , exploding in rage , intimidating and offending .
Others express their fury indirectly , in passive - aggressive ways like sarcasm , nagging or silence and withdrawal .
All of these ways are destructive and simply do n't work , since they just keep you stuck in the anger and drain your emotional , physical , and mental energy .
What to do ?
Of course there are exceptions : some people redirect anger towards building success for themselves , but on the whole anger is draining rather than invigorating .
When you find yourself engaged in anger , change the focus .
6 Living beyond your means : Overspending
Living beyond your means is a persistent energy zapper .
Trying to keep up with co-workers and friends who have a larger financial resource than you will certainly create financial trouble .
What to do ?
Sticking to the budget that fits your level of income can help prevent your energy from being zapped by worry how to pay bills each month .
Know exactly how much you have to spend and use money wisely .
When going out for shopping keep a list of items which you " really " need to buy and stick to your list .
Develop plan for financial future and try to increase your source of income .
Having freedom from financial stress can certainly assist in achieving your goals in different areas of life .
7 Information overload & addiction
Do you feel overwhelmed with the amount of information that enters your life in the form of media , books , magazines and e-mail ?
The excess of unnecessary information is a modern and gaining strength drainer of your time and energy .
Worse , perhaps , the information glut dulls your ability to think .
Just because we have access to all the information in the world does n't mean we can process it all .
Do you like blogs , e-mail and social networking sites to get the latest news and keep in touch ?
But that love can quickly turn into an obsession if you are n't careful .
What to do ?
You have to decide which information is important enough to read , watch , or pay attention to .
William Van Winkle observed , " Data is like food .
A good meal is served in reasonably sized portions from several food groups .
It leaves you satisfied but not stuffed .
Likewise with information , we 're best served when we can partake of reasonable , useful portions , exercising discretion in what data we digest and how often we seek it out . "
8 Resentment : taking offence
Resentment drags you down and keeps you grasped by your past .
In most cases where resentment takes place , the only person who suffers is the victim of the incident .
What to do ?
The only way the sufferer can get rid of the burden of resentment is forgiveness .
Yea , this can be very difficult to achieve !
But for as long as you continue to resent your offender , he or she will sap your joy for living and haunt your dreams at night .
9 Worrying & Control issues
We spend a lot of time and energy trying to control everything that goes on around us : events , people and situations .
Some people feel an urge to fix every problem that comes up but it is impossible to create a perfect world .
Constant worrying drains your brain of energy and focusing power , and it is a waste of your precious time .
This is one of the most difficult to get rid of since worrying is completely irrational , yet something so inherently human .
What to do ?
When you are faced with difficulties or challenges , ask yourself " What 's the worst that can happen ? "
Though usually the worst does n't happen , such question helps switch the thoughts from worry and empowers you to come up with a plan .
The energy waste is reduced , turning your force into a creative power .
Let go off things you can't control and focus on what you can !
Ask yourself if there is some action you need to take .
If there is no action you need to take , then say to yourself : " There is nothing I need to do about this right now , so there 's no point in focusing on it . " and switch your attention elsewhere .
10 Gossiping
People waste so much time , and create a negative environment by gossiping .
It is a real energy drain to discuss others negatively .
In fact , next time you gossip , take notice how your energy is lower than before you gossiped .
What to do ?
If you find yourself in a conversation with a gossip , although you may have no other choice but to listen , do not engage .
When there is a break in conversation try to change the subject .
11 " Energy vampires "
Did you ever talk to someone and felt tired , drained , depressed and exhausted afterwards ?
We often call such persons " Toxic people " or " Energy vampires " .
They suck positive energy out of you and leave feeling so mentally , emotionally , spiritually , and physically drained .
Toxic people are those who complain or grumble all the time , constantly in need for help , advice , sympathy , or confidence - boosting .
They always expect the worse to happen .
They encourage you to have feelings of guilt , inadequacy or inferiority .
They blame others , spoil for a fight , and provoke quarrels .
However , there are other , more subtle toxic people .
Deliberate " energy vampires " may be very appealing , charming , highly inventive or compellingly persuasive .
What to do ?
One of the first things to do is to be aware of who the energy vampires are in your life .
Try to avoid toxic people if possible or limit time with them .
Whenever the negative talk starts just smile and do n't say anything .
The less you pay attention to them , the less they 'll affect you .

12 Poor diet
When fast food and processed food is your main diet your body is not provided with enough vital nutrients such as vitamins , minerals , fiber , and essential fatty acids .
There are good chances your body will experience deficiencies of vital nutrients such as vitamins , minerals , fiber , and essential fatty acids .
Sugary food may promise a quick rush of energy but are followed by an energy crash .
These foods trigger a large output of insulin , which lowers blood sugar and leaves you feeling sluggish .
Too much food is just as dangerous for your energy as too little food .
Too many kilocalories will leave you lethargic .
Too few and you 're deserting without the fuel and nutrients you need .
Waiting too long between meals can also sap your energy .
If you skip meals , your body slows the metabolic rate and starts conserving energy because it lacks nutrients .
What to do ?
Eat healthy !
Reduce the amount of processed foods .
Focus on increasing fruits , vegetables , whole grains , fish , low fat dairy products and lean meats .
13 Overwork
Being chronically overworked can seriously drain energy reserves .
When your job extends over working hours , the things that could recharge your energy battery suffer as well .
You get less sleep , less rest , and load up on caffeine .
What to do ?
It 's important to seek a proper work - life balance in order to maintain energy levels .
Work to live , do n't live to work .
14 Endless " to - do " list
Too many commitments are extremely exhausting .
Often , just thinking about what you have to do is draining .
In addition to the physical force that chores like cleaning the house , cooking , and grocery store shopping demand from you , they drain your time and energy without giving much joy .
What to do ?
Simplify your to - do list up to the few really essential tasks .
Organize your list - prioritize which ones you think should be done first .
If something can be delegated to someone else , then do it .
Also , make sure that once you complete the task , it 's done properly .
This helps to avoid going back and re-do anything .
15 Lack of exercise
Lack of exercise = lack of energy .
It 's a downward cycle :
If you do n't exercise , you can ' be fit , and if you 're not fit , you wo n't have the energy to exercise .
During physical activity neurotransmitters called endorphins are released into your blood stream .
These chemicals give you a feeling of happiness , promote positive emotions , and contribute to a sense of well - being .
What to do ?
Even though it seems like exercise might deplete your last remaining energy reserves , it 's actually the best way to beat fatigue and feel refreshed .
Even though it seems like exercise might deplete your last remaining energy reserves , it 's actually the surest way to combat fatigue and feel energized and refreshed .

Just when you think Joe Biden could not embarrass himself any more , he can’t help but prove you wrong .
A recently resurfaced video now making the rounds shows the Democratic presidential nominee calling a crowd of U.S. service members “ stupid bastards . ”
CLICK HERE TO VIEW THIS VIDEO .
This most recent gaffe is not a new one , but it is certainly just as cringeworthy as the rest of Biden ’s biggest hits .
“ I have incredibly good judgment , ” Biden says in the video .
“ One , I married Jill , and two , I appointed Johnson to the academy .
I just want you to know that . ”
There is then a short pause as Biden awkwardly waits for applause that is n’t going to come .
“ Clap for that , you stupid bastards , ” he says .
The description of the video , which was posted on YouTube in 2017 , reads “ Vice President Joe Biden , recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom calls A room full of servicemen and servicewomen at an undisclosed location in southwest Asia stupid bastards in March 2016 . ”
Given that description , it appears the video is from a speech Biden gave to the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing at an undisclosed location in Southwest Asia on March 7 , 2016 .
The timing of this video ’s resurfacing is especially troubling for Democrats .
Only a few weeks ago , anonymous sources in a controversial Atlantic article alleged that President Donald Trump once called soldiers who were killed in action “ losers ” and “ suckers . ”
The truth of the article ’s claims has since been disputed by former National Security Advisor John Bolton , a man who has absolutely no reason to protect Trump given their falling out .
All in all , 21 on - the - record sources denied Trump made the comments , according to the Washington Examiner .
Nonetheless , Biden used the story as an opportunity to attack Trump , apparently forgetting about his own comments from 2016 .
“ Mr. President , if you do n’t respect our troops , you ca n’t lead them , ” the former vice president tweeted .
Unlike the anonymously sourced Atlantic article , however , it is undeniable that Biden disparaged soldiers during his remarks in 2016 .
In all fairness , Biden could have been joking , but whatever joke he was trying to make is far from obvious .
That ’s the problem with Biden nowadays :
The former vice president has become so nonsensical with his statements that many have cause to wonder whether his mental state is beginning to decline in his old age .
And Biden appears to be far worse now than he ever was in 2016 .
A series of verbal blunders and gaffes have defined the candidate ’s less - than - stellar campaign so far .
Perhaps the most famous example came during the presidential nominee ’s interview on the popular radio program “ The Breakfast Club , ” hosted by a man going by the name Charlemagne Tha God .
Toward the end of their interview , Charlemagne suggested that Biden has quite a lot of work left to do to win over black supporters .
Biden ’s response has since been criticized as borderline racist at best .
“ If you have a problem figuring out whether you ’re for me or Trump , then you ai n’t black , ” Biden replied .
Although he later apologized , the gaffe haunts the Biden campaign to this day .
Now , his comments about soldiers will as well .
It ’s hard to guess which class of people this bumbling candidate will insult next .
We ’ll likely find out soon enough .

WATCH : Biden Calls US Troops ' Stupid Bastards '
By Bronson Stocking | Townhall.com
If the media thought the fake news about Trump calling fallen World War One soldiers " suckers " and " losers " was breaking news , there 's no excuse for them to ignore this resurfaced video of Biden calling our men and women in uniform " stupid bastards . "
The video was reportedly taken on March 7 , 2016 , during Biden 's visit to Al Dhafra airbase in the United Arab Emirates .
The clip begins with Biden proclaiming that he has " incredibly good judgment " and ends with Biden ridiculing our nation 's finest .
" Clap for that , you stupid bastards , " Biden said .
" C'mon man .
Man , you are a dull bunch .
Must be slow here , man . "
So here we see Biden in his own words calling servicemembers " stupid bastards , " unlike the anonymously sourced and widely debunked story in The Atlantic that claimed President Trump referred to fallen U.S. soldiers in World War One as " suckers " and " losers . "
Other people with the president that day and willing to go on the record said the Atlantic story was n't true , including former National Security Adviser John Bolton who recently wrote a book attacking Trump .
Biden is known for making bizarre statements .
In February , the candidate accused a voter of being a " lying dog - faced pony soldier . "
According to Biden , the candidate 's brother likes to use quotes from John Wayne movies and sometimes they rub off on him .
Quick , Did John
Wayne ever call our troops " stupid bastards " ?

Has Biden Lost His Mind ?
He Just Compared Trump to Joseph Goebbels
BY TYLER O'NEIL | PJ Media

Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he is running for president in order to “ restore the soul of America , ” but he ’s just another lying , slimy politician intent on demonizing his opponent , President Donald Trump .
While Nazi comparisons are tragically common in politics , most presidential candidates have avoided comparing their opponents to Adolf Hitler or Nazi propagandist Paul Joseph Goebbels .
“ He ’s sort of like Goebbels , you say the lie long enough , keep repeating it , repeating it , repeating it , it becomes common knowledge , ” Biden said in an interview on MSNBC .
The Democrat — who has teamed up with outright socialists Rep. Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez ( D - N.Y. ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) — tried to smear Trump for calling him out on his increasing support for big government policies in the direction of socialism .
While Trump does engage in hyperbole , this is hardly comparable to the Nazi propaganda of Goebbels .
It is astounding that Biden thinks he can run a campaign on “ restoring the soul of America ” while comparing his opponent to the Nazis .
Biden launched his campaign by condemning Trump , arguing he had praised the white nationalists in Charlottesville , Va. , in 2017 as “ good people . ”
In reality , the president unequivocally condemned the racists .
“ I ’m not talking about the neo - Nazis and the white nationalists , because they should be condemned totally – but you had many people in that group other than neo - Nazis and white nationalists , okay ? ” he said .
After Biden launched his campaign , Trump again explained that he was defending the people who protected the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville , not the white nationalists .
Yet Biden continues to parrot the narrative that Trump is dividing America and the Democrats will bring Americans back together , using Charlottesville as an example .
Biden would be far from a return to normalcy .
During a debate last year , Biden bragged about launching a character defamation campaign against Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork .
He led an orchestrated smear effort so notorious that it turned Bork ’s last name into a verb .
Biden has also repeatedly lied about the tragic car wreck that killed his wife .
While Biden ’s late wife was at fault , Biden repeatedly accused the innocent truck driver of having “ drank his lunch ” before the accident .
On policy , Biden campaigned as a “ moderate ” in the Democratic primary — far further to the Left than Obama had campaigned in 2008 and 2012 .
When it seemed as though the outright socialist Bernie Sanders was about to win the nomination , the Democratic establishment rallied around Biden .
After he won the race , Biden worked with Sanders to craft the “ most progressive ” Democratic platform in history .
Biden appears to take black voters for granted , telling Charlamagne tha God that if Americans are divided between voting for him or Trump then “ you ai n’t black . ”
Yet Biden long championed the tough - on - crime legislation that ended up locking up young black men in record numbers , while Trump has signed criminal justice reform to reverse these policies .
Trump also secured permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities ( HBCUs ) , presided over an economy with historically low rates of black unemployment , and just recently announced a $ 500 billion “ platinum plan ” for the black community .
As Georgia House Rep. Vernon Jones ( D ) explained , Trump has done more for the black community in four years than Biden did in more than four decades .
Among many other things , Trump has condemned the rioting that has disproportionately hit black communities .
“ While Biden was turning a blind eye to the rioting , looting , and indiscriminate violence afflicting Democrat - run cities all over the country this summer , the President was demanding that Democrat governors and mayors allow their police forces to restore law and order , pointing out that destroying small businesses in majority - Black communities does nothing to advance the cause of racial justice but does negatively impact the people who live in those communities , ” Jones noted .
Indeed , the destructive George Floyd riots have disproportionately damaged black communities in Kenosha , Wisc. , Minneapolis , and Chicago .
The riots destroyed black lives , black livelihoods , and black monuments .
At least 26 Americans have died in the riots , most of them black .
While Biden condemned the arson and looting early on and more recently , he remained silent for months .
He singled out “ right - wing militias ” but never condemned antifa or Black Lives Matter agitators .
Yet Biden has released ads comparing Trump to notorious segregationist Bull Connor .
As for anti-Semitism , the noxious hatred that Joseph Goebbels preached , Trump could n’t be a better ally for Jews and the Jewish State of Israel .
Trump moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem , fulfilling a pledge the last three presidents failed to fulfill .
He signed an executive order protecting Jewish students from anti-Semitic harassment on college campuses .
He has even secured historic Middle East peace deals between Israel and multiple Arab and Muslim countries .
Trump could not be further from Adolf Hitler or Joseph Goebbels , but Biden frequently engages in the exact kind of political character defamation for which he condemns Trump .
Do n’t expect the left - leaning legacy media to call him out on it , however .

From Flickr to TV , Some Online Pics Not So Private
Posting Pictures Online Could Land You in Ads
During a lazy Sunday afternoon of watching football on Fox Sports with her husband , Tracey Gaughran - Perez suddenly became very interested in the game -- not for the plays , but for the commercials .
She was especially interested in the one that included a picture of her dog Truman in a Santa suit .
In a similar fashion , Allison Chang , unbeknownst to her , became the star of a Virgin Mobile ad campaign in Australia .
What the two women have in common is that their now - famous pictures were posted on the online photo scrapbooking site Flickr for their friends and family to see .
Some major companies , however , reportedly cruise sites like Flickr in search of free images to use in their ad campaigns -- sometimes without contacting the owner of the picture .
" I felt more upset than anything , because I just was n't asked , " Gaughran - Perez told " Good Morning America . "
" If they had asked me and said , ' Can we use a hilarious photo of your dog in a Santa suit ? '
I would 've been like , ' That 's fine . ' "
The Chang family is going a step further and suing Virgin Mobile for , among other things , invasion of privacy , libel and copyright infringement .
" She was insulted , offended .
She never consented to the use of her picture , " Ryan Zehl , the Changs ' attorney , told " Good Morning America . "
" What Virgin Mobile did was irresponsible , unethical and illegal .
They should have contacted Allison 's parents and they should have gotten their consent . "
Virgin Mobile said the case should be dismissed in the United States and tried in Australia .
According to a court filing by the telecommunications giant , Virgin Mobile Australia claimed that when Chang posted her photo , she marked it for unrestricted use , including commercials .
Gaughran - Perez , however , specifically toggled her pictures to restricted use .
" Flickr allows you to put an actual copyright notice on every photo , and I 've had that engaged forever , " she said .
Gaughran - Perez said the matter was settled with Fox Sports when the company apologized and paid her for the photo .
Flickr told " Good Morning America " that it encourages any individual or business who wants to use photos on Flickr to contact the owner directly to ask their permission .
Kevin Mitnick , a former hacker turned security consultant , knows the dangers of putting pictures online .
" There might be some tricks that hackers can get access to those photos without having those passwords .
According to Mitnick , the best thing anyone can do to protect their online photos is to keep their user names and passwords secure and make sure the photos are marked " private " -- especially because some online companies automatically make the photos public unless otherwise instructed .
A Malaysian karaoke enthusiast hogged the microphone for so long that people set upon him and stabbed him to death .
Abdul Sani Doli refused to hand over the microphone at a coffee shop that doubles as a karaoke bar in the town of Sandakan , Borneo .
Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after the altercation erupted a few minutes before midnight .
The town 's police chief , Rosli Mohammad Isa , said initial investigations showed the victim had sung several numbers on Wednesday night .
Other patrons fumed as Abdul Sani hogged the microphone , a scenario perhaps familiar to karaoke devotees the world over .
Three men on a neighbouring table confronted him on the pavement outside the coffee shop and witnesses saw a heated argument break out .
It turned into a punch - up and Abdul Sani was killed .
Karaoke rage is not unheard of in Asia .
There have been several reported cases of singers being assaulted , shot or stabbed mid-performance , usually over how songs are sung .
Frank Sinatra's
My Way has reportedly generated such outbursts of hostility that some bars in the Philippines now no longer offer it on the karaoke menu .
In Thailand this year , a gunman shot eight people dead after tiring of their endless renditions of a John Denver tune .
In Seattle last year , a woman with an apparent aversion to Coldplay attacked a singer who had just embarked on a rendition of Yellow .
Friday , 30 Jan , 2009 Current Events
The founder of the software giant Microsoft , Bill Gates , recently told the British Broadcasting Corporation that economies would have to handle the global economic downturn for at least four years .
According to Bill Gates , the economies will register an upturn as a result of revolutions in the fields of science and technology .
In his speech at the World Economic Forum , where Gates is promoting his charitable foundation , Microsoft 's founder outlined that people living in poor countries do not have the time to wait for the economic revival and help should come from the philanthropists that would urge governments , companies and ordinary people to donate what they can .
It is worth mentioning that currently Bill Gates is the richest philanthropist on the planet .
He outlined that the present economic downturn led to the fact that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation lost 20 percent of its value .
Although he predicted that the economic upturn will take place in at least four years , Gates stated that the basics of the global economic system remained unaffected .
According to Gates , Capitalism pushed opportunity and innovation and in the next 5 to 10 years the world will see a huge development in medicine , genetics and software .
As far as I know the mortality rate due to ghosts is zero .
There are no credibly documented cases of anyone being injured or killed by a ghost .
Besides – they are supposed to be immaterial , so how could they harm you ?
They might make you a bit chilly , or give you a severe case of the willies , but that ’s it .
I suppose they could frighten a weak - hearted person to death , in which case all we have to fear is fear itself .
So why , then , are people so terrified of ghosts .
I admit I have never seen one , so I cannot honestly brag about how I would react , but I think I would be more fascinated than anything else .
My primary thought would probably be – where ’s my camera ?
Why , then , are staff at Derby ’s new Royal Hospital so frightened ?
According to news reports :
There have been dozens of sightings over recent weeks and people are scared witless .
So scared , in fact , that the hospital administration is bringing in an exorcist to take care of the problem .
Senior manager Debbie Butler said :
“ I ’m taking it seriously as the last thing I want is staff feeling uneasy at work . ”
“ I ’ve spoken to the Trust ’s chaplain and she is going to arrange for someone from the cathedral to exorcise the department . ”
How about this as an alternative , Debbie – investigate the phenomenon scientifically .
Consider the possibility that perhaps you are dealing with a psychological and not paranormal phenomenon .
Chances are it is witless belief that is driving these sightings , not the sightings that are driving people witless .
You can take your employees seriously , but address what is likely actually going on – a community scare .
Robert Bartholomew and others have described mass delusions and community hysteria .
Belief and fear is contagious , and when the community is frightened we tend to feel anxious ourselves .
This is like a herd running from a predator , even though only one or a few members actually saw it – it ’s better to just run along with the herd to be on the safe side .
So it is no surprise that we tend to respond to fear infecting our community .
So how about a bit of public counseling and reassurance .
Despite the fact that this hospital is supposed to be the “ most haunted place in the UK ” I bet a small number of employees are making most of the sightings .
I also bet that despite the numerous alleged opportunities to document the apparitions , there is in fact no compelling evidence .
I could n’t find any online , and none of the news reports I saw included one – just artists conceptions and pictures of Linda Blair from The Exorcist .
It is sad that a professional and scientific institution has the opportunity to deal with this situation as professionals and scientists or as gullible asses , and they have chosen the latter .
Rather than calling in an exorcist and the local ghost - hunting boob , they should have called in a skeptic .
Skeptics have actually thought about such phenomena from a reality - based perspective and have developed a relevant knowledge - base that can be useful .
What is International Games Week ?
Each year people all over the planet join together during International Games
Week to celebrate the mutually - reinforcing power of play and learning at libraries around the world .
It ’s the week that libraries all over the world agree to play games in a spirit of cooperation .
The games can be anything the library and community in question likes : previously , libraries have hosted " learn to play chess " days , board games , card games , trivia games , tabletop role playing games , and video game tournaments that span the world .
But this description does n't come close to doing it justice .
Here are some reports on actual previous days - read these and see why it 's such an amazing event .
How does a library participate ?
All a library has to do to be part of International Games
Week is host some sort of games - related activity , which can be as simple or as elaborate as you are inspired and able to make it during or near the week of the event .
Then just register ( for free ! ) on the Games in Libraries blog here .
More information about games in libraries and International Games Week is available on the Games in Libraries Blog .
There are also a range of promotional materials available for libraries to use .
These materials are free and can be modified and remixed as your local library 's needs dictate .
How can game - lovers participate ?
First , check if your local library is running the event either by asking them or by looking on the IGW map .
If they are , great !
Just RSVP , and if you 're feeling really motivated ask if there 's anything you can do to help , other than just turn up and have fun .
If not , contact them and ask if they know about this event .
If they do n't , tell them it 's super - easy - and free ! - to participate .
Then give them this link ( http://games.ala.org/international-games-week/) and tell them you would love to participate in this global celebration of libraries if they can organize an event .
If they can't , which is quite possible and you are willing to get together a group of your friends to share games with other library users , that is more than enough to make the library eligible to register !
Just ask the library staff if they would mind you using the library space in this way - which is perfectly acceptable in most library spaces - and if they say they do n't mind , ask them to register their library as a venue .
That 's it !
You 're playing in International Games Week !
If the library can assist with a little staff presence , or some snacks , or other support , that 's a bonus .
Why games in libraries ?
We all know that libraries are about sharing culture and information .
Well , games are a form of culture that you often have to share - you can't experience them without another player .
They are also good for the brain , and foster important life skills like socialization , theory of mind and systems literacy .
Games have been around for as long as human culture has - Prof.
Johan Huizinga in his book Homo ludens described the play instinct as an essential part of what enabled humans to develop culture in the first place , and the earliest known book of history in the Western canon , Herodotus 's Histories , describes games keeping the ancient Lydian civilization together through 18 years of grinding famine .
Plus , they 're fun !
Whether videogames , tabletop games , social games or other kinds of games , games are a part of culture whose importance is only becoming clearer with time .
And that means we need to foster the kind of smart engagement libraries support for games as well as books .
What 's more , clearly our communities find value in games !
See the comments from past events below :
“ There were boys waiting outside for the library to open !
… We had more boys in the library at one time … than I have seen in my eleven years working here . ”
“ Some of the things I overheard this year : ' I did n't know the library was this cool ! ' , ' Can we do this every month ? ' , ' Do we have to leave ? ' , ' I love my life ! ' "
“ Where else would you find such a mix of ages interacting and having a fun time ?
In a family , of course , but none of these people were related ... it was just a cross section of the community . ”
“ We had an 80 year old senior who comes to play Wii bowling with other seniors on Friday mornings .
Some teens challenged her to a game of Wii bowling … and she WON ! ”
“ This was definitely a thumbs - up day ! ”
“ It was awesome to see the teenagers playing games with the younger children . ”
“ Great idea to get people involved with the library ! ”
“ My favorite part of the day had to be hearing the teens cheer for each other during the Brawl contests and clap at the end of the battles .
They all got along so well , even though we had quite a range of ‘ teenagers ’ – 8 to 18 ! ”
“ The program helped to give parents ideas on ways to become more involved with their children . ”
“ It was wonderful to see adults and children playing together . ”
" When I peeked into the room , I was surprised to see that all of the teens were -- at one point in time at least -- playing the board games rather than video games . "
“ This is the coolest day !
The library is awesome . ”
“ You guys rock this is fun .
When can we do it again ? ”

For 55 years , he was known to the world at large only as HM or Henry M. , the survivor of brain surgery that went catastrophically wrong , leaving him with a form of amnesia that prevented him from collecting any new memories and living in a pre-1953 world .
But when he died Dec. 2 of respiratory failure at a nursing home in Windsor Locks , Conn. , his tightly guarded identity was finally revealed to the world .
His name was Henry Gustav Molaison and he was 82 .
The ill - conceived surgery was a personal disaster , but it was a major boon to the scientific community , providing researchers with the first window into how and where memories are formed in the brain .
Over the years , more than 100 different researchers studied his memory processes , publishing their insights in dozens of scientific papers .
“ He is the most dramatic example of a patient who tragically became an experiment of nature , ” physiologist and Nobel laureate Eric Kandel of Columbia University said some years ago .
“ That single case enlightened a whole body of knowledge . ”
At the age of 9 , HM struck his head on the pavement when he was run down by a bicycle rider near his home in rural Hartford County , Conn .
He soon began having epileptic seizures and researchers were never sure whether it was this accident or a family history of epilepsy that caused his symptoms .
By the time he was 27 , HM was having as many as 10 daily seizures and severe seizures at least once a week , blacking out and suffering severe convulsions that prevented him from working at his job repairing motors .
In 1953 , Dr. William Beecher Scoville , a noted neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital who had refined many of the techniques used in lobotomies , decided that he might be able to help HM surgically .
As HM lay awake on an operating table on the first day of September , Scoville inserted a metal tube deep into his brain and suctioned out two finger - sized pieces of tissue from the hippocampus , which was not then known to participate in memory formation and storage .
The operation was a partial success .
HM ’s major seizures were reduced to an average of about two per year .
But the side effects were unfortunate and unforeseen .
HM developed what is known as severe anterograde amnesia , the inability to remember anything for more than a few seconds or minutes .
Events in the days before his surgery also were forgotten -- a condition known as retrograde amnesia -- but he remembered much of his earlier life .
Conscience - stricken by what he had done , Scoville -- who later cautioned other surgeons against repeating his mistake -- contacted Dr. Wilder Penfield of McGill University in Montreal , who had studied memory problems in two other patients .
Penfield ’s colleague Dr. Brenda Milner began studying HM , taking the night train from Montreal to meet with him and administer a variety of neurological and memory tests .
Neurobiologist Suzanne Corkin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also began studying him , establishing a working relationship that lasted until his death .
But the researchers would have to reintroduce themselves every day they visited him .
Eventually , HM seemed to retain some memory of Corkin .
“ He thought he knew me from high school , ” she frequently said .
One of the first things they learned was that intelligence and memory formation were different functions .
Even though HM ’s ability to form new memories was virtually completely gone , his intelligence remained normal .
He could carry on logical and comprehensible conversations and could even solve crossword puzzles , a hobby that he practiced all his life .
In a seminal paper in 1962 , Milner demonstrated that there are at least two types of memory formation in the brain : what are now called declarative memory and motor learning or muscle memory .
Declarative memory , which is now known to operate primarily in the hippocampus , involves the recognition of faces , names and experiences .
Motor learning , which operates elsewhere in the brain and is largely subconscious , involves learned skills like riding a bike or bowling .
Milner demonstrated the difference by having HM learn how to draw a complicated figure while looking at it in a mirror -- a tricky task that he was able to perform successfully .
When he was asked at later times to repeat the process , he did not remember his earlier efforts , but it became progressively easier for him to learn how to do it , indicating that his muscle memory was functioning .
Milner later recalled that he said , after one of the trials , “ Huh , this was easier than I thought it would be . ”
Studies of HM also provided new information about spatial learning .
If you asked him where he lived , he was likely to give you the address of the house where he lived before his surgery .
But if you asked him to draw a detailed map of the layout of the house where he lived , he could do so .
Researchers concluded that this knowledge was gained subconsciously as he walked through the house carrying out his everyday activities .
Evidence also emerged of a similar ability with words .
When researchers presented him with a list of words , such as “ pancake , bicycle and bazooka , ” he would quickly forget them .
But if he was later asked to name a weapon , he was likely to say “ bazooka , ” neurobiologist John Gabrieli of Stanford University reported .
“ And then he says , ‘ Why , that ’s an odd weapon .
I wonder why I picked that one ? ’ ” Gabrieli said .
Details of Henry Molaison ’s early life are scanty .
His father was an electrician who moved from Louisiana to Hartford in the 1920s .
Henry was born there on Feb. 26,1926 .
He remembered roller - skating , a hike along the Mohawk trail and shooting his father ’s gun in the woods , but he did n’t remember that his parents were dead unless he was coached .
Researchers noted , however , that his memories seemed flat and repetitive , and were not rich in detail .
After the disastrous surgery , he lived with his parents until their deaths , then with another relative .
In 1980 , he moved into the nursing home where he eventually died .
Molaison was a genial and meek man , eager to please , who cooperated fully with all the researchers who came to study him .
No one knows if that was an inborn trait , the result of his upbringing or the aftermath of his accident .
Corkin is at work on a book about Molaison titled “ A Lifetime Without Memory . ”
After he died Tuesday evening , researchers spent most of the night taking exhaustive MRI images of his brain , data that will help them interpret their earlier studies .
She has also arranged for his brain to be preserved , like Einstein ’s , for future study .
Molaison left no survivors .

A doctor shows phosphorus bomb injuries in Gaza .
Warning : contains graphic footage of war injuries International Solidarity Movement
Video showing injuries consistent with the use of white phosphorus shells has been filmed inside hospitals treating Palestinian wounded in Gaza City .
Contact with the shell remnants causes severe burns , sometimes burning the skin to the bone , consistent with descriptions by Ahmed Almi , an Egyptian doctor at the al - Nasser hospital in Khan Younis .
Almi said the entire body of one victim was burned within an hour .
It was the first time he had seen the effects of what he called a " chemical weapon " .
The Israeli military has denied using white phosphorus during the assault on Gaza , but aid agencies say they have no doubt it has been used .
" It is an absolute certainty , " said Marc Garlasco , a senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch .
He had seen Israeli artillery fire white phosphorus shells at Gaza City , Garlasco said .
The shells burst in the air , billowing white smoke before dropping the phosphorus shell .
Garlasco said each shell contains more than 100 incendiary rounds , which ignite and pump out smoke for about 10 minutes .
Severe respiratory problems can result in anyone exposed to the smoke and burning chemical particles that rain down over an area the size of a football pitch .
According to the International Solidarity Movement , many patients at the hospital near Khan Younis were suffering from serious breathing difficulties after inhaling smoke .
Human Rights
Watch compares the use of white phosphorus shells over Gaza to the impact of cluster munitions , which scatter " bomblets " over a wide area .
Children may kick and play with a lump of phosphorus , stirring up the embers and producing more fire and smoke .
The use of white phosphorus as a weapon – as opposed to its use as an obscurant and infrared blocking smoke screen – is banned by the UN's third convention on conventional weapons , which covers the use of incendiary devices .
Though Israel is not a signatory to the convention , its military manuals reflect the convention 's restrictions on using white phosphorus .
Israel initially claimed that it was not using white phosphorus .
It later explained that shells being loaded for a howitzer , identified from photographs as phosphorus rounds , were empty " quiet " shells used for target marking .
However , images of exploding shells and showering burning fragments are now acknowledged by independent observers as having been phosphorus .
At the centre of the controversy is the way white phosphorus air burst shells have been used in heavily built - up urban areas , with an overwhelmingly civilian population .
The M825A1 rounds , which are the kind identified as being fired by Israeli forces , are made primarily for use as a smokescreen in a way that limits their effect as an incendiary weapon , experts say .
Neil Gibson , a technical adviser to Jane 's Missiles and Rockets magazine , said the shells did not produce high - velocity burning fragments like conventional white phosphorus weapons once did .
Instead , he said , they produced a " series of large slower burning wedges which fall from the sky " .
The wedges would then ignite spontaneously in the air and fall to the ground , burning for five or 10 minutes , he said .

Blake Fielder - Civil Confessions Caught on Tape
This is something we have all probably figured out on our own over the last couple of years , butis taking full blame for his wifeand her destructive addictions .
Britain's News of the World is reporting Blake 's confession , stating that he said :
" I introduced her to heroin , crack cocaine and self - harming .
I feel more than guilty -- now I have to let her go to save her life .
I am not abandoning her .
I am doing this out of love . "
Blake was released from Highpoint prison on November 5th and went directly into a treatment facility as part of a plea bargain for early release .
Fielder - Civil never let his bride know that he was being released early and the couple have not seen each other .
Check out the photo above - it looks like prison has done Blake some good .
Perhaps
Amy would also benefit from some clink time .
Thus far , the authorities have continued to coddle her , which has not done anything to improve her situation from all outward appearances .
Speaking of appearances , look at this photo of Amy before her demons took over .
It is amazing and she is beautiful .

Come February , the red - brick Rockingham County Courthouse , one of New Hampshire ’s busiest , will arraign criminal suspects , process legal motions and otherwise deal with murders , mayhem and contract disputes .
What it wo n’t do is hold jury trials .
The economic storm has come to this : Justice is being delayed or disrupted in state courtrooms across the country .
Financially strapped New Hampshire has become a poster child for the problem .
Among other cost - cutting measures , state courts will halt for a month all civil and criminal jury trials early next year to save $ 73,000 in jurors ’ per diems .
Officials warn they may add another four - week suspension .
“ It brings our system almost to a screeching halt , ” said county prosecutor James M. Reams .
His aides are scrambling to reschedule 77 criminal trials that were on the February docket .
Advertisement
“ All the effort to subpoena witnesses and prepare for those trials is right out the window , ” Reams said , frustration in his voice .
“ Internally , it ’s a monumental waste of time .
We ’ll have to redo everything . ”
At least 19 other states , including California , have slashed court budgets and other government services as their economies have tanked , said Daniel Hall , vice president of the National Center for State Courts , a nonprofit in Williamsburg , Va .
“ Courts are there to provide a fair and impartial resolution of disputes , ” Hall said .
“ When you start affecting that , you affect who we are . ”
California cut its judicial branch budget by more than $ 200 million , or about 10 % , in the current fiscal year , and further reductions are almost certain as the state grapples with a projected $ 40 - billion deficit .
A Republican proposal unveiled last week , for example , would trim a further $ 205 million from the judiciary .
Advertisement
H.D. Palmer , spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s finance department , said it was “ not yet clear ” whether the judiciary would be granted an exemption to the governor ’s order to reduce state payrolls by 10 % through layoffs and unpaid furloughs .
Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to a speedy trial .
Judges usually give such trials priority over civil cases involving broken sidewalks , medical malpractice and the like .
As a result , civil litigation and family law cases are bearing the brunt of the disruptions .
And cascading bankruptcies , foreclosures and business disputes have only increased the backlog .
After two rounds of budget cuts in Florida , courts have laid off 280 clerks , lawyers and other staff members , and cut funding for a judges ’ unit that helps resolve civil disputes .
State legislators meeting next month are expected to demand more spending cuts .
Advertisement
An additional 10 % reduction would mean “ all civil cases in the state of Florida would virtually be suspended , ” Belvin Perry Jr. , chief judge of Florida ’s 9th Judicial Circuit and chairman of a trial court budget commission , warned a legislative committee in Tallahassee this month .
In Vermont , state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul L. Reiber recently proposed closing as many as seven county courts , as well as laying off employees , to help ease a budget deficit .
The state already shuts district and family courts half a day each week to save money .
“ None of our choices are good , ” Reiber conceded in a memo to court employees .
With rising joblessness and falling revenues , New Hampshire projects a budget deficit this year of $ 250 million .
The crisis has forced Gov. John Lynch to seek spending cuts across state government , including the judicial system .
Advertisement
John T. Broderick , chief justice of the state Supreme Court , has carved $ 2.7 million from the judicial budget .
In addition to the one - month halt in jury trials and trimming back courtroom security , seven of the state ’s 59 judgeships will be left vacant through June , when the fiscal year ends .
Three of the empty slots are in trial courts .
Worse , Broderick said , he may need to suspend jury trials for another month , and leave open a Supreme Court slot after one of the five justices retires in February .
It is the state ’s only appellate court .
“ In my 36 years here as a lawyer and judge , I ’ve never felt as insecure about the state courts in terms of operations and resources as I do now , ” Broderick said .
Robert J. Lynn , chief justice of the superior courts , which conduct all New Hampshire jury trials , said he fears the delays inevitably will cause damage .
“ There is some element of ‘ justice delayed , justice denied , ’ no doubt about it , ” he said .
Advertisement
Christopher Keating , executive director of the New Hampshire Public Defender program , said his chief concern now is “ people in custody who will endure delays in getting their day in court . ”
The state Supreme Court threw out two criminal cases this year because trials did not begin within six months of arraignment , the legal limit .
Prosecutors fear more cases may be dismissed .
Delays in jury trials in 2001 and 2002 , during a previous budget crisis , caused less disruption because they involved fewer cases , said John Safford , Superior Court clerk in the Hillsborough County district that includes Manchester , the largest city .
This time , he needs to reschedule up to 100 trials .
Advertisement
“ I ’ve been here 30 years , ” he said .
“ This is the worst I ’ve ever seen it . ”
The delays may encourage some defendants to seek plea deals , or litigants to settle out of court .
Some counties are advocating out - of - court mediation and conflict resolution .
But other cases may face new hurdles as time passes .
Advertisement
“ Witnesses die , memories fade ; things happen when trials are delayed , ” said John Hutson , dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center , the state ’s only law school .
“ Then you ’ll get a bow wave of cases , so they pile up the next month and it ’s hard to catch up . ”
The slowdown has unnerved many residents in the state , where granite - hewn courthouses often anchor Colonial - era town squares .
“ You ’re talking about erosion of our fundamental civic fabric , ” said Ellen J. Shemitz , executive director of the New Hampshire Assn. for Justice , which represents civil trial attorneys .
James J. Tenn Jr. , incoming president of the state ’s bar association , said that as the crisis has grown , New Hampshire courts have been slow to process orders , respond to lawyers ’ requests and “ do the daily work . ”
Advertisement
“ We ’ve just seen delay after delay after delay , ” said David Slawsky , a civil lawyer in Manchester .
“ The court process is breaking down . ”
Dennis Ducharme , a Manchester attorney , received cancellation notices last week for four personal injury cases scheduled for trial next year .
He worries that a delay of six months , perhaps longer , will make witnesses less willing to testify .
“ The longer you drag it out , the more reluctant people become to cooperate , ” he said .
In Newport , in the rural west , lawyer Lisa Wellman - Ally has seen a property rights trial postponed four times .
Each time , she has prepared 100 exhibits , re-subpoenaed witnesses , refreshed her arguments and billed her client for the time .
Advertisement
“ Then we would get bounced again , ” she said .
No new trial date has been scheduled .

“ This is the oldest trick in the books ” said Eric S. Ruff , a lawyer with Ruff & Cohen in Gainesville , Fla .
“ It ’s common when you hear the feet of your creditors approaching to divest yourself . ”
Mr. Fuld has been accused by some of doing too little too late to save the firm .
However , he has said publicly that the blame should be shared by regulators and that he took steps to try to save  or sell  the investment bank .
Florida has particularly generous home protection laws that protect residents from losing their homes in the case of lawsuits or bankruptcy .
But Mr. Fuld may not see much benefit by shifting the house to his wife ’s name because the Fulds may not be able to prove residency there .
Mr. Ruff , the lawyer in Florida , said that it might be difficult for him to claim residence in Florida , because he primarily lived and worked in the New York area .
That could mute any bankruptcy benefit .
And , Mr. Ruff said , the transfer to his wife could be deemed fraudulent conveyance if she did not pay enough for the house .
That would make the house fair game for creditors who come after Mr. Fuld .
Image Mr. Fuld 's wife , Kathleen .
It is also unclear how much Mrs. Fuld paid for the house .
It is standard for property deeds to contain a placeholder number .
The $ 10 on the deed in Martin County could simply be a placeholder , and Mrs .
Fuld might have paid more , lawyers said .
A bonus by any other name would smell just as sweet .
The fury over the fact that Wall Street paid out $ 18.4 billion in bonuses in 2008 , the " sixth largest " amount in history , is about words and nothing else .
This is n't a compensation issue , it 's a diction issue .
Outside of lower Manhattan , a " bonus " is a special , one - off reward for performance above and beyond what 's expected of an employee .
And if investment bankers had gotten $ 18.4 billion worth of bonuses in that traditional sense of the word , then of course it would be truly outrageous .
But on Wall Street , and at many law firms as well , a bonus is simply part , often the greater part , of your regular compensation .
It may vary from year to year , but when you take one of these jobs , the understanding is that you 'll be paid a base - salary and once a year you 'll also get a " bonus . "
The bonus varies in size from year to year , but it 's not actually a " bonus " in the way most people think of the word .
It 's an expected part of your salary , delivered in a lump - sum near Christmastime .
Historically , for many people on Wall Street , the base salary is much less than they could be earning elsewhere , but because they know they 're getting a sizable " bonus , " it makes sense for them to stay at their jobs .
So a bonus is n't a bonus .
But since the vast majority of people do n't know that , the public gets angry .
And when the public gets angry , Democratic politicians who probably know better have to demagogue the issue .
That 's how you get the President saying , " there will be a time for profits and bonuses .
Now is not that time . "
I do n't think this is class - warfare , although I would n't mind some of that , it 's a simple misunderstanding .
Obama would n't say , " now is not the time for paychecks . "
But that 's essentially what a bonus is on Wall Street , just an expected part of your compensation .
This is not crooked , greedy CEOs lining their wallets , although I wo n't deny that plenty of that happens .

Rails 2.2 Released – 27 Links and Resources To Get You Going
By Peter Cooper
Ruby 's most popular Web application framework , Ruby on Rails , takes another giant step today with the release of Rails 2.2 !
It follows on just five months after Rails 2.1 , but offers even more significant improvements , particularly in the areas of compatibility , internationalization , and documentation .
Read David Heinemeier Hansson 's release post for a quick overview .
Ruby Inside 's sister site , Rails Inside , was launched alongside Rails 2.1 in June , and would , you 'd think , be the ideal place for a post like this , but no .
Rails is very significant to the Ruby world as a whole , so you 'll still get the biggest of the biggest Rails announcements here on Ruby Inside !
If you want more regular Rails - only news , however , go and subscribe to Rails Inside ( RSS feed or e-mail subscription ) .
As is typical for a big release , we 've pooled together a ton of excellent resources , links , and what not , to help you get fully into the Rails 2.2 mindset .
So if you 've got Rails 2.2 running already or if you 're just investigating what it could do for you , read on and investigate some of these resources .
General Documentation and Guides
Rails 2.2 Release Notes -
A very solid set of release notes for 2.2 with basic coverage of the new features ( with short code examples and links ) as well as a list of deprecated features .
They were compiled by Ruby / Rails Inside 's very own Mike Gunderloy !
Upgrading RubyGems to 1.3.x - Depending on your setup , Rails 2.2 may demand that you upgrade to RubyGems 1.3.x .
This is not as easy as it might usually be , however .
Mike Gunderloy gives some tips in case you get stuck .
Rails Security Guide -
Steer clear of security issues in your Rails 2.2 applications by reading the Ruby on Rails Security Guide .
Who said Rails has poor documentation ?
This is incredible !
Rails 2.2 Screencast - Gregg Pollack and Jason Seifer of Rails Envy put together a very solid Rails 2.2 screencast .
It costs $ 9 , but it covers a lot of ground over 44 minutes - learn about etags , connection pooling , new enumerable methods , new test helpers , and more .
Rails 2.2 - What 's New - In association with EnvyCasts , Carlos Brando and Carl Youngblood present Rails 2.2 - What 's New , a 118 page PDF covering all of the changes and additions to Rails 2.2 .
It 's available in a package deal with the screencast ( above ) too .
InfoQ's Glance - InfoQ's Mirko Stocker takes a quick glance at some of Rails 2.2's new features .
New Features
Thread Safety - Rails 2.2 is now " thread safe . "
In October , Pratik Naik wrote a summary of why this is a big deal as well as some gotchas ( basically , do n't use class variables , use mutexes , etc. )
Charles Nutter has also written What Thread - safe Rails Means which answers several pertinent questions .
Internationalization - The Rails Internationalization effort has its own homepage at http://rails-i18n.org/
which features lots of links to how - tos , tips , documentation , and demos .
They also have a Google group / mailing list where you can get help , make suggestions , etc .
Basic Language Internationalization -
It 's a little old , but Simple Localization in Rails 2.2 gives a very quick , code - driven example of how basic internationalization works in Rails 2.2 ( some of the set up is easier now , but it mostly applies ) .
Localization / Internationalization Demo App - Clemens Kofler has put together a demo app that shows off some of Rails 2.2's internationalization and localization features .
If being knee deep in code is the best way for you to learn , jump in !
Layouts for ActionMailer - As of Rails 2.2 , you can now use layouts in your ActionMailer views .
Connection Pooling -
The connection pooling in Rails 2.2 allows Rails to distribute database requests across a pool of database connections .
This can cause less lockups .
In collaboration with a non-blocking MySQL driver , serious performance increases could result in certain situations .
Specify Join Table Conditions with Hashes -
Do you need to run a find ( or similar ) query across a join ?
Now you can just specify the conditions for the joined tables in a hash , much like local tables conditions !
Limited Resource Routes -
You can now limit map .resources to creating certain methods .
For example , you might not want destroy or index methods - you can now specify these with : only and : except .
Memoization - Stop rolling your own memoization in Rails apps .
Clemens Kofler demonstrates Rails 2.2's newly rolled - in memoization features .
It 's just a single method !
If you have a view that calls on a calculated attribute often , this will give you some serious performance gains .
Custom Length Tokenizer for Validations -
You can now specify a tokenizer of your own construction for validates_length_of validations .
Array #second through Array # tenth -
If you 're a bad programmer , you can now demonstrate it to the world by using the new Array # second , Array # third , Array # fourth , and so forth , methods .
I 've put it in my calendar to look for open source Rails apps using Array # seventh in six months time and to call them out on Rails Inside ;-)
Note :
This list only takes into account some of the new features in Rails 2.2 .
There are a lot more !
Read the release notes and the Rails 2.2 - What 's New PDF to get the full picture .
Miscellaneous
restful - authentication - i18n - Want an authentication plugin for Rails 2.2 that supports internationalization ?
Take a look at result - authentication - i18n !
Barebones Apps - Check out Rails Inside's 7 Barebones Rails Apps to Kick Start Your Development Process .
Deploying on JBoss -
You can now easily deploy a Rails app to a JBoss server .
With Rails 2.2's significantly improved JRuby support , this makes rolling out Rails apps in the enterprise a breeze !
Installing Rails on Ubuntu Hardy Heron - Simon St Laurent has put together two Rails useful installation videos .
One for servers , and one for the desktop .
REST for Rails 2 - Are you still in Rails 1.x land or not using REST at all ?
Would you like to ?
Geoffrey Grosenbach has put together a screencast showing you how it should be done .
( Disclaimer : Peepcode is a sponsor of Ruby Inside . )
A Better Rails Logo -
The Rails Logo ( as used at the head of this post ) was created by Kevin Milden and is distrubuted under the BY - ND Creative Commons Licence .
This makes it a lot cooler than the " official " Rails logo which is trademarked and , well , you can't use without getting approval from the top .

On posts like this , the comments get a lot of clicking love from readers eager to learn more - so feel free to promote your own Rails 2.2 related stuff :-)
Two FLDS men in Canada have been accused of polygamy and are currently in the middle of a trial .
A defense attorney on the case says that the country ’s decision to legalize gay marriage will lead to legalizing polygamy .
This question may raise some eyebrows , but I ’m going to ask it anyway :
What ’s the big deal ?
Polygamy is n’t any more “ dangerous to society ” than gay marriage , which Canada has deemed acceptable for society .
Consenting adults enter into a union that they feel fits their preferences , religion , or both .
Full disclosure : I am personally opposed to polygyny ( which is how polygamy is usually manifested ) .
But I think we ’re all missing the silver lining in polygamy legalization :
Currently , women in such marriages are legally vulnerable because their marriages are not registered or recognized by the state .
They have no recourse if they are abused or divorced : if they go to the police or other governmental entities , they worry they ’ll be arrested because polygamy is illegal .
Legalization would register these marriages and give women recourse for grievances in the case of domestic violence , divorce , child support , etc .
If polygamy is legalized , then those entering into polygamous marriages will have to fit the requirements for entering into any marriage ( i.e. , be consenting adult parties ) .
All parties ( including other wives ) will have to agree to the marriage .
Marriages with minors will still be against the law , as will marriage without a spouse ’s consent or knowledge .
The illegal status of polygamy in the West causes many women who are in polygynous marriages to fall into a legal grey area where they feel they are n’t allowed any rights or protections from the law because their marriages are illegal under Western laws .
Muslim polygynous marriages differ from the FLDS community ’s in that there are a finite number of wives allowed and Muslim communities are not separated from Western society through the use of compounds , as FLDS communities sometimes are .
However , both of these communities can find themselves trapped by the law if they no longer want to be a part of the polygamous lifestyle .
Polygyny is often associated with the exploitation of women partly because its illegal status allows for abuses to go unreported .
With legalization comes regulation : if we legalize and regulate polygamous marriage like we do other forms of marriage , those in polygamous marriages will no longer be in legal limbo .
Here are some Larry King statistics :
• Larry King has had a talk show on CNN for 73 years now .
• Larry King owns 4700 pairs of suspenders .
• Larry King does n’t look good in any of them .
• Larry King has been married 56 times .
• Larry King ’s real name is Saul Rabinowitz .
• Larry King is 206 years old .
• Larry King has fielded thousands of phone calls from wackos over the years .
I am one of those wackos .
***
One night in the mid-80s , I was sitting on my ratty couch in my one - bedroom apartment in Peoria , Illinois .
I had smoked a lot of pot and drank a bunch of beer and Larry King was on the television with the sound muted .
My stereo was blaring “ Wo n’t Get Fooled Again ” by the Who .
I remember feeling great pity for poor Pete Townshend .
Someone had fooled him and I wondered who would do such a mean thing to that big - beaked guitarist .
While pondering this thought , I absent - mindedly glanced at my 14 - inch Panasonic color television set with real plastic wood - grain on the sides , and I saw that Larry ’s guest for the evening was Jay Leno .
Now this was way before Leno became the host of The Tonight Show .
This is back when he used to do bits on the David Letterman ’s show when Letterman was on NBC .
I thought he was pretty funny back then and so I turned the Who off and turned up the volume .
Larry King was speaking .
“ Our guest tonight is funnyman Jay Leno .
If you have a question for Jay call the number below , ” Larry croaked out in that old - man , froggy voice of his .
As I looked at the number at the bottom of the screen , all of the sudden I had a desperate urge to call the show , so I scribbled it on a well - worn one - dollar bill that I yanked from my pocket , as a tampon commercial came on the air .
Brenda Vaccaro ’s deep mannish voice extolled the wonders of Playtex tampons , and I tried to think of a good question for Jay Leno .
Marijuana can cause unusual focus in obsessive moments , and this was one of those moments .
I wanted to ask Jay Leno a question and I wanted it to be funny .
I wanted to make Jay and Larry laugh .
I had to make Jay and Larry laugh .
This was more important than who fooled Pete Townshend .
This was more important than Brenda Vaccaro .
This , I daresay , was more important than a tampon .
I had to think hard and I had to think funny .
I was furiously pacing the room back and forth , like a tiger in a zoo cage that ’s two sizes too small .
Then it hit me like 12 tons of mashed potatoes .
I had the question and the question was thus : “ I ’d like to ask Jay what his favorite sandwich is . ”
Ha !
Now that ’s what I call comedy .
Everybody else would be asking about his comedy , his background , his influences and then I would roll in and hit him with , “ What ’s your favorite sandwich , Jay ? ” Ha !
It was kind of Andy Kaufmanesque .
And I loved Andy Kaufman .
I picked up the phone and dialed the number .
The line started ringing and my heart was racing wildly .
On the fourth ring , it was picked up and a woman with a monotone voice said , “ Larry King show , do you have a question for Jay Leno ? ”
She sounded almost robotic .
“ Yeah , I ’ve got a question , ” I answered the robot operator enthusiastically .
“ I want to ask Jay what his favorite sandwich is . ”
This was greeted by silence .
Dead silence .
For a nanosecond , I thought I had been accidentally disconnected .
“ Hello ? ” I queried to the silence .
“ Hi , ” the robotic woman replied .
Great !
We were still connected .
She continued in her monotone voice , “ Ummm , why do you want to ask Jay Leno what his favorite sandwich is ? ”
“ Because it ’s hilarious ! ” I told her .
“ This is really going to crack Larry and Jay up , ” I assured her , and then I shut up I did n’t want to oversell the bit .
“ It will ? ” she asked in her robotic monotone .
“ Oh hell yes , ” I said hoping that throwing in a minor curse word would bond us like kids hatching a plan to egg mean old Mr. Wilson ’s house .
“ Can I put you on hold for a few seconds ? ” she asked .
“ Of course you can , ” I responded in relaxing voice , trying to soothe her weary robot mind so she would see the genius of this question .
Well , it worked .
Within 15 seconds , she was back on the line .
“ Okay , you ’ll be caller number three , turn the volume down on your TV .
When you hear Larry talking on your phone , get ready to ask your question just like you said it to me . ”
I was on .
I WAS ON !
I was the third caller .
I was the king of the fucking world .
Larry and Jay would love my question .
They were going to crack up .
We would all laugh together .
They would laugh with me , not at me .
Maybe Jay would talk about it on the Letterman show the next week .
Maybe David Letterman would want to have me on as a guest .
Maybe I would become a star out of this .
I was just about to become the man who asked Jay Leno what his favorite sandwich was and soon the world would love me .
Strangers would want to embrace me and take me into their homes and feed me pizza .
About five minutes later , as I came to this realization , all of a sudden I heard Larry King ’s voice in my phone .
“ We have a caller from Peoria , Illinois .
Do you have a question for Jay Leno ? ”
Oh , boy , did I have a question .
And I asked it .
“ Yeah , Larry , ” I said , and then paused for comedic effect .
“ I ’d like to ask Jay what his favorite sandwich is . ”
Baboom .
It was asked .
I waited for heaven to part and the angels start singing and Jay and Larry to acknowledge my genius .
I looked at the Panasonic and Larry was grimacing .
Jay Leno looked like he had a sour stomach .
Did they hear my question ?
Did I somehow speak in a foreign tongue ?
After an uneasy few seconds , Jay Leno spoke .
“ Well , I guess I ’d say a Philly cheese - steak sandwich .
Gee , Larry , what an inquisitive audience you have , ” he said his voice dripping with sarcasm and contempt .
“ What ’s the next caller going to ask me : What ’s my favorite color ? ”
Larry was scowling .
All of the sudden my world was spinning in the wrong direction .
My stomach twisted into a pretzel knot as Larry uttered the following words : “ Next caller . ”
Next caller .
Fuck .
Then my phone went dead .
When the dial tone came on , I finally surrendered it to the base .
They did n’t get it .
Nobody laughed .
Jay Leno thought I was stupid .
Larry King hated me .
David Letterman was never going to call me .
And the poor robotic phone screener , she probably got handed her walking papers 10 seconds after the call hit the airwaves .
Fuck !
I turned the TV off and put the Who back on .
“ Meet the new boss , same as the old boss . ”
Pete Townshend would ’ve gotten it .
He would ’ve thought it was funny .
And Keith Moon ?
Shit , he would ’ve busted a gut over it .
“ What ’s your favorite sandwich ? ”
That ’s funny fucking stuff .
I ’m cracking myself up right now as I type the words .
Fuck Larry King .
Fuck Jay Leno .
A lot of people never got Lenny Bruce , either .
Shit , they locked that son of a bitch up in jail over some of his bits .
Nobody knows the trouble me and Lenny have seen .
Jay and Larry did n’t get my humor , but I knew as I passed out after drinking six more beers and cursing the lives of Jay Leno and Larry King , that Lenny was looking down at me and he was laughing .
With me .
Not at me .
The next day I woke up hungover and still a little high from the pot .
I took a shower , took a bunch of aspirin , washed them down with a can of Diet Coke and wearily drove downtown to the printing factory where I worked as a four - color film stripper .
I parked , made my way into the room where I worked with around nine other people , swiped my timecard and started making my way back to the light table where I sat .
On my way there , I heard one of my coworkers , Dick Maurer , talking .
“ I was watching Larry King last night and he had Jay Leno on , ” Dick explained to about five co-workers gathered around his light table .
“ All of a sudden some guy from Peoria gets on , and this asshole asks Leno what his favorite sandwich is ! ”
“ Hey , that asshole was me ! ” I shouted out to Maurer and his compatriots .
“ Holy shit !
I thought I recognized that voice last night and it was you , ” Maurer said , breaking out into laughter .
“ Why the hell did you call in and ask Jay Leno what his favorite sandwich is ? ”
“ Because it ’s funny .
You know , everybody else is asking questions about his career , his background , his family and then I hit him with , ‘ What ’s your favorite sandwich , Jay ! ’
It ’s on the level of an Andy Kaufman bit , ” I explained to the group .
They all just stared blankly at me .
“ It was funny ! ” I shouted out , and stomped my left foot on the concrete floor for emphasis .
No one said anything .
They all slowly went to their light tables and went to work .
I went to mine , muttering “ fucking assholes ” under my breath .
For over 10 years , I never talked about that night of the Larry King show .
By then , I was living in New York City , working nights and publishing my own humor magazine , fishwrap .
It was 1996 and Ellen and Tracie , the two women who ran the company that distributed my magazine , were in town .
We were having lunch at an outdoor cafe on the Upper West Side .
About three bites into my grilled chicken sandwich , Tracie ’s eyes got wide and she said , “ Oh , my God , look who ’s walking towards us . ”
I turned around and saw a tall , stunning fortysomething blonde strutting our way on the sidewalk .
Next to her , all slouched over , carrying all kinds of bags and a huge scowl coloring his face , was none other than Larry King .
I started laughing .
“ What ’s so funny ? ” Ellen asked .
“ Years ago , ” I explained , “ Larry King had Jay Leno on his show and I called in and got on air , ” still laughing at the memory .
“ Oh , yeah , ” Ellen inquired , “ What did you ask him ? ” “ I asked him , ” I said , looking at the both of them while smiling widely and holding my hands up in the air for emphasis : “ ‘ What ’s your favorite sandwich ? ’ ”
Ellen looked at me like I was nuts .
Tracie just said six words : “ Why did you ask him that ? ”
I decided right then and there that I ’d never tell that fucking story again .

In February this year , Nathan Froyd described allocation sequences in SBCL and alternative approaches other implementations use to make sure the runtime never sees half - initialised objects .
At first sight , SBCL 's sequence seems fairly large and slow for what , in the end , increments a thread - local pointer , even on x86 - 64 , with its awesome 14 ( RBP actually serves as a frame pointer in SBCL ) GPRs :
Set the pseudo - atomic bit OR BYTE PTR [ R12+160 ] , 8 ( what you 'd expect for bump : )
Load the allocation pointer MOV R11 , [ R12+80 ]
Test for overflow LEA RDX , [ R11+16 ] CMP [ R12+88 ] , RDX Jump to an out of line sequence JBE L4
Or save incremented pointer MOV [ R12+80 ] , RDX ... and tag it LEA RDX , [ R11+7 ] ( end of allocation per se ) Finally , unset the pseudo - atomic bit XOR BYTE PTR [ R12+160 ] , 8 Check for interrupt pending JEQ L2 Trigger a signal if so BREAK 9 ; pending interrupt trap L2 : ...
That 's two load / store and a test just to make sure we 're not caught with our pants down , handling improperly initialised objects .
One element of the alternatives is to actively check for pending interrupts ( or GCs , etc ) .
Instead of allowing interruptions everywhere except around key sequences , interruptions are queued , and explicit checks inserted by the compiler .
That seems like an interesting implementation choice , so I wanted to see what it'd look like in SBCL .
It was pretty easy to adapt the compiler to insert such checks at appropriate locations ( in the current case , at the end of each function ' prologue , and at the head of loops ) .
Using memory protection to turn an access into a conditional interruption seemed like a good idea , and that 's what I quickly implemented .
These checks can be executed fairly often in tight loops , so it 's important that they be very efficient .
The first version loaded a magic address from thread - local storage ( an address pointed to by a register ) , and then wrote to that address .
When the thread had to be interrupted , the page containing that address was made unreadable and unwritable , so the last access triggered a segfault , which was then handled specially .
The result was slow ... 25 % as much time as the original ( signals - ful ) version for a simple ( loop repeat n do [ not cons ] ) function , and no difference for a consing loop .
Modifying the safepoint sequence to read from the magic address instead of writing to it halved the slowdown to ~ 10 % , and did not improve the runtime of the consing loop .
That 's still far from impressive .
Executing two instructions at each safepoint seems obviously fishy .
Indeed , things improved sensibly when the safepoint sequence became a single TEST , as in Nathan 's example from HotSpot .
Instead of having to read an arbitrary address from the thread struct , I moved the " magic page " to a fixed offset from the thread structure .
The safepoint sequence then became a single instruction , TEST EAX , [ THREAD_STRUCT_REG + offset ] ( a register is dedicated to thread - local storage ) .
That 's a single instruction , reads from memory and does not clobber any register .
Unfortunately , that was only enough to bring the runtime for safepoints to the same level (+/- 1 - 2 % ) as that of the original code ( it does save ~ 50 KB out of 40 MB on the x86 - 64 core :) .

LOL at the Mike Myers thing at the end .
It gave me a diaphragmatic orgasm .
It appears increasingly likely that the Obama - Biden - Hillary administration will also adopt a Bubba - Gore - Hillary article of faith , namely that the 21st Century would see the end of the nation - state .
Acting on that belief , Bubba - Gore attempted to hand over to the United Nations , the presumptive world government , every semi-international problem , including womens reproductive rights ,
For example , in 1995 , as an official member of our delegation to the Fourth World Conference on Women being held in Beijing , Hillary Clinton blasted both China ( for promoting sterilization , abortion and female infanticide by its one child limit per family ) and India ( for permitting the burning of brides because their dowries were too small ) .
Then , in 2000 , at a weeklong special session of the UN General Assembly , Hillary “ laid out ”  according to our UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke  the official Clinton - Gore policy , which was to resist the efforts of ( a ) the Vatican , ( b ) some “ Catholic ” countries and ( c ) some “ Islamic ” countries to reverse the “ gains ” achieved by women at that 1995 Conference .
Now , President Clinton had hoped to make his principal legacy the elimination of nuclear - weapons altogether , getting every nation - state  including India , Pakistan and Israel  to become a signatory to ( a ) the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ( b ) the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
The NPT was viewed by almost every signatory as having three “ pillars ” :
an affirmation of the inalienable right of all signatories to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy “ without discrimination ”
a mechanism for verifying to other signatories that nuclear energy was not being diverted from peaceful to military purposes
a promise by the weapons - states to eventually dispose of their nukes
The NPT required those signatories not yet having nukes to negotiate a Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency  an existing United Nations agency already charged with facilitating the widest possible international transfer of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  for the “ exclusive purpose ” of “ verifying ” that certain proscribed materials were not “ diverted ” to a military purpose .
But what about this promise we made to eventually dispose of our nukes ?
In September 1993 , President Clinton called for a multilateral convention banning the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons , and in March 1995 the Conference on Disarmament established a committee to begin drafting such a treaty .
Next , at the 1995 NPT Review Conference , Bubba got all signatories to agree to its indefinite extension .
Then , in 1997 , at the 40th General Conference of the IAEA , Director - General Hans Blix announced the Trilateral Agreement , hyped as an important step towards the U.S. and Russia meeting NPT nuke “ disarmament obligations . ”
Each side would  under the watchful eyes of IAEA inspectors  dispose of 34 tons of weapons - grade plutonium , recovered from thousands of dismantled U.S. and Soviet nukes .
Finally , Bubba approved the “ action agenda ” of the 2000 NPT Review Conference , calling for “ systematic and progressive efforts ” to implement the NPT nuke disarmament requirement .
Of course , Bill Clinton did not shrink from killing thousands of women and children , in the Middle East and in the Balkans , from 20,000 feet , in accordance with the fervently expressed desires of various groups of his supporters , which included womens rights activists , to effect “ regime change . ”
But then Bush - Cheney came to power , repudiating the Clinton - Gore “ globalist ” philosophy , vowing , instead , to establish an American Hegemony .
Hence , Bush - Cheney deemed it necessary to destroy the IAEA - NPT nuclear - weapon proliferation - prevention regime  since it was in their way  corrupting the UN Security Council in the process .
Recall that in his first State of the Union Address , Bush essentially accused North Korea , Iran and Iraq of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs .
“ States like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
“ I will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
I will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer .
The United States of America will not permit the world ’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world ’s most destructive weapons . ”
But  at that time  North Korea , Iran and Iraq were all NPT signatories , and were certified by the IAEA to not have weapons - useable materials .
In particular , in 1998 , the new IAEA Director - General , Mohamed ElBaradei , reported to the UN Security Council that there were “ no indications that there remains in Iraq any physical capability for the production of amounts of weapons - usable nuclear material of any practical significance . ”
So , upon receipt of that IAEA report  that Iraq no longer posed a “ threat to the peace in the region ”  the Security Council should have removed some or all of the sanctions previously imposed .
But , President Clinton declared he would never allow UN sanctions to be lifted , despite the IAEA report that Iraq was in total compliance with its Safeguards Agreement , so long as Saddam Hussein was in power !
Whereupon Clinton launched Operation Desert Fox , a thinly disguised attempt to effect regime in Iraq by assassinating its President .
Clinton didnt succeed , of course , so the enforcement of the Clinton - imposed “ no - fly zones ” and of the UN sanctions on the civilian population continued , as a result of which , UN Assistant Secretary - General Denis Holliday told Congress that “ child mortality for children under five years of age is from five to six thousand per month . ”
In other words , by the time Bush - Cheney launched Operation Iraqi Freedom , Clinton - Gore and their supporters had been at least indirectly responsible for the deaths of at least 250,000 Iraqi children under the age of five .
All because many Clinton - Gore supporters  including womens rights activists  didnt think Saddam Hussein was a very nice man .
Many of these same supporters also didnt think Kim Il - Sung  the dictator of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea  was a very nice man , either .
Nor were the Iranian Mullahs or the Afghan Taliban .
So , after invading Afghanistan and routing the Taliban , when President Bush proceeded to designate Iran , Iraq and North Korea to lie on “ an axis of evil , ” he secured the support of most of those Clinton - Gore “ globalist ” supporters , including womens rights activists .
Now , as Obama - Biden - Hillary come to power , it will probably be impossible to reconstitute the effectiveness of the IAEA - NPT nuke proliferation - prevention regime , to undo the damage done to it by Bush - Cheney - Rice - Bolton in Iraq - Iran - India - Korea - Pakistan .
So , thanks to Bush - Cheney - Rice - Bolton , the chances of you and yours getting nuked in jammies is greater than it has ever been .
But , hey , the Mullahs and Taliban are resurgent and defiant , and Obama - Biden - Hillary will have all the support they need if they decide to stifle them , by force , if necessary .
So , Happy New Year .
California may run out of money again this year to supplement school meals , in part because more struggling families are taking part in the free or reduced - price school lunch programs , the state ’s superintendent of public instruction said Tuesday .
“ Without quick action by the governor and the Legislature , districts will be forced to make a series of unacceptable choices to dip further into their own bare - bones budgets , serve less nutritious foods and not comply with California ’s nationally renowned nutrition standards , or reduce cafeteria staffing , ” Supt .
Jack O’Connell said in a statement .
The federal government provides $ 2.17 to $ 2.57 for each free or reduced - price meal , and California provides an additional 22 cents .
Last school year , the state money ran out in May , and it is likely to run out earlier this school year , O’Connell said .
He is requesting $ 31.1 million from the general fund to prevent that , he said .
O’Connell said he did not know how many new students have applied for or received free or reduced - price breakfast or lunch this school year .
But he said California schools served 4.5 % more meals overall in 2007 - 08 than they did the previous year and he expected that those numbers have continued to rise this year .
He and other school officials have said the nation ’s troubled economy is likely to increase the need for subsidized meals .

But in the Los Angeles Unified School District , for August , September and October of this year compared with the same period last year , the district saw a 3 % increase in free lunches served , a 1 % decrease in reduced - price lunches and a 4 % increase in the number of regularly priced lunches that students buy , said Dennis Barrett , director of food services .
Elementary school students pay $ 1 for the full - priced lunches and high school students pay $ 1.50 .
L.A. Unified has been working to increase the numbers of students -- paying and not paying -- who eat meals at school .
For example , in May 2007 , the district served 6.3 million free and reduced - price meals and 859,000 meals that students paid for , according to the food services department .
In May 2006 , the figures were 6.2 million and 803,000 .
If L.A. Unified lost the state supplement , Barrett said , he would look to save money by improving efficiency or reducing menu choices .
The loss of free and reduced - price meals , he said , would be devastating .
On a related note , a report issued last month analyzed more than 100 studies of school breakfast programs and found that 10 million children nationwide who were eligible for free or reduced - price school breakfasts had not received them .

“ Letting schoolchildren go hungry means that the nation ’s investments in public education are jeopardized by childhood under-nutrition , ” said J. Larry Brown of the Harvard School of Public Health , who was the lead researcher on the breakfast report , which was funded by the Sodexo Foundation , the charitable arm of the food service company .
In L.A. Unified , about 30 % of elementary school students who get free or reduced - price school lunches do n’t participate in the subsidized school breakfast program , David Binkle , assistant director of food services for the district , said this week .
The figure is about 50 % for secondary school students , he said .
And those numbers are an improvement , he said , thanks to changes in the way breakfast is offered .
One of those is “ second - chance ” breakfast -- offered not only before school but again during recess or nutrition periods .
The other is the addition of carts stocked with “ grab and go ” breakfasts , which might include whole grain cereal , low - fat milk , low - fat yogurt and fruit .
When a school establishes both of those programs , Binkle said , breakfast participation often increases by 20 % to 30 % .

Some students come to school without eating breakfast because their families are poor , others because their households are chaotic .
“ And a lot of children are not hungry when they wake up ” and do n’t want to eat before they leave the house .
Most districts that do n’t provide breakfast say the issue is administrative -- getting cafeteria staffers to work earlier in the morning , getting custodians to clean up after breakfast , possibly shifting bus schedules , Brown said .
“ There is some legitimacy to all of that .
I do n’t think it outweighs the other side of it , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ We need to do a much better job of teaching school officials what the evidence is .
One can hardly have a stronger body of research ” saying that eating breakfast helps children learn and behave better , among other benefits .

The miracle teabag : Stem cells in a pack help stroke victim to talk again
Doctors have used a revolutionary stem cell treatment to restore the power of speech for a stroke victim .
Walter Bast also regained the use of his right arm after the operation to place a ' teabag ' of drug - producing stem cells in his brain .
Speaking a week after the operation - the first of its kind in the world - he said : ' I feel a lucky guy . '
If further trials prove the treatment 's worth , it could be on the market in as little as five years , providing fresh hope for the 45,000 Britons each year who suffer a haemorrhagic stroke , where a blood vessel in the brain bursts .
Currently , the only treatment option is surgery , which has a variable success rate .
Half will die within a month and just one in 20 patients will recover to the extent of Mr Bast , a 49 - year - old mechanic .
British experts described the operation as ' very promising '.
' Lucky guy ' : Neurosurgeon Amir Samii ( right ) tests the motor activity of apoplexia patient Walter Bast in Hanover , Germany
The CellBeads treatment is the brainchild of scientists at the British medical technology firm Biocompatibles International , based in Farnham , Surrey .
At its centre is a teabag - like sachet filled with tiny capsules , each containing around a million stem cells .
The stem cells , taken from bone marrow , have been genetically engineered to make a drug that protects brain cells from dying .
This lets the cells rejuvenate and repair the damage done by the stroke .
The stem cells are encapsulated in beads to hide them from the immune system and ensure they are not rejected by the body .
Enclosing everything in the 2 cm square ' teabag ' ensures the surgeon can easily remove it at the end of the treatment period .
Mr Bast , who lives near Bremen in Germany , agreed to be the first to test the operation after suffering two strokes in quick succession .
Miracle :
This is the tiny ' tea - bag - style ' bag made of polypropylene , which is filled with 500 alginate capsules
Doctors at the International Neuroscience - Institute in Hanover left the teabag in his brain for a fortnight while the stem cells pumped out the drug , known only as CM1 .
Now , six weeks after surgery , Mr Bast 's body has returned almost to normal .
His surgeon , Professor Thomas Brinker , said : ' We see a recovery as good as this in only the minority of patients , so it is an encouraging start .
It is important that we found no side - effects . '
Dr Peter Stratford , of Biocompatibles , said a one - size - fits - all treatment could be stored in hospital freezers ready for use when required .
If effective , it could have a huge impact on patients ' quality of life and save the NHS billions .
But stem cell scientists cautioned that many safety and ethical hurdles would have to be crossed before the treatment was accepted for widespread use .
Haemorrhagic strokes account for around 30 per cent of the 150,000 strokes in the UK each year .
Stroke is Britain 's third biggest killer , after heart disease and cancer , and causes more disability than any other disease .
It costs the economy about £ 7 billion a year , including NHS bills and lost productivity .
A snake catcher in Alice Springs says large numbers of venomous snakes have been found near homes in the last month .
Justin Rutherford says recent rain has encouraged insects and frogs in gardens , which the snakes come out to eat .
He recently removed a 2.1 metre mulga snake , also known as a King Brown , from a house in Alice Springs ' rural area , which was wrapped around a pool pump .
Mr Rutherford says it was the biggest venomous snake he 's ever seen .
" It 's probably the first one I 've seen that size .
The average that we catch is 1.3 , 1.4 metres so to see something in excess of two is really exciting " he said .
He says there were more than 60 snake call - outs in November and it appears lots of the reptiles are becoming active around Alice Springs .
" Everywhere mate .
There 's no particular spot that they 're not turning up at the moment .
So , big rains and if there 's more rain to come it might keep the activity alive so it just pays to be a bit cautious this time of the year and if you 've got a snake in your yard just give us a call and we 'll come and remove him and get him out of harm 's way " , he said .
Billions of Positrons Created in Laboratory
Irradiate a millimeter - thick gold target with the right kind of laser and you might get a surprise in the form of 100 billion positrons , the antimatter equivalent of electrons .
Researchers had been studying the process at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where they used thin targets that produced far fewer positrons .
The new laser method came about through simulations that showed a thicker target was more effective .
And suddenly lasers and antimatter are again making news .
Hui Chen is the Livermore scientist behind this work :
“ We ’ve detected far more anti-matter than anyone else has ever measured in a laser experiment .
We ’ve demonstrated the creation of a significant number of positrons using a short - pulse laser . ”

What ’s happening here is that ionized electrons are interacting with gold nuclei , giving off energy that decays into matter and antimatter .
It ’s a method that has been studied before at Livermore , using the laboratory ’s petawatt laser .
An article by physicist Michael Perry explains the interactions that laser achieved , first produced about a decade ago :
The intense beam of Livermore ’s Petawatt laser was powerful enough to break up atoms by causing reactions in their nuclei .
Accelerated by the laser , electrons traveling at nearly the speed of light collided with nuclei in a gold foil target , producing gamma rays that knocked out some of the neutrons from other gold nuclei and caused the gold to decay into elements such as platinum .
Gamma rays also zoomed in on a layer of uranium sitting behind the gold and split uranium nuclei into lighter elements .
Before the Petawatt , all of these effects had been solely in the domain of particle accelerators or nuclear reactors .
Accelerated to energies exceeding 100 megaelectronvolts , the electrons in the gold targets produced high - energy x rays .
These in turn decayed into pairs of electrons and their antimatter counterparts , positrons , in such large numbers as to possibly generate an electron - positron plasma , never before created in the laboratory .
An intense beam of protons also turned up .
Not only was the Petawatt the most powerful laser in the world , but , unexpectedly , it also was a powerful ion accelerator .
The petawatt laser was decommissioned in mid-1999 .
Its original development centered on the study of inertial confinement fusion , in which a pellet of fuel could be ignited through intense laser bombardment .
Variations on inertial confinement fusion play interestingly through interstellar propulsion studies , including the massive Daedalus probe designed by the British Interplanetary Society , which would have used deuterium and helium - 3 as its fodder for a trip to Barnard ’s Star .
But the petawatt laser also opened up the possibility of using a laser to do things particle accelerators had been called upon to do in the past .
And now we ’ve moved significantly beyond the earlier results — the petawatt experimenters detected roughly 100 antimatter particles compared to Chen ’s one million .
And note this :
Chen ’s number refers to particles that were directly detected , a result that produces an overall estimate of 100 billion positrons produced in the entire experiment .
We ’ve looked in these pages at the possibility of harvesting naturally forming antimatter found in our own Solar System , even near the Earth , where cosmic ray interactions with the upper atmosphere produce small quantities .
And the presence of antimatter near the center of our galaxy has been established , detectable because matter / antimatter annihilation produces gamma rays .
The trick has always been that harvesting antimatter — or producing it in accelerators — yields small amounts at great expense .
The latest work at least offers hope for more robust laboratory study of a material whose propulsive properties have long attracted interstellar theorists .
Just how significant a step this is remains to be seen , but I note what Peter Beiersdorfer , who works with Chen at Livermore , has to say :
“ We ’ve entered a new era .
Now , that we ’ve looked for it , it ’s almost like it hit us right on the head .
We envision a center for antimatter research , using lasers as cheaper antimatter factories . ”
We ’ll know more shortly , for Chen is presenting her work at the American Physical Society ’s Division of Plasma Physics meeting that runs through Friday this week .
A Livermore news release is available .

The world 's most famous polar bear is to be banished from Berlin zoo because of lack of cash – the first ursine victim of the credit crunch .
Knut the polar bear , who now weighs 210 kg , turns two on Friday .
But Berlin zoo will not be holding a party for its famous inmate , who has lived there since birth , announcing plans for his imminent eviction instead .
" He should go sooner rather than later , " Heiner Klös , the chief bear keeper , said .
" Knut must finally find a new home . "
He is set to leave by early 2010 .

More than 21,000 Berliners have signed a petition demanding that Knut be allowed to remain .
The bear 's fans plan to rent a site opposite the zoo on Friday for a Knut birthday party .
The city 's tourist industry did not welcome the news of the bear 's departure .
" Berlin is about to lose one of its best ambassadors , " said Christian Tänzler , of the tourist board .
" For our visitors from abroad it will mean the loss of one of the city 's true mascots . "
Conservative estimates put the revenue that Knut has earned at € 10 m ( £ 8.5 m ) .
Millions of cuddly Knut toys and T - shirts bearing his image have been sold , a Hollywood film has been made about him and he has even featured on the cover of the magazine Vanity Fair .
Berlin zoo cited financial concerns as the chief reason for the decision .
To keep Knut , the zoo would have to raise € 9 m to pay for roomier quarters for him and a future mate .
The city is still bankrupt and the credit crunch has destroyed hopes of an early recovery .
" We can not afford it in such times of economic strain , " a Berlin zoo spokesman said .
It emerged that Knut 's legal owner is Neumünster zoo in northern Germany ; its polar bear Lars fathered Knut in 2006 .
Peter Drü , the Neumünster director , said his zoo alone would decide on Knut 's future .
Zoologists are also concerned for Knut 's psychological welfare .
He was hand - raised for 18 months and zoologists have argued that because Knut only had contact with humans , he has developed psychopathic tendencies ; even if he found a mate , Knut would not have developed enough to be able to properly respond to her advances .
Bear experts have insisted that Knut should be found a new home with other polar bears as soon as possible .
The most likely option is a zoo in Gelsenkirchen , which has a three - year - old female polar bear called Lara .
Bowman 's posed with a sword on the social networking site , Bebo A teenager from Ayrshire who was caught posing with a sword on the social networking site Bebo has been fined £ 200 at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court .
Anthony Bowman , 19 , pleaded guilty to displaying the image on Bebo between January 2006 and July 2008 .
His case came to light after police conducted a trawl of the internet in a bid to cut crime and disorder .
Bowman was then identified by officers from the Strathclyde force 's Violence Reduction Taskforce .
The teenager 's case was reported to prosecutors as part of Operation Access - an ongoing campaign against violence .
Kilmarnock district procurator fiscal , Les Brown , said : " This case demonstrates the benefits of using creative investigative techniques to gather evidence of crimes of violence and anti-social behaviour .
Youngsters who use social networking sites irresponsibly should be warned that their activities are being monitored and they may get a visit from the police
Ch Supt Bill Fitzpatrick
Strathclyde Police " It sends a clear message that those responsible for such crimes cannot escape justice .
" During this operation , we have worked closely with local police divisions to ensure that cases detected through internet sites can be prosecuted effectively .
" Knife crime blights many local communities and we are committed to taking prompt and effective action to pursue those responsible and stop them in their tracks . "
Ch Supt Bill Fitzpatrick , of Strathclyde Police , said Operation Access had been introduced to " crack down on youth violence and anti-social behaviour within communities across Ayrshire " .
He added : " It provides us with an opportunity to identify young people who associate themselves with violence and the tools of violence .
" It is one strand of a very comprehensive strategy intended to bring about a reduction in violence by tackling it at source and in the most direct fashion .
" Youngsters who use social networking sites irresponsibly should be warned that their activities are being monitored and they may get a visit from the police . "

children 's record , Don Was , Ziggy Marley
Ziggy Marley is now in the studio recording a children ’s record with famed producer Don Was ( Rolling Stones , Bob Dylan , Bonnie Raitt ) .
Source is Worlds End .
His current record label is Tuff Gong Worldwide .
Straight from his website Ziggymarley.com he comments :
“ I decided to do a record focusing on children after finishing the Love Is My Religion tour .
Now that I am finally doing it I realize I was always being led in this direction .
Slowly but surely over the years the children ’s world became more pronounced in my world .
From Sesame Street , Arthur , Nickelodeon , Shark Tale and playing pre-concert children ’s shows , it just kept knocking at my door .
I finally realized what the Universe was telling me .
It is time to make a children ’s record .
There is a reason for this .
What has been hidden from the wise and the prudent is revealed to the babe and the suckling .
The message is for the children and Jah says it is time to make music for the children . ”
Beginning January 2009 , Marley is set to play Australia dates as part of the Raggamuffin Reggae Festival .

A gasoline pump nozzle is seen at a gas station in Arlington , Virginia in this June 11 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Jim Young
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. average retail gasoline prices fell below $ 2 per gallon , due to a continuing slide in crude oil prices , falling gasoline demand and a weakening global economy , according to the latest nationwide Lundberg survey .
“ It is the first time that the average price for regular gasoline has been below $ 2 a gallon since March 4 2005 , ” survey editor Trilby Lundberg said in an interview .
The national average price for self - serve regular unleaded gas was $ 1.9717 a gallon on November 21 , a drop of nearly 33 cents in the past two weeks , based on a survey of about 5,000 gas stations .
The average U.S. price per gallon of regular gasoline has now fallen about 81 cents in the past month and is down about $ 2.14 since peaking in mid-July .
It is world demand and not OPEC ( the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) that drove prices of crude so high earlier this year and it is demand not OPEC that will call the bottom on crude prices , said Lundberg .
Earlier on Sunday , Venezuela ’s oil minister Rafael Ramirez urged his fellow OPEC members to agree to lower crude oil supply by 1 million barrels per day at an emergency meeting of the group in Cairo on November 29 .
U.S. crude fell as low as $ 48.25 a barrel on Friday , down almost $ 100 from record highs of over $ 147 in July .
OPEC had agreed in October to cut output by 1.5 million barrels per day from November 1 , but this move has failed to stem the decline in oil prices .
At $ 2.81 , Honolulu , had the highest average price for self - serve regular unleaded gas , while the lowest price was $ 1.61 a gallon in St Louis , Missouri , according to the survey .
It is a message sent from on high to the world 's financial and political elite .
The Roman Catholic Church is calling for the effective closure of secretive tax havens as a ' necessary first step ' to restore the global economy to health .
In a policy paper from the Holy See , Pope Benedict pins the blame for the international financial crisis largely on ' offshore centres ' , many of which , such as the Channel Islands , are British dependencies .
' They have given support to imprudent economic and financial practices and have also played a significant role in the imbalances of development , allowing a gigantic flight of capital linked to tax evasion , ' says the report .
' Offshore markets could also be linked to the recycling of profits from illegal activities . '
The Pope points to estimates that the global fiscal deficit caused by offshore activities could amount to a staggering $ 255 bn ( £ 175 bn ) which is ' more than three times the entire sum of [ global ] development aid ' .
The papal intervention comes as a growing and powerful coalition of civil society , unions and multi - faith groups , frustrated by the limited response to the economic crisis by western governments , are starting to construct a radical framework to rebuild the global financial system after the most calamitous destruction of value seen for 80 years .
In language that barely conceals the Vatican 's anger at the effect of the credit crunch on the world 's poorest people , the reflection paper argues that tax havens , which banks use to escape the gaze of international financial watchdogs , facilitate the transfer of wealth from poverty - stricken nations to the rich world .
The paper also attacks the short - term greed that created the crisis , which it says ' came about after a long period during which people succumbed to the pressure of the immediate objective of pursuing short - term financial results ' .
John Chistensen , a former economic adviser to the Jersey government and an expert on tax havens , said : ' This shows that one of the world 's most influential institutions realises that central to any attempt to reform the world 's financial system must be a recognition that trust can only flow once radical steps to improve transparency and disclosure are taken . '
But the Vatican paper will raise eyebrows among the Church 's critics , who point to its history of hoarding gold , artwork and cash in Europe and beyond .
The Pope 's stance on tax havens is part of a growing trend .
President - elect Barack Obama has vowed to close loopholes that see US citizens avoid an estimated $ 100 bn in taxes each year .
And last month Alistair Darling announced a fundamental review of ' offshore centres ' under UK jurisdiction .
Intriguingly , the Vatican Bank , officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion , is one of few financial institutions to have emerged unscathed from the global bank crisis .
Its president , Angelo Caloia , claimed in October that it has ' no uncollectible losses ' and steered clear of some of the more arcane financial instruments , such as credit default swaps , that have helped to bring about the destruction of the banking system .
It is understood that 80 per cent of Vatican investments are in safe government bonds , with 20 per cent in shares .
The bank makes very limited financial disclosures , but the Rev Thomas Resse in his book Inside the Vatican claimed a cardinal told him in 1994 that it had $ 4bn in deposits and an annual income of $ 40 m .
Many experts believe this to be a spectacular underestimate .
The Vatican deals with its financial affairs separately and has a deficit of $ 14 m .
It has been hit by a weak dollar , which has markedly reduced the value of contributions from the US , which make up the bulk of the church 's donations .
Caloia headed the bank after the scandalous collapse of Banco Ambrosiano triggered the death of Roberto Calvi , found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London , weighed down by bricks .
Calvi , known as God 's Banker , was at the helm of Banco Ambrosiano when it lost £ 800 m in a corruption scandal implicating senior members of the Vatican , the mafia and a Masonic sect whose members included senior Italian politicians .
Prosecutors said today they had charged the priest and four nuns with imprisonment leading to death , while religious authorities said he would be barred from celebrating liturgy until the investigation was completed .
The monastery will be shut if they are found guilty , Father Daniel 's superiors said .
Cornici was found dead on Wednesday , gagged and chained to a cross , after fellow nuns called an ambulance , according to police .
Mihaela Straub , spokeswoman for the police in the province of Vaslui , said Daniel and four other nuns had claimed Cornici was possessed and should be exorcised .
Before being crucified she had been kept shut up for several days , her hands and feet tied and without food or drink , he said .
Cornici had entered the monastery just three months before , after visiting a friend who was a nun there , police said .
As her coffin entered the church of the monastery today no church bells were sounded while nuns cast distrustful glances at the strangers , including two AFP reporters , present at the ceremony .
Claps of thunder from an approaching storm were sometimes the only sounds to break the silence .
" This storm is proof that the will of God has been done , " Daniel said .
" You see it ? " said the priest , gesturing at the body , lying in an annexe and still showing the marks of the gag .
Daniel has lived for the past four years in the isolated monastery located in the hills of one of the poorest regions of Romania , without running water or electricity .
" Over there , in your world , the people must know that the devil exists .
Personally I can find his work in the gestures and speech of possessed people , because man is often weak and lets himself be easily manipulated by the forces of evil , " said the bearded young priest .
" I do n't understand why journalists are making such a fuss about this .
Exorcism is a common practice in the heart of the Romanian Orthodox church and my methods are not at all unknown to other priests , " he said .
Sociologist Alred Bulai said corporal punishment was still commonly used in certain Romanian monasteries .
" It 's happening particularly in the isolated monasteries , where the superiors have difficulty understanding the current realities and adapting themselves to modern life , " Bulai said .
It was not clear why Father Daniel believed the nun was possessed .
One parishioner , Dora , said the nun " had to be punished , she had an argument with the Father during a Sunday mass and insulted him in front of the congregation . "
Mediafax news agency reported today the Cornici had recently been treated for " schizophrenia " at the local hospital , but the chief of the local child welfare office , Ionel Bratianu , said the nun was " in good health and did not suffer from any psychiatric trouble " .
Cornici was raised in an orphanage until the age of 19 , when she travelled to Germany to work as a nanny for a family of German doctors .
After in - depth psychological and psychiatric tests , the German embassy had declared her apt to take care of children , said Bratianu .
Since the fall of the communist regime in December 1989 , the Orthodox church , which represents 85 per cent of Romania 's 22 million inhabitants , is rated in many opinion polls as the most trusted institution in the country .
Vitalie Danciu , the superior of a nearby monastery at Golia , called the crucifixion " inexcusable " , but a spokesman for the Orthodox patriarchate in Bucharest refused to condemn it .
" I do n't know what this young woman did , " Bogdan Teleanu said .

Titan 's volcanoes ooze cold slurry rather than molten lava Titan , the haze - shrouded moon of Saturn , displays tantalising evidence of ice volcanoes .
Two regions of Titan have been seen recently , by the Cassini spacecraft , to undergo clear changes in brightness .
This activity , and radar images hinting at flow - like structures , suggest the presence of volcanoes , scientists say .
Rather than erupting molten rock , Titan's " cryovolcanoes " are thought to ooze a slurry made of water ice , ammonia and methane .
There are suggestions that these frigid lava flows could be as much as 200 m thick .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Cryovolcanism is a process that many people have modelled in theory and shown to be viable in the outer Solar System on an object of Titan 's size , " said Bob Nelson from the US space agency Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
Researchers working on the Cassini mission argued their case here at the American Geophysical Union 's Fall Meeting .
Reflectance glory Early flybys of Titan by the US - European spacecraft spotted intriguing surface features that suggested the presence of cryovolcanism , but the thick atmosphere that shrouds this enigmatic world has always made definitive statements tricky .
The evidence , however , is mounting .
Cassini scientists can now point to distinct changes in brightness and reflectance at two separate locations in Titan 's equatorial region .
The changes were picked up by Cassini's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer instrument on flybys from July 2004 to March 2006 .
In one of the two regions , the reflectance of the surface surged upward and remained higher than expected .
In the other region , the reflectance shot up , but then declined .
The Cassini spacecraft spotted the suspected volcanoes in different regions
Cassini's radar - an instrument that can pierce the thick atmosphere to map the surface , at low resolution - sees lobe - like features at the two locations .
Their thickness , about 200 m , is consistent with a cyrovolcanic flow interpretation .
" These flows would come out as a thick slurry , " said Dr Rosaly Lopes , a Cassini radar team investigation scientist .
" They can be thick because cryomagma would be viscous , similar to lava flows on Earth . "
Scientists say they also have evidence that ammonia frost is sometimes present at one of the two sites .
The ammonia was evident only at times when the region was inferred to be active .
" Ammonia is a material that many thought would be in Titan 's interior but not found on the surface , " explained Dr Nelson .
" So the finding of ammonia on the surface for temporary periods of time strongly implies materials from the interior are being transported and fused on to the surface . "
Sceptical view Titan 's thick atmosphere makes observing the planet 's surface difficult Scientists like the idea of cryovolcanism because it is one way to explain why so much methane is retained in Titan 's atmosphere .
Without some means of replenishment , the moon 's original methane content should have been destroyed long ago by the Sun 's ultraviolet light .
Not all scientists are convinced by the latest assessment , however .
Jeffrey Moore , a Nasa planetary geologist independent of the Cassini mission , told the meeting : " The flow - like features we see on the surface may just be icy debris that has been lubricated by methane rain and transported down - slope into sinuous piles like mudflows . "
Dr Nelson countered : " Scepticism is part of the evolution of a scientific finding but logic dictates that we start looking at things in certain ways when certain patterns start falling together . "

Unveiled :
The car with a gadget that guarantees every traffic light will be green when you get there
They 're the bane of city drivers everywhere : those traffic lights that invariably turn to red just as you approach , making even the shortest journey a stop - start affair .
But now a German car - maker has come to the rescue – with a device that ensures you can always arrive at a light when it is green .
The in - car gadget tells drivers how fast to go in order to sail through a junction by ‘ speaking ’ to special transmitters fitted inside a traffic signal that can be up to 300 yards away .
Scroll down for more
How the device will beat the red light queues
It arrives at the calculation after plotting the car ’s position and approach route , then displays the optimum speed on a screen .
Audi , which has developed the device called Travolution , claims extensive trials have been so successful that in one phase of testing , cars nearly always hit a light on green .
The car - maker also says the system will benefit the environment by cutting exhaust emissions because fewer cars will be stationary at lights – and it will improve fuel economy by ending stop - start inefficiency .
But it admits the technology will not benefit the driver if the roads are particularly clogged .
Travolution works on Wireless Local Area Network ( WLAN ) technology and can be fitted to any car make .
The AA said the device – which is not yet in mass production – could be vital in meeting new European Union emissions standards .
The motoring organisation added : ‘ This could be an extremely useful tool for reducing CO2 and saving motorists money .
However , it will need to be tested thoroughly in many real and different types of traffic conditions to ensure there are no problems with other drivers . ’
During two years of tests in Audi ’s home town of Ingolstadt , Bavaria , 46 ‘ intelligent ’ sets of traffic lights were programmed to connect wirelessly with an Audi A5 coupé and A6 Avant estate carrying Travolution .
One test involving three busy junctions found that drivers were hardly ever made to stop on red , according to the car - maker .
Travolution was initially developed by the Technical University of Munich in conjunction with traffic technology firm GEVAS .
Professor Fritz Busch , of the university , said : ‘ The new approaches to network - wide control of traffic lights , together with communication between traffic lights and intelligent cars , exploits a potential for improving traffic flows that has previously gone untapped . ’
Kate Dixon of Audi UK said that if a minimum of ten per cent of cars in any given town were fitted with the technology , all road users would notice an improvement in traffic levels .
Ms Dixon added : ‘ Obviously , if the traffic is solid then Travolution wo n’t assist you .
But if the traffic is moving slowly then it will advise you what speed to maintain in order to avoid stopping . ’
Audi said it was too early to say how much the device would cost if it is put into mass production .
Further tests are expected next year .
Will this encourage drivers to speed up ?

Cement , a vast source of planet - warming carbon dioxide , could be transformed into a means of stripping the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere , thanks to an innovation from British engineers .
The new environmentally friendly formulation means the cement industry could change from being a " significant emitter to a significant absorber of CO2 , " says Nikolaos Vlasopoulos , chief scientist at London - based Novacem , whose invention has garnered support and funding from industry and environmentalists .
The new cement , which uses a different raw material , certainly has a vast potential market .
Making the 2bn tonnes of cement used globally every year pumps out 5 % of the world 's CO2 emissions - more than the entire aviation industry .
And the long - term trends are upwards : a recent report by the French bank Credit Agricole estimated that , by 2020 , demand for cement will increase by 50 % compared to today .
Making traditional cement results in greenhouse gas emissions from two sources : it requires intense heat , and so a lot of energy to heat up the ovens that cook the raw material , such as limestone .
That then releases further CO2 as it burns .
But , until now , noone has found a large - scale way to tackle this fundamental problem .
Novacem 's cement , based on magnesium silicates , not only requires much less heating , it also absorbs large amounts of CO2 as it hardens , making it carbon negative .
Set up by Vlasopoulos and his colleagues at Imperial College London , Novacem has already attracted the attention of major construction companies such as Rio Tinto Minerals , WSP Group and Laing O'Rourke , and investors including the Carbon Trust .
The company has just started a £ 1.5 m project funded by the government - backed Technology Strategy Board to build a pilot plant .
If all goes well , Vlasopoulos expects to have Novacem products on the market within five years .
Jonathan Essex , a civil engineer at the building consultancy Bioregional who also sits on the environment and sustainability panel for the Institution of Civil Engineers , welcomed Novacem 's ideas to tackle the carbon impact of cement .
" In the UK the climate bill commits us to reduce CO2 emissions , and every sector should play its part .
The construction industry needs to take greater responsibility for its own environmental impact . "
Essex said that , if Novacem can make their cement at a competitive price , the next step could be to take even more CO2 emissions out of the process by using renewable energy to fire the furnaces .
According to Novacem , its product can absorb , over its lifecycle , around 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of cement .
This compares to carbon emissions of about 0.4 tonnes per of standard cement .
" From that point of view , it 's attractive , " said Rachael Nutter , head of business incubators at the Carbon Trust .
" The real challenge is what is the supply chain , who do you need to partner with to take it to market ?
The million - dollar question is what are the applications of it ?
If it ends up as decorative applications such as floor tiles , it 's quite interesting but not as much as if you get into load - bearing structural stuff . "
Previous attempts to make cement greener have included adding more aggregate to a concrete mixture , thereby using less cement .
But this still does not tackle the problem of the carbon emissions from making the cement in the first place .
Other systems use polymers in the mix , but none have yet made a significant impact on the market .
A spokesperson for the British Cement Association expressed a sceptical note , saying that though there was much ongoing laboratory work on new types of cement , there were also problems .
" The reality is that the geological availability , and global distribution , of suitable natural resources , coupled with the extensive validation needed to confirm fitness - for - purpose , make it highly unlikely that these cements will a be realistic alternative for volume building . "
Vlasopoulos responded that magnesium silicates are abundant worldwide , with 10,000 billion tonnes available , according to some estimates .
" In addition , the production process of our cement is of a chemical nature , which means it can also utilise various industrial byproducts containing magnesium in its composition . "
He is confident the material will be strong enough for use in buildings but acknowledged that getting licenses to use it will take several years of testing .
Explainer : Ecofriendly vs traditional cement
Standard cement , also known as Portland cement , is made by heating limestone or clay to around 1,500C .
The processing of the ingredients releases 0.8 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of cement .
When it is eventually mixed with water for use in a building , each tonne of cement can absorb up to 0.4 tonnes of CO2 , but that still leaves an overall carbon footprint per tonne of 0.4 tonnes .
Novacem 's cement , which has a patent pending on it , uses magnesium silicates which emit no CO2 when heated .
Its production process also runs at much lower temperatures - around 650C .
This leads to total CO2 emissions of up to 0.5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of cement produced .
But the Novacem cement formula absorb far more CO2 as it hardens - about 1.1 tonnes .
So the overall carbon footprint is negative - ie the cement removes 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne used .
The State of California will run out of money within two months , forcing Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to start settling bills and paying employees by issuing " IOU " notes , his chief financial officer has revealed .
John Chiang , the state controller , admitted on Monday that a spiralling budget crisis , which has left California spending billions of dollars more each month than it can raise in taxes , will see his coffers run dry some time in mid-February .
At present , Mr Schwarzenegger 's administration is spending $ 11bn a year more than its total income .
The figure is now rising exponentially and has been forecast to hit $ 42bn ( £ 29bn ) by 2010 .

Unless taxes can be raised , or spending reined in , millions of public - sector employees and private contractors face having their salaries paid in " registered warrants , " a piece of paper which the Governor will promise to exchange for cash as soon as he is able .
The effective bankruptcy of an entire state is unprecedented in American history , even during the Great Depression .
Yet despite California 's standing as one of the most prosperous regions of the wealthiest nation on earth , its Governor seems powerless to stave off disaster .
So - called " direct democracy , " through which small interest groups can enact laws by making them the subject of an electoral " proposition " or ballot measure that attracts more than 50 per cent of the vote , has severely limited his ability to manage finances .
Property taxes , the mainstay of any state 's income , have been frozen for many homeowners since a proposition was passed in the late 1970s .
A separate measure , introduced in the 1980s , means that income taxes cannot be raised without the agreement of two - thirds of the state 's lawmakers .
Meanwhile , a raft of other ballot measures control spending , meaning that only 25 per cent of California 's spending is considered " discretionary " .
The rest has been " earmarked " for a particular cause or project .
The result has been political gridlock , with the minority of Republicans at the state assembly in Sacramento able to block tax rises , while the majority of Democrats refuse to countenance any cuts in spending .
Mr Schwarzenegger , who declared a " fiscal emergency " earlier this month , has pledged to hold round - the - clock negotiations to find a deal between Democrats and Republicans in his legislature in time for Christmas .
However , public - sector unions yesterday pledged to block his plan to force state employees to have two extra days off a month , saving $ 1.5 bn a year .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday urged Pakistan and India to cooperate with “ resolve and urgency " to catch and prosecute those behind last week ’s terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed more than 170 people and wounded hundreds .
Speaking in New Delhi , Rice leaned on Pakistan amid a flurry of reports that a militant group there trained the assailants and planned the efficiently executed operation , which threw India ’s financial capital into chaos and kept security forces at bay for 60 hours .
“ I have said that Pakistan needs to act with resolve and urgency and cooperate fully and transparently , ” Rice told reporters .
“ That message has been delivered and will be delivered to Pakistan . ”
Investigators have found strong evidence pointing to Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistani Islamist network that has been accused of previous attacks in India , including Mumbai train bombings in 2006 that killed about 200 people .

Investigators now believe that as many as 15 people were in a hit team that struck Mumbai and that the gunmen departed from the Pakistani port city of Karachi and talked by cellphone with a Lashkar leader in Pakistan , said a person close to the investigation who requested anonymity because the probe is continuing .
Rice is expected to visit Islamabad , the Pakistani capital , today .
While she was in India on Wednesday , Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , met with Pakistani civilian and military officials .
The visits were aimed at preventing a further deterioration in relations between the nuclear - armed South Asian nations .
Mullen urged the Pakistanis to “ investigate aggressively any and all possible ties to groups based in Pakistan , ” a U.S. statement said afterward .
Evidence of such ties has mounted , Western anti-terrorism officials said .

The sole suspect in custody and nine assailants who were killed were all Pakistanis , the officials said .
And the gunmen used Thuraya satellite phones and cellphones stolen from their victims to make repeated calls to a Lashkar figure , said the person close to the investigation , citing information from British and U.S. investigators .
Numbers called on a recovered satellite phone and the cellphones match and have been traced to Yusuf Muzammil , suspected of being the commander , the source said .
Investigators believe that Muzammil gave orders from Lahore , Pakistan , as his fighters battled police and commandos .
The log of one victim ’s cellphone suggests a chilling sequence of events the morning of Nov. 27 , the source said .
Gunmen forced a Singaporean woman held on the 19th floor of the Oberoi hotel to make two calls to her husband to relay a demand to Indian authorities to refrain from action against the hostage - takers or they would kill her , the source said .
Investigators say the log shows that a call was then placed to Muzammil , after which there were no more calls to Singapore and calls by the husband went unanswered , the source said .
The woman was found dead with two other women in the hotel room , the source said .

“ The theory is that they killed her at that point and that Muzammil was giving orders on who to execute , ” the source said .
Muzammil also made a call to Bangladesh during the attacks and asked an unknown person for five subscriber identity module , or SIM , cards , presumably for cellphones , the source said .
Indian intelligence intercepted the call , which may have been related to the attacks or to separate activity in Bangladesh , the source said .
Identification materials and other evidence found on the boat used by the attackers indicate that 15 people traveled from Karachi , the source said .
“ There ’s evidence to show there were five additional living people on the boat and only 10 are accounted for , ” the source said .
It ’s unclear whether the additional five were gunmen , the source said .

Investigators have identified Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi , Lashkar - e - Taiba ’s operational chief , as another suspected mastermind , the source said .
The investigators want to know whether members of the Pakistani security forces or the nation ’s main spy agency , Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , were aware of or involved in the plot , the source said .
“ They are looking at elements of the ISI and the possibility that they knew what was going on , ” the source said .
“ They do believe the training was at a very high level of quality .
There is a belief these guys may have been trained at a Lashkar - e - Taiba camp in Muzaffarabad , ” capital of Pakistani - controlled Kashmir .
A link to Pakistani security forces has not been established , officials cautioned .
“ We know that the close relations between the Pakistani regime and the organization still exist , ” a Western anti-terrorism official said .
“ We know as well of Pakistani intelligence officers ’ presence in the training camps in Kashmir .
This is a presence that continues . ”

India has stepped up pressure on Pakistan to hand over 20 terrorism suspects , including Muzammil , other leaders of Lashkar - e - Taiba and Dawood Ibrahim , a fugitive Mumbai gangster under investigation for a potential support role in the attacks .
But Pakistan appeared to dig in its heels .
President Asif Ali Zardari said in an interview that aired Wednesday that Pakistan would try any suspects itself , and only if India provided hard evidence of their involvement in the attacks .
“ If we had the proof , we would try them in our courts , we would try them in our land and we would sentence them , ” he said .
Zardari also said he doubted Indian assertions that the captured suspect is a Pakistani .
Indian officials say the suspect has provided details on the involvement of Pakistani groups .
But the credibility of his information was called into question Wednesday when police found an unexploded bomb he probably planted a week earlier in a railway station that he had n’t revealed despite days of questioning .
When asked about it , according to local media , he told police that he was following Lashkar ’s procedures on handling police interrogations .

Wednesday night , tens of thousands of people massed on Mumbai ’s waterfront , wearing “ I Love Mumbai ” T - shirts , singing patriotic songs and holding up banners , some of which denounced Indian politicians for allowing the attacks to happen .
“ Give us a gun , send us to the terrorist base and we ’ll get them ! ” shouted a group of young men .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuba ’s former leader Fidel Castro said on Thursday his country could talk to U.S. President - elect Barack Obama , in Havana ’s latest overture to the incoming Democratic administration in Washington .
Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro talks during a meeting with his brother Cuban President Raul Castro and Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez in Havana June 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Estudios Revolucion / Handout
His remarks followed comments from his brother , President Raul Castro , who told a U.S. magazine he could meet Obama in a “ neutral place ” to try to end the Communist - run island ’s four - decade conflict with the United States .
“ With Obama , talks could happen anywhere he wants , ” Fidel Castro , America ’s longtime Cold War enemy , wrote in the latest of a series of columns he has published in state - run media since falling ill in 2006 .
“ He should remember the carrot - and - stick approach will not work with our country , ” Castro wrote of Obama .
“ The sovereign rights of the Cuban people are not negotiable . ”
Fidel Castro , who took power nearly 50 years ago after an armed revolution , has not been seen in public since undergoing surgery for an undisclosed illness in July 2006 .
But he has met several state leaders and appeared in photographs .
Obama , who takes office on January 20 , has raised hopes of improved U.S. - Cuba ties by saying he was open to talks with the Cuban government and has favored easing some U.S. sanctions .
He has said he will reverse the U.S. administration ’s policies restricting Cuban Americans from visiting Cuba and sending cash to their families .
He is willing to talk to Castro but would keep the four - decade - old U.S. trade embargo as leverage to influence changes in the one - party state .
Raul Castro formally took over the Cuban presidency in February and has said several times Havana is willing to talk to the United States .
Before the U.S. presidential election last month , Fidel Castro praised Obama as intelligent and humanitarian in the columns that have become his main form of communication .
Raul suggested in the interview he could meet Obama in Guantanamo Bay , where the United States maintains a naval base , which Cuba considers a violation of its sovereignty .
Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s Sheldon Adelson has had quite a 2008 !
Year - to - date his net worth has decreased by $ 30 BILLION .
And we thought Indian billionaire Lakshi Mittal , he with his $ 50 billion in five months worth of losses , was alone in having a major league sucky time of it — as far as billionaires go .
Looks like he has some company !
WSJ : ... his net worth declined by about $ 100 million a day , or $ 4.1 million an hour , or $ 69,000 a minute , or $ 1,157 a second .
It is possible Mr. Adelson now may hold the title for the largest one - year paper loss in U.S. history .
.. Even looking further back in history , it is hard to find personal wealth destruction quite like Adelson’s .
In the Great Depression , the Rockefeller ’s lost about half their wealth , totaling about $ 1 billion .
But that was over a period of years , and even adjusting for inflation–about 14 times 1930 dollars –that loss is pocket change compared with that of Mr. Adelson .
What is more , while the losses of Messrs .
Buffett , Brin , Page and Gates represent a fraction of their wealth , Mr. Adelson ’s net worth has shrunk a staggering 93 % .
SELF AWARENESS : THE LAST FRONTIER
One of the last remaining problems in science is the riddle of consciousness .
The human brain — a mere lump of jelly inside your cranial vault — can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space and grapple with concepts such as zero and infinity .
Even more remarkably it can ask disquieting questions about the meaning of its own existence .
" Who am I " is arguably the most fundamental of all questions .
It really breaks down into two problems — the problem of qualia and the problem of the self .
My colleagues , the late Francis Crick and Christof Koch have done a valuable service in pointing out that consciousness might be an empirical rather than philosophical problem , and have offered some ingenious suggestions .
But I would disagree with their position that the qualia problem is simpler and should be addressed first before we tackle the " Self . "
I think the very opposite is true .
I have every confidence that the problem of self will be solved within the lifetimes of most readers of this essay .
But not qualia .
The qualia problem is well known .
Assume I am an intellectually highly advanced , color - blind martian .
I study your brain and completely figure out down to every last detail what happens in your brain — all the physico - chemical events — when you see red light of wavelength 600 and say " red " .
You know that my scientific description , although complete from my point of view , leaves out something ineffable and essentially non-communicable , namely your actual experience of redness .
There is no way you can communicate the ineffable quality of redness to me short of hooking up your brain directly to mine without air waves intervening ( Bill Hirstein and I call this the qualia - cable ; it will work only if my color blindness is caused by missing receptor pigments in my eye , with brain circuitry for color being intact . )
We can define qualia as that aspect of your experience that is left out by me — the color - blind Martian .
I believe this problem will never be solved or will turn out ( from an empirical standpoint ) to be a pseudo - problem .
Qualia and so - called " purely physical " events may be like two sides of a Moebius strip that look utterly different from our ant - like perspective but are in reality a single surface .
So to understand qualia , we may need to transcend our ant - like view , as Einstein did in a different context .
But how to go about it is anybody 's guess .
The problem of self , on the other hand , is an empirical one that can be solved — or at least explored to its very limit — by science .
If and when we do it will be a turning point in the history of science .
Neurological conditions have shown that the self is not the monolithic entity it believes itself to be .
It seems to consist of many components each of which can be studied individually , and the notion of one unitary self may well be an illusion .
( But if so we need to ask how the illusion arises ; was it an adaptation acquired through natural selection ? )
Consider the following disorders which illustrate different aspects of self .
•
Out of body experiences : patients with right fronto - parietal strokes report floating out into space watching their body down below — undoubtedly contributing to the myth of disembodied souls .
Left hemisphere strokes result in the feeling of a mysterious presence — a phantom twin — hovering behind the patient 's left shoulder .
• Apotemnophilia :
An otherwise completely normal person develops an intense desire to have his arm or leg amputated .
The right parietal ( a part of it known a SPL ) normally contains a complete internal image of the body .
We showed recently that in these patients the part of the map corresponding to the affected limb is congenitally missing , leading to alienation of the limb .
The patients are sometimes sexually attracted to amputees , We postulate that in " normal " individuals there is a genetically specified homunculus in S2 that serves as a template acting on limbic and visual areas to determine aesthetic preference for ones own body type .
Hence pigs are attracted to pigs not people .
( Which is not to deny an additional role for olfactory and visual imprinting )
But if the image in S2 is missing a limb this may translate into an aesthetic preference toward an amputee - mediated by reverse projections that are known to connect the ( " emotional " ) amygdala to every stage in the visual hierarchy .
• Transsexuality ; A woman claims that for as far back as she can remember she felt she was a man trapped in a woman 's body — even experiencing phantom penises and erections .
Our ordinary notion of every person having a single sexual identity ( or self ) is called into question .
It turns out there are at least four distinct aspects of sexuality ; your external anatomy , your internal brain - based body image , your sexual orientation and your sexual identity — who you think others think of you as .
Normally these are harmonized in fetal development but if they get uncoupled you become a transsexual person .
( It is important to note there is nothing " abnormal " about them , any more than you would regard being gay as abnormal . ) •
A patient with a phantom arm simply watches a student volunteer 's arm being touched .
Astonishingly the patient feels the touch in his phantom .
The barrier between him and others has been dissolved .
•
Cotards syndrome ; the patient claims he is dead and rejects all evidence to the contrary .
• Capgras delusion ; the patient claims that his mother looks like his mother but is in fact an imposter .
Other patients claim that they inhabit a house that 's a duplicate of their real house .
Bill Hirstein and I ( and Haydn Ellis and Andrew Young ) have shown that this highly specific delusion arises because the visual area in the brain is disconnected from emotional areas .
So when our patient David sees his mother he recognizes her — along with the penumbra of memories linked to her .
But no emotions and no jolt of familiarity is evoked so he rationalizes away his curious predicament saying she is an imposter .
It is important to note that these patients are usually intelligent and mentally stable in most other respects .
It is the selective nature of the delusion that makes it surprising and worth studying .
David also had difficulty abstracting across successive encounters of a new person seen in different contexts to create an enduring identity for that person .
Without the flash of recognition he ought to have experienced in the second , third or n'th exposure , he could n't bind the experiences together into a single person .
Even more remarkably David sometimes duplicated his own self !
He would often refer to " The other David who is on vacation . "
It was as if even successive episodes of his own self were not bound together the way they are in you and me .
This is not to be confused with MPD ( " multiple personality disorder " ) seen in psychiatric contexts .
MPD is often a dubious diagnosis made for medico- legal and insurance purposes and tends to fluctuate from moment to moment .
( I have often been tempted to send two bills to an MPD patient to see if he pays both . )
Patients like David , on the other hand , may give us genuine insight into the neural basis of selfhood .
•
In another disorder the patient , with damage to the anterior cingulate
develops " akinetic mutism " .
He lies in bed fully awake and alert but cannot talk or walk — indeed does n't interact in any way with people or things around him .
Sometimes such patients wake up ( when given certain drugs ) and will say " I knew what was going on around me but I simply had no desire to do anything " .
It was if he had selective loss of one major attribute of the self — free will " .
•
Even odder is a phenomenon called " The telephone syndrome " .
The patient ( I 'll call him John ) will display akinetic mutism — no visual consciousness — when seeing his ( say ) father in person .
But if he receives a phone call from his father he suddenly becomes conscious and starts conversing with him normally .
( S. Sriram and Orrin Devinsky , personal communication . )
It 's as if there are two Johns — the visual John who is only partially conscious and the auditory John ( with his own self ) who talks over the phone .
This implies a degree of segregation of selves — all the way from sensory areas to motor output — that no one would have suspected .
We will now consider two aspects of self that are considered almost axiomatic .
First its essentially private nature .
You can empathise with someone but never to the point of experiencing her sensations or dissolving into her ( except in pathological states like folie a duex and romantic love ) .
Second , it is aware of its own existence .
A self that negates itself is an oxymoron .
Yet both these axioms can fall apart in disease ; without affecting other aspects of self .
An amputee can literally feel his phantom limb being touched when he merely watches a normal person being touched .
A person with Cotard 's syndrome will deny that he exists ; claiming that his body is a mere empty shell .
Explaining these disorders in neural terms can help illuminate how the normal self is constructed .
To account for some of these syndromes we need to invoke mirror neurons discovered by Giacomo Rizzolatti , Victorio Gallase and Marco Iacoboni .
Neurons in the prefrontal cortex send out sophisticated signals down the spinal cord that orchestrate skilled and semi-skilled movements such as putting food in your mouth , pulling a lever , pushing a button , etc .
These are " ordinary " motor command neurons but some of them , known as mirror neurons , also fire when you merely watch another person perform a similar act .
It 's as if the neuron ( more strictly the network of which the neuron is part ) was using the visual input to do a sort of " virtual reality simulation " of the other persons actions — allowing you to empathize with her and view the world from her point of view .
In a previous Edge essay I also speculated that these neurons can not only help simulate other people 's behavior but can be turned " inward " — as it were — to create second - order representations or metarepresentations of your own earlier brain processes .
This could be the neural basis of introspection , and of the reciprocity of self awareness and other awareness .
There is obviously a chicken - or - egg question here as to which evolved first , but that is tangential to my main argument .
( See also Nick Humphrey 's contributions to Edge . )
The main point is that the two co-evolved , mutually enriching each other to create the mature representation of self that characterizes modern humans .
Our ordinary language illustrates this , as when we say " I feel a bit self conscious " , when I really mean that I am conscious of others being conscious of me .
Or when I speak of being self critical or experiencing " self - pity " .
( A chimp could — arguably — feel pity for a begging chimp , but I doubt whether it would ever experience self - pity . )
I also suggest that although these neurons initially emerged in our ancestors to adopt another 's allocentric visual point of view , they evolved further in humans to enable the adoption of another 's metaphorical point of view .
( " I see it from his point of view " etc. )
This , too , might have been a turning point in evolution although how it might have occurred is deeply puzzling .
There are also : " touch mirror neurons " that fire not only when your skin is touched but when you watch someone else touched .
This raises an interesting question ; how does the neuron know what the stimulus is ?
Why does n't the activity of these neurons lead you to literally experience the touch delivered to another person ?
There are two answers .
First the tactile receptors in your skin tell the other touch neurons in the cortex ( the non-mirror neurons ) that they are not being touched and this null signal selectively vetos some of the outputs of mirror neurons .
This would explain why our amputee experienced touch sensations when he watched our student being touched ; the amputation had removed the vetoing .
It is a sobering thought that the only barrier between you and others is your skin receptors !
A second reason why your mirror neurons do n't lead you to mime everyone you watch or to literally experience their tactile sensations might be that your frontal lobes send feedback signals to partially inhibit the mirror neurons ' output .
( It cant completely inhibit them ; otherwise there would be no point having mirror neurons in the first place . )
As expected , if the frontal lobes are damaged you do start miming people ( " echopraxia " ) .
Recent evidence suggests that there may also be mirror neurons for pain , disgust , facial expression — perhaps for all outwardly visible expression of emotions .
( We call these " empathy " neurons or Gandhi neurons . )
Some of these are in the anterior cingulate — others in the insula .
I mention these to emphasize that despite all the pride that your self takes in its individuality and privacy , the only thing that separates you from me is a small subset of neural circuits in your frontal lobes interacting with mirror neurons .
Damage these and you " lose your identity " — your sensory system starts blending with those of others .
Like the proverbial Mary of philosopher 's thought experiments , you experience their qualia .
We suggest that many otherwise inexplicable neuro - psychiatric symptoms may arise from flaws in these circuits leading to " you - me " confusion and impoverished ego - differentiation .
Lindsay Oberman , Eric Altschuler and I have seen strong preliminary hints that autistic children have a paucity of mirror neurons which would not only explain their poor imitation , empathy and ' pretend play " ( which requires role - playing ) but also why they sometimes confuse the pronouns I and You , and have difficulty with introspection .
Even Freudian phenomena like " projection " , seen in all of us , may have similar origins ; " I love you " turns to " You love me " to make me feel safer .
Let us return to Cotards syndrome — the ultimate paradox of the self negating its own existence ( sometimes claiming " I am dead " , " I can smell my body rotting " , etc. ) .
We postulate that this arises from a combination of two lesions .
First , a lesion that is analogous to Capgras but far more pervasive .
Instead of emotions being disconnected from just visual centers , it is disconnected from all sensations and even memories of sensations .
So the entire world becomes an imposter — unreal ( not just the mother ) .
Second , there may be dysfunctional interaction between the mirror neurons and frontal inhibitory structures leading to a dissolution of the sense of self as being distinct from others ( or indeed from the world ) .
Lose the world and lose yourself — and it's as close to death as you can get .
This is not a fully developed explanation by any means ; I mention it only to indicate the style of thinking that we may need to explain these enigmatic syndromes .
Now imagine these same circuits become hyperactive as sometimes happens when you have seizures originating in the temporal lobes ( TLE or temporal lobe epilepsy ) .
The result would be an intense heightening of the patient 's sensory appreciation of the world and intense empathy for all beings to the extent of seeing no barriers between himself and the cosmos — the basis of religious and mystical experiences .
( You lose all selfishness and become one with God . )
Indeed many of history 's great religious leaders have had TLE .
My colleague , the late Francis Crick , has suggested that TLE patients as well as priests may have certain abnormal transmitters in their brains that he calls " theotoxins " .
( He once told philosopher Pat Churchland that he had nothing against religion per se , so long as it was a private arrangement between consenting adults . )
I hasten to add that the involvement of the temporal lobes in mystical experiences does not in itself negate the existence of an abstract God , who , in Hindu philosophy , represents the supreme dissolution of all barriers .
Perhaps the TLE patient has seen the truth and most of us have n't .
I do n't have TLE myself but have had personally had epiphanies when listening to a haunting strain of music , watching the aurora borealis , or looking at Jupiter 's moons through a telescope .
During such epiphanies I have seen eternity in a moment and divinity in all things .
And , indeed , felt one with the Cosmos .
There is nothing " true " or " false " about such experiences — they are what they are ; simply another way of looking at reality .
Let us turn now to out - of - body experiences .
Even a normal person — such as the reader — can at times adopt a " detached " allocentric stance toward yourself ( employing something like mirror neurons ) but this does n't become a full blown delusion because other neural systems ( e.g. inhibition from fontal structures and skin receptors ) keep you anchored .
But damage to the right fronto - parietal regions or ketamine anesthesia ( which may influence the same circuits ) removes the inhibition and you start leaving your body even to the extent of not feeling your own pain .
You see your pain " objectively " as if someone else was experiencing it .
Some such opossum - like detachment also occurs in dire emergencies when you momentarily leave yourself and watch your body being raped or mauled by a lion .
This reflex is normally protective ( lying still to fool predators ) but a vestige of it in humans may manifest as " dissociative " states under conditions of extreme stress .
The purported " unity " or internal consistency of self is also a myth .
Most patients with left arm paralysis caused by right hemisphere stroke complain about it as , indeed , they should .
But a subset of patients who have additional damage to the " body image " representation in the right SPL ( and possibly insula ) claim that their paralyzed left arm does n't belong to them .
The patient may assert that it belongs to his father or spouse .
( As if he had a selective " Capgras " for his arm ) .
Such syndromes challenge even basic assumptions such as " I am anchored in this body " or " This is my arm " .
They suggest that " belongingness " is a primal brain function hardwired through natural selection because of its obvious selective advantage to our hominoid ancestors .
It makes one wonder if someone with this disorder would deny ownership of ( or damage to ) the left fender of his car and ascribe it to his mother 's car .
There appears to be almost no limit to this .
An intelligent and lucid patient I saw recently claimed that her own left arm was not paralyzed and that the lifeless left arm on her lap belonged to her father who was " hiding under the table " .
Yet when I asked her to touch her nose with her left hand she used her intact right hand to grab and raise the paralyzed hand — using the latter as a " tool " to touch her nose !
Clearly somebody in there knew that her left arm was paralyzed and that the arm on her lap was her own , but " she " — the person I was talking to — did n't know .
I then lifted her " father 's hand " up toward her , drawing attention to the fact that it was attached to her shoulder .
She agreed and yet continued to assert it belonged to her father .
The contradiction did n't bother her .
Her ability to hold mutually inconsistent beliefs seems bizarre to us but in fact we all do this from time to time .
I have known many an eminent theoretical physicist who prays to a personal God ; an old guy watching him from somewhere up there in the sky .
I might mention that I have long known that prayer was a placebo ; but upon learning recently of a study that showed that a drug works even when you know it is a placebo , I immediately started praying .
There are two Ramachandrans — one an arch skeptic and the other a devout believer .
Fortunately I enjoy this ambiguous state of mind , unlike Darwin who was tormented by it .
It is not unlike my enjoyment of an Escher engraving .
In the last decade there has been a tremendous resurgence of interest among neuroscientists in the nature of consciousness and self .
The problem has been approached from many angles — ranging from single neuron electrophysiology to macroscopic brain anatomy ( including hundreds of brain imaging studies )
What has been missing , though , is what might be called " psycho- anatomy " ; whose goal is to explain specific details of certain complex mental capacities in terms of equally specific activity of specialized neural structures .
As an analogy , consider the discovery of the genetic code .
Crick and Watson unraveled the double helix , and saw in a flash that the complementarity of the two strands of the helix is a metaphor of the complementarity of parent and offspring in heredity .
( Pigs give birth to pigs — not to donkeys . )
In other words the structural logic of DNA dictates the functional logic of heredity .
No such radical insight has emerged in neuroscience that would allow us to precisely map function on to structure .
One way of achieving this goal , as we have seen in this essay , might be to explore syndromes that lie at the interface between neurology and psychiatry Given the inherent complexity of the human brain , it is unlikely that there will be a single climactic solution like DNA ( although I do n't rule it out ) .
But there may well be many instances where such a synthesis is possible on a smaller scale and these may lead to testable predictions and novel therapies .
They may even pave the way for a grand unified theory of mind of the kind physicists have been seeking in trying to unify gravitation , relativity and quantum mechanics .
When such a theory finally emerges we can either accept it with equanimity or ask " Now that we have solved the problem of self , what else is there ? "
A VERY REAL NEW WORLD ORDER
By Chuck Baldwin
January 27 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
It is hard to believe , but a majority of Americans ( including Christians and conservatives ) seem oblivious to the fact that there is a very real , very legitimate New World Order ( NWO ) unfolding .
In the face of overwhelming evidence , most Americans not only seem totally unaware of this reality , they seem unwilling to even remotely entertain the notion .
On one hand , it is understandable that so many Americans would be ignorant of the emerging New World Order .
After all , the mainstream media refuses to report , or even acknowledge , the NWO .
Even " conservative " commentators and talk show hosts such as Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Michael Savage , or Joe Scarborough refuse to discuss it .
And when listeners call these respective programs , these " conservative " hosts usually resort to insulting the caller as being some kind of " conspiracy kook . "
One host even railed that if anyone questions the government line on 9/11 , we should " lock them up and throw away the key . "
So much for freedom of speech !
This is an area -- perhaps the central area -- where liberals and conservatives agree : they both show no patience or tolerance for anyone who believes that global government ( in any form ) is evolving .
One has to wonder how otherwise intelligent and thoughtful people can be so brain dead when it comes to this issue .
It makes one wonder who is really pulling their strings , does n't it ?
The list of notable personalities who have openly referenced or called for some kind of global government or New World Order is extremely lengthy .
Are all these people " kooks " or " conspiracy nuts " ?
Why would world leaders -- including presidents , secretaries of state , and high government officials ; including the media , financial , and political elite -- constantly refer to something that does n't exist ?
Why would they write about , talk about , or openly promote a New World Order , if there is no such thing ?
Many of us recall President George Herbert Walker Bush talking much about an emerging New World Order .
For example , in 1989 , Bush told the students of Texas A&M University , " Perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of nations . "
Later , Bush , Sr. said , " We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order . . ..
When we are successful , and we will be , we have a real chance at this new world order , an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.N. 's founders . "
Bush , Sr. also said , " What is at stake is more than one small country , it is a big idea - - a new world order . "
Bush , Sr. further said , " The world can therefore seize the opportunity to fulfill the long - held promise of a new world order . . . "
What was President G.H.W .
Bush talking about , if there is no such thing as an emerging New World Order ?
Was he talking out of his mind ?
Was he hallucinating ?
England 's Prime Minister , Tony Blair , said , " We are all internationalists now , whether we like it or not . "
He continued saying , " On the eve of a new Millennium we are now in a new world .
We need new rules for international co-operation and new ways of organizing our international institutions . "
He also said , " Today the impulse towards interdependence is immeasurably greater .
We are witnessing the beginnings of a new doctrine of international community . "
In 1999 , Tony Blair said , " Globalization has transformed our economies and our working practices .
But globalism is not just economic .
It is also a political and security phenomenon . "
What is Tony Blair talking about , if there is no emerging New World Order ?
What does he mean by " a new doctrine of international community " ?
What does he mean by " new world " ?
How can one have globalism , which includes " a political and security phenomenon , " without creating a New World Order ?
Is Tony Blair hallucinating ?
Likewise , former President George W. Bush penned his signature to the Declaration of Quebec back on April 22 , 2001 , in which he gave a " commitment to hemispheric integration and national and collective responsibility for improving the economic well - being and security of our people . "

By " our people , " Bush meant the people of the Western Hemisphere , not the people of the United States .
Phyllis Schlafly rightly reminded us that G.W. Bush " pledged that the United States will ' build a hemispheric family on the basis of a more just and democratic international order . ' "
Remember , too , that it was G.W. Bush who , back in 2005 , committed the United States to the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) , which is nothing more than a precursor to the North American Community or Union , as outlined in CFR member Robert Pastor 's manual , " Toward a North American Community . "
If there is no such thing as an emerging New World Order , what was G.W. Bush talking about when he referred to " a hemispheric family " and an " international order " ?
The public statements of notable world leaders regarding an emerging New World Order are copious .
Consider the statements of former CBS newsman , Walter Cronkite .
In his book , " A Reporter 's Life , " Walter Cronkite said , " A system of world order -- preferably a system of world government -- is mandatory .
The proud nations someday will see the light and , for the common good and their own survival , yield up their precious sovereignty . . . "
Cronkite told BBC newsman Tim Sebastian , " I think we are realizing that we are going to have to have an international rule of law . "
He added , " We need not only an executive to make international law , but we need the military forces to enforce that law . "
Cronkite also said , " American people are going to begin to realize that perhaps they are going to have to yield some sovereignty to an international body to enforce world law . "
If there is no emerging New World Order , what is Walter Cronkite talking about ?
Can there be any doubt that Cronkite is talking about global government ?
Absolutely not !
Now , when Bush , Sr. talks about fulfilling " the promise and vision of the U.N. 's founders , " he was talking about the same thing former UN Secretary - General Boutros Boutros - Ghali was talking about when he said , " The time for absolute and exclusive sovereignty . . . has passed . "
The United Nations has been on the forefront of promoting the New World Order agenda since its very inception .
In 1995 , the UN released a manual entitled , " Our Global Neighborhood . "
It states , " Population , consumption , technology , development , and the environment are linked in complex relationships that bear closely on human welfare in the global neighborhood .
Their effective and equitable management calls for a systematic , long - term , global approach guided by the principle of sustainable development , which has been the central lesson from the mounting ecological dangers of recent times .
Its universal application is a priority among the tasks of global governance . "
If there is no emerging New World Order , what is " global governance " all about ?
" Who are the movers and shakers promoting global government ? " you ask .
Obviously , it is the international bankers who are the heavyweights behind the push for global government .
Remember , one cannot create a " global economy " without a global government to manage , oversee , and control it .
In a letter written to Colonel E. Mandell House , President Franklin D. Roosevelt said , " The real truth of the matter is , as you and I know , that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson . "
" Old Hickory " did his best to rid the United States from the death grip that the international bankers were beginning to exert on this country .
He may have been the last President to actually oppose the bankers .
In discussing the Bank Renewal bill with a delegation of bankers in 1832 , Jackson said , " Gentlemen , I have had men watching you for a long time , and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country .
When you won , you divided the profits amongst you , and when you lost , you charged it to the bank .
You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter , I shall ruin ten thousand families .
That may be true , gentlemen , but that is your sin !
Should I let you go on , you will ruin fifty thousand families , and that would be my sin !
You are a den of vipers and thieves .
I intend to rout you out , and by the eternal God , I will rout you out . "
Unfortunately , the international bankers proved themselves to be too formidable for President Jackson .
And in 1913 , with the collaboration of President Woodrow Wilson , the bankers were given charge over America 's financial system by the creation of the Federal Reserve .
Ever since the CFR and Trilateral Commission were created , they have filled the key leadership positions of government , big media , and of course , the Federal Reserve .
In his book , " With No Apologies , " former Republican Presidential nominee Barry Goldwater wrote , " The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States .
The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful , coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power -- political , monetary , intellectual and ecclesiastical .
What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation - states involved .
As managers and creators of the system , they will rule the future . "
Was Goldwater a prophet or what ?

And again , the goals of the global elite have been publicly stated .
Back in 1991 , the founder of the CFR , David Rockefeller praised the major media for their complicity in helping to facilitate the globalist agenda by saying , " We are grateful to the Washington Post , The New York Times , Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years .
. . .
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years .
But , the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto - determination practiced in past centuries . "
How could Rockefeller be any plainer ?
He acknowledged the willful assistance of the major media in helping to keep the elitists ' agenda of global government from the American people .
To this day , the major media has not deviated from that collaboration .
And this includes the aforementioned " conservative " talking heads .
They know if they want to keep their jobs , they dare not reveal the New World Order .
The NWO , more than anything else , is the " Third Rail " to the national media .
Is it any wonder that President Barack Obama has stacked his government with numerous members of the CFR ?
Among these are Robert Gates , Janet Napolitano , Eric Shinseki , Timothy Geithner , and Tom Daschle .
Other CFR members include CFR President Richard Haass , CFR Director Richard Holbrooke , and founding member of the Trilateral Commission and CFR member Paul Volcker .
Obama even asked a CFR member , Rick Warren , to deliver the inaugural prayer .
Still not convinced ?
Just a few days ago , when asked by a reporter what he thought the most important thing was that Barack Obama could accomplish , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said , " I think his task will be develop an overall strategy for America in this period when , really , a New World Order can be created .
It 's a great opportunity ; it is n't just a crisis . "
This is the same Henry Kissinger , you will recall , who said back in 1991 , " Today , America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order .
Tomorrow , they will be grateful !
This is especially true if they were told that there were [ sic ] an outside threat from beyond , whether real or promulgated , that threatened our very existence .
It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil .
The one thing every man fears is the unknown .
When presented with this scenario , individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well - being granted to them by the World Government . "
Even Gideon Rachman , the chief foreign affairs commentator for the Financial Times , wrote an editorial expressing his support for world government .
In his column he said , " I have never believed that there is a secret United Nations plot to take over the US .
. . .
But , for the first time in my life , I think the formation of some sort of world government is plausible .
" A ' world government ' would involve much more than co-operation between nations .
It would be an entity with state - like characteristics , backed by a body of laws .
The European Union has already set up a continental government for 27 countries , which could be a model .
The EU has a supreme court , a currency , thousands of pages of law , a large civil service and the ability to deploy military force .
" So could the European model go global ?
There are three reasons for thinking that it might . "
Rachman then goes on to explain the reasons why he believes world government is plausible .
Do you now see why it does not matter to a tinker 's dam whether it is a Republican or Democrat who resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ?
For the most part , both major parties in Washington , D.C. , have been under the dominating influence of the international bankers who control the Federal Reserve , the CFR , and the Trilateral Commission .
And this is also why it does not matter whether one calls himself conservative or liberal .
For the most part , both conservatives and liberals in Washington , D.C. , are facilitating the emerging New World Order .
It is time we wake up to this reality .
Presidents Bush , Sr. , Bill Clinton , and Bush , Jr. have thoroughly set the table for the implementation of the NWO , as surely as the sun rises in the east .
All Obama has to do is put the food on the table -- and you can count on this : Barack Obama will serve up a New World Order feast like you cannot believe !

Of course , the first thing they have to do is admit that an emerging New World Order exists !

Harold Meyerson ’s latest dispatch ( WashingtonPost.com , 12/8/08 ) on Tribune Co. owner Sam Zell retells how “ Zell repeatedly and profanely expressed his disdain for quality journalism , ” gutting major dailies like the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune because he thought they “ carried too much national and international news . ”
After “ hundreds of excellent reporters and editors were unceremoniously shown the door ” comes news that the Tribune Co. is filing for bankruptcy protection , but Meyerson writes that
Sam Zell never really had much skin in the game .
Last year , when he purchased the Tribune Company … he put up $ 315 million of his own money and paid the balance of the purchase price , $ 8.2 billion , with the employee stock ownership plan–a move in which Tribune employees had no say whatever .
But that actually overstates the amount of Zell ’s investment .
Of the $ 315 million he sunk into the company , it turns out that $ 225 million was simply a promissory note .
Due to the vagaries of bankruptcy law , writes business analyst Mark Lacter on LAobserved.com , that means that Zell has better protection for his stake than all his employees .
And how are those employees faring ?
Well , even the New York Times headlined its December 8 report “ Workers Pay for Debacle at Tribune . ”

Preemptive Propaganda " Air " Raids
Airing this week on talk radio shows have been a slew of " issues based " ad buys , confusing listeners into thinking a revived Fairness Doctrine would muzzle partisan talk .
Hannity in particular began referring to the law as the " Censorship Doctrine " but quickly laid bare in an L.A .
Times piece , we saw the effort was an intentional " cry wolf " , meant to begin a messaging campaign - that is , conditioning listeners to have kneejerk reactions at any mention of the Fairness Doctrine .
Hannity and Rush Limbaugh , who preemptively calls the nonexistent legislation the " hush Rush bill " should perhaps be gearing up to answer different questions about disclosure requirements on public airwaves .
The most serious criticisms of right wing radio are n't about free speech or equal time for opposing viewpoints , rather the deliberately deceptive nature of show content .
Unlike truth - in - advertising regulations for commercials , anything goes in show segments .
But if you can't legally broadcast an advertisement that says a hearing aid filters out the noise you do n't want to hear , why should Hannity be allowed to selectively present only the news items , guests and call - ins that reinforce his bias ?
If the limits of free speech fall short of yelling fire in a crowded theater , what might be the negative side - effects of someone urging us to hate and fear eachother in an orderly society every day ?
Might this not push some to commit violent acts like the unwell man who shot up a " liberal " church in Knoxville ?
reported 90 million , or roughly one third of adult Americans possess fifth grade literacy skills or lower , so it 's no news that political debates , ads and discussion have become dumbed - down and low - rent .
And it 's only expanding - the GOP , RNC and associated " privately funded " organizations save millions on messaging come election season by keeping talk radio and news ' commentary " going year round .
America The Ridiculed
The real harm is plain to see when whole swaths of the country mistakenly believe for example Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11 , justifying the decision to invade Iraq .
We became the laughingstock of the world because our populace is misinformed to an alarming degree on the most important issues of our time , a direct result of choices made in picking sources for news and information .
The # 1 and # 2 radio hosts in the country bear prime responsibility for this , mixing cherrypicked info and incomplete , conflated arguments to " fix the facts " around neocon directives on a host of topics .
As one Australian blog post bluntly recalled : " ... someone in Limbaugh 's crew slipped up and allowed a very bright young woman to challenge him .
She was terrific , very calm , very composed , very reasonable and did she slice the elastic on his underpants .
He was completely and utterly unable to counter her points .
He was obviously furious that someone other than a dittohead had been allowed to speak to him .
It showed him up as a complete and utter twat ... to think people take him seriously !
Old Rush might just the only person on talk radio in the US who understands the term " Socratic irony " . "
Treason Reason # 1 : Failing the Public Trust
The Fairness Doctrine did instruct FCC licensees to honor their roles as trustees of the public airwaves in making " every reasonable attempt " to present complete and accurate information - in other words , self - regulate according to expected norms in professionalism , journalistic ethics and basic ethical broadcasting standards .
But the law used subjective methodology to interpret intent and made any attempt at outside enforcement unwieldy .
So the whole thing was scrapped under Reagan - two federal judges who ruled in favor of scuttling the bill were later rewarded with Supreme Court nominations - their names were Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia .
With the legal requirement to present balance gone , Hannity , Limbaugh and company openly shirk their moral and civic responsibility to voluntarily present balance .
Because these two have led all other US broadcasters for decades , any moral requirement to discuss news in balance was also eroded , making propaganda in talk radio the norm .
Hypocrisy rages as Hannity decries pay - for - play between Democrats and unions or Fannie and Freddie .
The last thing he should be asking for are ethics investigations into government / industry collusion after it was revealed Karl Rove covertly pumped talk radio luminaries with discussion points while under White House employ in order to beat the drums for war .
Treason Reason # 2 : Selling War
This is small potatoes compared to defense spending , however , where arms manufacturers and private contractors cannot just buy advertising to enrich media shills .
We know they do fund lobbies , PACs and special interest groups to " recommend " arms build - ups and deployments , but legislators are reticent to sign off on wars without public approval .
This need has been met neatly by talk radio's top hosts , always pro-war and full - throttle as if they were secretly being hired to sell war like soap powder .
The real kicker is the questionable legality of Hannity and Limbaugh 's broadcasts during the time Karl Rove was sending memos from inside the White House to unidentified " friendly " talk radio personalities , according to Scott McClellan , former White House Press Secretary who once defended Bush 's use of faked interviews and videos but later admitted all on a 2008 book tour , describing an apparent violation of domestic law prohibiting " covert " propaganda .
The White House also hired Cuban reporters to plant political stories in Florida papers and in a worse exploitation of public trust , dispatched a cadre of retired military brass to " act objective " in defending detention and the war in public , secretly using Secretary Rumsfeld 's talking points .
Presidents Reagan and Clinton have also committed similar media manipulation , so disclosure enforcement has been scant and selective over the years , but Bush quadrupled previous PR budgets to deceive taxpayers with their own money .
A furor arose over fake news reports and talk show segments produced to promote Bush 's education policies , but largely died down after officials threatened to throw the book at talk show host Armstrong Williams for not disclosing government authorship of information broadcast publicly .
Williams reached a settlement with prosecutors but never regained his former stature .
Treason Reason # 3 : Breaking the Law
he never received talking points directly from the White House while Hannity and Limbaugh fell silent on the issue .
Then earlier this month , Dan Shelley , a former news director for Milwaukee 's resident right wing radio home published an In the aftermath of McClellan 's bombshell , Fox TV's Bill O'Reilly went to great measures to stressnever received talking points directly from the White House while Hannity and Limbaugh fell silent on the issue .
Then earlier this month , Dan Shelley , a former news director for Milwaukee 's resident right wing radio home published an article alleging numerous hosts also received emails straight from the White House and used them on the air without disclosure - sometimes verbatim .
Should Congress dredge up the political will to probe Hannity 's part in violating the same anti-propaganda law Williams did , it might total hundreds of counts of the same infraction .
If cited in a potential legal showdown , Limbaugh and Hannity may argue much of the language in the 1948 law as inapplicable in the internet age , but could very likely lose on a key provision that bans government funding for covert propaganda unless specifically listed in the appropriation funding it .
This may explain their current " victimization " campaign - claiming selective enforcement may end up being Rush and Sean 's best defense - the classic straw man , though they might have to resort to " we 're not the only ones doing it " .
The crucial legal question is whether Hannity ever used any government - furnished source material on the air without disclosure .
Shelley , a former insider at WTMJ Milwaukee explained in detail the effect of neocon bias at the station , where they also turned away callers with opposing views including sitting U.S. Senator Russ Feingold trying to refute slanted claims made before the public .
If this were true for Limbaugh and Hannity 's show as well , it would explain the lopsidedness of calls and guests over the years - and also put Hannity 's current and former producers , call - screeners and staff on notice that they one day may be asked if partisan imbalance affected any written or oral guidelines given them for booking guests or call screening .
Treason Reason # 4 : Intellectual Cowardice
Though it may be unrealistic to expect responsible , balanced reportage from any enterprise seeking to maximize profits , it 's each broadcaster who must decide for himself whether their success trumps the public right to know the facts that matter , using the " I 'm just an entertainer " cop-out .
Should not the biggest radio hosts in America lead by educating and informing ?
St. Peter I 'm not , but surely intentional deception runs counter to Christian ideals - somewhere between responsible journalism and $ 100 million dollars there is a moral balance , especially in light of the Pope 's updated list of deadly sins now including " social injustice " and " the excessive accumulation of wealth for a few " .
To me , the simplest test is how much informa tion I 'd want my own wife or children to have so they can make informed decisions .
For example :
On the Iraq war : I 'd want my daughters to hear not only the argument that America needs to be kept safe from terrorists by fighting them " over there " , but also the first - hand accounts by Bush administration insiders like McClellan , CIA Director George Tenet or Lt. Col.
Lawrence Wilkerson who , as Col .
Powell 's chief of staff stepped down because :
I 'd want my daughters to hear not only the argument that America needs to be kept safe from terrorists by fighting them " over there " , but also the first - hand accounts by Bush administration insiders like McClellan , CIA Director George Tenet or Lt. Col.
Lawrence Wilkerson who , as Col .
Powell 's chief of staff stepped down because as he said , the whole lead - up to the war was " a hoax " orchestrated by Cheney , Rumsfeld and the rest of Bush 's Iraq Team .
On the economic meltdown : I want my daughters to know more then the incomplete narrative Hannity drones literally hourly - that it was all due to the Community Redevelopment Act and Democratic pals of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mandating banks write loans for " unqualified " minorities .
These few , beat - into - the - ground facts by themselves constitute a fallacy via omission : because the sub - prime loans were doomed to fail , they were intentionally mixed in with up to ten times as many viable mortgages in securitized packages , intertwined via impossibly complex formulas and sold all over the world for years .
Then , even larger credit default swap policies were sold on these securities , essentially side bets that pay out in case the securities do not perform as promised .
The swaps were sold rampantly and recklessly in the belief they would never all come due at the same time - a risk only possible after preventative monitoring was abolished , in large part due to the efforts of Phil Gramm , " the high priest of deregulation " .
So the relatively small value of failed sub - prime loans were merely the straw that broke the camel 's back , representing but a fraction of the amounts tied up in the bigger securities which are still in large part sound but can't easily be valued .
The much worse nightmare was the trillions in side - bet " swaps " that came due and ruined the biggest firms on Wall Street overnight .
Knowing this , observers may blame Bush - era deregulation a bit more then reckless sub - prime loan facilitators .
On free - market economic theory : Hannity explains that Reagan created jobs and reduced unemployment and inflation in the longest post - war period of economic growth ever .
These stats would be divine if not for the deficits Reagan accumulated , passing unmanageable debt on to the next generation for the first time .
Hannity and his sponsors at the Heritage Foundation expend so much time praising Reagan 's greatness without addressing this basic accounting red flag , it makes one wonder if they even believe what they 're saying .
Worse still , the national deficit which was comendably controlled during the Clinton / Gingrich years have almost doubled under George W. Bush to over ten trillion dollars , ensuring economic difficulty for decades on end .
As bitterly burned future generations analyze what happened , they might uncover clips of Hannity who fought for and defended George W. Bush 's unmonitored waste , spending and borrowing on a daily basis against a rising tide of Americans , who by the 2006 elections were sufficiently apprised of the true cost of military deployments and privatized contracts in the Middle East and voted the GOP out in droves .
On the rules of debate :
The way our children are taught to form arguments in middle school are clear .
State a premise , provide fact , analysis and opinion , preferably in that order .
Students then learn how to strengthen their arguments by anticipating challenges , considering diverse perspectives and defending them against well - matched peers in live debate .
In our schools , bullying and deceit are condemned because it is the legal and moral obligation of professional educators to provide an environment where students understand , synthesize , and above all , think .
This traditionally extended into the study and practice of broadcast journalism , but has deteriorated as Rush and Sean ascended to make partisan political talk a part of the everyday commute .
All Roads Lead To Tax Breaks For The Rich . Hmm ...
Sensational and distractive " infotainment " has become an American staple as media consolidation brought many voices under fewer umbrellas in pursuit of profit , market share and sociopolitical influence .
For each issue Hannity covers , he chooses a conveniently finite set of arguments to make his case , and then by his choices of news , guests and callers , limits the discussion to repeat talking points , often leading right back to defense of " Reaganomics " and " trickle down " theories for job growth .
Yet after years of sustained tax cuts for the rich just as Hannity advocated , it has led only to deficits and downturns for the many , disproportionately benefiting those in Rush and Sean 's tax bracket - this , even before the October 2008 crisis .
A tax credit for every job created sounds like a more direct incentive then giving whopping tax reductions exclusively to the wealthy in the hope they voluntarily choose to create jobs .
But this line of reasoning is censored by Limbaugh and Hannity because they resist debating qualified adversaries who might bring this out .

Forget diamonds - one Swiss watchmaker is betting on watches made from moon dust , parts of the Apollo 11 rocket and bits of spacesuits to capture consumer cash as an economic slow down bites .
More than 600 watchmakers have the Swiss brand stamp , so Geneva - based Romain Jerome aims to use " inaccessible materials " to set its products apart from rivals such as Richemont 's Vacheron Constantin and independent watchmaker Patek Philippe .
" This gives value to the product and the brand .
But the material must also be well known and it must be luxurious , " Romain Jerome Chief Executive Yvan Arpa said in an interview at the group 's headquarters .

“ The notion of secret law has been described in court opinions and law treatises as ‘ repugnant ’ and ‘ an abomination ’ , ” observed Sen. Russ Feingold .
“ It is a basic tenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law . ”
“ But the law that applies in this country is determined not only by statutes and regulations , but also by the controlling interpretations of courts and , in some cases , the executive branch .
More and more , this body of executive and judicial law is being kept secret from Congress as well , ” he said .
To probe that subject , Sen .
Feingold ’s subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing last April 30 , the full record of which has just been published .
See “ Secret Law and the Threat to Democratic and Accountable Government . ”
The hearing volume includes newly published responses ( pdf ) to questions for the record from John P. Elwood of the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel , Prof . Dawn E.

The Impending Failure of San Francisco ’s Pilot Bike Share Program
Which will San Francisco ’s bike - share program resemble ?
Lest it appear that Streetsblog does n’t support bike - sharing in San Francisco , I should say from the outset that I love the successful bike - sharing programs that I ’ve used , believe they are one of the more innovative new transit models available , and know that San Francisco is ripe for the roll - out of a large - scale program of its own .
But I am also among the large majority of Americans that Republican Pollster Frank Luntz found support infrastructure improvements and believe getting the job done right is more important than ribbon cutting and shovel readying .
Consider that a bicycle sharing program ’s greatest assets are ubiquity and ease of use .
In Paris , Velib started with 10,000 bicycles at 750 stations , shortly thereafter jumped to 20,000 bicycles at 1450 stations , and is poised to add an additional 3,300 bikes at 300 new stations in the Parisian suburbs .
The city of Paris keeps all the revenue from the small annual fees for membership to the program and daily use fees paid by tourists and those who do n’t join annually and the advertising firm JC Decaux operates the system and pays out an additional $ 4.3 million .
When I rode Velib for the first time in Paris shortly after its launch in 2007 , the system was intuitive and the bicycle stations were everywhere ( approximately 300 meters between each ) .
As a tourist with minimal French , I had no problem activating the system with my credit card and pedaling my way through the lovely streets of that fair city .
Over the course of three days I never went underground , never took a taxi and got some good exercise in the process .
My hopes were high when Mayor Newsom announced that San Francisco would
join the nearly 100 cities around the world that have started bike
sharing .
But now they are dashed .
How grand a system will San Francisco have ?
50 bikes .
To the tune of $ 1 million for start up and $ 500,000 annually for upkeep !
The Mayor made his announcement , from the heart of Paris no less , that San Francisco is in negotiations with Clear Channel to roll - out a mere 50 bicycles at five racks in the downtown area .
Do you hear my teeth gnashing ?
When Washington DC debuted their system last year with 120 bikes , their department of transportation immediately regretted that they had not added many more .
As Alice Kelly of the District DOT said to Streetfilms when they interviewed her , " Knowing what we know now , we would ’ve launched it bigger . "
Mayor Newsom has been accused of press - releasing and grandstanding before , but this has to be among his most exquisite offerings .
He ’s embracing a transit trend that all “ green ” mayors must , but he ’s implementing it in such paltry fashion that at best it will be inconsequential at replacing short car trips with bike trips ; at worst it will create a bunch more enemies of bicycles in a city that already boasts its fair share .
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but I believe the last time San Francisco failed its due diligence on a bicycle project , a court slapped the city with an onerous injunction that generated no bicycle projects for three years .
The SFBC is being political and not taking a hard stand on the program , as indicated by Leah Shahum ’s statement :
Given that half of all trips are two miles or less , this bike share program — along with completing the citywide Bike Network — are ideal ways to help more people make more trips by bikes .
While we do support the Mayor ’s pilot bike share program , we have reservations about how such a small - scale program can prove itself properly .
Plans to create a dense , citywide Bike Share program should not rest solely on the workings of this small - scale pilot program .
MTA spokesman Judson
True attempted to mollify my skepticism by arguing that the $ 1 million price tag would be paid by Clear Channel , or another bidder should they exercise their right to first - refusal , and that the announcement was only the beginning , that the low numbers were in part due to the injunction .
“ We will not be satisfied by 50 bikes in a city where interest in bicycling is skyrocketing .
Our goal is to have thousands , ” he said .
Still , I have to wonder how this program meets any transit effectiveness criteria , especially at a time when the MTA is projecting a shortfall of $ 100 million over the next 18 months ( PDF ) .
With a state budget in freefall and funding in limbo for big - ticket projects like the Central Subway and TEP , the last thing the MTA needs is for window dressing to add to the cannibalization of vital system operations .
If the Mayor is serious about his commitment to increasing the number of trips that are taken on bicycles , to reducing vehicle miles traveled , to improving the health of San Franciscans , he should marshal his forces for the looming battle over the top 60 projects in the Bicycle Plan when the injunction is lifted .
Stripe lanes , install racks , be innovative with bike boxes , colored lanes , and protected rights - of - way .
Then , when there is money and political capital to spend on a bike - share program and the city is in a position to capitalize on the transit benefits of bike share , let ’s talk about rolling out a fleet of thousands of new bicycles .

An 11th - hour ruling from the Bush administration gives health care workers , hospitals , and insurers more leeway to refuse health services for moral or religious reasons .
The rule , issued today , becomes effective in 30 days .
Its main provisions widen the number of health workers and institutions that may refuse , based on " sincere religious belief or moral conviction , " to provide care or referrals to patients .
" This rule protects the right of medical providers to care for their patients in accord with their conscience , " says Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O. Leavitt in a statement .
Previous rules allow health care workers to refuse to provide abortion or sterilization services to which they are morally opposed .
The new rulings give individuals and institutions much greater leeway in refusing to provide services to which they are morally opposed .
The ruling , issued by the Department of Health and Human Services , covers an estimated 571,947 " entities " including doctors ' offices , pharmacies , hospitals , insurers , medical and nursing schools , diagnostic labs , nursing homes , and state governments .
Each of these entities is required to certify in writing that they will comply with the ruling .
Failure to comply may be punished with loss of federal funding .
A wide number of medical groups strongly oppose the new ruling .
These groups include the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , the American Nurses Association , the American Academy of Family Physicians , the American Academy of Pediatrics , and 27 state medical associations .
The focus of the new ruling is on protecting health care workers and institutions that oppose abortion and a broad interpretation of " sterilization . "
" Today 's regulation issued by HHS under the guise of ' protecting ' the conscience of health care providers , is yet another reminder of the outgoing administration 's implicit contempt for women 's right to accurate and complete reproductive health information and legal medical procedures , " says a statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
The Catholic Health Association , representing the Catholic hospitals that care for about a sixth of U.S. patients , strongly supports the conscience ruling .
The group says it 's seen a number of efforts to force doctors to perform -- or make referrals -- for abortions and sterilizations .
this one looks good over here .

If you have a question about a social media post , we may have already answered it on our Debunking False Stories page .
Or see the most popular questions on our Viral Spiral page .
Right here :
Marine Cpl. James
Dixon was wounded twice in Iraq — by a roadside bomb and a land mine .
He suffered a traumatic brain injury , a concussion , a dislocated hip and hearing loss .
He was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Army Sgt. Lori Meshell shattered a hip and crushed her back and knees while diving for cover during a mortar attack in Iraq .
She has undergone a hip replacement and knee reconstruction and needs at least three more surgeries .
In each case , the Pentagon ruled that their disabilities were not combat - related .
In a little - noticed regulation change in March , the military ’s definition of combat - related disabilities was narrowed , costing some injured veterans thousands of dollars in lost benefits — and triggering outrage from veterans ’ advocacy groups .
The Pentagon said the change was consistent with Congress ’ intent when it passed a “ wounded warrior ” law in January .
Narrowing the combat - related definition was necessary to preserve the “ special distinction for those who incur disabilities while participating in the risk of combat , in contrast with those injured otherwise , ” William J. Carr , deputy undersecretary of Defense , wrote in a letter to the 1.3 - million - member Disabled American Veterans .
And while this may make your blood boil , and it may look to you like the Bush administration is doing their best to screw vets out of money and care , what you fail to realize is that most everyone in the Bush administration has a yellow “ We Support Our Troops ” sticker on their car , so there .
The soldiers understand what is happening to them :
Dixon said he was denied at least $ 16,000 in benefits before he fought the Pentagon and won a reversal of his noncombat - related designation .
“ I was blown up twice in Iraq , and my injuries were n’t combat - related ? ” Dixon said .
“ It ’s the most imbecile thing I ’ve ever seen . ”
This is utter bullshit .
Notwithstanding the fact that they should get every penny they deserve , failing to pay these folks will hide the true cost of war .
These people are injured and scarred for life because of our desire to wage pre-emptive war .
Failing to account for the costs of our actions will just make it easier to engage in this sort of stupidity again .
So quit screwing our troops , Pentagon .
Quit screwing our troops , Bush appointees .
These guys were hurt , in combat , and your post hoc redefining does n’t change it .
I should probably also add , this sort of thing is nothing new .
The brass and the bean - counters have always been screwing our troops this way .
For example , remember Gulf War Syndrome , which was widely labeled as bullshit , and that the Pentagon and others spent years denying so they did not have to pay benefits ?
Guess what ?
It exists .
It is real :
A congressionally mandated scientific panel has concluded that Gulf War syndrome is real and afflicts nearly one - quarter of the 700,000 U.S. troops who served in the 1991 conflict , according to a report released Monday .
The report broke with most earlier studies by concluding that two chemical exposures were direct causes of the disorder : the drug pyridostigmine bromide , given to troops to protect against nerve gas , and pesticides that were used — and often overused — to protect against sand flies and other pests .
Just stop the bullshit and give these guys what they are due .
Every year , we see scores of innovations trickle onto the web – everything from new browser features to cool web apps to entire programming languages .
Some of these concepts just make us smile , then we move on .
Some completely blow our minds with their utility and ingenuity – and become must - haves .
For this list , we 've compiled the most truly life - altering nuggets of brilliance to hit center stage in 2008 : the ideas , products and enhancements to the web experience so huge that they make us wonder how we got along without them .
Nitpickers will notice that a couple of these technologies arrived two or three years ago .
Others are n't even fully baked yet .
But each innovation on our list reached a level of maturity , hit the point of critical mass , or stepped in to fill a burning need during 2008 that resulted in it significantly changing the landscape of the web .
Here 's to the technologies currently making the web a better place than it was 12 months ago .
Identity Management
Few things carry more value than your digital identity , and yet most web users have only a tenuous grasp of it .
That 's because on the social web , identity is no longer just who you are .
It 's who you know , how you know them and how much you want them to know about you .
On the web , your identity is explicitly tied to your relationships , both with your friends and with the websites you visit .
Three great technologies came to fruition this year to help you manage these complex interdependencies : OpenID , Google Friend Connect and Facebook Connect .
These ID systems all offer a way to take control of your social capital , that cache of " friend data " you carry with you as you sign up for and use different web services .
They also all offer a more tangible advantage – an easy way to log in to any website using one set of credentials .
You get one virtual ID card that gives you access to hundreds of websites .
As a bonus , you do n't have to go through the painful process of filling out a profile and adding or approving friends on every new blog , community or social network you want to join .
The end of 2008 saw a flurry of activity around identity .
Facebook Connect , which currently lets you log in to a few dozen high - profile websites using your Facebook ID , went live the first week of December .
Google 's Friend Connect and MySpace 's MySpaceID , similar systems that are n't yet as widely adopted , launched soon after it .
There 's a hitch , though .
Facebook Connect , while elegant and easy to use , is built on proprietary code and is n't compatible with the offerings from Google and MySpace , which are built using OpenID and other open source standards .
We should expect this battle for your personal data play out over the next year , maybe longer .
But 2008 will be remembered as the year that identity stepped into the spotlight .
HTML 5
One of the most important technologies on this list does n't fully exist yet – HTML 5 – but in 2008 , key features started to trickle out .
HTML 5 will eventually replace HTML 4.01 , the dominant programming language currently used to build web pages .
But the governing bodies in charge of the web are still drafting the details , and nobody expects HTML 5 to fully emerge as the new standard for at least a few more years .
But HTML 5 is no vaporware .
Many of the changes to the way the web operates as outlined in early versions of the new specification are already being implemented in the latest browsers , and some of the web 's more adventurous site builders are already incorporating HTML 5's magic into their pages .
HTML 5 will be great step forward , standardizing things like dragging and dropping elements on web pages , in - line editing of text and images on sites and new ways of drawing animations .
There 's also support for audio and video playback without plug-ins , a boon for usability and a worrisome sign for Adobe 's Flash , Microsoft 's Silverlight and Apple 's QuickTime .
The language will also give a boost to web apps , as there are new controls for storing web data offline on your local machine .
Want Gmail on your desktop ?
HTML 5 makes it possible .
Alas , the blink tag is n't invited to the party .
Lifestreaming
A new breed of social app has arisen to help us manage the mess of information overload – the lifestream .
Not long ago , keeping track of your friends on the internet was pretty easy .
Everyone belonged to Friendster or MySpace and that was it .
Now , the web is littered with thousands of social sites , each with its own special purpose – Flickr for photos , Last.fm for music , Twitter for tweeting .
Even the most rudimentary services are tied to the social web .
Renting a movie , buying a book or writing a blog post ?
Let all your friends on Netflix , Amazon and Blogger know about it .
Keeping tabs on your friends now is all too easy and all too much , all at once .
Sites like FriendFeed , Plaxo Pulse and Digsby serve as social - network - activity aggregators .
They 're like virtual funnels .
Dump in all the notifications , feeds and updates from your various networks , and the services will bring it all into one master stream , relieving you of the responsibility of visiting a dozen or more sites to learn what your friends are up to , what they 're listening to , who they 're snogging and so on .
Controls let you dial back the flow by sorting and filtering the flow , pruning it down to only what matters most .
Many such services have emerged , but FriendFeed , an elegant and simple site designed by a crew of ex-Googlers , is our favorite .
Oh , and do n't expect to be able to add Facebook to your lifestream .
The network lets all sorts of data in , but precious little out .
Firefox 3
Firefox has been around since 2004 , but when version 3 of Mozilla 's browser arrived in June 2008 , it got everything right .
Mozilla 's browser is faster and more secure than ever before , and it 's open source , so you get the feel - good factor , too .
One of the most highly anticipated software releases of the year , more than 8 million people downloaded Firefox 3 on the first day .
Third time 's a charm , indeed .
The genius bit of engineering was bringing search front and center – just type what you 're looking for in the location bar , and FF3 searches your history , bookmarks and the web to bring you the page you want , lightning fast .
Performance enhancements made it one of the web 's fastest browsers – especially for surfing the recent swell of web apps – and improved security features made it one of the safest .
Mozilla continues to build upon the concept with its Ubiquity add - on for Firefox , which lets you search and interact with any number of web services by typing text commands into the browser .
It 's still the second - most - popular browser after Microsoft Internet Explorer by a wide margin , but Firefox 3 is the feisty favorite of the web 's elite .
Google Chrome
Its debut release in September was not expected , nor was it greeted with as much fanfare as the arrival of Firefox 3 a few months prior .
But Google 's browser was instantly recognized as a potential game - changer , both among browser - makers and within the world of web apps .
Chrome is a browser built to empower web applications .
Its killer feature is a new approach to page rendering that isolates web applications inside each of the browser 's tabs – a crashing web app might cause a single tab to go south , but that wo n't affect anything outside that tab .
The rest of the browser remains stable .
When you 're doing mission - critical work in a web app and the browser crashes , it is n't an annoyance , it 's a deal breaker .
E-mails are lost , documents have to be rewritten , web forms need to be filled out again .
Chrome 's ability to sidestep a full crash strengthens Google 's bid to replace desktop apps with its own web - based alternatives .
Chrome reached official 1.0 status in December .
It 's Windows - only for now , but we should expect official versions for Mac and Linux soon .
It 's also still very young .
Future releases will have support for add - ons , offline syncing of web data through Google Desktop and – knowing Google – probably a few other bells and whistles nobody 's thought of yet .
Location Awareness
In 2008 , location - based information ceased being a fancy add - on and instead became a requirement of any serious , successful web service .
Hit a button on your laptop or phone to tell a web service where you are , and it tells you what restaurants are close by , where the new Bond movie is playing ( and when , and if there are tickets left ) , and which of your friends are within shouting distance if you need a date .
The tipping point arguably came when a wave of GPS - equipped mobile web devices hit the market .
The iPhone 3G , the T - Mobile G1 and the latest Nokia N - series devices all have GPS built in .
They also all have real web browsers and the tools necessary for access to web APIs , opening the door to more - relevant search and localized mobile services .
On the iPhone , you can use Yelp 's app to get a list of nearby venues , restaurants and hangouts with the touch of a button .
Or , in the case of Google 's local - search app , you can simply speak your request and get local results .
An app like Say Where queries multiple search sites .
The benefits are n't limited to mobiles , either .
Social networking sites and desktop search apps can take advantage of new technologies like Yahoo's FireEagle , where users can update and store their location data , or browser plug-ins like Google Gears or Firefox 's Geode , which users can set up to report their location automatically .
Whether they 're using a desktop browser or an iPhone , users now demand the high levels of relevance and convenience on the web that location awareness affords .
The World Wide Web Consortium , the web 's governing body , has stepped up and formed a think tank to develop a set of standards for handling users ' geodata that ensures privacy and interoperability .
The W3C Geolocation Working Group hopes to have its first recommendation filed by the end of 2009 .

EDINBURGH ( Reuters ) - The Scottish government announced a 10 million pound ( $ 14.94 million ) prize for new wave or tidal power technologies on Tuesday as part of the country ’s renewable energy drive .
First Minister Alex Salmond announced details of the international “ Saltire Prize ” at a ceremony in Edinburgh castle .
The prize is intended “ to push the frontiers of innovation in clean , green marine renewable energy , ” he said ahead of the ceremony .
Salmond said Scotland could enjoy a quarter of Europe ’s total marine power potential and described the turbulent waters off the northern Scottish mainland as “ our Saudi Arabia of renewable marine energy . ”
The prize will be awarded to the team that can demonstrate the best commercially viable wave or tidal energy technology in Scottish waters that produces at least 100 gigawatt hours ( GWh ) over a two - year period using only the power of the sea .
Scotland ’s chief scientific adviser and head of the prize committee , Anne Glover , said the competition would open in the summer of 2009 and close by June 2013 .
Scotland hopes to get half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .

Phytoestrogen content of common foodstuffs ( micrograms of phytoestrogen per 100 grams )
Worried about eating too much “ gender - bending ” soya ?
It turns out a host of other foods also contain high levels of oestrogen - like chemicals , including beer , wine and roasted peanuts .
Gunter Kuhnle of the MRC Dunn Human Nutrition Unit in Cambridge , UK , and colleagues surveyed dozens of foods and beverages using mass spectrometry , an extremely sensitive chemical technique .
Most previous surveys of foods and drinks focused on one kind of phytoestrogen that is found in high levels in nuts and seeds called lignans , but ignored another kind called isoflavones .
By searching for isoflavones , Kuhnle found that phytoestrogens are present in far more foods and drinks than had previously been realised .
Studies on the health effects of phytoestrogens have painted a mixed and muddled picture .
Some have hinted that the compounds protect against cancer , heart disease and the side - effects of the menopause , while others have linked high levels to an increased risk of breast cancer and male infertility .
Still others have documented no link between phytoestrogens and those same ailments .
So snack at your own risk – or reward .

A mother in easternmost Canada pleaded guilty on Friday to murdering her only child in a twisted bid to save her relationship with a boyfriend , a court official said .
Penny Boudreau , 34 , was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 20 years for strangling her 12 - year - old daughter Karissa after her boyfriend had given her an ultimatum : Karissa or him .
The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia heard she drove Karissa to a remote spot near the town of Bridgewater in January 2008 and told her to get out of the car .
They argued and Penny tackled Karissa to the ground , pinned her with her knees , wrapped twine around her neck and strangled her .
" Karissa said : ' Mommy , do n't ' , " prosecutor Paul Scovil told the court , as relatives sobbed , according to local media .
While the two would - be prime ministers address the nation with their talking points , and talk radio is flooded with angry phone calls , it seems obvious that many Canadians ( and politicians ) are basing arguments on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of parliamentary democracy .
In that spirit , here are some myths being thrown about and reality checks for each :
Canadians voted for a Conservative government and Prime Minister Harper : Canadians did no such thing .
Despite the impression given during election campaigns , the prime minister ( and hence his government ) is not chosen by the voters ( you may have noticed that the words “ prime minister ” were not on your ballots , nor were “ Stephen Harper ” unless you voted in Calgary Southwest ) .
Instead , the prime minister is chosen by the 308 members of Parliament elected by the voters .
A majority of those 308 members have decided that Harper should not be the prime minister .
The coalition wants to overturn the results of the election : I do n’t see where that ’s the case .
There are no floor - crossings involved here ( and even if there were , both the Liberals and Conservatives have benefitted from such crossings and ignored hypocritical calls from the opposition that the member resign and face a by - election to ratify the change in party ) .
The election resulted in a minority government , which means that any measure needs support of more than one party to be approved .
The Liberals were forced to act to save Canadian jobs : Oh please .
This is clearly a power grab .
The Liberals saw their opportunity , but it was just a matter of time before this happened .
A minority situation where three of the four parties are left - of - centre and the remaining right - wing party is the one in charge just was n’t sustainable .
The economy argument is a smokescreen .
Dion is so desperate to become prime minister he ’s trying to get in by the back door :
While I ’m sure part of Dion is gleeful about the idea , and he ’s definitely better at this kind of political maneuvring than he is getting popular support from Canadians , he is n’t reversing his decision to step down as Liberal leader .
The leadership campaign will go on as planned and if the government lasts that long , the winner will become the prime minister .
Making a deal with separatists threatens this country directly :
If this were true ( and it ’s not ) , the Conservatives are just as guilty .
Many of its laws , including matters of confidence , were supported by the Bloc Québécois in exchange for matters the two could agree on like transferring more money to the provinces .
Dion ’s federalist bona fides are not in question .
Besides , the argument is being made on the other side that the Bloc has sold its soul to the federalists by agreeing not to take down a coalition government for a year .
The Liberals have a better plan to fix the economy : Nobody ’s going to fix this economic crisis .
The United States is in a recession and debt markets are in turmoil .
There ’s nothing a prime minister can do to fix that .
They can make a small impact : the Tories want to reduce taxes and the Liberals / NDP want to increase spending , both of which will put this country back into deficit and increase the national debt .
The best solution would probably be something in between , but there is no centre option here as long as the Liberals are in bed with the NDP .
The coalition will bring the stability and progressive policies needed to weather the economic crisis .
Wow , I need to get some of what you ’re smoking .
The coalition will bring partisan gridlock to Parliament Hill in no time flat .
Another election will quickly follow , in which Canadians will either punish Harper for his arrogance or ( perhaps more likely ) punish the Liberals for a transparent power grab .
This crisis shows why we need a majority government :
Whether this crisis is good or bad for Canada depends on which side you ’re on .
Majority governments are by nature more stable , because they ’re run by a benevolent dictator .
They also have a habit of being more fiscally responsible by being able to cut spending and make tough decisions .
But minority coalitions are more democratic and involve more compromise and negotiation .
And when one party attempts to do something unpopular , it can be overridden by the other three parties .
If the government loses a confidence vote , an election must be called :
That ’s not necessary .
The King / Byng affair demonstrated that .
The governor - general has the option to allow another group to become the government if she feels they would have the confidence of the House .
We must protest to ensure we get the right government :
While both sides are appealing to public opinion , it ’s highly unlikely that any of the four parties will listen to the public which has already divided so transparently along party lines .
The Liberals and NDP have already made up their minds about forming a coalition .
The Bloc has already agreed not to let it fall for a year and a half .
And the Conservatives are going to fight to the last breath to keep Stephen Harper in power .
Any other misconceptions you feel need to be corrected ?
Oh hell , I ’ll just let Rex Murphy summarize :
The first current - generation God of War game is still one of the more anticipated PlayStation 3 titles out there , and now David Jaffe has decided to build up the hype even more .
The director of the original game in the franchise , Jaffe recently visited Sony 's Santa Monica Studio where he was able to get an early glimpse of the blockbuster .
" I saw God of War III when I was in Santa Monica last week , " Jaffe wrote on his blog .
" I can and will not give away details .
But I think it 's ok for me to say two things : a ) holy holy holy [ expletive ] hell !!!! b)
I thought Gears of War 2 looked about as good as a next - gen game could look ... Dudes and dudettes , [ expletive ] wait till you see the amazing graphics ... just [ expletive ] wait . "
Unfortunately , while Jaffe showed a great deal of excitement over how GoW3 looked — which , I think , most people expected to look great anyways — we have n't really learned much new about the game .
In fact , we really know pretty much nothing about it other than its existence and , now , that it looks great .
Hopefully some actual details will come out soon .
In the meantime , GoW fans can keep themselves busy watching the epically short teaser from E3 this year .
In the first study to examine whether the inability to recognize faces can be inherited , researchers found that it is in fact a common disorder that runs in families and is one of the most frequent disorders apparently controlled by a defect in a single gene .
The study was published online June 30 , 2006 in American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A , and is available via Wiley InterScience at http://www. interscience .

Prosopagnosia ( PA ) or face blindness is characterized by the inability to differentiate faces , except for the most familiar ones such as members of one 's family .
It can be caused by brain injury , but cases where the disorder appears to run in families have also been reported .
In the first systematic study of hereditary prosopagnosia ( HPA ) , researchers led by Ingo Kennerknecht , M.D. of the Institute of Human Genetics at the University of Muenster in Germany , recruited 689 subjects from local secondary schools and a medical school and administered a questionnaire to identify those with suspected HPA .
They found 17 cases of the disorder , and of the 14 subjects who consented to further interfamilial testing , all of them had at least one first degree relative who also had it .
" Nearly all affected persons report a problem in deciding immediately whether a face is known , " the authors state .
Subjects report uncertainty in social situations and the inability to visualize the faces of close relatives or recall mental images of trees , leaves , or birds .
They generally have difficulty following TV programs or movies because they cannot tell similar actors apart .
All of the PA subjects revealed that they used up to three different strategies for overcoming the disorder .
In the compensation strategy , subjects attempt to recognize people by other characteristics such as voice , gait , clothing or hair color .
In the explanation strategy , subjects have a ready set of excuses as to why they can't recognize someone , such as being deep in thought or needing new glasses .
In the avoidance strategy , subjects try to avoid situations where they might be unable to recognize faces , such as large functions or crowded places .
Because of the compensation strategies that those with PA learn to utilize at an early age , many of them do not realize that it is an actual disorder or even realize that other members of their family have it .
" This could explain why this kind of cognitive impairment is largely unknown to lay persons or even to physicians other than neurologists and psychiatrists , " the authors state , adding that there are no established diagnostic tools for PA .
While face recognition is strongly affected in HPA , the processing of other facial information , such as gender , age , and emotional expression is generally intact .
This suggests that facial information and these other characteristics are processed independently of one another .
Furthermore , HPA is one of the few cognitive functions or dysfunctions that has only one symptom and is inherited , the authors note .
" Neurophysiological studies of people with this highly selective dysfunction might fundamentally improve our understanding of face recognition , " the authors conclude .
" As soon as gene mapping / mutation mapping will be successful , the genotype / phenotype correlations should widen our knowledge of the development of higher cerebral functions . "
