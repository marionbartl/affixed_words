I like learning new programming languages .
It ’s like a whole new way of thinking .
I thought I ’d have another look at J ( an ASCII descendent of APL ) .
APL and J clearly enshrine a way of thinking that is unusual amongst programming languages , and that alone makes them worth learning .
I last looked at J about 10 years ago .
My head exploded .
This time the tutorials seem to have a tiny bit more explanation to them .
I learnt something that I was n’t expecting ( invaluable ) .
I learnt that if you take two single digit numbers and multiple them and take the last digit of the answer , then you get the same last digit if you subtract each of the starting number from 10 and do the same thing .
3 × 4 = 1 2 ; 7 × 6 = 4 2 .
Note that 7 is 3 from 10 and 6 is 4 from 10 ; we could say that 7 and 6 were the complements in 10 of 3 and 4 .
Learning this new thing happened as I was bashing away at the J prompt .
One of the examples that comes with J produces an addition table with code like this : ( i.5 ) +/ ( i.5 ) .
And you can produce a coloured quilt pattern with viewmat ( i.5 ) +/ ( i.5 ) ( or at least you can once you ’ve remembered to type « require ‘ graph ’ » first ) :
So I thought that a multiplication table mod 10 would be a good idea .
It shows the last digit of a multiplication .
The code for that is easy : viewmat 10 | ( i.11 ) */ ( i.11 ) :
The first thing I noticed was that there was a reflection symmetry along the main - diagonal .
That ’s easy to explain , multiplication is commutative so x × y = y × x .
The next thing I noticed suprised me .
There was a reflection symmetry along the other diagonal ( the counter - diagonal ) .
I was n’t expecting that at all .
I thought about this for a bit .
So what I seem to be seeing is that :
a ⊗ b = ( 10 – a ) ⊗ ( 10 – b )
where ⊗ denotes multiplication in the ring of integers modulo 10 .
Well that ’s easy to see with a bit of algebra :
( 10 – a ) ⊗ ( 10 – b ) = ( - a ) ⊗ ( - b ) = a ⊗ b
or without using a ring :
( 10 – a ) × ( 10 – b ) | 10 = 100 – 10 ×a – 10×b + a×b | 10
by multiplying out ; and we can see that 100 and 10×a and 10×b are all 0 | 10 , so the right hand side reduces to :
a×b | 10
Another way of thinking about this is that adding 10 to a number obviously is n’t going to affect the last digit of a multiplication .
Nor is taking away 10 .
So subtracting a number from 10 is just like negating it ; and negating both numbers obviously does n’t change the answer when you multiply them together .
We can see this repeating pattern in J with viewmat 10 | ( i:10 ) */ ( i:10 ) which gives the table for integers from - 10 to 10 :
Aside : I find the above image a bit disturbing to look at .
Some part of my brain wants to believe that it has left - right and top - bottom mirror symmetry ( which it almost does have ) and is fighting with the bit of brain that can see that it does n’t have mirror symmetry .
A larger repeating version can be seen with the code viewmat 10 | ( i:40 ) */ ( i:40 ) :
Further aside : I produced these pictures by saving them as BMP files using savemat_jviewmat_ in J and converting them to much smaller PNG format using the excellent netpbm suite .
In the BMP files all the blues got swopped for reds and vice - versa .
Someone got confused as to whether the colours were specified RGB or BGR , so I had to channel swop them back again .
Of course that ’s pretty easy to do using netpbm .
Bottom line : BMP sucks .
So the thing that impresses me about J was that I was just playing around with it casually and discovered for myself this little fact about numbers that I had n’t known before .
This is how it should be when we ’re using a tool for learning .
It reminds me of the way you can discover things about geometry by playing around with Logo .
It makes me want to use computers as an exploratory tool for teaching children maths through discovery .
J itself still makes me think my head is about to explode .
If J intrigues you from this taste , perhaps you ought follow along with me : Learning J part I .

Here are some of the most common computer issues and some tips on how to repair them yourselves without spending a dime .
As always , our technicians will be waiting for your call if these DIY repairs do n’t work .
Computer Freezes
As your computer gets older and older , it ’s not all too uncommon that it freezes or hangs .
This issue is mostly related to the hard drive .
See , as more and more data gets stored , documents opened and media downloaded , all these activities create bits of information that needs to be stored .
Unfortunately , some of these pieces of information go missing or become corrupted causing your computer to freeze .
Formatting your system could help resolve the issue , but make sure you back up everything you need to avoid losing sensitive data .
Pop Up Windows and Malware
Here ’s one of the easiest problems to fix right at home .
If your computer is not protected by a firewall or anti-virus software , then that ’s a very big problem alright .
In today ’s tech - savvy world , there are plenty of dangers that could face an unprotected computer .
These include hackers , fraudsters , software writers and all sorts of cybercriminals willing to take advantage of this fact .
To avoid losing all your data and having your information held at ransom , you should install an up to date antivirus software .
Wifi Connectivity Issues
I ’ll be the first to admit ; everyone ’s had their fair share of internet connectivity issues .
Whether it ’s the technologies or the providers , something often goes wrong somewhere .
If you ’re computer savvy and know a bit about cables , modems , ADSL , routers , Bluetooth , network cards , wireless and all that , then you will know where to start .
Typically , resetting the modem or router for a minute might solve the issue .
But with today ’s automated systems , things can get a bit complicated .
If that happens , just give us a call and perhaps we can help diagnose and repair the issue .
Other computer issues that will require our expertise include :

Laptop LCD or LED Repairs or Screen Replacements
You have come to the right place .
We also replace the Glass Cover
of all Apple Macbooks and Imacs .
Just call us so we can organise a pickup and delivery once repaired .
If your Laptop has a blank
screen , black screen , white screen , vertical lines , red or blue lines horizontal lines these are all signs of possible video circuit
issues involving the motherboard , video cable and inverter including the screen itself .
One other common problem is overheating .
The
GPU can suffer from a solder degradation requiring a reball .
This is normally as expensive as replacing the logic board so i prefer to
replace it rather than doing a video chip reball .
Liquid Spills |Water Damage
Can be repaired efficiently and as cheaply as possible .
Sometimes a chemical clean can restore the logic board to
functionality again .
There are those occasions where a motherboard repair or replacement may be required .
The most important action
one can take when a Liquid spill or water damaged laptop has occurred is to TURN IT OFF IMMEDIATELY !
and remove the battery and
disconnect it from any power source .
WATER and ELECTRICITY do not mix !
If you are not able to remove the battery call us or any other
specialist technician or service to get them to disconnect the battery .
This will limit the damage and also one should use
gravity to help by turning the laptop upside down to try and keep as little liquid on the logic board components as possible .
Once
oxidation sets in it becomes harder and most costly to repair .
Hard disk or hard drives as found in all modern PCs , laptops and macs fail
from time to time .
This can happen if the laptop or macbook is suddenly
dropped , or moved too quickly .
Other reasons include ; power surges , liquid
damage , heavy objects placed on top of the laptop , wear and tear etc .
We
offer Data Recovery or hard drive repair .
We are very good at retrieving
or recovering your precious data from devices like USB stick flash
drives , nano drives ,
All the different types of branded Memory Cards
including but not limited to Nokia phones , Samsung tablets and the common
Iphone and related iPad .
Data Recovery
or retrieval is normally classified as being software or
logical based , and mechanical or electrically ( PCB failures etc ) based .
Costs vary but most if not all data recovery jobs that involve mechanical / electrical issues are very expensive .
I would strongly advise that you try every other possible way to either recreate the lost or missing data first as it will save you a lot of money .
We are one of the few data recovery services in Sydney and offer low - cost affordable rates .
There is data recovery software available online but if you are not familiar with such programs it may be wise to consult an expert first , even if you just want free advice .
Internet dropouts and sudden disconnections are very frustrating and extremely inconvenient .
We often find ourselves asking
Why is my internet
not working , My Wireless signal or Wifi not reaching far
enough .
We deal with these and other complicated issues on a daily basis .
If you are going to need data recovery pray that its logical or software based …its cheaper and quicker to recover !

Conservation scientist and Australian of the Year Tim Flannery has warned that huge industrial and economic changes need to be implemented quickly to slow the growth of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere .
Speaking on the ABC's Lateline program , Professor Flannery has revealed the contents of a crucial Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report , which will be released in November .
He says the report shows that greenhouse gas levels are at levels far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before .
Professor Flannery says these new figures show that greenhouse gas levels had already reached levels deemed to be dangerous by mid-2005 .
" We 've really seen an unexpected acceleration in the rate of accumulation of CO2 itself , " he said .
" I mean that 's been beyond the limits of projection , beyond the worst - case scenario as we thought of it in 2001 , and some of the other gases also have been produced on a larger scale than was easy to have imagined . "
He says the actual levels of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere are far beyond what has previously been modelled by climate scientists .
" What the report establishes is that the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that could potentially cause dangerous climate change , " he said .
" So if I was trying to summarise it , what it says is that we already stand an unacceptable risk of dangerous climate change and that the need for action is ever more urgent . "
Just a question .
Is there any moral difference between these two ?
Muslim cashiers wo n’t ring up pork products
So Dsouza was taken aback when the cashier – who had on the traditional headscarf worn by many Muslim women – refused to swipe the bacon through the checkout scanner .
“ She made me scan the bacon .
Then she opened the bag and made me put it in the bag , ” said Dsouza , 53 .
“ It made me wonder why this person took a job as a cashier . ”
In the latest example of religious beliefs creating tension in the workplace , some Muslims in the Twin Cities are adhering to a strict interpretation of the Koran that prohibits the handling of pork products .
Instead of swiping the items themselves , they are asking non-Muslim employees or shoppers to do it for them .
ARTS & IDEAS
A Thinking Bird , or Just Another Birdbrain ?
By DINITIA SMITH
TUCSON , Ariz . --
" Calm down , " Alex , an African Gray parrot , told Dr. Irene Pepperberg , the scientist at the University of Arizona who owns him .
" Do n't tell me to calm down , " Dr. Pepperberg snapped .
Sometimes Dr. Pepperberg and Alex squabble like an old married couple .
He even says , " I love you . "
For the last 22 years , Dr. Pepperberg has been teaching Alex , who is 23 , to do complex tasks of the sort that only a few nonhuman species -- chimpanzees , for instance -- have been able to perform .
But unlike those other creatures , Alex can talk , or at least , he can vocalize .
And , Dr. Pepperberg says ,
Alex does n't just imitate human speech , as other parrots do -- Alex can think .
His actions are not just an instinctive response , she says , but rather a result of reasoning and choice .
Jeff Topping for The New York Times
Alex the parrot is urged to count objects by Dr. Irene Pepperberg of the University of Arizona .
Assertions like Dr. Pepperberg 's are at the center of a highly emotional debate about whether thought is solely the domain of humans , or whether it can exist in other animals .
Although many people are intrigued by the idea that animals may be capable of some form of abstract reasoning and communication , scientists often ascribe what looks like clever behavior to mimicry or rote learning or even , in some cases , unconscious cues by a trainer .
So , just how smart is Alex ?
The question of animal intelligence goes back at least to Descartes and his famous aphorism , " I think , therefore I am . "
Animals cannot think , said Descartes , and therefore are inferior to humans .
And for many theologians and philosophers , the ability to think gives man a unique closeness to God .
Parrots , of course , are famous mimics , and some parrots have bigger vocabularies than Alex .
But no parrot , says Dr. Pepperberg , has been able to perform tasks as complex as Alex can .
And she believes that when Alex vocalizes , he is expressing the results of his thoughts , not mere mimicry .
For instance , when she asks Alex what color corn is , he answers yellow , even though there is no corn around .
This means , she says , he has an abstract concept of what the words " color , " " corn " and " yellow " mean .
He has not simply memorized them , but can apply them to different objects .
Chimpanzees and dolphins have been able to perform equally complex tasks , though the tasks differ from those given to Alex because of the differences between species .
But chimps and dolphins , obviously , cannot vocalize in the way Alex does .
Few scientists would dispute that Alex is doing something unusual in the history of animal studies .
At least , his behavior is more advanced than that of most other parrots who have been the subject of scientific experiments .
But scientists differ on the implications of Alex 's behavior .
Until now , Dr. Pepperberg has published her work in scientific journals , but in January Harvard University Press will publish " The Alex Studies , " a book summarizing her experiments with Alex .
Dr. Pepperberg bought
Alex at a garden - variety pet store in Chicago when he was about a year old with the idea of studying him .
As far as she knew , he had no particular pedigree , and she is not even sure whether he is particularly smart in relation to other parrots .
Now she is trying to replicate his training with another Gray Parrot , Griffin .
Dr. Pepperberg , listing Alex 's accomplishments , said he could identify 50 different objects and recognize quantities up to 6 ; that he could distinguish 7 colors and 5 shapes , and understand " bigger , " " smaller , " " same " and " different , " and that he was learning the concepts of " over " and " under . "
Hold a tray of different shapes and colored objects in front of him , as Dr. Pepperberg was doing the other day as a reporter watched , and he can distinguish an object by its color , shape and the material it is made of .
( Dr. Pepperberg said she frequently changed objects to make sure Alex was n't just memorizing things and that she structured experiments to avoid involuntary cues from his examiner ) .
But today Alex was being recalcitrant .
Dr. Pepperberg had been away for three weeks at M.I.T. , where she is a visiting professor this year .
When she leaves him , she says , Alex chews at his tail and wing feathers , giving him a rather threadbare appearance , and when she returns he is very demanding , turning his back and saying , " Come here ! "
" What matter is orange and three - cornered ? " she asked Alex , holding the tray of objects in front of him .
First ,
Alex had to identify which object was orange and three - cornered , and then tell Dr. Pepperberg what it was made of .
She allowed Alex to pick up the objects on the tray with his beak and to " examine " each one .
But after he finished , instead of giving an answer , Alex demanded a nut .
" Want a nut , " he said clearly , sounding almost human .
( He also responds to other people 's commands , Dr. Pepperberg 's graduate students for instance . )
" I know , I 'll give you a nut , " Dr. Pepperberg said , sounding annoyed .
" Wanna go back , " said Alex , meaning go back into his cage .
Dr. Pepperberg continued trying to get Alex to perform , but he resisted and she began to lose patience .
" C'mon , Alex , " she said .
" I 'm sorry , " he said .
Usually , said Dr. Pepperberg , that means he is about to give in .
" What matter is orange and three - cornered , Alex ? " she insisted .
" Wool ! " said Alex , getting it right .
Dr. Pepperberg refuses to call Alex 's vocalizations " language . "
" I avoid the language issue , " she said .
" I 'm not making claims .
His behavior gets more and more advanced , but I do n't believe years from now you could interview him . "
She continued : " What little syntax he has is very simplistic .
Language is what you and I are doing , an incredibly complex form of communication . "
Still , many scientists and others remain unconvinced .
What about unconscious cues from the trainer ?
Perhaps the most famous instance of that involves Clever Hans , a horse at the turn of the century who could supposedly count , tell time and make change by tapping his hoof on the ground .
It was learned that Hans 's trainer was tipping him off to the right answer by tensing his body and moving his head as Hans " counted . "
More recently , Dr. Herbert Terrace , a Columbia University psychology professor , famously repudiated his own studies in the 1970's with a chimpanzee he called Nim Chimpsky , after the M.I.T. linguist Noam Chomsky .
Dr. Terrace taught Nim to use signs that looked as if they were combined grammatically into sentences .
But it turned out they were clever imitations of his teacher .
Asked about Alex , Dr. Terrace said he thought that what Alex was doing was " a rote response . "
He calls it " a complex discriminative performance . "
But is Alex thinking ?
" I would say minimally , " Dr. Terrace responded .
" In every situation , there is an external stimulus that guides his response . "
Thought , he said , involves the ability to process information that is not right in front of you .
" It shows Alex is a smart bird , " he said .
But if you take away Alex 's ability to vocalize in a way that seems human , he went on , it would not seem as impressive : " The words are responses , are not language . "
On the other side of the animal - intelligence debate is Dr. Donald R. Griffin , author of " Animal Thinking , " who coined the phrase " cognitive ethology , " the study of animal cognition .
He believes that animals are capable of complex thought and behavior that is not just instinctive .
The discovery that " a bird can express his conscious thoughts and feelings , " said Dr. Griffin , " is a great advance .
We used to think that was impossible . "
To Dr. Griffin ,
Alex 's achievements are just one more proof of his contention .
Dr. Griffin 's views of animal intelligence have been hotly contested .
" The intensity of the aversion is incredible , " he said .
" It 's a very touchy subject .
Scientists do n't like to be told that a valid reason for what an animal does is the possibility that it does it with any consciousness . "
Dr. Steven Pinker , an M.I.T. scientist and author of " How the Mind Works , " said that at the heart of the debate is the question of human primacy .
" In earlier times the issue was of whether we are mere animals , and to separate and exalt human worth .
Ironically , there has been the same kind of moralistic return from animal fans who say we should n't mistreat them because they think and feel the way we do . "
Dr. Pinker believes that human beings alone are genetically programmed to learn language spontaneously and easily .
" I think it is rather an ironic definition of animals to tend to enoble them by training them to mimic humans . "
Until recently , birds had been thought of as on the low end of the intelligence scale -- hence the term " birdbrain . "
The point , Dr. Pepperberg said , is that Alex " is a nonmammal , nonprimate , with a brain the size of a walnut . "
And Alex 's accomplishments .
she added , show that " animal intelligence is more widespread than we thought . "
Dr. Pepperberg attributes what she calls
Alex 's ability to reason and process complex information to her training methods .
Most training of birds has followed the conditioning theories of B. F. Skinner , the behaviorist .
A bird is taught to say or do a specific thing by a human instructor and is rewarded with food .
Dr. Pepperberg initially uses the object itself as a reward so that the bird associates the word with the object .
She uses two human trainers instead of one to demonstrate the interaction she is trying to teach Alex .
For instance , Dr. Pepperberg stands in front of Alex with a graduate student and orders the student to select a three - sided orange object and to say what the object is made of -- wool , perhaps .
She believes that by watching the interaction , Alex connects the graduate student 's response to the command .
" Orange " she believes , comes to mean to Alex the color of an object rather than the immediate reward of a grape .
Dr. Pepperberg says her experiments have implications beyond determining whether -- or how well -- animals can think .
She says her methods have been successfully used to train autistic children and children with learning disabilities .
Alex 's achievements , she said , also underscore the need for stricter conservation of parrots , which are an endangered species .
Dr. Pepperberg , who is 50 , was born in New York City , an only child who kept parakeets as pets and taught them to speak .
She was studying for her Ph.D. in chemistry at Harvard , she said , when she saw a " Nova " series on PBS about chimps ' using sign language , dolphin research and why birds sing .
She wanted to change fields , but her advisers discouraged her , she said , so she continued her chemistry studies , continuing nonetheless to read all she could on animal behavior .
She married and divorced .
She has no children .
When she applied for her first grant to study bird behavior from the National Institutes of Health , she said , " there were reviews asking me what I was smoking . "
" People are not at all surprised a chimpanzee can do this , " she went on .
" You can't imagine -- people said birds were stupid . "
Dr. Pepperberg expects
Alex to live at least 20 more years .
Meanwhile , she has added two new birds to the lab .
Besides Griffin , now 4 years old , there is Kyaaro , who Dr. Pepperberg believes exhibits symptoms of attention deficit disorder .
" Alex does n't like either of them , " she said .
" Kyaaro is weird .
Griffin is a threat . "
Right now she is trying to train Griffin to do some of the things Alex can do .
Griffin , who learned the word " wool " only recently , has been clinging to it the way a child clings to a new - found possession .
One day recently Dr. Pepperberg held up a purple plastic letter S and asked , " What sound is purple ? " Griffin stared at the letter .
But from the other side of the laboratory Alex made the sound for him , " Sss . "
" Buttinsky , " Dr. Pepperberg said to Alex , and she turned back to Griffin .
" What sound ? " she asked Griffin again , holding up the S .
" What sound ? "
" Wool , " said Griffin .
Griffin has a long way to go

Congressman plans new impeachment articles against Gonzales

A freshman Democratic Congressmember from Tennessee is working with a former Reagan - era Justice Department lawyer to introduce Articles of Impeachment against Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , according to a report in Monday 's Commercial Appeal .
" In a telephone interview from Memphis on Monday , [ Rep. Steve ]
Cohen said he and his staff are working with former Reagan Justice Department lawyer Bruce Fein to draw up articles of impeachment against Atty .
Gen. Alberto Gonzales , " wrote the paper 's Bartholomew Sullivan .
Rep .
Cohen , who was elected to his first term last November , did not say what ' high crimes and misdemeanors ' his articles would accuse Gonzales of committing .
But he did criticize Gonzales for approaching then - Attorney General John Ashcroft when he served as White House Counsel to overturn his deputy 's ruling that a government spying program was not legal .
" It 's a major part of our country 's civil liberties , and principles , that we do n't spy on our people , " Sullivan reports Cohen saying .
Cohen 's articles will be another entrant in expanding field of measures that Democratic Congressmembers are proposing to condemn the work of President George W. Bush 's second Attorney General .
Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) recently introduced a measure that called on the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether the Attorney General had committed any impeachable offenses .
Additionally , Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) and Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) both introduced censure measures against the President , Vice President Dick Cheney , and Gonzales on Monday .
Also , Reps. Adam Schiff ( D - CA ) and Artur Davis ( D - AL ) in May proposed a ' no confidence ' motion against the Attorney General which has so far garnered 121 additional co-sponsors .
Cohen is a co-sponsor of all of these earlier measures .
He also signed on to Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's Article of Impeachment against Vice President Cheney .
Sullivan 's full article in the Commercial Appeal can be read at this link .
Not that China needed another black eye these days , but reports that tires manufactured in the country are missing a key safety component that 's already caused two deaths certainly does n't help China shed its growing image of shoddy products .
Some 450,000 Chinese - made tires -- a number that could balloon to nearly a million , depending on how many distributors have sold tires made at this factory -- are going to be subject to a massive recall that threatens to bankrupt the small New Jersey distributor that imports them .
Foreign Tire Sales says it will begin a recall when it gets notification from the NHTSA .
" We will wait to get their order and create a remedy plan and begin a recall , " said a company spokesman .
" When the money runs out , that 's the end . "
The problem is that a thin gum strip between the steel belts of a tire is allegedly missing .
Foreign
Tire says the Chinese manufacturer , a company that it 's been doing business with for 10 years with no problems until now , stopped inserting the $ 1 - a - piece strip , leading to tread separation .
It was tread separation that doomed Firestone a few years back and caused a blowout in its relationship with Ford ( NYSE : F ) , which had extended as far back as the Model T .
The Chinese manufacturer , the Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Company , disputes the assertion , though Foreign Tires says it had admitted as much to the company in a report it gave to federal regulators .
Foreign
Tire was sued in May as a result of a crash caused by tread separation that led to two deaths .
The company had been suspicious of the tires since 2005 , when it began receiving an increasing number of customer complaints about them .
The company undertook its own tests , and earlier this month it reported its concerns to the NHTSA , asking for assistance in recalling the tires .
It estimates that this process will cost between $ 50 million and $ 80 million -- money Foreign
Tire says it does n't have .
Hangzhou Zhongce thinks the problem has more to do with China becoming a bigger player in the tire market than anything to do with defective tires .
According to the Rubber Manufacturers Association , China accounts for 32 million units in tire imports to the U.S. , the largest of any other country .
Both Goodyear ( NYSE : GT ) and Cooper Tire ( NYSE : CTB ) have moved production facilities to China in the face of rising U.S. labor costs .
Tires , of course , are merely the latest in a string of high - profile product problems emanating from China .
Toymaker RC2 ( NASDAQ : RCRC ) is probably relieved that tires may now be the focus of substandard manufacturing processes .
Since it was discovered that its hugely popular Thomas the Tank Engine train toys were coated with lead paint -- a process its Chinese manufacturer also undertook on its own -- it has been the subject of consumer and regulatory ire .
Lead paint has been banned in the U.S. for decades .
Before the toy problem , there was another cause for alarm : the use of antifreeze in Chinese - made toothpaste ( the ingredient was mislabeled as a benign similar - sounding chemical ) .
And then there was tainted pet food that contained a flame retardant as an additive .
Investing overseas can provide wonderful opportunities to profit from emerging markets and growing companies domiciled outside of United States .
For my money , however , China has yet to prove itself committed to ensuring the health , safety , and welfare of its products , while the companies themselves walk a knife 's edge of legitimacy in a Communist society .
This requires us not only to carefully consider whether we want to invest in a company like game maker The9 ( NASDAQ : NCTY ) , but also whether a company like Goodyear continues to warrant our investment dollars too .

I was inspried by comments from a friend yesterday , to think up a couple of “ bumpersticker ” type slogans in support of the second amendment .
Which do you think would make the better bumper sticker or t- shirt :
The Second Amendment :
In case they “ forget ” the other ones
Or …
The Second Amendment : Defending the other ones since 1791
I had originally written “ the other nine ” , and I still think it sounds better , but it ’s technically inaccurate since there are 27 amendments ; even if most of those not in the bill of rights are essentially procedural in nature , not necessarily related to fundamental rights and liberties …
… Well that , and the fact that I ’m fundamentally opposed to a lot of the amendments outside of the bill or rights , either in principle , in detail , in structure , or in language … including some amendments that a minarchist like myself might be expected to support
Why ?
Well , let ’s go though them .
I oppose :
the 15th , 19th , and 24th amendments : Because they were unnecessary .
Once slavery was made unconstitutional by the 13th amendment , then all citizens who were of age ( 21 at the time ) , of all races , sexes , backgrounds , prior conditions of servitude etc … should have automatically and clearly been allowed to vote under the 14th amendment , without any requirement for literacy or taxes .
Any construal of the 14th amendment to the contrary , or any state laws to the contrary , should have been struck down by the supreme court under the 14th ( and in fact they have been ever since .
The 15th and 19th are generally ignored , and the 24th is usually invoked with dubious justification ) .
the 16th Amendment : Because it establishes a de-facto slavery to the government .
Some taxes are of course necessary , however taxes on incomes , earnings , wages , and assets are fundamentally theft or slavery .
Additionally , the 16th amendment was never properly ratified , and was enacted fraudulently ; and has since its enactment been enforced fraudulently as well , because it authorizes taxes on income not on wages .
Income , earnings , and wages are three different things by law and by centuries of precedent , but our government has chosen to treat the 16th amendment as if it authorizes all three .
A tax on wages is involuntary servitude without compensation , the very definition of slavery .
the 17th amendment : Because it fundamentally unbalanced our federated system of checks and balances between state and federal power , in favor of the federal government to the harm of the interests and powers of the states and the people .
The house of representatives was meant to represent the interests of the people as individuals , and the senate was meant to represent the interests of each state .
This is why representatives are apportioned by population , but senators are apportioned two per state ; and why senators were meant to be selected by the government of each state as they saw fit .
We were founded as a representative federated republic ; and direct election of senators has essentially removed the middle out of those three ; much to the detriment of our nation ; moving us closer and closer to a simple republic ( which in a nation of our size , with such diverse interests geographically , would be an unmitigated disaster )
the 18th and 21st amendments : Because they address an issue that is not properly a matter of law , but of morality .
Passing the 18th amendment was against the principles we founded our government on , and should never have happened .
The 21st therefore should n’t have happened either .
Additionally , the 21st established in blackletter law the ability for the states to make their own prohibitions , which should n’t have been a matter for the federal constitution to address , unless it was to prohibit such state laws to be made .
the 22nd amendment : Because term limits are also fundamentally wrong under our system of government .
If the people are stupid enough to elect a scumbag over and over again ; so long as that scumbag has n’t been disqualified by unlawful actions , then they should be able to run as often as they like .
In engineering ( and in the military , which share a similar mindset towards problem solving ) , this type of law has a saying about it : this is a technical solution to a non-technical problem ( also called a hardware solution to a software problem and other variations )
The problem is that the people are electing people they “ should n’t . ”
The solution is not to make electing those people illegal ; it ’s to educate the electorate better so they wo n’t want to elect people they should n’t .
the 23rd amendment : Because the District of Columbia either IS a state , or it is not ; you ca n’t have it half way .
Giving DC representation in congress , electors in presidential elections , or any kind of position on the national stage is ridiculous .
We do n’t allow New York City to have electors separate from it ’s state government , why would we allow Washington to do so .
This is not disenfranchisement , this is clearly a structural issue .
A single city should not be given the status of a state in any way .
We should either leave DC without representation ( including in elections ) , give it back to Maryland , or make it a state , with all the attendant rights and responsibilities of the people within .

Simplifying can sometimes be overwhelming .
The amount of stuff you have in your life and the amount of things you have to do can be too big a mountain to tackle .
But you do n’t have to simplify it all at once .
Do one thing at a time , and take small steps .
You ’ll get there , and have fun doing it .
In fact , you can do little but important things today to start living the simple life .
I was criticized a few weeks ago when I published the Simple Living Manifesto : 72 Ideas to Simplify Your Life , because many people felt the list was too long .
I heard this point , and this post is my response : just the 10 most important things .
And these are not 10 difficult things , but 10 simple things that you can do today .
Not tomorrow , not next week , not next month .
Today .
Choose one and do it today .
Tomorrow , choose another .
If you do these 10 things , you ’ll have made great strides with little effort .
1 . Make a short list .
Take out a sheet of paper and fold it into a small square , perhaps 3×5 inches .
Or take out an index card .
Now make a short list of the 4 - 5 most important things in your life .
What ’s most important to you ?
What do you value most ?
What 4 - 5 things do you most want to do in your life ?
Simplifying starts with these priorities , as you are trying to make room in your life so you have more time for these things .
2. Drop 1 commitment .
Think about all the things in your life that you ’re committed to doing , and try to find one that you dread doing .
Something that takes up time but does n’t give you much value .
Perhaps you ’re on a team , or coaching something , or on a board or committee , or whatever .
Something that you do each day or week or month that you do n’t really want to do .
Now take action today to drop that commitment .
Call someone , send an email , telling the appropriate person or people that you just do n’t have the time .
You will feel relief .
I ’d recommend dropping all commitments that do n’t contribute to your short list ( from Item # 1 ) , but for today , just drop 1 commitment .
3 . Purge a drawer .
Or a shelf , or a countertop , or a corner of a room .
Not an entire room or even an entire closet .
Just one small area .
You can use that small area as your base of simplicity , and then expand from there .
Here ’s how to purge : 1 ) empty everything from the drawer or shelf or corner into a pile .
2 ) From this pile , pick out only the most important things , the stuff you use and love .
3 ) Get rid of the rest .
Right now .
Trash it , or put it in your car to give away or donate .
4 ) Put the stuff you love and use back , in a neat and orderly manner .
4 . Set limits .
Read Haiku Productivity for more .
Basically , you set limits for things you do regularly : email , RSS posts , tasks , feeds , items in your life , etc .
And try to stick with the limits .
Today , all you have to do is set limits for a few things in your life .
Tomorrow , try to stick with them .
5. Simplify your to - do list .
Take a look at your to - do list .
If it ’s more than 10 items long , you can probably simplify it a bit .
Try to find at least a few items that can be eliminated , delegated , automated , outsourced , or ignored .
Shorten the list .
This is a good habit to do once a week .
6 . Free up time .
Simplifying your life in general is a way to free up time to do the stuff you want to do .
Unfortunately , it can be hard to find time to even think about how to simplify your life .
If that ’s the case , free up at least 30 minutes a day for thinking about simplifying .
Or alternatively , free up a weekend and think about it then .
How can you free up 30 minutes a day ?
Just a few ideas : wake earlier , watch less TV , eat lunch at your desk , take a walk for lunch , disconnect from the Internet , do email only once today , shut off your phones , do 1 less thing each day .
7. Clear your desk .
I can personally attest to the amazing feeling that a clean desk can give you .
It ’s such a simple thing to do , and yet it does so much for you .
If your desk is covered with papers and notes and gadgets and office supplies , you might not be able to get this done today .
But here are the basic steps : 1 ) Clear everything off your desk and put it in a pile ( either in your inbox or on the floor ) .
2 ) Process the pile from top to bottom , one item at a time .
Do not defer decisions on any item — deal with them immediately and quickly .
3 ) For each item , either file it immediately , route it to someone else , trash it , or note it on your to - do list ( and put it in an “ action ” folder ) .
If it ’s a gadget or office supply , find a place for it in your desk drawers ( or get rid of it ) .
4 ) Repeat until your pile is empty and your desk is clear .
Be sure to get rid of any knick knacks .
Your desk should have your computer , your inbox , perhaps a notepad , and maybe a family photo ( but not many ) .
Ahh , a clear desk !
5 ) From now on , put everything in your inbox , and at least once a day , process it in the same way as above .
8. Clear out your email inbox .
This has the same psychological effect as a clear desk .
Is your email inbox always full of read and unread messages ?
That ’s because you ’re delaying decisions on your emails .
If you have 50 , let ’s say , or fewer emails in your inbox , you can process them all today .
If you have hundreds , you should put them in a temporary folder and get to them one chunk at a time ( do 20 per day or something ) .
Here ’s how you process your inbox to empty — including emails already in your inbox , and all future incoming emails : 1 ) process them top to bottom , one at a time , deciding and disposing of each one immediately .
2 ) Your choices are to delete , archive , respond immediately ( and archive or delete ) , forward ( and archive or delete ) , or mark it with a star ( or something like that ) and note it on your to - do list to respond to later ( and archive ) .
3 ) Process each email like that until the inbox is empty .
4 ) Each time you check your email , process to empty .
Ahh , an empty inbox !
9 . Move slower .
We rush through the day , from one task to another , from one appointment to another , until we collapse on the couch , exhausted , at the end of the day .
Instead , simplify your life by doing less ( see Items 1 , 4 and 5 ) and doing them more slowly .
Eat slower , drive slower , walk slower , shower slower , work slower .
Be more deliberate .
Be present .
This is n’t something you ’re going to master today , but you can start practicing today .
10 . Single - task .
Instead of multi-tasking , do one thing at a time .
Remove all distractions , resist any urge to check email or do some other habitual task like that while you ’re doing the task at hand .
Stick to that one task , until you ’re done .
It ’ll make a huge difference in both your stress level and your productivity .
Ever since aspartame was first approved in foods and carbonated beverages as a sweetener , there has been a fire storm of controversy surrounding it .
Although the FDA claims that it is one of the safest and most thoroughly tested food additives ever approved , some believe it has many side effects .
A recently released Italian study reaffirms their own research from 2005 that there is an increase in cancer risks associated with aspartame .
With each study citing its dangers , there is one that counters its conclusions and states the opposite .
The FDA is once again busy proclaiming that it is safe and that there is no link to cancer .
Yet many well researched studies by respected individuals and institutions point to aspartame as the cause of toxic reactions and illnesses .
Is this a case of the FDA covering up potential risks associated with aspartame to protect the profits of large corporations ?
This would n't be the first time they have put greed ahead of our health and safety .
Despite the FDA 's assurances , many are making a conscious effort to avoid it in their diet .
This is being done without suggestions from their doctors or support from traditional medicine .
In fact in some cases , it is the patients who are educating their own physicians to the potential risks associated with aspartame .
The approval of aspartame in foods in 1981 was done under questionable circumstances , with some in the FDA recommending that it not be approved .
In 1996 , one of the FDA 's own toxicologists , Dr. Adrian Gross , warned of it's potential to cause brain tumors and cancer .
If this admission is true , it would completely violate amendments , which forbid adding any substance to food that is cancer - causing .
Aspartame is not so much an additive as it is a drug and it interacts with other drugs .
Methanol or wood alcohol constitutes one third of the aspartame molecule and is classified as a severe metabolic poison or narcotic .
Although possible side effects can be immediate , it has been called the silent slow killer because it appears to cause gradual damage over long term use .
It has brought more complaints than any other additive , and in 1995 the FDA was forced to release a list of 92 possible symptoms related to aspartame intake .
It is entirely possible that aspartame is the cause of many diseases and mystery illnesses .
It breaks down into a solution , and as a result is able to travel throughout the body and deposit with any tissue .
Possible side effects vary from person to person because it is directly related to genetic individuality and physical weaknesses .
Some researchers claim that it is responsible for the epidemic of diabetes and connected with the sharp increase in obesity .
Other studies have found that it causes depletion of serotonin that can lead to behavioral and psychiatric problems .
There have been numerous side effects linked to aspartame which include blindness , headaches , migraines , dizziness , sleeplessness , memory loss , buzzing or ringing sound , nausea , shortness of breath , and allergies .
Some leading doctors and researchers have cited that it might trigger , mimic , and even cause diseases such as Lyme , Graves ' , Alzheimer 's , chronic fatigue syndrome , multiple sclerosis , lupus , and others .
It has also been linked to sever depression , birth defects , suicidal tendencies , aggressive behavior , hyperactivity in children , and death .
Some say that aspartame is being used as a scapegoat to explain the cause of a wide number of ailments .
Leading Italian researcher Dr. Morando Soffritti concluded from his first study in 2005 that aspartame leads to higher rates of lymphoma and leukemia in rats .
He found that aspartame consisting of two amino acids and a methanol binding agent caused the cancer .
The FDA concluded after a review of the study that there was no data to support his claims .
The European Food Safety Authority came to the same conclusions .
Results of a second study through the Ramazzini Institute backed up the findings of the first one .
It dealt with the negative health effects associated with low doses of aspartame that would be equivalent to the intake of diet drinks on a daily basis .
Dr. Soffritti's second study also confirmed that it is carcinogenic .
Aspartame is now found in over 6000 products including soft drinks , gum , yogurt and many other sugar - free items .
Personally , if I am going to have sugar , I prefer that it is in it 's natural form .
Often I find myself checking labels and ingredients , trying to stay away from aspartame .
My experiences include getting bad headaches after drinking diet colas or chewing gum containing aspartame .
Although I do n't have any scientific proof that aspartame was the cause , that was enough for me to start avoiding it .
My article is intended to serve more as a cautionary warning to aspartame 's possible side effects .
There are many different conflicting studies and it can be very confusing .
Ultimately , we are left with the decision whom to believe and trust .
Many people now associate some of their health issues as a direct result of aspartame poisoning .
Although I am not a doctor or a nutritionist , it only makes sense to keep ones diet simple and include plenty of raw , natural foods and to avoid artificial , refined , and prepared foods packed with preservatives .
Even our fresh foods are contaminated with pesticides , hormones , and antibiotics .
As consumers , we can dictate the market .
For example , there has been an explosion in the availability of organic foods , which was a direct result of consumer demands .
The British Supermarket Sainsbury 's is in the process of banning artificial colors , flavors , and aspartame in their own brand foods and soft drinks .
This is being done as a result of studies showing that this is what customers are demanding .
The aspartame controversy is n't over , as some continue to claim that it is safe , while others warn of its dangers .
In the end , the use of aspartame becomes a personal issue .

The Islamic Republic of Iran has just issued a new 50,000 rial banknote .
An eye - catching feature of the banknote is the atomic symbol on its reverse side , an orange - hued representation of six electrons in orbit .
Money has been " backed " by a wide range of things , from silver and gold , to central banks , to assertions of raw power .
This atomic symbol represents quite an escalation in this regard .
While less explicit than its atomic symbol , another part of the banknote speaks to the continuing break - down of the Iranian economy .
The denomination of the note — 50,000 rials — is much larger than that of the highest banknote previously in circulation — 20,000 rials ; which 20,000 rial note was only issued three years ago .
In both cases , the notes were issued because rampant inflation was making the currency of the country awkward for use as a medium of exchange .
Prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution , the economy was mostly a private property , market - oriented economy , and since , industry has been mostly nationalized and the economy directed from Teheran .
Production and income , apart from the export of crude oil and natural gas , is down , and the ambitious spending programs of the government have been financed increasingly with paper money .
Prior to the revolution , it took 70 rials to buy 1 US dollar .
Today , the official exchange rate is 9,300 rials to 1 US dollar , and there is a vibrant black market in dollars .
Because of Iran 's great oil wealth , it has been able , thus far , to stave off a hyperinflationary blow - off .
Other countries have not been so lucky .
Zimbabwe , today 's poster child of hyperinflation , has collapsed into economic destitution , its population suffering from the outbreak of social diseases as well as from slow starvation .
And , Zimbabwe 's inflation has been modest when compared to other recent hyperinflations .
In the chart below , I track the exchange rates ( to the US dollar ) of four currencies that recently went through hyperinflations , Argentina , Brazil , Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe .
As you can see , the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe is just getting underway .
Hyperinflation has often been associated with a collapse of the political order along with a collapse of the economy , and even with the outbreak of war and genocide .
In Yugoslavia , it culminated in the dismemberment of the country .
In Zaire , things got so bad , they changed the name of the country ( to The Other Congo ) and the official language , and — would you believe it ! — they had the French come in as peacekeepers .
In Bolivia , during their hyperinflation of the 1980s , the number one import was newly printed money from Germany and the number one export was illegal drugs to the United States .
In Chile , during their hyperinflation of the 1970s , armed gangs of the " right - wing " and of the " left , " roamed the country for food , leaving the people terrorized and the economy paralyzed .
In Hungary , following World War II , the occupying Soviets used hyperinflation to destroy that country 's middle - class and open the door for a communist take - over .
Of course , during the Weimer Republic , the hyperinflation that was forced onto Germany by France and England following WWI similarly destroyed the middle - class of that country and ushered in the Nazis .
In the past , paper - money - fueled inflation quickly ran its course to ruin .
The assignats of the French Revolution , and the Continental dollar of the American Revolution , for two examples , quickly ran their courses , one ushering in Napoleon , a dictator , and the other Robert Morris , a mere banker .
But , with the perfection of the issue of paper money , central banks became able to embark on a course of a continuing , moderate rate of inflation , and so , exact a much larger " profit " ( called , seigniorage ) from the process .
( I put scare quotes on the word profit because this is n't a true profit , or excess above cost , but a redistribution of wealth , from those possessing money to those owning the money - printing press . )
As shown in the above chart , Argentina and Brazil mastered the art of legal pick - pocketing , and , thus , proceeded to run very rapid rates of inflation for prolonged periods of time .
However , so as to prevent hernias in the use of money as a medium of exchange , they had to print larger and larger denominations of banknotes ( as Iran is now doing ) , and even they had to periodically call in the outstanding money and exchange it for new money at a ratio of , e.g. , 1,000 to 1 .
Below , I show a 1,000 cruzado banknote of Brazil overprinted 1 new cruzado , illustrating how these currency exchanges worked .
Over the years , Brazil exchanged cruzados for cruzerios , new cruzados for cruzados , cruzerios reals for new cruzados , and reals for cruzerios reals .
Thus , Brazil was able , over an extended period of time , to aggregate even more inflation than the former Yugoslavia , or in Germany during the short - lived period of the Weimer Republic .
In the ancient world , Rome had similarly mastered the art of legal pick - pocketing through debasement of the coinage .
Over time , the denarius of Rome became increasingly orange , as the coins were recast with less silver and more copper , with periodic exchanges of nearly all - copper denarii for new silver denarii at exaggerated exchange rates .
But , the process of inflationary finance did not originate with the Romans .
It can be traced much further back , to soon after government got into the business of " attesting , " with its stamp , to the weight and fineness of coins , as it did n't require a great deal of intelligence to realize that the government could force people to accept its money at face value , via legal tender laws , independent of weight and fineness .
The Greeks were so familiar with cumbersome bronze , tin , and iron coins that were forced upon them by their governments , that the playwright Aristophanes wrote , in The Frogs , " In our Republic , bad citizens are preferred to good , just as bad money circulates while good money disappears . "
And the prophet Isaiah reminded Israel that it had sinned and needed to repent , saying , " your money has become dross . "
Also written on the new Iranian banknote , in Arabic , is a quotation of the prophet Mohammed , that the scientists of Persia would reach to the heavens for knowledge .
If the government of Iran were scientific , it would heed the science of economics and desist from inflation before it totally ruins its own country .
Do you want a really simple way to strengthen your family ?
It ’s really not complex , and it does n’t have to cost much , financially … it just takes your time and attention .
Do I have your attention ?
One of the simplest ways to strengthen a family is to plan dates .
This includes , of course , your spouse … but is n’t limited to them .
It could and should include everyone in your family , at least once a month ( if possible … some families are HUGE , it might have to be less often if yours is one of them ) .
Here are the with whom you should plan dates , in this simple way to strengthen your family :
Your Spouse
This one should be obvious , but for some reason it is n’t … the fact that you ’re married does n’t mean you should stop dating .
In fact , if you want your relationship to be great , go back to thinking of your spouse as someone that you have to woo , someone you have to win over .
An absolutely huge number of couples forget the importance of making each other their significant other .
If you are one of those couples … change .
Fix it … go back to thinking about your spouse and how important they are to you and win them over … again and again and again .
This is one person whom you should NOT let slip to less often than once a month … if you can do more , go for it !
Once a week would be great … you wanted to see your spouse at least once a week before you got married , right ?
Your Children
It ’s less obvious that you should plan dates with your children than that you should plan them with your spouse , but it ’s not less important !
Planning specific times to be with each child , and ONLY with that child , gives both you and them something to anticipate , hopefully eagerly .
If you start this when they are young enough , it is something that will keep you close to them , and something they will remember , for the rest of their life .
If they are old enough , it ’s nice to let them choose what to do … it makes them feel more like it ’s their date , too .
Your Self Probably the person most forgotten when it comes to scheduling exclusive time , your self still needs it .
It can be really difficult , especially if you ’re one of those people who identify with your family and helping others , to remember that you need time to yourself , too … and I ’m not talking about ten minutes before bed , although that can be very helpful , too ( see How To Make Your Life Happier In One Simple Change ) .
I ’m talking about an honest - to - goodness solid block of time for yourself , at least three or four hours in a row … uninterrupted .
You can use this time to do whatever you enjoy , but do n’t use it to do something that “ needs ” done .
Do something that you want to do , something you enjoy , but not anything that you have to do .
If you follow this plan , you should notice basically everything about your family life getting better over the next few months .
If you want it to happen faster , you can plan the dates more often … but do n’t make it overwhelming .
It ’s good to have a date with your wife once a week , and certainly would n’t hurt to have time to yourself each week , but you do n’t want to feel like all of your time is scheduled to death , either .
After all , dates should be enjoyed , not forced , or they pretty much lose all effectiveness .
So , get started and actually enjoy something that strengthens your family .
The Shin Bet intelligence service recently prevented a double suicide bombing in central Israel , a statement issued by the organizations revealed Wednesday .
According to the statement , two Palestinian women were arrested last month at the Erez crossing following Shin Bet intelligence reports .
The two planned to carry out suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and Netanya .
Women 's Terrorism Network of Islamic Jihad women exposed Efrat Weiss Cleared for publication : IDF , Shin Bet arrest six women who receive funds from Islamic Jihad 's Syrian command , transfer funds to terror cells and families of suicide bombers .
Monday , female suicide bomber from Islamic Jihad blows herself up next to IDF roadblock in Beit Hanoun Network of Islamic Jihad women exposed
The bombings were to take place in crowded locations , such as bus -stops , restaurants or public halls .
Fatma Younis Hasan - Zack , a 39 year - old Gazan , had been running the Islamic Jihad employment center for women for the past four years .
Familiar with many of the organization 's activists , Zack was the liaison between them and many women interested in carrying out suicide bombings .
About three months ago , Zack was approach by her niece , a mother of four from Gaza , who wanted to commit a suicide attack .
Zack decided to carry out a bombing as well , and contacted the Islamic Jihad .
The two went on to secure false papers stating a medical condition allowing them to get to Ramallah for a medical examination which would secure a referral to an Israeli hospital .
Both underwent the Jihad 's weapons training and were given explosive devices , and instructions as to what they should wear in order not to arouse suspicion .
The two were arrested at the Erez crossing , on May 20 , following a specific intelligence report the Shin Bet received .
Over the last few years , more and more Palestinian women have been willing to carry out suicide bombings .
The Shin Bet statement said the two took a cold , deliberate advantage of Israel 's humanitarian - aid policy .
As a retired four - star general and former presidential candidate , you ’re about to publish a memoir whose title , “ A Time to Lead , ” might seem to suggest you ’re personally eager to lead this country .
Is that an accurate reading ?
“ A Time to Lead ” is a time for America to lead .
That is the intention of the title .
Certainly we are having a leadership crisis .
We have an administration that has lost all sense of strategic purpose in the Mideast .
I am very concerned that we have lost the foundation of America ’s worldwide power and influence .
It has been squandered .
Are you referring to our military strength ?
The most important element of power is not the military .
After World War II and through the end of the 20th century , we had a legitimacy that magnified our military strength and economic strength .
We were n’t like other powers .
We were n’t after an empire .
We did n’t torture .
What we ’ve lost is our legitimacy .
It ’s time for every American to be a leader .
Is that practical ?
If every American were a leader , there would be no one left for them to boss around .
Leaders do n’t boss .
Not if they ’re any good .
They persuade .
And I think America needs a whole lot more persuading and a lot less bossing .
It sounds as if you ’re running for president again as a Democrat .
I have n’t said I wo n’t .
I think about it every day .
( By Bill O'leary ) Will Limbaugh call these men " phony soldiers ? "
For six decades , they held their silence .
The group of World War II veterans kept a military code and the decorum of their generation , telling virtually no one of their top - secret work interrogating Nazi prisoners of war at Fort Hunt .
" We got more information out of a German general with a game of chess or Ping - Pong than they do today , with their torture , " said Henry Kolm , 90 , an MIT physicist who had been assigned to play chess in Germany with Hitler 's deputy , Rudolf Hess .

An alleged international arms dealer accused of arming militants from Iraq to Nicaragua for decades has been arrested on U.S. charges of conspiring to supply Colombian rebels with millions of dollars ’ worth of weapons , federal authorities said Friday .
Monzer Kassar of Marbella , Spain , and codefendants Tareq Mousa Ghazi and Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy were arrested Thursday as they prepared to complete a transaction to pay for the weapons , federal officials said .
The arms were headed to the FARC , the Spanish acronym for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , according to a federal indictment unsealed Friday in New York .
The left - wing FARC is accused of killing thousands in Colombia in its decades - long battle with government and right - wing paramilitary forces .
The United States classifies it as a terrorist organization .

Between February 2006 and May 2007 , Kassar , Ghazi and Moreno agreed to sell thousands of machine guns , millions of rounds of ammunition , rocket - propelled grenade launchers and surface - to - air missile systems to the FARC , according to Michael J. Garcia , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York .
During a series of recorded telephone calls , e-mails and face - to - face meetings , the three men agreed to sell the weapons to two confidential sources working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , according to the indictment .
The two men were posing as FARC militants who claimed they wanted the weapons to attack U.S. helicopters conducting anti-drug and anti-terrorism missions in Colombia , the indictment said .
Authorities arrested the suspects before any weapons could be shipped , and said their capture capped an undercover investigation that had been underway for several years .
Kassar , 61 , is believed to have amassed a fortune from arms dealing since the early 1970s .
His alleged trafficking in high - powered weapons has “ fueled the most violent conflicts of the last three decades , ” Garcia said at a news conference in New York .

He said Kassar had provided weapons and military equipment used in conflicts in Nicaragua , Brazil , Cyprus , Bosnia - Herzegovina , Croatia , Somalia , Iran and Iraq , and that he had sold weapons to organizations the U.S. government considers terrorist , including the Palestine Liberation Front .
“ He operates in the shadows , the silent partner behind the business of death and terror , ” DEA Administrator Karen P. Tandy said of Kassar .
Kassar , also known as Abu Munawar and “ El Taous , ” was arrested on the U.S. charges by Spanish authorities in Madrid , and Ghazi and Moreno were arrested in Romania .
The indictment alleges that Kassar , who is originally from Syria , developed an international network of criminal associates to carry out a weapons - trafficking business , including Ghazi , 60 , of Lebanon , and Moreno , 58 , of Marbella .
He also used front companies and bank accounts in Britain , Spain , Syria , Iraq , Poland , Bulgaria , Romania and other countries to carry out his business and disguise the illicit nature of his criminal proceeds , according to the indictment .

Kassar promised to provide the FARC with “ C4 explosives , as well as expert trainers from Lebanon to teach the FARC how to effectively use C4 and improvised explosive devices , ” the indictment and federal authorities alleged .
“ In addition , Kassar offered to send a thousand men to fight with the FARC against U.S. military officers in Colombia , ” Garcia said .
Kassar , Ghazi and Moreno were charged with four separate terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals , conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees , conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization , and conspiracy to acquire and use an antiaircraft missile .
Kassar and Moreno were also charged with money - laundering .
If convicted on all counts , the men face a sentence of life in prison without parole .

International research co-led by professor Alejandro Maiche , of the Department of Basic , Evolutionary and Educational Psychology at the UAB , has put forward the hypothesis that the brain responds to the possibility that two objects might collide , in a different way to how it would react to two objects in movement with divergent trajectories .
This conclusion comes from an experiment on a visual phenomenon , the Flash - lag effect ( FLE ) , which has shown that this effect increases when the visual system perceives two movements with convergent trajectories .
Visual perception requires a process ( from when the eye receives the information until the moment the brain " digests " it ) which , although it occurs in a very short space of time , means a delay between the moment when the events happen in reality and the moment when they are perceived .
This " retard " is not really a problem when we perceive static objects , but it may be important for our survival in some everyday situations in which we interact with objects in movement at high speed ( for example , when driving a car ) .
The brain seems to have implemented mechanisms whose aim is to compensate this retard , at least in the perception of stimuli in movement .
The Flash - lag effect ( FLE ) allows us to empirically test this difference in the time we in which we perceive static objects and objects in movement .
This is a perceptive phenomenon that causes a flash ( an object which only appears for a few milliseconds ) which appears on an object in continuous movement to be perceived behind the object .
A possible explanation would be that , in the case of the perception of objects in movement , our visual system tries to compensate for the inherent delay in the neuronal process of transmitting information .
How does it do so "
By projecting the movement of the object in the most probable way in order to try to " predict " its trajectory .
According to a study undertaken by researchers at the UAB , at the Universidad de la República ( Uruguay ) and at the Unité de Neurosciences Integratives et Computationnelles ( France ) , the Flash - lag effect increases when the flash is superimposed on an object in movement whose trajectory will presumably cause it to collide with another object in movement .
The researchers have made this discovery by means of an experiment , carried out at the UAB in which five individuals took part .
The result allows them top put forward the hypothesis that the brain responds to the possibility of collision between two objects differently to how it would react to two objects in movement with divergent trajectories .
This difference determines a greater Flash - lag effect in the situation of possible collision as has been observed .
The researchers put forward the hypothesis that the neuronal pre-activation which all movement causes ( that is the projection of the direction of movement made by the brain ) may be added to that of another mobile object with which it may collide due to the fact that both have convergent trajectories .
The sum of both pre-activations would result in a diminution of the time in which the movement is perceived , hence also causing an increase in the Flash - lag effect .
The days dwindle down to a precious few ... not .
It 's September , that magic month when the " Surge " was either going to show some real political and military results , or the Washington Punditocracy assured us the withdrawals would begin .
So what are they saying now ?
Behold ... and marvel .
The GAO says that Iraq is failing fifteen of eighteen benchmarks .
( That 's a test score of 17 out of a possible 100 , for the arithmetically inclined among you - and 70 or below is usually considered flunking . )
We 're empowering Shi'ite sheikhs to scour Al Anbar province while al Maliki cozies up to Iran .
But the response to this total political failure is not a bipartisan , Dave Broder - led call for withdrawal .
( Anyone surprised ? )
Instead , the call is for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in favor of Allawi - a move which renders the September date meaningless , and which was given bipartisan cover by Sens. Clinton and Levin .
Oh , it 's a long , long while from May to December , says the old Kurt Weill song , but the days grow short when you reach September .
What about the other measure of " Surge " success - the death rate ?
The LA Times writes :
Bombings , sectarian slayings and other violence related to the war killed at least 1,773 Iraqi civilians in August , the second month in a row that civilian deaths have risen , according to government figures obtained Friday .
Pretty clear , right ?
Seven - plus months into the Surge , violence is going up .
Obviously the Times reporter had n't received his spin memo , but it was a different story at the Associated press .
Here 's how the AP rigs the numbers :
A huge suicide attack in northern Iraq caused civilian deaths to rise slightly in August despite security gains elsewhere , making it the second deadliest month for Iraqis since the U.S. troop buildup began , figures compiled by The Associated Press showed Saturday ...
The August total included 520 people killed in quadruple suicide bombings near the Syrian border on Aug. 14 , the deadliest day since the war began in March 2003 ... U.S. deaths last month remained well below figures from last winter , when the U.S began dispatching 30,000 additional troops to Iraq .
Let 's list the deceptions this text throw our way , shall we ?
They imply that if not for those August 14 bombings the picture would be rosy : 520 in a country of 20 million ( and falling rapidly ) .
For them , that 's the equivalent of two or three 9/11's .
Should we forget about 9/11 , too ?
That aside , without Aug. 14 there would have been 1,289 deaths that month , less than July - but more than June .
They ignore seasonal variations in death rates :
We 've been through this before .
Death rates in an insurrection have seasonal variations , so comparing July to December is deceptive .
Kevin Drum has provided seasonally - adjusted figures to show just how bad the situation has become .
They ascribe all the changes in death rates to the " Surge , " when other factors are involved :
This is especially true of those " security gains elsewhere " the AP mentions .
They mean Al Anbar province , which is being " pacified " as the result of a Faustian bargain with tribal forces - a process that was underway before the Surge - and one that will have disastrous long - term political consequences .
More here .
The AP goes on to say that " American officials have maintained that violence is declining in Iraq in the run-up to a series of reports to Congress this month that will decide the course of the U.S. military presence here . "
Yeah , they do maintain that ... but the numbers says that violence is going up .
How 's a reporter going to maintain access with an inconvenient fact like that to report ?
You 've just seen how .
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame , the song says , one has n't got time for the waiting game .
But then , Kurt Weill was never a DC insider .
The " Surge " will continue .

Richard blogs at :
It 's been almost two years since I wrote this post comparing the approaches to presentation by Bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
Since PowerPoint 2007 has been out quite a while now I wondered if Bill Gates ' visuals and delivery have improved along with the software .
So I watched this entire Bill Gates presentation recently ( twice ) .
Now , I like Bill Gates a lot .
He 's a nice guy and he 's certainly a great philanthropist .
My friends at Microsoft tell me he 's a pleasure to talk to one - on - one .
I 'm sure that 's true , but mastering the large keynote presentation on stage still eludes him .
His keynotes are not terrible , they are just very average and unremarkable .
His style is " normal " and " typical " and his presentations are largely unmemorable as a result .
Bill Gates is a remarkable man , why can't his presentations be remarkable too ?
Every time Bill does one of these " PowerPoint presentations " he legitimizes and validates this tedious style of presenting with slides .
I am not suggesting that Bill Gates change his presentation style ( though I 'd pay my own way to Redmond and work for free to help Bill with his next presentation ) .
He 's been doing it " the Microsoft way " for a long time and the world keeps on spinning .
The point rather is that you and I cannot present like Bill under any circumstance .
I do n't care if you are pitching to investors or presenting a paper at a conference filled with stuffy , pedantic anthropologists , there is no excuse for tedium .
We can still learn a lot by examining the different approaches taken by Bill and Steve .
Bill needs to be stickier
Remember that the Heath brothers found that sticky messages have six key attributes in common : simplicity , unexpectedness , concreteness , credibility , emotions , and stories .
Bill has more credibility than you or I will ever have ; he 's one of the most famous people on the planet .
But his presentations are usually weak in the other five areas .
They are rarely simple ( though the topics are not overly complex ) , his visuals are cluttered , he speaks in abstractions with few if any surprises and little emotion ( Steve Ballmer , on the other hand , gets high marks for emotion VIDEO ) .
Bill & Steve redux
You may say that comparing Bill 's presentations and Steve 's keynotes is apples & oranges , that it 's not fair to compare Bill 's talk about technology trends to Steve 's product introductions .
If Bill were talking about the intricacies of insurance premiums and actuary tables , you may have a point .
But in this May 16th presentation by Bill Gates , the Microsoft chairman is talking about " technology megatrends that will shape the future of business and society . "
The audience included CEOs from top technology - related companies and the thousands watching on the webcast .
There is no reason that this talk about " the future " and " business " and " society " had to be a bullet - point filled snoozer .
( See more presentations by Bill Gates . )
Bill 's " voice " vs. Steve 's " voice "
Steve 's tone , pace , and the words he chooses all come together to make his " voice " conversational and natural .
Steve appears comfortable , smiles , and uses humor just the right amount .
He 's relaxed so the audience is relaxed .
Bill appears less comfortable and his speech is more vague and filled with abstractions .
Bill also uses more jargon and terms like " ... rich capabilities , " " rich fonts , " " ... working together in a rich way , " " ... use these tools in a rich way , " and " ... watching something rich like learning about an election . "
( See the rich transcripts of Bill 's May 16th CEO Summit 2007 .
Watch the webcast of Bill 's presentation . )
Bill 's slides vs. Steve 's slides
Both Steve and Bill use slides to complement their talks .
Steve 's visuals are a big part of his talk .
The visuals are necessary not decorative .
The visuals do not overpower him but they are an important component of the talk not just icing on the cake .
Steve uses the slides to help him tell a story and he interacts with them in a natural way , rarely turning his back on the audience ( monitors in front show the same onscreen image ) .
Steve uses the huge backlit screen behind him in the same spirit at least that George Lucas uses his screen : to help tell a story .
Lucas uses actors , visuals , and effects to convey his message , Steve uses visuals and his own words and natural presence to tell his story .
In Bill 's case the slides are not only of low aesthetic quality ( though this may be a matter of taste ) they simply do not really help Bill 's narrative very much .
It 's not the slides , it 's the way they are used
But the biggest difference is not the fact that Steve 's slides are simpler with fewer elements and fewer bullet points , the biggest difference is in the way they are used .
If you want to appreciate the difference you have to watch both presentations ( Steve , Bill ) .
The difference is that Steve 's slides flow smoothly with his talk .
Bill 's slides are n't really necessary ; they are more of an ornament or a decoration off to the side .
Bill would have been better off just pulling up a stool and sharing his ideas and then answering questions that audience members could have submitted before the talk so that Bill could select which ones he 'd answer .
Bill 's slides
Below are most of the slides Bill used in his CEO Summit presentation .
Steve 's slides
Below are just a few ( Steve uses far more slides ) of the slides Steve used in his August Special Event keynote on the Apple campus ( watch video ) .
If your ideas matter
Bill 's topic / subtopic bullet point style is very common , very bland , and rarely effective .
He can get away with it , but you and I can't .
I am not saying that solid presentation skills will make you successful , but do not dismiss remarkable presentation skills as something soft , fluffy , and superfluous .
Why aim to be successful in spite of your presentation skills ?
Why not allow your presentation skills to be an advantage that helps you make a difference and spread the word about your cause ?
If your ideas matter , then the presentation matters , right ?
You do n't have to use slideware for every presentation , but if you do the visuals should seem part of " the show " not something " over there " off to the side .
Looking for a photo of Bill
Speaking of Bill Gates , if anyone owns the rights to a high - rez image of Bill Gates presenting at Live or CES , etc .
I am still looking to get a Bill Gates image for the book .
( There are some good CC ones on Flickr , but my email inquiries seeking permissions have been met with silence -- I suspect people rarely check their Flickr email ? )
If you have an image that you took and would like to share please send me a note here with your terms and conditions .
Much appreciated !
St Luke 's Church has links to the Holy Grail story
Chisels and hammers were used to chip away at walls inside St Luke 's church in Hodnet , Shropshire .
The church has attracted many visitors including tourists from overseas after its links to the Holy Grail were featured in a book and website .
The Reverend Charmian Beech said : " They seemed to know what they were doing . "
A number of holes were chiselled into the stonework of the Grade I - listed 14th Century church in the nave , near the choir vestry door and by a stained glass window .
There is nothing really left to find at Hodnet Church , apart from God
The Reverend Charmian Beech
That window has helped fuel the church 's links to the Da Vinci Code because there is a feminine - looking St. John - one of the major themes of the best - selling novel by Dan Brown .
The Rev Beech said : " We are not sure what they were looking for .
" There is nothing really left to find at Hodnet Church , apart from God .
We are fed up with it . "
A stained glass window shows a feminine looking St John
The church also features strongly in The Chalice of Magdalene , written by " historical detective " Graham Phillips .
In it , his search for the Holy Grail leads him to St Luke 's and the stained glass window .
The story also features on the author 's website .
The Rev Beech said they had always welcomed visitors to the church , but would have to review security and may have to fit CCTV cameras .
Author Mr Phillips said of the vandalism : " I think it is disgraceful what has been done to the church .
" In my opinion whoever did it is not only despicable but stupid .
" There is no point anyone searching in Hodnet church because the cup that the stained - glass window code alluded to has already been found . "
Nothing was taken but the damage could cost thousands of pounds to repair .
Police are investigating .
R&D Magazine has sponsored the " Oscars of Inventions " for 45 years .
These research and design awards are coveted by government as well as private industry inventors .
The 100 winners selected by R&D Magazine for 2007 are stunning innovations - resourceful , effective , inspiring .
A significant portion of the 2007 awards are homeland security / military innovations ; others are environmental , health , and there 's even innovations for kids , like a must - have - Holiday - toy robot !
Here are my picks for the top 10 inventions from R & D Magazine 's list of the best of 2007 :
1. Air Conditioner That Controls Superbugs
The Kunne air conditioning system is the first of its kind to control heat and humidity at the same time , thereby helping to prevent " sick buildings , " those that make us sick just by visiting or working in them .
This system does not have a filter or anything else that may hold germs and is self - cleaning .
By Palm Beach R&D .
Hopefully , this system will be implemented by hospitals , so those with weak immunities can avoid the dreaded superbug as well .
2. No More Blood Tests !
Some of the 2007 awards have gone to inventions that seem just short of miraculous and the Electro Needle Biomedical Sensor Array comes close .
This is a small patch device with electro - chemically treated probes .
When the patch is applied to the skin , it has the ability to ascertain chemical readings present in a patient 's blood without having to withdraw any blood .
Thus , readings such as " carbohydrates , electrolytes , lipids , enzymes , toxins , proteins , viruses , and bacteria can be detected in a patient 's blood or interstitial cellular fluid . "
No more searching for " good " veins ?
You mean no more vials and vials and vials taken ?
One great step for medicine ; 15 great steps for the sick folks in the emergency room .
Developed by the Sandia National Laboratories .
3. Troops Can Detect Surrounding Chemicals
Chemical detection ability is extremely important t our troops , and this HAPSITE Viper Chemical Identification System uses infrared technology to improve the identification of toxic substances and chemical warfare agents ( CWA 's ) in the environment in a matter of a few minutes .
The Hapsite System that can be used inside a vehicle as well as in open space , is one thousand times more sensitive than NATO requirements for such a system , affording greater safety to troops and civilians in the area .
Inficon won an R&D environmental award for the system , just one of several detection devices made by the company .
4. Homeland Chemical Detection
Another environmental innovation in CWA technology , the Passive Millimeter - Wave Spectrometer for Remote Chemical Detection was developed by four scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois
This somewhat larger device can detect harmful nuclear waste from several miles away .
Focusing , let 's say , on a plume of smoke from a processing plant , the spectrometer can detect the levels of environmentally dangerous particles in the smoke .
For use in the U.S. , this system is seen to be a boost to Homeland Security efforts and one that may have several other applications in the future .

CURRENCIES are first and foremost relative prices — in essence , they are measures of the intrinsic value of one economy versus another .
On that basis , the world has had no compunction in writing down the value of the United States over the past several years .
The dollar , relative to the currencies of most of America ’s trading partners , is off about 20 percent from its early 2002 peak .
Recently it has hit new lows against the euro and a high - flying Canadian currency , likely a harbinger of more weakness to come .
Sadly , none of this is surprising .
Because Americans have n’t been saving in sufficient amounts , the United States must import surplus savings from abroad in order to grow .
And it has to run record balance of payments and trade deficits in order to attract that foreign capital .
The United States current account deficit — the broadest gauge of America ’s imbalance in relation to the rest of the world — hit a record 6.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2006 before receding slightly this year .
America must still attract some $ 3 billion of foreign capital each business day in order to keep its economy growing .
Economic science is very clear on the implications of such huge imbalances : foreign lenders need to be compensated for sending scarce capital to any country with a deficit .
The bigger the deficit , the greater the compensation .
The currency of the deficit nation usually bears the brunt of that compensation .
As long as the United States fails to address its saving problem , its large balance of payments deficit will persist and the dollar will keep dropping .
The only silver lining so far has been that these adjustments to the currency have been orderly — declines in the broad dollar index averaging a little less than 4 percent per year since early 2002 .
Now , however , the possibility of a disorderly correction is rising — with potentially grave consequences for the American and global economy .
WNBC catches Giuliani getting ' tripped up ' by 9/11 activist David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 30 , 2007 Print This Email This On Tuesday , members of a 911 truth activist group confronted former Mayor Rudy Giuliani at a New York fundraiser about the fall of the World Trade Center .
" How come people in the buildings were n't notified ? " asked one member of the group .
" And how can you sleep at night ? "
Giuliani's politely - phrased response , caught by WNBC newscameras filming the event , was " I did n't know that the towers were going to collapse . "
That response contradicts remarks the former New York City mayor made about being warned about the collapse during a phone interview with onetime ABC anchor Peter Jennings on September 11 , 2001 , as shown in a transcript WNBC obtained from the Giuliani 2008 campaign .
Giuliani told Jennings , " I -- I went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barkley Street , which was right there with the police commissioner , the fire commissioner , the head of emergency management , and we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse .
And it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building , so we were trapped in the building for 10 , 15 minutes , and finally found an exit and got out , walked north , and took a lot of people with us . "
The following video from We Are Change and Infowars.com juxtaposes the two quotes .
Nicola Collinson 's actions were describes as sadistic
Nicola Collinson , 21 , from Gateshead , was filmed attacking the young black and white cat in a street in January .
She earlier pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the animal and was sentenced at Gosforth Magistrates ' Court in Newcastle on Monday .
She was given a 12 - month supervision order , and a six - month night - time curfew on top of the lifetime ban .
' Laughing and joking '
Clive McKeag , prosecuting , described the offence as " totally sadistic " and " totally unprovoked " .
The video , captured on a mobile phone camera , showed Collinson and a 16 - year - old female accomplice , who can not be named for legal reasons , laughing as they repeatedly kick and punch the cat , chasing after it when it attempted to escape .
Mr McKeag said : " These images speak volumes .
The fact that they are carrying out these actions laughing and joking , and treating it as amusement , is an awful sight to see . "
Collinson , of Parkside Avenue , Gateshead , was also ordered to pay court costs of £ 420 to the RSPCA .
The occupants of the camp cannot leave the camp for any reason .

I 'm extremely depressed to report that things seem to only be getting sadder concerning the people so devastatingly affected by Katrina last week .
Two car loads of us headed over to Falls Creek , a youth camp for Southern Baptist churches in Oklahoma that agreed to have its facilities used to house Louisiana refugees .
I 'm afraid the camp is not going to be used as the kind people of the churches who own the cabins believe it was going to be used .
Jesse Jackson was right when he said " refugees " was not the appropriate word for the poor souls dislocated due to Katrina .
But he was wrong about why it is not appropriate .
It 's not appropriate because they are detainees , not refugees .
Falls
Creek is like a small town that is closed down about 9 months out of the year .
It is made up of cabins that range from small and humble to large and grandiose , according to how much money the church who owns the cabin has .
Each cabin has full kitchen facilities , bathrooms and usually have two large bunkrooms - one for women and one for men .
The occupancy of the cabins varies according to the church .
This past week the Southern Baptist association of Oklahoma offered the facility as a place to house refugees from the Katrina disaster .
Each church owning a cabin was then called to find out if they would make their cabin available .
Churches across the state agreed .
I started my journey by loading six large trash bags full of clothes in the back of my beetle buggy .
I then went to the local Dollar General and purchased various hygiene products , snacks and even a set of dominoes and a deck of cards .
I had my daughter take her own shopping cart and go and select her own items that she wanted to take .
I told her to imagine herself without anything in the world and then select what she would need to live every day .
We then met up with my elderly parents who had gone to the Dollar Store themselves , and to the grocery store and had spent WAY too much of their limited social security on the venture .
But that 's okay .
We ended up having to take both vehicles on the 150 mile round trip because they were both pretty full .
My son showed up and wanted to go .
He drove my parents while my daughter and I rode in my car .
To say we all left with excitement would be appropriate .
My 78 year old mother is a " fixer " .
She loves to help people and she absolutely needs some one to dote over .
That she was about to be able to help some people who had lost all in their lives had her feeling physically healthier than I 've seen her in days .
I was glad to get the chance to actively do something other than donate what little I can to some faceless charity hoping it would get to the people who needed it .
I felt glad I could do some small something that might cut through the helplessness I 've felt over this situation .
Both of my kids were eager to assist .
The only odd thing that occurred prior to setting off happened while I was gassing up in our small town .
My daughter was pumping the gas and a lady she knew pulled up to an adjacent pump .
My daughter started telling her where we were going and that we were taking things to the refugees .
The lady told my daughter that she had been told the Red Cross was not allowing any one to deliver supplies .
When I returned to the car from paying for the gas my daughter informed of this .
I told her that the Red Cross would not be preventing the members of our church from entering our own cabin , so it really did n't matter .
It was at that point we decided to stop back by the house and get my daughter 's camera so that she could take pictures if required .
From the moment I heard about Falls Creek being scheduled to receive refugees I had two thoughts run through my mind : 1 . What a beautiful place to be able to stay while trying to get your life back in order .
2 .
What a terrible location to be when you 're trying to get your life back in order .
The first thought is because Falls Creek is nestled in the Arbuckle Mountains of south central Oklahoma .
One of the more beautiful regions of the state .
It would be a peaceful and beautiful place to try to start mending emotionally , and begin to figure what you 're going to do next .
The second thought comes because Falls Creek is very secluded and absolutely no where near a population center .
The closest route from Falls Creek to a connecting road is three miles on a winding narrow road called " High Road " ( It gets that name for two reasons - it 's goes over the mountain instead of around it like " Low Road " does , and it's where the teenagers of the area go to party ) .
The road has not a single home on it for over 3 miles .
After battling that 3 miles over mountains , you 'll find yourself about 5 miles from the nearest town , Davis , Oklahoma , population ca. 2000 .
This is no place to start a new life .
A few pictures headed toward Falls Creek over High Road to give you a feel of the seclusion .
All of sudden the landscape changed from picturesque mountainous rural America , to something foreign to me as we approached the rear gate of the camp .
Two Oklahoma State Patrol vehicles and four Oklahoma Troopers guarded the gate .
We started through and they stopped us .
" Can I help you , ma'am ?
" I informed him we 're here to deliver supplies to * our church 's name * cabin .
He stood silent and stared at me .
My daughter turned and snapped a picture of his vehicle - very conspicuously .
I smiled at him and he asked , " Do you know where that cabin is located ?
" I informed him I did .
He looked at me a bit longer and then said , " Ok " and stepped away from the car .
They stopped my parents ' vehicle as well , but I assume my son informed them he was with us .
They let them pass .
We made our way through the narrow streets toward our church 's cabin .
We noticed that the various church cabins had numbered placards on them that normally were n't there .
We arrived at our cabin and started toting the clothes in .
We finally found a group of men upstairs in the dorms trying to do something alien to them - make beds .
They had almost completed the room of bunk beds and told us we could go over to the ladies ' dorm room and start on it .
We lugged our sacks of clothes back down the stairs .
Then we got the first negative message .
" You can't bring any clothes in .
FEMA has stated they will accept no more clothes .
They 've had 30 people sorting clothes for days .
They do n't want anymore . "
My mind could n't help but go back over the news articles that have accused FEMA of refusing water in to Jefferson Parrish , or turning fuel away .
We lugged the bags of clothes back to the car .
We then turned to bringing in our personal hygiene products .
That 's when we learned our cabin had been designated a " male only " cabin .
Approximately 40 men , ranging from age 13 on up would be housed there .
We started resacking the female products and sorted out everything that would be useful for men .
We lugged the bags of female products back to the car .
We asked if they knew of a cabin that had been designated for women .
The " host " ( the hosts are Oklahoma civilians who have been employeed ??? by FEMA to reside at each cabin and have already gone through at least one " orientation " meeting conducted by FEMA at " BASE " which is some unknown but repetitively referred location within the camp ) told us he believed McAlester cabin was dedicated to females .
He then explained there were male , female and family cabins designated .
We then started lugging in our food products .
The foods I had purchased were mainly snacks , but my mother - God bless her soul - had gone all out with fresh vegetables , fruits , canned goods , breakfast cereals , rice , and pancake fixings .
That 's when we got the next message :
They will not be able to use the kitchen .
Excuse me ?
I asked incredulously .
FEMA will not allow any of the kitchen facilities in any of the cabins to be used by the occupants due to fire hazards .
FEMA will deliver meals to the cabins .
The refugees will be given two meals per day by FEMA .
They will not be able to cook .
In fact , the " host " goes on to explain , some churches had already enquired about whether they could come in on weekends and fix meals for the people staying in their cabin .
FEMA wo n't allow it because there could be a situation where one cabin gets steaks and another gets hot dogs - and ... it could cause a riot .
It gets worse .
He then precedes to tell us that some churches had already enquired into whether they could send a van or bus on Sundays to pick up any occupants of their cabins who might be interested in attending church .
FEMA will not allow this .
If they leave the camp they may never return .
They will be issued FEMA identification cards and " a sum of money " and they will remain within the camp forMy son looks at me and mumbles " Welcome to Krakow .
" My mother then asked if the churches would be allowed to come to their cabin and conduct services if the occupants wanted to attend .
The response was " No ma'am .
You do n't understand .
Your church no longer owns this building .
This building is now owned by FEMA and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol .
They have it for the next 5 months . "
This scares my mother who asks " Do you mean they have leased it ? "
The man replies , " Yes , ma'am ... lock , stock and barrel .
They have taken over everything that pertains to this facility for the next 5 months .
" We then lug all food products requiring cooking back to the car .
We start unloading our snacks .
Mom appeared to have cornered the market in five counties on pop-tarts and apparently that was an acceptable snack so the guy started shoving them under the counter .
He said these would be good to tied people over in between their two meals a day .
But he tells my mother she must take all the breakfast cereal back .
My mother protests that cereal requires no cooking .
" There will be no milk , ma'am . "
My mother points to the huge industrial double - wide refrigerator the church had just purchased in the past year .
" Ma'am , you do n't understand ... It could cause a riot .
" He then points to the vegetables and fruit .
" You 'll have to take that back as well .
It looks like you 've got about 10 apples there .
I 'm about to bring in 40 men .
What would we do then ?
" My mother , in her sweet , soft voice says , " Quarter them ? "
" No ma'am .
FEMA said no ... It could cause a riot .
You do n't understand the type of people that are about to come here ....
" I turn and walk out of the room ... lugging all the healthy stuff back to the car .
My son later tells me the man went on to say " We 've already been told of teenage girls delivering fetuses on buses . "
My son steps toward him and says " That 's because they 've almost been starved to death , have n't had a decent place to get a good night 's sleep , and their bodies can't keep a baby alive .
I 'm not sure that 's any evidence some one should be using to show these are ' bad people ' .
" We then went to the second dorm room and made up beds .
When we got through and were headed outside the host says to me and my daughter , " How did you get in here ? "
I told him we came in through the back gate .
He replies , " No , HOW did you get in here ?
No one who does n't have credentials showing is supposed to be in here . "
( I had noticed all the " hosts " had two or three badges hanging around their necks . )
I told him it might have had something to do with the fact my daughter was snapping pictures of the OHP presence at the gate .
He then tells us , " Well , starting in the morning NO ONE comes in .
So if you have further goods you want to donate you will have to take them to your local church .
They will collect them until they have a full load and then bring them to the front gate .
" Me and my two kids then walked over the hill to the camp 's amphitheater .
First - just another OHP car ...
The amphitheater is full of clothes ( but I 'm not sure I 'm seeing enough for 5000 people for 5 months ) .
But there was more ... an Oklahoma Department of Safety truck and a military vehicle ... and a cell phone tower ( which fretling did n't get a pic of ... grrr ) .
Falls Creek , because it sits in a " bowl " surrounded by mountains , is notorious for no cell phone coverage .
There were buses coming in the front gate at about a rate of 1 every 2 or 3 minutes .
We could hear them below us as we walked back up the hill .
We could also see their white tops through the trees .
We figured these were busloads of refugees arriving , but we never saw these buses in the camps , nor were any refugees visible at the camp while we were there .
We then loaded back into our vehicles and headed toward the cabin we had been told was for women so that we could off - load our appropriate products .
When we arrived there was no one in the cabin so we preceded to unload our vehicles and take the merchandise in to the cabin .
A horde of " hosts " who had been hovering at a nearby cabin head toward us .
" Can we help you ?
" I explained to them what we were doing .
" Uhh ... you can't just leave donated goods in the cabins .
FEMA has stated they want all supplies to go to their central warehouse .
They said they have had far too many supplies come in and they need to handle them .
You can't leave ANY clothes .
" I just stared at them .
One chubby - checker , after several moments of pregnant pause broken only by the sound of my 82 year old dad continuing to shuffle boxes out of the back of his car ( GO DAD ! ) , says " I 'll call " BASE " and confirm what should happen here .
" I continue to stare .
He pounds out the number on his cell phone and when some one picks up he chickens out and just asks " I need to verify that cabin 11 is a female only facility . "
When he hangs up he says that it is and I respond , " Well , good , we 'll get on with this then . "
It 's at that point my son pulls me aside and says , " Every damned one of them have the same phone .
That 's what the comm tower is for at the amphitheater .
Now we know how FEMA runs through billions , they 've given every one of these people a Cingular phone when walkie - talkies would have worked just fine .
" We off - load our goods into the McAlester cabin .
Fretling takes pics of the buckets of toys that have been donated by citizens for the kiddos coming this way .
And a dorm room :
We then start out of the camp .
I tell my daughter I want to go out the main gate this time .
Here is what we saw on the way out : Just another OHP car ... This cabin was apparently commandeered by a group of people in navy blue jumpsuits with insignias all over them .
You can see them in the left side of this pic .
But they were standing all over the place on both sides of the narrow street .
This is just one OHP car in a long line of them parked along the side of the street .
Three firetrucks parked along the river .
Talk about a surreal moment ... troops ( unknown if Regular or National Guard ) have taken up residency in the Durant First Baptist Church cabin very near the main gate of the camp .
Two things to point out in the pictures above ... we passed a row of about 6 or 8 ambulances parked in the street just in front of the troop cabin , and the large tent on the top of the hill ... we have no idea what that is for .
Main gate completely blocked by OHP vehicles as we approach : More OHP vehicles parked at the rear gate as we pass by : Now I 'm starting to understand why it does n't matter that this location is not conducive to starting a new life .

Hot on the heels of reports that calorie restriction slows immunological aging comes this theoretically motivated suggestion that expressing telomerase in T cells might delay senescence in immune cells themselves .
From a UCLA ‘s Rita Effros :
Cells of the immune system are unique among normal somatic cells in that they have the capacity to upregulate the telomere - extending enzyme , telomerase , albeit in a precisely controlled fashion .
Kinetic analysis of telomerase activity in long - term T cell cultures has documented that the high level of telomerase induced in concert with activation reaches a peak at 3 – 5 days , then declines by 3 weeks .
The process is recapitulated during secondary antigenic stimulation , but by the third , and all subsequent stimulations in vitro , CD8 T cells are unable to upregulate telomerase .
Cell division in the absence of telomerase activity results in progressive telomere shortening , and ultimately , the DNA damage / cell cycle arrest that is signaled by critically short telomeres .
Cultures of senescent CD8 T cells show altered cytokine patterns , resistance to apoptosis , and absence of expression of the CD28 costimulatory receptor .
CD8
T cells with these and other features of replicative senescence accumulate progressively with age , and at an accelerated rate , during chronic infection with HIV - 1 .
Clinical studies have shown that high proportions of CD8 T cells with the senescent phenotype correlate with several deleterious physiologic outcomes , including poor vaccine responses , bone loss , and increased proinflammatory cytokines .
CD8 +CD28– T cells have also been shown to exert suppressive activity on other immune cells .
Based on the central role of telomere shortening in the replicative senescence program , we are developing several telomerase - based approaches as potential immunoenhancing treatments for aging and HIV disease .
Gene therapy of HIV - specific CD8
T cells with the telomerase catalytic component ( hTERT ) results in enhanced proliferative capacity , increased anti-viral functions , and a delay in the loss of CD28 expression , with no changes in karyotype or growth kinetics .
These proof - of - principle studies have led to screening for pharmacological approaches that might mimic the gene therapy effects , in a more clinically suitable formulation .
Lymphocytes are particularly attractive targets for gene therapy because they can be removed from the body via extraction of blood ( a relatively non-invasive technique , as invasive techniques go ) , propagated in culture , and even positively selected for successful genetic modification — this last point being particularly easy in this case , since telomerase - positive cells do n’t have a built - in limit on the number of divisions they can undergo .
The clinical ramifications of the strategy are clear , not only for the treatment of specific diseases ( in the work here , the author focused on HIV - reactive CD8 + alternative pathway .
Hence , giving telomerase to cells removes one roadblock on the path to full - blown neoplasia .
Does we really want our blood crawling with lymphocytes that are all one step closer to oncogenic transformation ?
On the other hand , telomerase expression is just one of the roadblocks ; there are many more .
And there are tissues of the body that express telomerase throughout the lifespan but are not riddled with tumors , i.e. , the germ line .
So while more study is clearly required before this enters the clinic , I ’d count Dr. Effros ’ suggestion as one with considerable promise .
BECCLES , England —
This winter a 50 - foot - wide strip of Roger Middleditch ’s sugar - beet field fell into the North Sea , his rich East Anglian lands reduced by a large fraction of their acreage .
The adjacent potato field , once 23 acres , is now less than 3 — too small to plant at all , he said .
Each spring Mr. Middleditch , a tenant farmer on the vast Benacre Estate here , meets with its managers to recalculate his rent , depending on how much land has been eaten up by encroaching water .
As he stood in a muddy field by the roaring sea recently , he tried to estimate how close he dared to plant this season .
“ We ’ve lost so much these last few years , ” he said .
“ You plant , and by harvest it ’s fallen into the water . ”
Coastal erosion has been a fact of life here for a century , because the land under East Anglia is slowly sinking .
But the erosion has never been as quick and cataclysmic as it has been in recent years , an effect of climate change and global warming , many scientists say .
To make matters worse for coastal farmers , the government has stopped maintaining large parts of the network of seawalls that once protected the area .
What Is Noise Pollution ?
Noise pollution is human - created sound that has the effect of being annoying , distracting , painful , or physically harmful .
It is a public health issue that is adversely affecting the lives of millions of people throughout the world .
People continuously exposed to noise experience elevated stress levels , mood swings , lost sleep , diminished productivity , hypertension , depression , and hearing loss .
In children , it results in slowed learning .

A graduate student watches a Plasmoid Thruster Experiment on the campus of The University of Alabama in Huntsville .
Graduate students and faculty researchers at The University of Alabama in Huntsville are investigating propulsion concepts that could eventually revolutionize deep space travel .
The Plasmoid Thruster Experiment ( PTX ) is a stepping stone to a highly efficient propulsion concept which could ultimately change how we travel in space , according to Dr. Jason Cassibry , a researcher in UAH ’s Propulsion Research Center .
“ Larger , more powerful versions can produce fusion for both power and space propulsion , allowing human travel to the outer planets , ” he said .
Few groups around the country are working on this emerging technology , according to Cassibry .
UAH is among that small number of research institutions .
The experimental branch of the Propulsion Research Center ’s pulsed plasma research group is focused on gathering experimental data from PTX , which was originally built at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center .
MSFC donated the equipment to UAH last year .
The purpose of the PTX is to investigate the fundamental plasma and acceleration properties of a small - scale , pulsed plasma thruster .
PTX works by ringing a single turn conical theta pinch coil at about 500 kHz , ionizing and accelerating a small quantity of gas .
The magnetic field inside the coil creates a plasmoid , a plasma that has a closed magnetic field structure .
One of the biggest challenges in any electric propulsion concept is increasing the lifetime of the thruster , which must run continuously for several years for deep space missions .
Most electric propulsion concepts use plasma , which is in contact with electrodes or acceleration grids , causing erosion of the components and limiting the lifetime of the thruster .
The plasmoid thruster potentially has a much longer lifetime , because the plasma is formed inductively , which means that the plasma is not in contact with the thruster components .
UAH researchers ran system tests and calibrations in October , and today the equipment is at full capacity .
In the short term , PTX will continue to take data in support of the ongoing development of the numerical models .
This will be accomplished by using a laser interferometer to measure the plasma density .
Also , magnetic field measurements help to determine size of the plasmoid .
Together , these diagnostics provide a lot of information without affecting the plasmoid itself , according to Cassibry .
In the long term , the PTX experiment will be expanded by varying the coil geometry , adding bias flux and changing the initial conditions to study the effect on the coupling efficiency between the primary coil current and the secondary current in the plasmoid in an effort to improve plasma acceleration and thrust .
“ Our experimental pulsed plasma group is keeping a watchful eye on the field of plasma science , ” Cassibry said .
“ We believe that we now have the means and the ability to support further scientific developments in this field . ”

Reading through the Kyl - Lieberman amendment ( hat tip Laura Rozen ) , you 'd think that the Ryan - Crocker dog and pony show was designed to justify war on Iran .
And you might be right .
The amendment cites four Petraeus statements about Iranian influence in Iraq and four Crocker statements .
And intersperses those with cherry - picked citations to create the illusion that Iran is the only outside force causing trouble in Iran .
For example , when they cite Ahmadinejad talking about the vacuum US failure will leave in Iraq ...
" The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly , " Mr Ahmadinejad said at a press conference in Tehran .
" Soon , we will see a huge power vacuum in the region .
Of course , we are prepared to fill the gap ,
They neglect to mention that Ahmadinejad nods to Saudi Arabia and Iraq in his statement ...
... with the help of neighbours and regional friends like Saudi Arabia , and with the help of the Iraqi nation . "
( A detail that even Fox managed to include . )
And when they cite from the NIE 's list of neighboring countries likely to make trouble in Iraq ...
Remember how Fox News and its apologists ( even in Democratic circles ) moaned about charges that they were a propaganda outlet for the Republican Party ?
From Crooks and Liars :
This is the network that so many Democrats are so eager to validate and legitimize .
And to think that the CBC is still considering doing a debate with Fox ...

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Few stories have touched CNN.com users like that of 5 - year - old Youssif , an Iraqi boy who had gone out to play on a January day when he was suddenly grabbed by masked men , doused in gas and set on fire .
Youssif was known for his bright smile before he was attacked by masked men.

CNN.com users responded by the thousands to the story asking how they could help .
But there were tricky and difficult issues the family had to suddenly confront , as several aid organizations quickly offered their services .
Specifically , the family had to make a decision on whether to leave their homeland or stay inside Iraq for treatment .
If they chose to leave , could they get visas to travel to the United States or leave Iraq safely ?
Further complicating matters is the fact that few aid organizations remain in Iraq ; most moved out months ago due to the constant threat of being targeted .
Leaving one 's homeland is never an easy choice to make , even during war .
But the family has decided Youssif should seek treatment in the United States .
The Children 's Burn Foundation -- a non-profit organization based out of Sherman Oaks , California , that provides support for burn victims locally , nationally and internationally -- has agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund so you can donate .

Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him .
Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman , a plastic surgeon with the affiliated - Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif 's cause .
Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for his travels .
Youssif could be in the United States for up to a year for the various treatments he needs .
You can make a donation at the foundation 's site by clicking here .
There 's a drop down menu under the " general donation " area that is marked " Youssif 's fund . "
When informed of the news in Baghdad , Youssif ran around his house , saying , " Daddy , daddy , am I really going to get on a plane ? ! "
Youssif 's father was also cheered by the news .
" I feel like I am going to fly from happiness , " his father told CNN's Arwa Damon , who reported the story on what happened to Youssif .
Barbara Friedman , executive director of the Children 's Burn Foundation , said she and others at the foundation were deeply moved when they first read the piece .
" In terms of a personal reaction , the only thing I could say is it takes your breath away -- because it 's just so unfathomable , that that kind of brutality and violence was undertaken in a premeditated way against a defenseless child , " she told CNN.com .
" From the foundation 's perspective , our immediate reaction was : Can we help ?
How can we help ?
We want to help .
This is what we do . "
Many of you had the same reaction .
" This kind of thing breaks my heart , " wrote CNN.com user Jessica Allen .
" To see that smiling adorable face before that day that he was so brutally attacked is enough to make you cry .
How could someone do this to anyone , let alone a child ? "
Others pleaded for CNN to act .
" CNN , if you put this on for us to read , then you should allow us to donate , " wrote Brian Quinn .
The story -- published and broadcast on Wednesday -- has been one of the most - read , non-breaking news stories in CNN.
com 's 12 - year history .
" We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support for Youssif and his family , and are grateful that the Children 's Burn Foundation and the Grossman Burn Center have volunteered to help , " said Mitch Gelman , CNN. com 's senior vice president and senior executive producer .
" It is heart - warming and restorative to see such generosity and goodness emerging from this truly unspeakable horror . "

Chemical engineers have discovered a fundamental flaw in the conventional view of how liquids form bubbles that grow and turn into vapors , which takes place in everything from industrial processes to fizzing champagne .
The findings cast into doubt some aspects of a theory dating back to the 1920s that attempts to describe the underlying molecular mechanism behind a phenomenon called " homogeneous nucleation , " said David S. Corti , an associate professor of chemical engineering at Purdue University .
The research could lead to a more precise understanding of the " phase transition " that takes place when bubbles form , grow and then become a vapor , which could , in turn , have implications for industry and research , Corti said .
In the conventional view , a liquid boiling and turning into a vapor takes place in a systematic process known as " nucleation and growth . "
The liquid first forms tiny " nuclei , " or microscopic bubbles , that eventually grow as they pick up particles like a snowball gaining size as it rolls down a hillside .
This conventional view is described by " classical nucleation theory , " which was originally proposed in the 1920s .
" Our findings indicate that this is not what 's going on , " Corti said .
" The bubble grows via a mechanism very different from classical nucleation theory . "
Findings are detailed in a research paper appearing online this month in the journal Physical Review Letters .
The paper was written by Corti and chemical engineering doctoral student Mark Uline .
As water is heated in a pot on a stovetop , it begins boiling when the temperature reaches 100 degrees Celsius , or 212 degrees Fahrenheit .
" You get little microscopic bubbles that form on the surfaces of the pot , " Corti said .
This bubble formation on a surface is called heterogeneous nucleation .
Bubbles also may form , however , by homogeneous nucleation , in which they appear not on surfaces , but within the liquid itself .
The new findings specifically apply to homogeneous nucleation .
" A common example is when you heat water in a microwave oven , " Corti said .
" It heats liquid from the inside as opposed to on the surface , so you can actually raise the temperature of the water above 100 degrees Celsius and it does n't boil .
Sometimes when you microwave water in a mug you can superheat it and , if you put a spoon in there after removing it from the microwave , you introduce nucleation sites and it boils off and sprays hot water .
The transition happens rapidly , causing a vapor explosion . "
The conventional nucleation theory uses the same mechanism for how liquid droplets condense from a vapor in attempts to describe how bubbles form in a liquid .
The Purdue researchers found , however , that bubbles do not form by the same mechanism as condensing droplets , Corti said .
According to the conventional theory , the pathway going from a liquid to a vapor is narrow , strictly defining the molecular mechanism by which the liquid becomes a vapor .
" You could think of this pathway as a mountain pass , " Corti said .
" In order to get from the liquid to the vapor , you have to go over this mountain pass .
If you climb up and you 're not quite at the top , sometimes you can roll back down , but if you get to the top , you can roll down to the other side and get to the vapor phase . "
The new research has shown that this metaphorical mountain pass is actually more broad and flat than previously thought , meaning there are several possible pathways responsible for the phase transition .
" At the same time , what we found is that once you get over this mountain pass , which is called the free energy surface of bubble formation , the surface disappears , " Corti said .
" You look at one side and you see the mountain and think everything is OK , but once you climb over , it 's as if the mountain disappears on the other side . "
In the conventional view , the forming bubbles moving down the mountain pass could , in principle , reverse direction back toward the liquid phase .
" But in our view , as soon as you get over the top of the mountain , the mountain disappears , " Corti said .
" You have no choice but to plummet to something else , the vapor phase . "
The findings were based on research using new theoretical methods and verified by computational simulations developed by the Purdue engineers .
Nucleation occurs when a liquid is heated above its boiling temperature or when the pressure exerted on a liquid is decreased below the so - called saturation pressure , which is the case when the lid is removed from the bottle of a carbonated beverage such as champagne , beer or a soft drink .
" This also occurs in the chemical industry and in other work environments where liquids flow through pipes , sometimes with undesirable consequences , " Corti said .
" Depending on the diameter of the pipes , the pressure of the liquid can drop very rapidly , causing it to become superheated , and before the pressure recovers you can get this phase transition . "
The bubbles that form can then collapse when the pressure increases again , sometimes causing significant damage to equipment .
In other industrial processes involving propeller blades , bubbles can form or undergo " cavitation " and then suddenly implode , producing high temperatures and extreme pressures and damaging equipment .
" There are tons of examples , but the real fundamental mechanism underlying what 's going on is not that well understood , even for very simple systems , " Corti said .
New insights into phase transition could translate into practical and safety benefits for industry .
Such insights also could result in a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for initiating " sonochemistry " and " sonoluminescence " processes in which sound waves are used to form tiny bubbles in liquids .
As the bubbles collapse , they emit flashes of light and generate high pressures and temperatures that could be used to enhance chemical reactions .
Another potential practical benefit is to improve the manufacture of foams made of plastic polymers that depends on the formation and distribution of bubbles .
Although the new findings indicate current theory does not adequately describe the molecular mechanism for bubble formation and phase transition from a liquid to vapor , the Purdue researchers do not yet know precisely what that mechanism is .
" We are still working out the full implications of this ourselves , " Corti said .

Sort time ago , a blogger rather cleverly embedded a C - like imperative language as a DSL in Haskell .
He then implemented quicksort in this DSL and opined that no elegance had been gained .
Um ...
... yeah .
I guess there really is n't much to say about that .
This post is both an explanation of QuickSort in Haskell itself an a window into how I develop code .

Swap is only used in one place , but it should be in the standard library , so I 'm factoring it out anyway .
Now , the most important property of quicksort is the inner loop , in which elements less than the pivot are left at the front of the subarray and values greater than the pivot are moved to the end .
I ignore the optimization of tracking the values equal to the pivot , which avoids pathological behavior on simple inputs .
and , of course , when it ends , we want to properly return a middle index to swap the pivot back into .
Putting these together , however , results in a disappointingly long function which manages to be almost entirely duplication .
Fortunately , we can factor the common parts together .
Wikipedia has a simpler algorithm , though , and I 'll get back to it later .
Anyway , from here , we can sort .
And then , the housekeeping .
And quickCheck verifies that it does the right thing .
But it is n't pretty .
Much of Haskell 's nice properties come from giving up on mutation and mutable structures altogether .
None of what follows has been tested .
Wikipedia 's version is n't any shorter :
The real problem is with the entirely conventional array operations .
As long as the only available operations are the same , the algorithm obviously stays the same .
Better would be something involving aand some kind ofNothing spectacular .
The for loop already encodes performing a nondeterminate action to each element of an array .
Surely we can do better .
Sorts encode something specific , namely performing a swap on decreasing sections of an array .

Since 1991 , I ’ve been indexing and reviewing online resources .
Yes , that was before the web became popularized and long before Yahoo and others .
People needed a way to find the online support groups that existed at the time in the form of newsgroups and mailing lists , but you needed a fair amount of information to join one .
In 1995 , we began awarding Web awards to recognize those online resources that really stood out .
Flash forward 12 years later and a lot has changed .
We aim to give you the best of the best , so you know where to go when you need information , opinion , and support .
We ’re committed to doing a complete round of awards this time for all the major mental disorders and resources , starting with blogs .
With the invaluable assistance of Sandra Kiume , I present to you 2007 ’s Best of the Web – Blogs for bipolar disorder .
Please be aware , this list was made in 2007 and since that time , most of these blogs have been taken offline .
Here ’s a more updated list .
1. The Trouble with Spikol
A fantastic blog by the personable and candid Liz Spikol .
She posts frequently on bipolar news items culled from the mainstream media ( and reader contributions ) with a special interest in prison reform and related mental health legal issues .
A career journalist , she ’s got an instinctive affinity for the blog medium .
Maybe most importantly , her personal experience with bipolar provides a perspective some blogs lack .
The Trouble with Spikol takes a pragmatic view of mental health issues , looking at consumer activism as well as medical advances and humanizing it all .
Although the news items are sometimes grim , Liz infuses her blog with lightness , warmth and humour .
This blog no longer exists .
2. Furious Seasons
Depending on your perspective , Philip Dawdy is either a whistleblowing hero or provocative conspiracy theorist .
Whether inspiring or annoying , he ’s unquestionably a talented writer .
( He ’s done some terrific investigative blogging about Zyprexa , for example . )
With thinking and rethinking , it ’s likely you ’ll agree with some views and reject others , just as he does .
He discusses his own experience with bipolar disorder as well .
If you like to be challenged and are keen on good rants , this blog is tops .
Philip also has a good take on almost anything having to do with spotting incongruous arguments or behavior , and calling people or companies on it .
This blog no longer exists .
3. John McManamy ’s Share Posts
John is not only known for his writing on bipolar spectrum disorders research , he ’s received high honors for it .
This year he was awarded a Mogens Schou Award for Public Service , joining an exclusive and prestigious list of honorees that include professor of psychiatry , author , and bipolar overachiever Kay Redfield Jamison , family psychotherapy researcher David J. Miklowitz , and the Stanleys of the Stanley Foundation ( a major research funding source ) .
John does things a bit differently online .
Although he keeps a blog it ’s mostly relegated to personal stories and recipes while his most astute , well - researched writing is delivered in McManamy ’s Depression and Bipolar Weekly , a subscription - based email newsletter .
Eventually its articles become publicly archived at his static web site McMan ’s Depression and Bipolar Web .
He also wrote a great book that distilled a lot of that knowledge , Living Well With Depression and Bipolar Disorder .
The blog keeps everyone current what he ’s working on .
This blog no longer exists .
4. Time for Your Meds
A lesbian psychiatric nurse who has bipolar , “ Crazy Tracy ” depicts life from both sides of the gurney .
Her blog is personal , emotional and powerfully written .
With severe bipolar I , Tracy is often hospitalized or recovering from an episode .
Her descriptions of manic perceptions and depressive despair are harrowing and real .
Unusually ( at least in the blogosphere ) , she ’s a proponent of ECT , having undergone many courses of it .
5. DBSA President Sue Bergeson ’s Mental Health Blog
Exactly what it describes .
The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance ’s elected leader keeps a seldom - updated but informative blog with topics ranging from bipolar irritability to spirituality to research and community news .
It ’s not an especially personal blog , but she does infuse it with anecdotes that make her posts vivid and accessible .
This blog no longer exists .
6. Living the Scientific Life ( Scientist , Interrupted )
GrrlScientist is a molecular evolutionary biologist in New York City , a person with bipolar and a Ph.D. looking for work in zoology .
She chronicles her progress and struggles with hospitalization , career , survival and academia .
This is an acclaimed blog written with personality and doused with plenty of science ( and beautiful related photos ) .
This blog no longer exists .
7. Caught in my Burble
“ Your neighborhood misanthropic , buxom , bondage - positive , bipolar , bisexual , flying , loquacious hedonist . ”
She is trying to get a VNS implant , which is unusual since so far they ’ve only been used experimentally for treatment - resistant depression ( they are FDA - approved for epilepsy ) and not bipolar since it theoretically could trigger mania .
She writes descriptively about horrific depression , so it ’s easy to see why she ’s considering a VNS implant as an option .
The outcome should be interesting .
8. Been Broken
Very poetic and thoughtful .
It feels delicate but has an undercurrent of strength , which describes many people who have a bipolar disorder but few write this eloquently in a blog .
Blog made private .
9. Trick Cycling for Beginners
A bipolar junior psychiatrist in the UK .
Life seems pretty hectic .
Honorable mention : Anxiety , Addictions and Depression Treatments .
Not limited to bipolar disorders , and not written by a bipolar writer ( not overtly , at least ) .
It is , though , a good source of research news digested for consumers .
Blog made private .
Top Ten Bipolar Blogs
What is “ net neutrality ? ”
To borrow Senator Ted Stevens ’s infamous analogy of the Internet to a series of tubes , imagine a network of pipes connected by switching stations .
The width of a pipe ( bandwidth ) determines the volume of messages ( packets ) than can be sent through it .
Packets arriving at a switching station wait in a queue until they can be forwarded to their destination .
The pipe ’s diameter and the volume of traffic determines the total time ( latency ) that messages take to reach their destination .
Advocates of “ net neutrality ” argue against the right of the owners of the pipes ( Internet Service Providers ) to discriminate between different messages or to charge recipients of messages .
So for example , an ISP would not be able to favor telephone calls sent over the net over movie downloads , or charge Google extra for the traffic sent their way , or to block a business if it competes with their own services , or to block malicious or illegal websites .
Implementation of such regulations would require government surveillance of Internet traffic and FCC approval of new technologies and services which might violate “ neutrality . ”
Regulation stifles innovation
The limitations of the original Internet protocols became apparent as it transitioned from a monopoly network designed for government use to a competitive and decentralized marketplace .
One limitation is the lack of ability to prioritize certain kinds of traffic .
Different kinds of communications have different bandwidth requirements .
Watching movies over the web is bandwidth - intensive , but not time - critical .
Teleconferences are both bandwidth intensive and time critical .
Some applications like remote surgery and other time - critical services are simply impossible over the public Internet with current technology .
Advances in technology are beginning to allow traffic to be analyzed in the process of transmission , so certain traffic , such as real - time video can be prioritized , while other traffic such as file sharing or spam can be given a lower priority or dropped .
Along with dramatic increases in speed and performance , technological innovation is making entirely new kinds of services possible .
Net neutrality advocates want the government to regulate how ISP ’s may and may not route traffic .
Pressure groups such as consumer activist groups , major websites , small ISPs , and Internet backbone providers are fighting for controls that favor them .
Once the precedent of regulation is established , competition will shift to passing the most favorable legislation rather than providing the best technology and service .
Regulations breed more regulations
While communications technology has experienced exponential growth , heavily regulated and monopolized consumer phone and cable providers have been slower to improve services .
Consumers fed up with expensive cable and DSL services are demanding more government controls over the pricing and behavior of their ISP’s .
They argue that regulations are necessary because telecommunications companies receive monopoly privileges and other benefits from the government .
But the lesson they should learn is the opposite – regulations create the need for more regulations .
The solution is to abolish coercive monopolies for cable and phone service providers and allow free and open competition .
The Internet is possible because many private networks find it in their mutual self - interest to cooperate and share traffic loads .
When inequalities arise , networks compensate each other for the extra load .
“ Neutrality ” regulations force companies to act against their self - interest , inevitably leading them to complain to Congress to impose ever more detailed controls to maintain “ fairness . ”
The Internet is private property
The Internet is not public property .
Telecommunications companies have spent billions of dollars on network infrastructure all over the world .
They did so in the hope of selling communications services to customers willing to pay for them .
The government has no right to effectively nationalize ISP ’s by telling them how run their networks .
Proponents of a mixed economy like to invent hypothetical scenarios of ways companies could abuse customers .
It is true that a free society gives people the freedom to be stupid , wrong , and malicious .
The great thing about capitalism is that it also gives people the freedom for the most consumer - friendly business to win .
A regulated Internet takes away that freedom and turn it over to politicians and lobbyists .
History shows that most attempts to improve outcomes by regulating markets worsen the very problems they were intended to solve .
That is how the USA ended up with the current overpriced , monopolistic oligopoly providers .
Why do “ net neutrality ” advocates ridicule politicians for comparing the Internet to a “ series of tubes , ” and then trust them to regulate it ?
Real solutions to a better Internet
End local Internet monopolies which prevent small ISPs from being successful
Remove local and federal ( FCC ) regulations which prevent all but the most powerful corporations from providing telecom services
Allow ISPs to innovate in by forcing cities to open up their infrastructure without the threat that their business model will be nationalized or regulated out of existence .
Give capitalism and free markets a chance – America has already tried everything else

Federal district judge Dale A. Kimball issued a ruling on Friday declaring that Novell owns the UNIX copyrights .
Kimball 's ruling means that the end is near for SCO 's protracted litigation trainwreck , an epic assortment of lawsuits that have achieved infamy in the tech industry .
Judge Kimball finds that Novell never transferred ownership of the UNIX copyrights to SCO during or after a 1995 agreement between the two companies .
Judge Kimball 's ruling effectively ends SCO's " slander of title " lawsuit against Novell , which was based on SCO 's allegation that Novell had wrongfully claimed ownership of the UNIX copyrights .
Since Novell is the rightful owner of the UNIX copyrights , " there is no basis in the evidence before this court for finding that Novell 's public claims of ownership were a misappropriation or seizure of SCO 's property , " said Judge Kimball in his 102 - page ruling .
Confirmation of Novell 's ownership of the UNIX copyrights will also put an end to SCO 's lawsuit against IBM , in which SCO alleges that IBM infringed on UNIX copyrights by incorporating proprietary UNIX code into the open - source Linux operating system .
Judge Kimball has determined that , under the terms of Section 4.16 ( b ) of the 1995 Asset Purchase Agreement between the two companies , Novell has the authority to " direct SCO to waive its purported claims for breaches of [ UNIX ] license agreements with IBM and Sequent . "
An expensive mistake
In the original agreement between Novell and SCO , Novell retained ownership of all UNIX copyrights but granted SCO the ability to sell licenses to third parties .
As part of this arrangement , SCO agreed to give Novell all of the royalties generated through UNIX licensing minus a five percent administrative fee .
Judge Kimball has ruled that SCO owes Novell 95 percent of the royalties generated by the licensing of Novell 's UNIX copyrights .
The two most prominent SCO licensees are Microsoft and Sun , both of which develop operating systems that compete directly with Linux .
According to Judge Kimball 's ruling , Microsoft paid SCO approximately $ 16 million for license rights and Sun paid approximately $ 10 million .
SCO neglected to turn over the licensing fees to Novell , which " gave SCO its first profitable year in history , " Kimball notes .
" As a matter of law , the court concludes that SCO breached its fiduciary duties to Novell by failing to account for and remit the appropriate SVRX Royalty payments to Novell for the SVRX portions of the 2003 Sun and Microsoft Agreements , " says Kimball .
" Because of the decrease in SCO 's revenues and assets , Novell fears that it will be unable to collect on its claim for royalties . "
With the exception of the wrongfully - retained UNIX royalties from Microsoft and Sun , SCO has consistently lost money since the start of this entire affair .
Few options remain open for SCO , and a bankruptcy could be imminent .
Robert Provine wants me to see his Tickle Me Elmo doll .
Wants me to hold it , as a matter of fact .
A professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Maryland , he has been engaged for more than a decade in a wide - ranging intellectual pursuit that has taken him from the play of young chimpanzees to the history of American sitcoms — all in search of a scientific understanding of that most unscientific of human customs : laughter .
The Elmo doll happens to incorporate two of his primary obsessions : tickling and contagious laughter .
“ You ever fiddled with one of these ? ”
Provine asks , as he pulls the doll out of a small canvas tote bag .
He holds it up , and after a second or two , the doll begins to shriek with laughter .
There ’s something undeniably comic in the scene : a burly , bearded man in his midfifties cradling a red Muppet .
Provine hands Elmo to me .
“ It brings up two interesting things , ” he explains .
“ You have a toy that ’s a glorified laugh box .
And when it shakes , you ’re getting feedback as if you ’re tickling it . ”
( Elmo has been so popular that in September 2006 Fisher - Price released a tenth anniversary version of the doll , called Elmo T.M.X .
It not only laughs and vibrates but rolls on the ground pounding its fists , pleading for the supposed tickler to stop . )
Think about that Tickle Me Elmo doll .
We take it for granted that tickling causes laughter and that one person ’s laughter will easily “ infect ” other people within earshot .
Even a child knows these things .
( Tickling and contagious laughter are two of the distinguishing characteristics of childhood . )
But when you think about them from a distance , they are strange conventions .
We can understand readily enough why natural selection would have implanted the fight - or - flight response in us or endowed us with a sex drive .
But the tendency to laugh when others laugh in our presence or to laugh when someone strokes our belly with a feather — what ’s the evolutionary advantage of that ?
There is a long , semi-illustrious history of scholarly investigation into the nature of humor , from Freud ’s Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious , which may well be the least funny book about humor ever written , to a British research group who claimed they had determined the world ’s funniest joke .
Despite the fact that the researchers sampled a massive international audience in making this judgment , the winning joke revolved around New Jersey residents :
A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods when one of them falls to the ground .
He does n’t seem to be breathing ; his eyes are rolled back in his head .
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency service .
He gasps to the operator : “ My friend is dead !
What can I do ? ”
The operator says : “ Take it easy .
I can help .
First , let ’s make sure he ’s dead . ”
There is silence , then a shot is heard .
The guy ’s voice comes back on the line .
He says , “ OK , now what ? ”
This joke illustrates the notion of controlled incongruity :
You ’re expecting x , and you get y .
In the hunting joke there are two plausible ways to interpret the 911 operator ’s instructions — either the hunter should check his friend ’s pulse , or he should shoot him .
The context sets you up to expect that he ’ll check his friend ’s pulse , so the — admittedly dark — humor arrives when he takes the more unlikely path .
That incongruity has limits , of course :
If the hunter chooses to do something utterly nonsensical — untie his shoelaces , say , or climb a tree — the joke would n’t be funny .
When Provine set out to study laughter , he imagined that he would approach the problem along the lines of these humor studies : having people listen to jokes and other witticisms and then watching what happened .
He began by simply observing casual conversations , counting the number of times that people laughed while listening to someone speaking .
But very quickly he realized that there was a fundamental flaw in his assumptions about how laughter worked .
“ I started recording all these conversations , ” Provine says , “ and the numbers I was getting — I did n’t believe them when I saw them .
The speakers were laughing more than the listeners .
Every time that would happen , I would think , ‘ OK , I have to go back and start over again because that ca n’t be right . ’ ”
Psychologist Robert Provine .

Speakers , it turned out , were 46 percent more likely to laugh than listeners — and what they were laughing at , more often than not , was n’t remotely funny .
When Provine and his team of undergrads recorded the ostensible “ punch lines ” that triggered laughing in ordinary conversation , they found that only about 15 percent could be called humorous .
In his book , Laughter : A Scientific Investigation , Provine lists some of the laugh - producing quotes : “ I ’ll see you guys later . ” “ Put those cigarettes away . ” “ I hope we all do well . ”
“ It was nice meeting you too . ” “ We can handle this . ” “ I see your point . ” “ I should do that , but I ’m too lazy ! ”
Not So Funny
Previous studies of laughter had assumed that laughing and humor were inextricably linked , but Provine ’s early research suggested that the connection was only an occasional one .
As his research progressed , Provine began to suspect that laughter was in fact about something else — not humor or gags or incongruity but our social interactions .
He found support for this assumption in a study that had already been conducted , one analyzing people ’s laughing patterns in social and solitary contexts .
“ You ’re 30 times more likely to laugh when you ’re with other people than you are when you ’re alone — if you do n’t count simulated social environments like laugh tracks on television , ” Provine says .
Think how rarely you ’ll laugh out loud at a funny passage in a book but how quick you ’ll be to give a friendly laugh when greeting an old acquaintance .
Laughing is not an instinctive physical response to humor , the way a flinch is a response to pain or a shiver to cold .
Humor is crafted to exploit a form of instinctive social bonding .
The more technical parts of Provine ’s work — exploring the neuromuscular control of laughter and its relationship to the human and chimp respiratory systems — draw on his training at Washington University in St. Louis under Viktor Hamburger and Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini .
But the most immediate way to grasp his insights into the evolution of laughter is to watch video footage of his informal fieldwork , which consists of Provine and a cameraman prowling Baltimore ’s Inner Harbor , asking people to laugh for the camera .
Typically , Provine asks someone to laugh and they demur , look puzzled for a second , and say something like , “ I ca n’t just laugh . ”
Then they turn to their friends or family , and the laughter rolls out of them as though it were as natural as breathing .
At one point Provine stops two waste - disposal workers driving a golf cart loaded up with trash bags .
When they fail to guffaw on cue , Provine asks them why they ca n’t muster up a chuckle .
“ Because you ’re not funny , ” one of them says .
Then they turn to each other and share a hearty laugh .
“ See , you two just made each other laugh , ” Provine says .
“ Yeah , well , we ’re coworkers , ” one of them replies .
The insistent focus on laughter patterns has a strange effect on me as Provine runs through the footage .
By the time we get to a cluster of high school kids , I ’ve stopped hearing their spoken words at all , just the rhythmic peals of laughter breaking out every 10 seconds or so .
After one particularly loud outbreak , Provine turns to me and says , “ Now , do you think they ’re all individually making a conscious decision to laugh ? ”
He shakes his head dismissively .
“ Of course not .
In fact , we ’re often not even aware that we ’re laughing .
We ’ve vastly overrated our conscious control of laughter . ”
Uncontrollable giggles
The limits of our voluntary power over laughter are most clearly exposed in studies of stroke victims who suffer from a disturbing condition , known as central facial paralysis , that prevents them from voluntarily moving either the left or right side of their face , depending on the location of the neurological damage .
When these individuals are asked to smile or laugh on command , they produce lopsided grins :
One side of the mouth curls up , the other remains frozen .
But when they ’re told a joke or they ’re tickled , traditional smiles and laughs animate their entire faces .
There is evidence that the physical mechanism of laughter itself is generated in the brain stem , the most ancient region of the nervous system , which is also responsible for fundamental functions like breathing .
Sometimes called the reptilian brain because its basic structure dates back to our reptile ancestors , the brain stem is largely devoted to our most primal instincts , far removed from the complex , higher - brain skills that allow us to understand humor .
And yet somehow , in this primitive region , we find the urge to laugh .
Why do we have this unconscious propensity for something as frivolous as laughter ?
As I watch them on the screen , Provine ’s teenagers remind me of an old Carl Sagan riff , which begins with his describing “ a species of primate ” that likes to gather in packs of 50 or 60 individuals , cram together in a darkened cave , and hyperventilate in unison , to the point of almost passing out .
The behavior is described in such a way as to make it sound exotic and somewhat foolish , like salmon swimming furiously upstream to their deaths .
The joke , of course , is that the primate is Homo sapiens and the group hyperventilation is our laughing together at comedy clubs or in theaters — or with the virtual crowds of television laugh tracks .
I ’m thinking about the Sagan quote when another burst of laughter arrives through the TV speakers , and without realizing what I ’m doing , I find myself laughing along with the kids on the screen .
I ca n’t help it .
Their laughter is contagious .
Tickle me Washoe
We may be the only species on the planet that laughs together in such large groups , but we are not alone in our appetite for laughter .
Not surprisingly , our near relatives , the chimpanzees , are also avid laughers , although differences in their vocal apparatus cause their laughter to sound somewhat more like panting .
“ The chimpanzee ’s laughter is rapid and breathy , whereas ours is punctuated with glottal stops , ” says legendary chimp researcher Roger Fouts .
“ Also , the chimpanzee laughter occurs on the inhale and exhale , while ours is primarily done on our exhales . ”
Chimps do n’t do stand - up routines , of course , but they do share a laugh - related obsession with humans , one that Provine believes is central to the roots of laughter itself : Chimps love tickling .
Back in his lab , Provine shows me video footage of a pair of young chimps named Josh and Lizzie playing with a human caretaker .
“ That ’s chimpanzee laughter you ’re hearing , ” Provine says .
It ’s close enough to human laughter that I find myself chuckling along .
Parents will testify that ticklefests are often the first elaborate play routine they engage in with their children and one of the most reliable laugh inducers .
According to Fouts , who helped teach sign language to Washoe , perhaps the world ’s most famous chimpanzee , the practice is just as common , and perhaps more long - lived , among the chimps .
“ Tickling . . . seems to be very important to chimpanzees because it continues throughout their lives , ” he says .
Even at the age of 41 , Washoe still enjoys tickling and being tickled .
Among young chimpanzees who have been taught sign language , tickling is a frequent topic of conversation .
Like laughter , tickling is almost by definition a social activity .
And like the incongruity theory of humor , it relies on a certain element of surprise , which is why it ’s impossible to tickle yourself .
A number of tickle - related studies have convincingly shown that tickling exploits the sensorimotor system ’s awareness of the difference between self and other :
If the system orders your hand to move toward your belly , it does n’t register surprise when the nerve endings there report being stroked .
But if the touch is being generated by another sensorimotor system , the belly stroking will come as a surprise .
Jared Diamond wrote a short book with the provocative title Why Is Sex Fun ? that suggests an evolutionary answer to the question of why tickling is fun :
It encourages us to play well with others .
In his book , Provine suggests that feigned tickling can be thought of as the original joke , the first deliberate behavior designed to exploit the tickling - laughter circuit .
Our comedy clubs and our sitcoms are culturally enhanced versions of those original playful childhood exchanges .
Along with the suckling and smiling instincts , the laughter of tickling evolved as a way of cementing the bond between parents and children , laying the foundation for a behavior that carries over into the social lives of adults .
If we once laughed at the surprise touch of a parent or sibling , we now laugh at the surprise twist of a punch line .
Playing is what young mammals do , and in humans and chimpanzees , laughter is the way the brain expresses the pleasure of that play .
“ Since laughter seems to be ritualized panting , basically what you do in laughing is replicate the sound of rough - and - tumble play , ” Provine says .
“ And you know , that ’s where I think it came from .
Touching and being touched is an important part of what it means to be a mammal . ”
There is much we do n’t know yet about the neurological underpinnings of laughter .
We do not yet know precisely why laughing feels so good ; one recent study detected evidence that stimulating the nucleus accumbens , one of the brain ’s pleasure centers , triggers laughter .
Some anecdotal and clinical evidence suggests that laughing makes you healthier by suppressing stress hormones and elevating immune - system antibodies .
If you think of laughter as being basically synonymous with the detection of humor , the laughing - makes - you - healthier premise seems bizarre .
Why would natural selection make our immune system respond to jokes ?
Provine ’s approach helps solve the mystery .
Our bodies are n’t responding to punch lines ; they ’re responding to social connection .
And even if we do n’t yet understand the neurological basis of the pleasure that laughing brings us , it makes sense that we should seek out the connectedness of infectious laughter .
We are social animals , after all .
And if that laughter often involves some pretty childish behavior , so be it .
“ This is why we ’re not like lizards , ” Provine says , holding the Tickle Me Elmo doll on his lap .
“ Lizards do n’t play ; they ’re not social the way we are .
When you start to see play , you ’re starting to see mammals .
So when we get together and have a good time and laugh , we ’re going back to our roots .
It ’s ironic in a way : Some of the things that give us the most pleasure are really the most ancient . ”

Dan says :
A sagacious fellow by the name of Radley Balko , whose chief journalistic endeavor has been exposing the excesses of the War on Drugs , has compiled an impressive list of botched raids conducted by hyper - agressive police units acroos the country .
The militarization of our police forces , with SWAT units armed with weapons designed for warfare against foreign enemies , has been spreading from the inner city to the suburbs , and from small towns to farm country .
All across America , local police units are arming and training officers to bust down doors , destroy personal property and mercilessly manhandle all living creatures in their path .
Dogs , children and even elderly women have been shot by rampaging SWAT teams , usually in the hunt for trivial amounts of drug contraband .
Here 's a recent example :
Williams said he believes the team was supposed to be raiding a parolee 's home Aug. 24 when they inadvertently hit the wrong door .
Officers ended up at the home of David and Lillian Scott , just off Rancho California Road .
Lillian Scott said she and her husband were in the living room discussing family plans , their 15 - year - old daughter was in the garage with two friends and their 16 - year - old son was in another room feeding the Scotts ' 5 - month - old baby .
That all changed at 9:35 p.m. she said , when Temecula police officers –- four or five , she 's not sure –– carrying rifles charged though the unlocked front screen door and ordered the couple to the floor .
" Two of them came over and put handcuffs on the two of us , " Lillian Scott said .
" We asked what we had done wrong and did n't get an answer . "
Elsewhere in the house other officers handcuffed their daughter and her two friends .
" ( The officers ) told them to get down on the f–ing floor , " she said .
Her 16 - year - old son , who was feeding the baby , was also ordered to the floor and handcuffed , Scott said .
From the other room , Scott heard her infant crying .
" I asked if my baby was OK and the officer told me if I moved he was going to put a bullet in my head , " Scott said . "

Update :
Radley Balko of Reason says :
I think I sent a copy of my [ Cato Institute ] paper on the rise of paramilitary police forces last year , but if you did n't get it , you can download it for free here .
I recommend sipping a glass of something stiff while reading .
We also did a Google Maps mashup of about 300 botched raids to go with the paper .
But it 's already out of date .
There have been a couple of dozen more botched SWAT raids since I left Cato for Reason magazine last November .

But the crusading MP Norman Baker felt sure there was something more to his death - and gave up his front - bench role to investigate the case .
In the Mail he revealed extraordinary evidence that he believes proves Kelly did not take his own life and was instead murdered by Iraqi dissidents .
Here , he reveals how the murder may have been carried out . . .
While investigating the death of Dr David Kelly I have made many strange discoveries , not least some disturbing parallels with the case of a young American journalist named Danny Casolaro .
Mr Casolaro made himself deeply unpopular with elements in the murky world of U.S. defence by probing too deeply into their activities .
One morning in August 1991 , he was found dead in a hotel room near Harpers Ferry in Virginia .
He was in the bath , naked , with his wrist slashed .
There were no signs of bruising or other marks on the body and the police concluded that he had committed suicide .
But this was totally false according to Dr Christopher Green , who was the CIA 's chief forensic pathologist for decades .
Dr Green participated in Casolaro 's autopsy and last year he told veteran White House reporter Sterling Seagrave that the young journalist had been killed before being stripped , put in a full bath , and his left wrist cut in precisely the same manner as Dr Kelly's .
And as with Dr Kelly , there was remarkably little blood , bar a small amount smeared on the edge of the tub , suggesting that the wrist wound had been inflicted after the heart had stopped pumping .
This compelling demonstration of how effectively a murder can be disguised as suicide drove me on in my search for the truth about Dr Kelly , who was found dead in an Oxfordshire wood on July 18 , 2003 , having apparently taken his own life .
Before Danny Casolaro died , the journalist had been investigating the activities of America 's private security companies which , according to Sterling Seagrave , are linked to the ' Grey Ghosts ' - an army of professional killers commissioned by the Pentagon to carry out assassinations .

The similarities between the two men's deaths led Seagrave to suggest that Dr Kelly might also have fallen victim to these shadowy figures .
After all , he was the source behind a BBC report that the British government had ' sexed up ' intelligence about Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction in order to justify the invasion of Iraq .
This can hardly have been well received by the White House .
As I explained in Saturday 's Mail , my own information strongly suggests that those behind Dr Kelly 's death were Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein 's regime and angry at Dr Kelly for undermining the case for toppling him .
A well - placed source also told me that the British police or security services had been warned of a likely assassination attempt but were not in time to stop it .
Did they then try to disguise the murder as suicide for reasons of political expediency ?
To understand what may have happened , we must return to Thursday , July 17 , the day
Dr Kelly disappeared .
That morning he was at home with his wife Janice in the village of Southmoor and it must be said that none of his behaviour fits the profile of a man about to commit suicide .
In her evidence to the Hutton inquiry into Dr Kelly 's death , his wife said he was ' tired , subdued , but not depressed ' .
Indeed , it seems it was Janice Kelly , not her husband , who was more seriously under par .
During phone calls that morning , Dr Kelly told a colleague that he was basically ' holding up all right ' , but that his wife was having a difficult time , both physically and mentally , under the pressure of long - standing ill health and the political storm that had engulfed them .
At lunchtime she went to bed with a nauseous headache and arthritis pains .
He , on the other hand , appears to have carried on working normally , eaten some lunch and taken the trouble to go upstairs to check on his wife , shortly before 2 pm , to see how she was feeling .
Given his obvious concern , it hardly seems likely that he would want to exacerbate matters for her by committing suicide that day .
Dr Kelly told his wife he would be going out for one of the regular walks he took to help his bad back .
These were normally short affairs lasting no more than 25 minutes .
Mrs Kelly estimates that her husband left the house shortly after 3 pm .
With him , we are led to believe , he had the knife later found by his corpse and three packets of the painkillers his wife took for arthritis .
These would later be discovered in his jacket pocket - empty but for one of the 30 tablets .
According to the Hutton inquiry , Dr Kelly set out on that walk intent on killing himself .
But , if so , why does he appear to have waited so long before doing it ?
Since the pathologist inexplicably failed to take Dr Kelly 's body temperature when he first arrived on the scene the following day - a standard procedure which would have helped give an accurate time of death - we have to make our own deductions about when he died .
The pathologist offered a wide window of between 4.15 pm on Thursday and 1.15 am on Friday .
But there is every reason to think this window is far too wide .
The Hutton inquiry heard that after Dr Kelly 's body was found on Friday morning , two paramedics moved his arm away from his chest at about 10 am so that they could attach electrodes and confirm that he was dead .
Clearly , rigor mortis - the stiffening of the body - had not yet fully set in .
Since it is generally accepted that it reaches its peak after 12 hours , we can assume that Dr Kelly most likely died at some time after 10 pm on the Thursday night , and quite possibly much later .
What then happened to him in the missing hours - at least seven of them - between leaving home and supposedly killing himself ?
The last person known to have seen Dr Kelly alive was his neighbour , Ruth Absalom , who met him about three - quarters - of - a - mile from his home .
They passed the time of day briefly before going their separate ways .
Dr Kelly 's parting words were : " See you again then , Ruth . "
According to Ms Absalom , he was heading towards the nearby village of Kingston Bagpuize .
That would be consistent with a circular half - hour walk back to his house - but in quite the wrong direction to reach Harrowrecords - down Hill , the lonely area of woodland where his body was discovered .
One of the few clues to what happened next is that Dr Kelly 's phone was switched off when a colleague from the Ministry of Defence tried to call him between 5 pm and 6 pm .
This was odd .
Dr Kelly himself would tell friends that his mobile was always on and , given that he had been in regular contact with the MoD that morning , and that the furore surrounding him was developing from hour to hour , it seems unlikely that he would have turned it off or let the battery run down .
If he did indeed intend to commit suicide , turning off his phone could be seen as a preliminary step .
But for reasons I have made clear , I do not believe suicide is a credible explanation for his death .
This leaves us with an alternative possibility .
Did someone else turn
Dr Kelly 's phone off so that his movements could not be traced via signal kept by the phone company ?
In other words , was he forcibly abducted ?
If he headed in the direction Ms Absalom described , his walk would probably have taken him along Appleton Road , a quiet and rather empty stretch with only sporadic development alongside .
From there he is likely to have turned right into Draycott Road , which is even more deserted .
A no -through road with some derelict buildings part - way down , it peters out into a footpath at the end .
On either of these roads it would certainly have been relatively easy for determined abductors to have forced the 59 - year - old weapons inspector into a van without anyone seeing .
According to the information I have been given , the murder itself was carried out by a couple of not very well - paid hired hands .
As to the method used , I am told that they gave Dr Kelly an injection in his backside , which perhaps points to the use of succinylcholine , a white crystalline substance that acts as a muscle relaxant .
For less beneficent purposes , it can be used to induce paralysis and cardiac arrest and frequently goes undetected in post - mortems .
I asked Thames Valley Police whether the body had been checked for the presence of this or a similar substance .
They told me that they did not know .
If this was not the substance used then , alarmingly , there appear to be a large number of other ways in which Dr Kelly might have been killed that would be difficult or even impossible to trace .
For this we can no doubt partly thank the work of Project Coast - a highly unpleasant chemical and biological warfare programme run by the South African government from 1981 onwards to develop exactly such capabilities .
With aims including the creation of a biological weapon designed to attack the black population while leaving whites unscathed , its prime mover was Dr Wouter Basson , variously described as ' the South African Mengele ' and ' Dr Death ' .
Ironically , in the week before Dr Kelly died , it is alleged he was due to be interviewed by MI5 about his links with Dr Basson , who in 1985 had visited the Porton Down research centre , where Dr Kelly was then head of the Chemical Defence Establishment .
This visit had happened at a time when Mrs Thatcher 's government claimed that the South Africans were developing biological and chemical weapons solely for defensive purposes .
Only later was it revealed that they were working on chemicals such as parathion , an organophosphate that can be introduced into the body through hair follicles , perhaps under the arm or around the crutch .
This causes vomiting - evidence of which could be seen on Dr Kelly 's body - and leads to a respiratory attack .
It is extremely difficult to detect traces of such a chemical in the body , unless you know what you are looking for .
When I tracked down Wouter Basson at his home in the Western Cape earlier this year , I asked him if he thought Dr Kelly had been murdered .
He paused , as if choosing his words carefully , then replied that Dr Kelly ' did n't seem the sort to commit suicide ' .
He was also in no doubt that the UK , and indeed other Western countries , have a capacity for assassination .
Other possible methods of killing Dr Kelly included the use of saxotoxin , found in some shellfish and known as the CIA Shellfish Toxin , after its alleged use by that agency to kill one of their targets .
Even a tiny amount is effective seconds after injection and is completely untraceable after autopsy .
One private detective even suggested to me that Dr Kelly 's killers might have made gruesome misuse of the equipment employed by undertakers in embalming , placing a tube into an artery and forcibly pumping the blood out of the body .
This would cause unconsciousness and then death , and reinforce the assumption that the victim had lost a lot of blood through a cut - the conclusion reached by Lord Hutton in Dr Kelly 's case .
The detective told me that this process did not need access to a main artery like the jugular , but could be achieved through , say , the ulnar artery .
This was the one slashed with a knife in Dr Kelly 's wrist .
Was that incision an attempt to cover up the artery 's previous use ?
Another ghastly suggestion came to me from someone who signed themselves only as ' Nemesis ' .
Their letter alleged that he or she had been told by a ' member of the non-English diplomatic corps ' that air had been introduced into Dr Kelly 's bloodstream through a needle in a vein .
Apparently , if present in sufficient quantities , air in the major organs will kill and leave no scar .
' Nemesis ' was in no doubt that this was how Dr Kelly 's life had ended .
" His heart and lungs were full of air , " the letter said .
We know that the pathologist did retain one of Dr Kelly 's lungs and some blood to test for substances such as chloroform but Assistant Chief Constable Michael Page , who gave evidence at the Hutton inquiry , revealed that the tests to the lung had not actually been carried out .
This was , he said , because no suspicious substances had shown up in the blood tests .
Whatever method might have been used to murder Dr Kelly , we have to wonder why those responsible did not kill him immediately .
There would have been no insurmountable obstacles to doing so , after all .
Perhaps his kidnappers wanted an opportunity to take him into the woods at Harrowdown
Hill under cover of darkness to minimise the chances of being spotted or disturbed .
It certainly would not have been difficult to have given him a shot to render him temporarily unconscious until his assailants forced him to walk to the spot where he would be killed and found the next day .
If they drove him there , the closest they could have got by road was about half a mile from where his body was found .
That walk is rather a public one , but there is another route and one seemingly not investigated by the police .
This path runs from a remote reach of the River Thames , about 500 yards away , up through a field and into the woods .
With no houses or other dwellings nearby , anybody walking here is unlikely to be seen , particularly in the dead of night .
Intriguingly , this area was searched the following morning by Louise Holmes and Paul Chapman , the two volunteers who eventually found Dr Kelly 's body .
They told the Hutton inquiry that some time after beginning their search at 8 am they came across a group of three or four people in a boat and had a brief conversation with them .
Who they were , and what they were doing on the river at that time of the morning , has never been established .
They could , of course , have been holidaymakers .
But was the truth more sinister ?
After being in a negative mood yesterday , and getting it all out of my system , I figured I would return today and give a quick list of the advantages of being a problogger , over most common jobs .
Making Your Own Hours
Sometimes I get up bright and early and get to work , other days I lounge around and focus all evening .
The flexibility in my work allows me to get many other things done , and removes a fair bit of the stress from my job .
I know I have to put in a certain amount of time to see rewards from what I do , but I can spread it out over the course of the day , allowing me to do bursts of high productivity times split up with times of relaxation , reflection and some gaming .
Writing About Your Passion
Most people that become probloggers make it to that level by writing about their passion , and to be honest , there is nothing better than spending all day researching and writing about the things you love the most .
Early on in my problogging career , I was able to write about technology all day , and so I was more knowledgeable in that area than I ever had been before , and it was a great feeling to be so well informed .
It is like taking a class in something you ’ve always wanted to know more about and getting paid for it .
Online Community
There is a diverse community of bloggers online who are looking to connect with other bloggers .
If you can find a few people that your personality meshes well with , you will find your time online that much more enjoyable .
I have been fortunate enough to work with , meet and talk to numerous people online who have been an inspiration to me , as well as supportive in my online ventures , and a great sounding wall stopping me from making mistakes .
Low Cost Business
I put this last on my list because it is one of the least important “ pro ’s ” I could think of , but it is worth mentioning that problogging is a low cost business .
If you have a computer , an internet connection , and something to write about , you are pretty much set .
You do n’t need an office , expensive equipment , or tons of other overhead .
This means that whenever I want to start a new project , or a different project , I do n’t have to empty my pockets , and that most of what I make through blogging goes right to paying my mortgage , food and other such things .
Conclusion
Blogging professionally , be it part - time or full time has many advantages over the traditional nine to five style job , and what I have listed here is only a small bit of what could convince you that this is the right job for you .
But before you leap into becoming a problogger , check out my con ’s list .
— A Fayetteville woman hired the county to put rat poison in her yard on May 25 .
Now , two of her dogs are dead , and a third became seriously ill .
The county failed to properly warn her of the poison 's danger to her pets , and someone needs to be accountable , Lisa Rey said Monday .
Leda was a lost , hurt pup nine years ago , wandering the side of a road with another pup , one so ragged her rescuer named her " Ugly . "
Rey said Monday that she “ got in my car , took her to the vet because she was in terrible condition . "
Leda , she said , has " stayed with me ever since . "
And there was Jack , a hound she had adopted from a shelter .
The three had the run of her back yard , but so did rats .
Rey paid $ 15 for the Cumberland County Health Department to bait her yard with rat poison .
" He laid a bait right there , under the faucet , ” she said .
The worker tossed pellet bags in places she thought her dogs could reach , she added .
" And he said , ' Well , they may dig some up , and they may toss the bags around , but they 'll have to eat their weight in it in order to make them sick . ’
I trusted that .
And I believed him , " Rey said .
In the next few weeks , though , Ugly and Jack were dead .
Leda has racked up more than $ 800 in veterinary bills .
Highland Animal Hospital confirmed that the dogs died of blood clots consistent with ingesting rat poison .
The Health Department has apologized to Rey for the loss of her dogs , but says its employee did nothing wrong .
One official describes it as a matter of miscommunication .
" The rat has to eat its weight in the poison in order to die , not the dog eating its weight in order to die , " said Tony Ferguson , who works in the department 's Division of Vector Control .
“ This has happened before , but it ’s very rare that it happens because most of the time a dog will not – he does n’t mess with the bait , ” Ferguson said .
Every homeowner who pays for the service must sign a disclaimer that says the county will accept no responsibility for anyone who ingests the poison , Ferguson said .
The worker followed procedure , he added .
“ He followed the standard procedure and what he was supposed to be doing .
He had the owner with him as he was putting the poison down and inside the hole , " Ferguson said .
He added that policy requires the worker to put poison in holes where rats are known to travel .
Lisa Rey is not satisfied , “ Because he looked me in the eye several times and assured me they'd be OK . "
As she did nine years ago , she 's trying to nurse Leda back to health .
Cumberland County requires workers to have the homeowner with them as they 're setting out bait .
In response to this case , the department has mandated that every client receive a written explanation of the dangers of rat poison .

Creation Science Evangelism , whose founder Kent Hovind ( " Dr. Dino " ) was recently sentenced to ten years in prison for tax evasion , has been sending out DMCA takedown notices to YouTube in an attempt to halt the criticism .
Now , critics claim that CSE has perjured itself by filing the claims .
The Rational Response Squad was one of the groups that had videos taken down .
The group does n't shy away from controversy ( motto : " Fighting to free humanity from the mind disorder known as theism " ) , and had posted a set of videos that feature clips from CSE 's own productions ; these were then rebutted ( the group did not respond to a request for comment ) .
A few days back , user " cseministry " began sending out DMCA takedown notices , which require the sender to swear under penalty of perjury that he or she owns the copyright to the material in question and that said material is in fact infringing on that copyright .
Filing false takedown claims can result in lawsuits and penalties .
The case raises two issues : 1 ) Does CSE own the copyrights to the clips in question and 2 ) is the use of those clips " fair use " ?
The first question is tough to answer .
As another YouTube user illustrates well , CSE 's videos were explicitly not copyrighted for many years and users were encouraged to share them .
This certainly seems to count as putting the material in the public domain , but CSE did an about - face in 2005 and began claiming copyright on all its products , even those which it had previously said were not copyrighted .
Was this legal ?
Ars contacted CSE , and a spokesman there told us that they had spoken with the US Copyright Office .
" We were assured that our materials are not considered public domain , but rather works that enjoyed copyright protection from its creation , " CSE told us .
" The Copyright Office clarified that a copyright notice is optional for any works distributed after 1989 .
The Copyright Office assured us that we are within our rights to put restrictions on our copyright at any time . "
This is of course true , but it omits a crucial issue — the fact that CSE seems to have waived its copyright in the past .
As Stanford 's librarians point out , " dedicating " a work to the public domain by swearing off copyright can in fact remove copyright protection from that work .
If this had not happened , then CSE could certainly enforce most restrictions regardless of whether it had " filed " for a copyright or had included a copyright notice in the past .
But swearing off copyright muddies the water substantially .
Regarding the issue of fair use , CSE again asked the Copyright Office and " they explained that ' fair use ' can be widely interpreted , " we were told .
Again , this is absolutely true ; fair use is elastic by definition so that it cover a multitude of situations .
But the law clearly spells out at least some of the situations in which fair use can be claimed .
Criticism , comment , news reporting , and teaching are all on the list .
Criticism from groups like the Rational Response Squad certainly seems to be covered , but this is one of those determinations that only a judge can make with authority .
CSE hopes it wo n't come to that .
The group tells
Ars that it " does not intend to turn this into a battle . "
In their view , other groups are using their work for nothing more than propaganda and fund - raising and should be stopped .
CSE 's copyright page now says that materials can still be copied but must be " unedited . "
Still , the group seems to have acknowledged that zeal ran ahead of knowledge when it came to these DMCA takedowns .
CSE tells
Ars that " we submitted to YouTube a list of files which we withdrew our claim of copyright on .
YouTube will use their discretion and take appropriate action on those files .
The remainder of the files , we have good faith belief infringed on our copyright . "
If CSE really has admitted that some of its takedown requests were in error , it could in fact be in trouble if charges are pursued .
DMCA takedowns are n't the sort of thing that can be dashed off and remedied at leisure ; false claims can leave the claimant on the hook for perjury .
And they may get a court fight .
The Rational Responders are showing a surprising bit of emotion ( given their name ) and have resorted to threats of the " Creation Science Ministries picked the wrong people to f--- with " variety .
What 's the cost of file - sharing ?
For Terri Frye of Hickory , NC , it was $ 300 .
That 's the amount she 'll have to pay the RIAA after agreeing to a judgment in a file - sharing case .
Frye is a single mother living in state - supported housing who received one of the RIAA 's settlement letters in November 2005 .
Wanting to defend her innocence , she immediately contacted a lawyer .
" She did a good thing , finding a lawyer as soon as she found out [ the RIAA ] was pursuing her , " Joey Long , one of her attorneys , told Ars Technica .
" It 's what every person should do when they receive a settlement letter . "
Despite contacting Frye in late 2005 , the RIAA did not actually file suit until March of this year .
In the intervening period , Frye repeatedly informed the RIAA that they had the wrong person .
Even if she was guilty of infringement , another of Frye 's attorneys , Matthew K. Rodgers , told the labels that she could n't afford to pay damages of up to $ 750 per song due to her financial situation .
The correspondence between the RIAA 's legal counsel and Frye 's between the time of the settlement letter and the filing of the lawsuit paints a picture of the RIAA 's unwillingness to budge at all from its position that Frye was either directly or indirectly responsible for infringement , despite her protestations to the contrary .
It also showed a troubling lack of communication within the RIAA .
According to a filing by Frye , the RIAA agreed to give her until May 16 to file an answer to their complaint .
Then , on May 4 , the plaintiffs informed Long that they were going to file for a default judgment , saying that the agreed - to extension was " not in the file . "
As early as December 2005 , Frye offered to work with the labels " to avoid any liability and will agree to any reasonable condition that would avoid the payment of any penalties . "
The following month , she was informed that the RIAA would not " release " her from the claims of infringement , and even if she offered the RIAA an affidavit identifying the person she believed responsible for the infringement , the record labels would not agree to drop their claims against her without having the affidavit in hand .
After months of back - and - forth between the RIAA and Frye , the RIAA filed suit in March of this year .
This came despite Frye 's assertions that she had told the owner of the PC associated with the account about the RIAA 's inquiries and that the owner subsequently deleted all the incriminating evidence .
" The RIAA wanted us to reveal who actually committed the infringement , " said Long .
But absent any assurances that she would not be held liable for infringement herself , she was unwilling to divulge the information herself .
The end result is that the RIAA likely spent thousands of dollars to obtain a $ 300 judgment .
And although Frye agrees to be enjoined against future copyright infringement , she does not admit to any wrongdoing .
We asked Long if Frye was going to work with the record labels to identify the person actually responsible for the infringement now that the case has been closed and a judgment entered .
" I can't disclose any of the information about that , " Long told Ars .
" It 's between us and them . "
The RIAA 's prelitigation settlement letters say that defendants are liable for costs of $ 750 per song .
MediaSentry flagged 706 songs on the computer that became the basis for the lawsuit , and at $ 750 per song , that works out to a total of $ 529,500 .
The RIAA settled for a minuscule fraction of that number , one curiously close to the 70¢ - per - track figure a record industry attorney said is close to the labels ' share of each track sold .
File - sharing defendants have argued that the $ 750 - per - track damages sought by the RIAA are excessive , and here we have them accepting a judgment for about 40 ¢ per track .
The RIAA appears willing to extract even a miniscule settlement from a single mother on federal assistance who was willing to help them discover the true identity of the alleged infringer rather than walk away emptyhanded .

MSNBC : How Bush gets away with redefining ' success ' in Iraq David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday September 5 , 2007
Print This Email This MSNBC host Dan Abrams and guests Pat Buchanan and Arianna Huffington argued on Tuesday about the implications of President Bush 's constant redefinition of the meaning of " success " in Iraq and its effectiveness as a political strategy .
" What is remarkable is how the president changes definitions to fit his agenda , " Abrams began .
" The rules , the standards , any effort to judge this war objectively are constantly subverted by the almost dizzying shift in terminology and targets set and reset by the administration . "
Abrams pointed out that Bush 's definition of " success " has shifted from finding Saddam 's WMD's , to creating a model democracy in Iraq , to just reducing the current level of violence .
Pat Buchanan agreed that expectations have " changed dramatically " since the days of " Mission Accomplished , " from carrying out a " world democratic revolution " to merely " averting a strategic catastrophe . "
However , he also appeared to admire the political savvy behind the shift , emphasizing that it means Bush has trumped the Democrats and will continue to enjoy the support to do whatever he wants in Iraq .
" If he says we 've got to avert disaster , he can hold his coalition , " Buchanan stated .
" But he 's not saying we 've got to avert disaster ! " objected Abrams .
" He sure is , " Buchanan replied .
" He 's talking about a holocaust .
He 's talking about slaughter , talking about the end of Vietnam , talking about Cambodia .
Come on Dan , that 's what 's holding the country behind him . "
" There 's a big difference , Pat , between the reality and the words that are being used , " cautioned Abrams , turning to ad agency president Eric Hirshberg for comment on the careful choise of " words that are intended to inflame " in Bush 's recent statement that any decision on troop levels would not be based on " a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the media . "
Buchanan , however , continued to insist that Bush was playing politics very effectively , asking , " What do you think Lincoln did at Gettysburg for heaven 's sake ?
Do you really think the war was about slavery to begin with ? "
This remark was met by a chorus of objections , with Huffington calling the comparison of Bush to Lincoln " laughable " and attempting to suggest that " the only hope the president has is to change the language he is using and hope the Democrats are not ... "
Buchanan cut her off , insisting that " whatever Arianna says , Bush is going to win this .
...
It 's a political war , and you 're right , he 's shifting his ground as you do in war . "
Abrams summed up the discussion by saying , " It sounds like we all agree that this shifting of the goalposts , this changing of the words , whether you like it or not , works .
And that 's unfortunate , and I think that we 've got to call him on it .
... I do n't think that we should necessarily throw up our arms and say ' That 's okay ! ' "
" It only works when the Democrats do n't stand up and fight , " concluded Huffington .
The following video is from MSNBC's Live with Dan Abrams , broadcast on September 4 .
Crude oil for October delivery rose $ 1.68 , or 2.2 percent , to settle at $ 79.91 a barrel at 2:54 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange , a record close .

" There 's a tropical storm in the Gulf and inventories posted a huge decline . "
U.S. oil inventories fell a greater - than - expected 7.01 million barrels to 322.6 million last week , the Energy Department said today .
Prices also rose after OPEC said yesterday it would increase production by 500,000 barrels a day , less than is needed to meet a seasonal rise in demand .
The mystery behind surging oil prices
Latest inventory report shows big drop in crude .
But overall supplies are still high , and U.S. economic growth is slowing .
So what 's pushing prices up to $ 80 a barrel ?
What 's Behind OPEC 's Production Hike ?
Recent shifts in the oil market have driven the Saudis to want to cool things with a 500,000 barrel a day increase .
So far , it has n't worked .
Power prices set to surge
For a long time , conventional wisdom has held that coal would easily meet the nation 's rising demand for electricity .
It 's cheap , and there 's enough of it in the U.S. to power the country for an estimated 250 years .
But a combination of rising construction costs for coal - fired power - plants and uncertainty over whether Congress will regulate emissions of carbon dioxide - a byproduct of burning coal and one of the main gasses behind global warming - has put plans for many new plants on hold .

Americans are leaving home earlier and earlier to beat the rush and get to work on time .
Census data released today document the ever - lengthening commutes :
In 2000 , 1 worker in 9 was out the door by 6 a.m. , the new data says ; by 2006 , it was 1 in 8 .
That might not seem like a big change , but it has put more than 2.7 million additional drivers — for a total of 15 million — on pre-dawn patrol .
This " commuting creep " is changing the lives of tens of millions of Americans .
It affects everything from the breakfast - food industry to television viewership trends , from traffic - signal timing to newspaper delivery times , from carpooling patterns to personal fitness routines .
Increasingly early commutes also are altering workers ' relationships with their families .
Climate - change paradox : Greenhouse gas is Big Oil boon
With enough CO2 injected into declining oil fields , the US could see its petroleum reserves quadruple .
Matt Simmons : Take to the Water to Move People , Goods
As much as the SUV has been depicted as Public Enemy # 1 in the campaign to increase the fuel efficiency of vehicles , Matthew Simmons says the SUV is n’t so bad .
What is bad , the noted Houston investment banker told EnergyTechStocks.com , is an SUV stuck in traffic .
“ Traffic congestion is the single biggest user of oil . ”
API Economist John Felmy : Molecules there but Trillions Must be Spent
While he finds Matthew Simmons to be credible , John Felmy , chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington , DC , does n’t agree with the Houston - based energy investment banker that the world is hitting a point of “ peak oil ” production .
“ The molecules are there , ” says Felmy .
API Chief Economist John Felmy : Greater Diplomacy Needed with Mexico , Others ( Part 2 of 6 )
Like other energy experts , Felmy is worried about the precipitous decline in production from Mexico ’s giant Cantarell oilfield .
Cantarell reportedly is the world ’s second biggest oil complex .
It is the backbone of Mexican oil production , which provides a virtually irreplaceable source of imported crude for the United States .
As Cantarell falters , Felmy sees a critical need to convince Mexico that it needs to change .
API Chief Economist John Felmy : Plug - in Hybrids Hold Promise , but Wo n’t be Cost - free ( Part 3 of 6 )
Plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) are expected to be capable of going up to 40 miles or farther solely on electricity .
Powering the vehicle will be as easy as plugging it in to an ordinary electrical socket .
A number of manufacturers , including General Motors and Toyota , are expected to introduce plug-ins over the next few years .
Surveys show that if consumers understand what a plug - in vehicle is , acceptance should be high , even with the vehicle ’s expected higher price tag .

What a Lake Says About Climate Change
When the East German nuclear power plant Rheinsberg was shut down almost 20 years ago , environmentalists expected that fauna and flora in nearby Stechlin lake would survive without further damage .
Farms ' to see energy crop takeover '
Future demand for biofuels could see more than a million hectares of miscanthus , together with willow for coppicing , being cultivated in the UK , taking over 15 % to 20 % of agricultural land .
Energy efficient appliances should be made compulsory , says UN expert
Governments should make energy efficient appliances and building materials compulsory because that is the smartest way of controlling greenhouse gas emissions , a U.N. expert said Tuesday .
Mexico pipeline attacks raise fear of " new Nigeria "
A series of attacks on Mexico 's fuel pipelines this summer has raised fears the key energy supplier could slide into a Nigeria - style struggle to keep its oil and gas flowing , experts said on Tuesday .
... So far , energy shipments from Mexico , the world 's fifth largest oil exporter , have not suffered from the attacks , and strife in Nigeria has been much worse .
Still , analysts say rising instability in Mexico , a normally reliable supplier , could add as much as $ 10 a barrel to world oil prices .
IEA cuts world oil demand forecasts
World oil demand will grow more slowly than expected in the last quarter of 2007 and next year , and high prices may further curb consumption , the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday .
Bubble Energy ?
According to ( some ) wizards at Harvard , " Solar could meet one - fifth of U.S. energy needs within two decades . "
At least that 's what they said 30 years ago in the widely acclaimed book Energy Future .
What happened ?
If you count as solar both the obvious solar and indirect solar sources such as wind , wood , corn , geothermal and the like , America today hit a collective 4 % , or one - twenty - fifth share .
Low Technologies , High Aims
M.I.T. has nurtured dozens of Nobel Prize winners in cerebral realms like astrophysics , economics and genetics .
But lately , the institute has turned its attention toward concrete thinking to improve the lives of the world ’s bottom billion , those who live on a dollar a day or less and who often die young .
Transport group urges petrol price rise
Petrol prices should go up to keep carbon emissions down , according to the Government 's transport advisers .
The Commission for Integrated Transport ( CfIT ) called for a " steady increase in fuel price to help control CO2 emissions " .
Free - lunch foragers
' Freegans ' are a growing subculture that has opted out of capitalism by cutting spending habits and living off consumer waste .
Turning the Ride to School Into a Walk
Forty years ago , half of all students walked or bicycled to school .
Today , fewer than 15 percent travel on their own steam .
One - quarter take buses , and about 60 percent are transported in private automobiles , usually driven by a parent or , sometimes , a teenager .
The change was primarily motivated by parents ’ safety concerns — a desire to protect their children from traffic hazards and predators .
But it has had several unfortunate consequences .
Children ’s lives have become far more sedentary .
They are fatter than ever and at greater risk of developing hypertension , diabetes and heart disease at young ages .
Oil reserves not running out anytime soon
Oil is a nonrenewable resource .
Whatever we burn today for use as energy will be unavailable for future generations .
Though this is a fact , it has the tendency to spawn catastrophic predictions based on fear rather than factual evidence .
For more than 150 years there has been a steady stream of scientists claiming our oil supply is running out , and we have only a few years left .
The world will in actuality never run completely out of oil ; the problem is people believe it will .
Cautionary Cleantech Metrics
In the influential book “ Hubbert ’s Peak : The Impending World Oil Shortage , ” author Kenneth Deffeyes argues we are running out of oil and that a catastrophic collapse in oil supplies is inevitable .
This point of view totally ignores the feasibility of extracting usable oil from the so called “ heavy oil ” reserves , as well as recovering oil from coal .
At $ 70 per barrel , these technologies are viable today – and every time the price of oil rises , these technologies become more feasible .
Oil from the Athabasca tar sands , for example , is recoverable at a price of $ 45 per barrel .
Similar costs apply to the massive reserves in Venezuela ’s Orinoco basin .
Power Cuts Threaten Lifeblood of Albanian Economy
Albania has been suffering from a massive power crisis since the 1990s - the result of poor strategy in the energy sector , lack of investment and fast - growing consumption .
The failure of several governments to effectively tackle the crisis jeopardizes the country ’s fragile recent economic recovery , stunting the possibility of growth and making life for ordinary people hard to fathom .
Nigeria : Energy Crisis - Beyond Emergency Declaration
The chronic nature of the crisis justified the pledge by President Umaru Yar 'Adua at the take - off of his administration that the situation in the sector deserved a declaration of emergency .
And to be fair to Yar 'Adua , a lot of activities of the government are focussed on addressing the problem .
It has been explained that the perceived tardiness in the Yar 'Adua approach is due to the fact that he wants to be holistic and systematic in the solutions to be proffered .
He has taken his time to apprise himself with the depth of the problem while the consumers of electricity are yearning for steady power supply .
The approach seems to take energy as whole , be it electricity or fuel .
Engineer says
Thailand needs nuclear - powered electricity plants
Thailand needs nuclear - powered electricity generating plants due to the rising demand for electricity and to help cushion the impact of global warming , a board member of the Council of Engineers said Wednesday .
Kamol Takabut said during a seminar that a feasibility study on constructing a nuclear - powered electricity plant would be submitted to the government next month and it would be left to the new elected government to decide whether to go ahead with its construction .
Lebanon plagued by power losses
Power rationing has been stepped up in recent weeks , leaving citizens facing up to 14 hours per day without electricity .
The crisis , not helped by ongoing fighting in the region , has meant reliance on generators and led to a fuel shortage .
To make matters worse , there have even been reports of theft of electricity through the illegal connection of cables to power lines .
Natural gas cars on road

PT OKs resolution in favor of railroad bed preservation
The Portage Township board Monday became the fifth in the area to approve a resolution in favor of preserving old railroad beds for future use .
Lisa McKenzie , representing the Keweenaw Peninsula Chamber of Commerce , said the corridors could still be used for recreational uses — or , depending on how things go , railroads .
“ None of us realize how drastically things could change with the energy crisis , so who knows , ” she said .
Soaring wheat , oil prices spark global inflation fears
As central banks prepare to cut interest rates to relieve a global credit crunch , they 're being stalked by the threat of inflation .
Wheat prices rose to record highs on global markets today .
Oil prices rose to near - record levels .
And as pork prices soar , China posted its highest inflation figures in more than a decade .
The greening of nuclear energy
The nuclear power industry is riding the green wave back into public favour with its promise of a low - carbon solution to our growing energy needs .
But even as the industry struggles to dictate what role nuclear can realistically play , it is bound by a global energy landscape - from solar to carbon sequestration - that is still predominantly shaped by the marketplace .
Change in political climate must inform green investments
We might have been forced to listen to nearly two years of the manure of political rhetoric to reach this point , but if the last few weeks are anything to go by the UK could soon see the green shoots of serious political action on climate change .
Beware the new world energy order
With crude oil prices strengthening and demand for oil continuing to rise , you 'd expect three of the most powerful men in the global business to be thrilled with their good fortune .
Instead , Rex Tillerson , chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. , Jeroen van der Veer , chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell PLC , and Thierry Desmarest , chairman of Total S.A. -- brought together likely for the first time last Friday by Alberta utility magnate Ron Southern to address his Spruce Meadows Round Table -- are anxious about whether there 's even a future for their business .
World Oil Outlook : Consumption Increases , Inventories To Decline
In 4th Quarter
Announced maintenance at fields in the United Arab Emirates has lowered EIA ’s projection for OPEC crude oil production in the fourth quarter by 100,000 bbl/d from last month ’s Outlook to 30.9 million bbl/d .
In 2008 EIA expects that OPEC will increase production slowly , to an average of 31.4 million bbl/d , in order to manage inventories and maintain prices .
The economic uncertainty and risks to oil demand brought on by the turmoil in financial markets will likely reinforce OPEC ’s cautious approach to production - target decision - making .
Despite expected increases in production capacity by several OPEC members , the expected gains in demand for OPEC oil will likely keep surplus capacity in the 2 - to - 3 million bbl/d range through 2008 .
Most of the surplus will remain concentrated in Saudi Arabia , leaving Riyadh with the flexibility to play a key role in influencing oil market developments .
The modest level of worldwide surplus capacity makes the market vulnerable to unexpected supply disruptions .
Oil Minister : Angola May Have OPEC Oil Quota in ' 08 , Not Now
Angola 's Oil Minister Desiderio da Graca Verissimo e Costa said Tuesday that his country would n't be constrained by an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries production quota this year but may have one in place in 2008 .
Costa , speaking ahead of an OPEC policy meeting at which members are expected to approve a rise in quotas , said the issue of a limit for Angola , which became its 12th member at the beginning of this year , is n't on the agenda .
Preparing for the post oil era
SHETLAND and neighbouring Faroe Islands are both to spend oil revenues to create an economy eventually independent of oil .
Opening the Energy from the Edge symposium in Lerwick yesterday morning , the Faroese prime minister Joannes Eidesgaard announced that his country would spend at least 10 per cent of its oil revenues to stimulate research to become less reliant of fossil fuels .
IEA sounds ' wake - up call ' on energy savings
With sustained economic growth , the rising demand for travel , homes and leisure in the developed world has led to a 14 % increase in energy - use and related CO2 emissions since 1990 , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) has warned in a new report .
Oil 's golden years stifled innovation
The trouble with oil and natural gas is that it runs out .
Norway 's energy resources in the North and Norwegian seas are already maturing .
Oil production is expected to increase until 2011 and then fall gradually , while gas production is expected to increase rapidly until 2013 and then plateau , according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate , the government body .
KRG responds to Dr Shahristani ’s recent statements on oil
The Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) would like to make it clear that Dr Shahristani 's recent remarks about the legality of the KRG 's oil and gas contracts are totally unacceptable .
His views are irrelevant to what the KRG is doing legally and constitutionally in Kurdistan .
Dr Shahristani should concentrate on making a positive contribution to the country , rather than undermining the constructive work that the KRG is carrying out for the benefit of all the Iraqi people .
Mexico pipeline bombers threaten new attacks
A leftist rebel group claimed responsibility on Tuesday for bomb attacks on Mexican oil and gas pipelines earlier this week , and threatened more assaults against the state - owned oil company .

9/11 , unity , and the chattering of chipmunks
The " chattering of chipmunks . "
Disagreement , doubt , frustration .
It 's a drag .
Bykofsky caught crap for saying it and had to take it back , but I think the sentiment is fairly common .
I hear echoes of it when enviros say that the American public wo n't rally around the climate change ( peak oil / biodiversity / oceans ) fight until " another Katrina " happens .
Indeed , responding to Bykofsky , our own Kit Stolz said : " I 'm sorry , but somebody needs to say it .
We need another Katrina -- now . "
Act now , eat later
The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas ’s ( Aspo ) South African chapter released its report on the country ’s energy future last month and issued a caveat to the government : the country has to switch to a path of sustainability for the sake of both the economy and social stability .
Biofuels offer cure worse than the disease OECD
Biofuels , championed for reducing energy reliance , boosting farm revenues and helping fight climate change , may in fact hurt the environment and push up food prices , a study suggested on Tuesday .
In a report on the impact of biofuels , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said biofuels may " offer a cure that is worse than the disease they seek to heal " .
Sweden , Brazil sign biofuels deal during Lula visit
Sweden agreed Tuesday to abolish a tax on ethanol , which it currently purchases from Brazil , under a biofuels accord signed here during a visit of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , officials said .
Southeast Asia gears up for palm oil boom
Southeast Asian nations are gearing up for a palm oil boom as interest in biofuels soars , but activists warn the crop may not satisfy a global thirst for energy that is both clean and green .
They caution that oil palm plantations require massive swathes of land -- either what 's left of the region 's disappearing forests , denuded plots that would be better off reforested , or land critical to supporting local people .
Japanese consumers feel the pinch of biofuel demand
As more people embrace ethanol and other biofuels as eco-friendly alternatives to fossil fuels in curbing global warming , the unintended consequence is a rise in food prices as demand puts pressure on agriculture .
While the most frequently voiced concern is that food will become more expensive in the developing world , the effects are already being felt in quiet ways in rich countries such as Japan , which relies on imports for most of its food needs .
Many roads lead to cleaner cars , GM and Toyota say
The world 's biggest automakers , GM and Toyota , have taken different routes so far to developing cleaner vehicles but agree there is no one way to achieving lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions .
They also agree that making the technology affordable will be a major challenge .
Mediterranean 's rich marine life under threat : study
The experts said a cold current emanating from the Gulf of Trieste off northern Italy , which allowed the waters of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean to mix , had vanished since 2003 due to warming .
World likely to pass dangerous warming limits
President George Bush 's latest effort to rally support for his Iraq policy has touched a nerve in Vietnam , where previous US intervention led to the deaths of millions of people .
In a speech to US war veterans yesterday , Mr Bush invoked the Vietnam war , saying that widespread death and chaos would envelop Iraq if the US troops left too quickly , as he claimed had happened when America pulled out of Vietnam three decades ago .
But people in Vietnam , where opposition to the US intervention in Iraq is strong , said today that Mr Bush had drawn the wrong conclusions from the conflict .
" Does n't he realise that if the US had stayed in Vietnam longer , they would have killed more people ? " said Vu Huy Trieu of Hanoi , a veteran who fought against US troops in Vietnam .
" Nobody regrets that the Vietnam war was n't prolonged except Bush . "
Vietnam 's official government spokesman offered a more measured response .
" With regard to the American war in Vietnam , everyone knows that we fought to defend our country and that this was a righteous war of the Vietnamese people , " said the foreign ministry spokesman Le Dung .
" And we all know that the war caused tremendous suffering and losses to the Vietnamese people . "
Mr Dung said Vietnam hoped that the Iraq conflict would be resolved " very soon , in an orderly way , and that the Iraqi people will do their best to rebuild their country " .
Although Vietnam opposed the US intervention in Iraq , Mr Dung stressed that ties between Hanoi and Washington had been growing closer since the former foes established friendly relations in 1995 .
In his remarks in Kansas City yesterday , Mr Bush said that a hasty retreat from Iraq would lead to terrible violence .
" One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ' boat people , ' ' re - education camps ' and ' killing fields ' , " he said .
But many people in Vietnam said the comparison was ill - considered .
The US could not have overcome the will of the Vietnamese people no matter how many bombs it dropped , said Mr Trieu .
" Does he think the US could have won if they had stayed longer ? "
Mr Trieu asked .
" No way . "
The only way to restore order in Iraq was for the US to leave , said Trinh Xuan Thang , a Hanoi university student .
" Bush sent troops to invade Iraq and created all the problems there , " he said , adding , " suicide bombing was unheard of before . "
If the US withdrew , he said , the violence might escalate in the short term but the situation would eventually stabilise .
" Let the Iraqis determine their fate by themselves , " Mr Thang said .
" They do n't need American troops there . "

It 's not up to me .
That 's the biggest A number 1 thing you need to keep in mind .
I hate the whole ID thing just as much as you do .
It 's stupid and Orwellian and total overkill .
I believe that anyone reasonably 21 looking should be able to get a beer no questions asked and no hassle .
But this is America , and I do n't think we ever really got over prohibition .
You have MADD and the " think of the children " brigade to thank for the police state conditions at your favorite watering hole .
The teetotallers keep crying that it needs to be harder for kids to get alcohol , and the fines keep going up , and the bars keep getting more paranoid .
We hear horror stories of ABC coming into a bar and carding everyone inside , then when someone does n't have it , the bar gets shut down , fined tens of thousands of dollars , and the entire staff goes to jail for the weekend .
It is fucking ridiculous but unfortunately it's what we have hanging over our heads , so no I can't let you in even though you 're bald , even though your expired license still has your birthday , even though you have to go back so far to get it , even though you just got your wallet stolen , even though it 's risky to carry your passport , it 's not going to happen .
I 'm sorry .
If it were up to me I would , but it is n't , so please do n't keep arguing with me .
You could talk to the manager but he 'll just tell you the same thing , and I can't leave my post to go get him anyway .
This all goes triple for you , Mr. Lawschool .
No I can't quote the DC alcohol laws from memory , all I know is that they 're designed to instill a culture of fear in barstaff across the city and they 're working .
If you 're such a fucking hotshot why do n't you go argue with the alcohol control board and help us all out .
So yeah it sucks but there 's nothing any of us can do about it .
Just get used to it .
Have your ID .
Have it out .
Show it to me .
Go drink .
I know you 're 25 and your job sucks and you feel old and you 're so sick of getting carded , but it 's happening .
Buck up , kiddo :
You 're still young .
Maybe you 're 40 and it really is ridiculous I 'm carding you .
I think so too .
A more accurate statement is it 's ridiculous the city is making the bar make me card you .
Sorry .
Just let me see it and do n't be an asshole about it .
And do n't quiz me on it to try to prove I did n't really look .
I do n't memorize shit , and I do n't do the math .
I look for a number below 1986 , a number above 2007 , and match the photo .
Nice and efficient .
You 've succeeded in proving only that you are a prick .
It 's not up to me .
Remember that and you and I are going to get along 1000 % better .
After that there 's really just a couple pet peeves that I 'd like to ask you to work on ... Do n't count on being a regular .
You used to come here all the time .
You totally know the owner , what 's his name , Dave .
Where 's the usual door guy ?
He got fired , and unfortunately for you this high - turnover position does n't come with a list of regulars and their head shots .
If you come here so much it should n't be so hard to figure out when a doorman is new .
You should have your ID anyway .
Show it to me , and if you 're so proud of being a regular , introduce yourself , but do n't be surprised if it takes a few times to really remember .
Again if you 're such a barfly you should understand that by now .
Do n't tell me where the fucking birthdate is .
Even with an ID from a state I do n't see too often , I 've probably already found it and I 'm looking for the expiration date , or I 'm double checking something that looks odd to me .
I 'm not an idiot and you 'll get your beer in a second .
Chill the fuck out .
Do n't try to be funny .
Every ten minutes , some idiot makes the " oh do n't let my friend in she has a fake " joke as if I 've never heard it before .
I usually joke back " you know this is like the airport , I have to take that seriously . "
Eventually I 'm going to just go ahead and not let your friend in .
Consider yourself warned .
... and not funny .
I do n't remember you .
I see hundreds of faces every night .
Each for only a couple seconds .
If you come outside for a smoke or a phone call , do n't breeze past me and then be shocked when I ask to see your ID again , especially if you left it inside .
Simple solution : just be a good sport and show it to me again .
If that 's really such a big deal to you , a simple " hey I left my ID inside and I 'm stepping out for a second " as you come out the door is usually all it takes to actually get you remembered .
Do n't ask me what it 's like inside .
I 'm out here too , buddy .
Your guess is as good as mine .
Please use discretion when trying to make smalltalk with me .
I 'm stuck here .
Depending on my mood and my first impression of you , some smalltalk from a stray smokebreaker is either a welcome distraction or a major annoyance .
Like most social interactions , you 're gonna have to read between the lines and figure out what 's appropriate .
If I put down my book / crossword puzzle / gameboy / whatever and engage the conversation , you 're in .
If I keep giving you one word answers and going back to whatever I was doing , go bother someone else .
Also , if I 'm obviously injured , please do n't ask what I did to my arm .
I 'm already sick of telling my friends the same story .
I definitely do n't want to repeat it for hundreds of strangers .
And do n't you dare try to help with my crossword unless you 're cute and you 're trying to sleep with me .
Cheers .
ABC 's much anticipated " 20/20 " report last night on the DC Madam scandal was a dud to say the least .
Last week Brian Ross said :
Download Download
" There are thousands of names , tens of thousands of phone numbers , and there are people there at the Pentagon , lobbyists , others at the White House , prominent lawyers — a long , long list .
But last night on " 20/20 , " Ross completely reversed course and said :
As usually is the case in Washington , much of it is dull .
There are no members of Congress we can find in these phone numbers , no White House officials .
Quite frankly , but for the few exceptions , most of the men on this list just are n't newsworthy .
What accounts for that sudden shift ?
A week ago the White House was involved , but now they 're not ?
The last thing I want is anyone falsely accused of anything , but how did an extra week with the phone records lead Ross to conclude that people who he last week said were involved no longer are n't ?
That 's just weird if you ask me .
A new , location - based web service is trying to make social - networking software more about socializing than simply collecting lists of buddies .
Meetro , from a small , Chicago - based company called Meetroduction , marries instant - messaging software with geo-proximity technology in the hopes of expanding people 's social circles .
When you sign on and report your location , Meetro 's Windows - only software displays the names and photos of users within a certain geographic radius of your address .
You can then check out what music and books someone likes , according to their profile , and instantly start chatting , or invite them to join you for coffee a couple blocks away .
Dating and making business contacts are the most obvious uses of Meetro , according to Meetroduction CEO Paul Bragiel .
But he hopes the service will smooth the process of making new friends .
" Ten years ago , the idea of dating people you met off your computer was ridiculous , but now it 's commonplace , " Bragiel said .
" Ours is the next bump .
People right now are meeting over computers and plan to meet each other .
Meetro is dynamic , so if someone shows up in your local area , you can meet up in 10 minutes because they are less than a quarter - mile away . "
Meetro users currently are clustered mainly in Chicago and New York City and mostly seem to be 18 - to 30 - year - olds , college students and people new to a city who are looking to socialize .
Bragiel says his company is very aware of privacy issues and works to make sure Meetro does not turn into stalkerware .
For starters , the software generalizes locations , so a user can know that someone is within a mile , but wo n't get a specific address .
Meetro users can also prevent someone from ever seeing their profile or IM - ing them again by hitting a prominently placed " block " button .
Meetro is n't the only location - based social - software application , though nothing else works quite the way it does .
Google recently acquired dodgeball.com , a service that lets you use SMS to broadcast your location to nearby friends .
A Germany - based company called Plazes that lets people report their location and contact information is drawing in Silicon Valley technologists .
And several large cell - phone providers offer a service that lets you know the locations of friends on the same carrier .
Many Meetro users ' first chat invitation comes from the service 's unofficial ambassador , Jean Zei , a 31 - year - old office manager who goes by the handle " QueenJean " and makes a point of welcoming new users .
Zei says that , despite having made dozens of new friends , she has had to block three users permanently .
" Like anywhere else , there 's some weirdos out there that I block just because I do n't wanna look at them , " Zei said in an instant message .
" But otherwise , the crowd is so fun and welcoming and inviting . "
Kurt Uhlir , a Chicago technologist who edits a blog called The Technology Suits , is looking forward to Meetro having enough users that he can easily find people nearby who share his interests .
" I have already met a few people while in downtown Chicago , once at a flight delay in O'Hare and another time in Atlanta for a layover where I met someone just to talk to for a while , " Uhlir said .
" I have even kept up with one of those guys since for business reasons and we bounce ideas around about advertising models . "
Apple held a somewhat rare , company - wide virtual meeting with Steve Jobs this morning ( 11 am Pacific Time ) , wherein Steve Jobs discussed the gravity of the iPhone on Apple 's business as well as how he perceives the parts played by the rest of the company .
The following is a series of notes produced by combining details from several of Ars Technica 's internal sources .
Steve opened up with how he believes that the iPhone will change the mobile space forever .
He said that when the Mac first came out , people talked about how some day , every computer would work that way , and the same would be true of the iPhone .
The iPhone was driven by the fact that everyone hates their phones , and it's all about " core competence " — making all of the features easy - to - use and self - discoverable .
He then talked about iPhone in relation to the rest of Apple 's business .
Steve described it as trying to put the third leg onto a chair with only two legs .
The first leg is the Mac business , which Steve addressed by saying that they have the " best Macs " in the new product pipeline ever right now , and that the stuff coming out in the next year is " off the charts . "
Wow , sounds juicy .
He said that the second leg is the iPod and iTunes marketplace , which we all know has been wildly successful .
The third leg of the chair , Steve hopes , will be the iPhone business , which he hopes to grow into something as strong as the iPod .
He added that he hopes for the fourth leg to become the Apple TV , but focus is on the iPhone for now .
This reiterates previous reports that Steve Jobs viewed the Apple TV as more of an experiment than a total dive into the set - top space .
He then expanded upon OS X , and what it means for the business .
There is one OS group that does Mac OS X for the Mac and the iPhone , as well as " some iPods we 're working on . "
Could it be that the next major revision to the iPod video will , in fact , be a widescreen iPod similar to that of the iPhone ?
We 're not sure , but it definitely sounds like Steve is leaning in that direction .
Someone from the audience asked whether Apple was concerned about cannibalization of business from the iPod with the introduction of the iPhone , and Steve answered that if there 's going to be cannibalization of Apple , they want it to be by Apple .
He also answered a question about " why EDGE ? " , saying that EDGE is more pervasive than 3G networks and that 3G chips are also power hogs .
Here 's a funny one .
" Why 6 PM ? "
Steve says
Apple did n't want people to have to take off from work , so they figured that was a good time to do it .
Our tipster said that at this point , Steve got a " look on his face that was kind of the same look as he had when introducing the Mac in 1984 . "
He said that it sounded like Steve thought the iPhone launch was a really huge deal , and considered it to be one of the most revolutionary and exciting products they had ever created .
Steve said , " Do n't worry about two years from now , " they 'll deal with that as it comes .
Apple employees will be able to tell their grandkids that they were at Apple when they launched the iPhone , and that it was all worth the sacrifice .
To thank the employees , all fulltime Apple employees in the US and part - time employees who have been there for a year will be getting an iPhone at the end of July .
Multiple sources have told me that they believe this includes retail employees .
Edit :
We have received some clarification on the employees receiving iPhones .
All fulltime employees will get one , plus part - timers who have been there for a year .
And that 's it , folks !
WASHINGTON , Sept. 7 ( Bloomberg News ) —
The House approved the most sweeping changes to United States patent law in more than half a century on Friday in a victory for computer companies like Microsoft and finance companies like Goldman Sachs .
The legislation , approved 220 to 175 , would make patents harder to obtain and easier to challenge and is intended to curtail litigation by limiting where patent owners can file suit and how much they can collect in damages .
Approval came after last - minute changes to appease critics , including labor groups , universities , the Bush administration and the drug maker Pfizer , which said the original proposal went too far in weakening patent rights and might hurt investment in new technologies and cost American jobs .
Even with the changes , the measure faced opposition from manufacturers , including Caterpillar , Eli Lilly and Procter & Gamble .
Opponents said the measure favored certain industries over others .

Leahy wants Justice docs before confirming new AG David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 3 , 2007
Print This Email This The White House has foiled and forestalled Congressional investigations of its warrantless domestic spying program and other instances of alleged misconduct , but a new round of confirmation hearings could open a crack in the Bush administration 's armor .
The showdown came to a head earlier this month when Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy invoked threats of criminal contempt charges when the White House again refused to comply with subpoenas .
But the announced resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has placed another arrow in Leahy 's quiver as he continues to target what , if any , legal justifications backed Bush 's assertion that 9/11 gave him unilateral authority to approve wiretaps rather than submitting to judicial oversight .
Appearing on Fox News Sunday , Leahy implied he may hold up confirmation of Gonzales 's as - yet - unnamed successor , until the White House cooperates with investigations of the current AG 's alleged misconduct .
" I have told the White House there 's a lot of information we need to have before a confirmation hearing , " Leahy told host Chris Wallace .
Republicans and Democrats had for months criticized Gonzales 's alleged attempts to politicize the Justice Department , and some have accused him of giving President Bush poor , improper or illegal advice in areas ranging from the warrantless wiretapping program to the treatment of US - held detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
However , Leahy said , the Judiciary Committee has an incomplete picture of Gonzales 's performance and guidance because of the administration 's refusal to hand over requested documents , citing executive privilege and national security concerns .
" They 've operated under a legal document apparently approved by the attorney general that has allowed everything from signing statements to torture to warrantless wiretapping of Americans , " Leahy said .
" We have to know what was in there so we can ask the next person , what 's going on . "
Leahy indicated he would n't hold up the confirmation of a new attorney general to compel the administration to cooperate in tangentially related areas , such as by allowing the testimony of just - departed White House political guru Karl Rove .
" I 'll know when we have enough information to ask the valid questions on both sides , " he said , " and then we 'll go forward with the confirmation hearing . "
At an Aug. 20 press conference , Leahy accused the administration of hiding " behind a fictitious veil of secrecy , " and he threatened to bring contempt proceedings before the committee if the administration refused to cooperate .
Since then , there has been " nothing new " with regards to communication between the committee and the White House , a Leahy spokesman told RAW STORY via e-mail .
The committee 's schedule does not indicate that contempt charges will be considered this week , but the spokesman , David Carle , noted that the committee is carrying over a " heavy existing agenda . "
Whether contempt charges are considered , new confirmation hearings may offer Leahy a better opportunity to compel the White House 's cooperation , and he said previously he hopes to be able to avoid criminal proceedings .
Besides , the Justice Department has said it would not prosecute contempt charges should they pass the House , when the House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of finding two administration figures in contempt of Congress for their refusal to testify in its investigation of the US Attorney firings .
Sen . Arlen Specter , the Judiciary Committee 's top Republican , echoed the call for White House cooperation , but he said such confirmation of a new attorney general should not be delayed .
" Let us not get embroiled in two years of litigation on what executive privilege means , until this administration is gone , " Specter ( R - PA ) said .
" There are some important questions to be answered , and congressional oversight can do it without putting a lot of preconditions , and tying up the confirmation of a new attorney general . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox News Sunday , broadcast on September 2 .
The Lost Arcade Games of the Soviet Union
Even the most loyal Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee found it impossible to throw Mr. Gonzales a lifeline .
The best Orrin Hatch of Utah could do was to mutter that “ I think that you ’ll agree that this was poorly handled ” and to suggest that Mr. Gonzales should just be forgiven .
Senator Sam Brownback led Mr. Gonzales through the names of the fired attorneys , evidently hoping he would offer cogent reasons for their dismissal .
Some of his answers were merely laughable .
Mr. Gonzales said one prosecutor deserved to be fired because he wrote a letter that annoyed the deputy attorney general .
Another prosecutor had the gall to ask Mr. Gonzales to reconsider a decision to seek the death penalty .
( Mr. Gonzales , of course , is famous for never reconsidering a death penalty case , no matter how powerful the arguments are . )
Mr. Gonzales criticized other fired prosecutors for “ poor management , ” for losing the confidence of career prosecutors and for “ not having total control of the office . ”
With those criticisms , Mr. Gonzales was really describing his own record : he has been a poor manager who has had no control over his department and has lost the confidence of his professional staff and all Americans .
Mr. Gonzales was even unable to say who compiled the list of federal attorneys slated for firing .
The man he appointed to conduct the purge , Kyle Sampson , said he had not created the list .
The former head of the office that supervises the federal prosecutors , Michael Battle , said he did n’t do it , as did William Mercer , the acting associate attorney general .
Mr. Gonzales said he did not know why the eight had been on the list when it was given to him , that it had not been accompanied by any written analysis and that he had just assumed it reflected a consensus of the senior leaders of his department .
At one point , Mr. Gonzales even claimed that he could not remember how the Justice Department had come to submit an amendment to the Patriot Act that allowed him to fire United States attorneys and replace them without Senate confirmation .
The Senate voted to revoke that power after the current scandal broke .

Posted on June 13 , 2007 , William My Thoughts on Forza 2 ( Xbox 360 )
I spent the past couple of days playing Forza 2 and I ’d have to say I am slightly satisfied , yet not overly impressed with the racing sim everyone is talking about .
300 + cars , 40 + tracks and great music should have been enough to keep me excited but I just do n’t think this game will live up to expectations with most racing simulator enthusiasts .
I could n’t help but think to myself that I ’d almost rather be playing one of the old Gran Turismos on my PS2 .
I ’ll break my review into simple sections for you .
Customization :
The customization is very extensive in Forza 2 , so if that ’s your thing it ’s truly a winner .
You could spend endless hours customizing every little detail of your cars .
One thing I do like is the ability to take photos of your vehicle and upload them to the Forza server to view later on the web .
This sim definitely gets my stamp of approval as far as customization and is just as good if not better than any other racing sims I have played .
Graphics :
The graphics are great .
I do n’t think it ’s quite as ground breaking as some claimed it would be , but it ’s enough to keep me happy .
In some ways , I think it is almost too realistic .
The car damage so highly spoken of for the game is a little on the hokey side .
It ’s not accurate in the least bit and either under or over - exaggerated in nearly every event .
Gameplay :
This is where the game gets an average rating from me .
Even with 40 + tracks , the racing seems to get a little too repetitive each time .
The AI in the game is n’t all that great and your opponents are fairly predictable .
I was actually surprised that there were no races in the rain which I really love in many other racing games .
The cars do handle realistically and probably better than most racing games .
All in all I would call Forza 2 a great game .
If I had to give it a number , I ’d say 8.5/10 .
It is better than the Gran Turismo series in many ways , but I do n’t think it ’s even close to what we need to expect out of the future of next - generation racing .
I ’m not sure I am just burnt out on racing , but there was really nothing new about this game to keep my attention for long periods of time .
There ’s nothing ground breaking in the title .
There ’s nothing to write home to mom about .
If you like racing games a lot , then it ’s probably a good pick .
I ’d suggest renting it first though .
Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov entered Russia ’s presidential race Sunday , raising prospects that the Western - oriented democratic opposition might field several candidates in the contest this March -- something that Kasparov had originally sought to avoid .
Kasparov received 379 of 498 votes at a national congress held in Moscow by the Other Russia coalition , spokeswoman Lyudmila Mamina said .
“ I will do everything possible for the ideas of Other Russia to win , ” Kasparov said at the congress .
“ This will work only if we stay united .
. . .
I know that the road will be difficult . ”
Other Russia has sought to unite opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin across the political spectrum .

Another key figure in the coalition is Eduard Limonov , a writer who heads the group formerly known as the National Bolshevik Party .
Because that group is banned , Limonov is often introduced at opposition events as leader of “ the nyelzya bolshe proiznosit party , ” which means “ the party that you are not allowed to pronounce anymore . ”
Former Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov , widely viewed as potentially the most influential opposition candidate , was a founding leader of Other Russia but split with the group this summer .
He now heads his own party , People for Democracy and Justice , and has made it clear that he intends to run for president .
Grigory A. Yavlinsky , leader of the human rights - oriented Yabloko party , has also said he will contest the presidential election .
None of the opposition contenders are guaranteed places on the ballot .

Their candidacies still need to be registered and could be blocked .
Other Russia also chose Kasparov to be one of three candidates to head the coalition ’s list in parliamentary elections in December , if it is able to participate .
The others are Limonov and former Central Bank head Viktor Gerashchenko .
Under Russian law , only individual political parties can participate in the parliamentary vote , and Other Russia ’s parties have not been officially registered as eligible .
Putin enjoys popularity ratings above 70 % , but the constitution requires him to step down at the end of his second term , next spring .

Most observers believe that voters , influenced by state - controlled television , will endorse whomever Putin selects as his preferred successor .
Among the contenders seen as most likely to win the Kremlin ’s backing are Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov and First Deputy Prime Ministers Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei B. Ivanov .
Dem candidate : Warrantless wiretaps a ' victory ' for terrorists Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Senator vows to block telecom immunity as Judiciary Committee stands up to Bush Democratic presidential candidate Chris Dodd , who has taken a hard - line in opposing Bush administration proposals to modify a foreign surveillance law , says the president 's willingness to trample Constitutional rights hands terrorists a " victory " beyond what they could achieve through another attack .
" When you give up basic Constitutional rights , you give terrorists a far greater victory in ways , " Dodd said during an online video chat .
The Connecticut senator explained his efforts to block a proposed bill that would grant immunity to telecommunications companies that critics say broke the law in allowing the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants .
Dodd repeated his promise to filibuster any surveillance law that included immunity for telephone and internet providers , while he acknowledged that sustaining such a blockade would not be easy .
Although he has registered little more than a blip in national opinion polls , Dodd 's stand against telecom immunity has dramatically raised his profile among progressive bloggers , and his campaign raised $ 100,000 in 36 hours when he vowed to put a " hold " on the bill .
In August , Congress rushed to pass a temporary expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that was assailed for not providing enough court oversight of surveillance methods authorized by the administration .
That measure expires in February , and the House and Senate are considering long - term legislation to modify the act .
Dodd said he was encouraged by indications that the Senate Judiciary Committee would not include telecom immunity in a proposal expected to emerge from the committee in coming weeks .
Last week , the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 13 - 2 in favor of a FISA update that would spare from civil litigation companies that cooperated with the administration .
As Roll Call reports Tuesday , the administration has refused to share internal documents outlining the legal justifications behind the warrantless wiretapping program with the Judiciary Committee .
Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and Ranking Member Arlen Specter called those conditions " unacceptable " in a letter to White House counsel Fred Fielding Monday .
The Judiciary Committee may introduce its own FISA - update proposal or refuse to act on the Intelligence Committee 's bill , sponsored by Chairman John Rockefeller ( D - WV ) .
However , according to Roll Call , if the committee fails to act , the Rockefeller measure could proceed unchanged .
Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he will work with Dodd and other critics to correct flaws in the bill and he called on the administration to hand over requested documents , but he has not committed to honoring Dodd 's proposed hold .
" The Judiciary Committee has an important role in making sure the final protect is constitutional and legally sound , " Reid said from the Senate floor Monday .
" Unfortunately , the Administration has chosen again to stonewall Congress in providing all the information and documents needed for Congress to properly consider this legislation . "
Dodd said he was hopeful that telecom immunity would be excised from a Senate bill ; companion legislation in the House did not contain an immunity provision , but Republicans have succeeded in blocking floor consideration of that measure for now .
Dodd spoke live from Iowa today in the following video posted on UStream.tv :

Due to fallout from a recent computer catastrophe at work , I had the opportunity to salvage 2 GB of memory .
I installed the memory in my work box , which brings it up to 4 gigabytes of RAM -- 4,096 megabytes in total .
But that 's not what I saw in System Information :
Only 3,454 megabytes .
Dude , where 's my 4 gigabytes of RAM ?
The screenshot itself provides a fairly obvious hint why this is happening : 32 - bit Operating System .
In any 32 - bit operating system , the virtual address space is limited , by definition , to the size of a 32 - bit value :
232 = 4,294,967,296
4,294,967,296 / ( 1,024 x 1,024 ) = 4,096
As far as 32 - bit Vista is concerned , the world ends at 4,096 megabytes .
That 's it .
That 's all there is .
No ms .
Addressing more than 4 GB of memory is possible in a 32 - bit operating system , but it takes nasty hardware hacks like 36 - bit PAE extensions in the CPU , together with nasty software hacks like the AWE API .
Unless the application is specifically coded to be take advantage of these hacks , it 's confined to 4 GB .
Well , actually , it 's stuck with even less -- 2 GB or 3 GB of virtual address space , at least on Windows .
OK , so we 're limited to 4,096 megabytes of virtual address space on a 32 - bit operating system .
Could be worse .*
We could be back in 16 - bit land , where the world ended at 64 kilobytes .
Brr. I 'm getting the shakes just thinking about segments , and pointers of the near and far variety .
Let us never speak of this again .
But back to our mystery .
Where , exactly , did the other 642 megabytes of my memory go ?
Raymond Chen provides this clue :
In the absence of the / PAE switch , the Windows memory manager is limited to a 4 GB physical address space .
Most of that address space is filled with RAM , but not all of it .
Memory - mapped devices ( such as your video card ) will use some of that physical address space , as will the BIOS ROMs .
After all the non-memory devices have had their say , there will be less than 4GB of address space available for RAM below the 4GB physical address boundary .
Ian Griffiths offers a more detailed explanation :
To address 4GB of memory you need 32 bits of address bus .
( Assuming individual bytes are addressable . )
This gives us a problem - the same problem that IBM faced when designing the original PC .
You tend to want to have more than just memory in a computer - you need things like graphics cards and hard disks to be accessible to the computer in order for it to be able to use them .
So just as the original PC had to carve up the 8086's 1MB addressing range into memory ( 640 K ) and ' other ' ( 384 K ) , the same problem exists today if you want to fit memory and devices into a 32 - bit address range : not all of the available 4GB of address space can be given over to memory .
For a long time this was n't a problem , because there was a whole 4GB of address space , so devices typically lurk up in the top 1GB of physical address space , leaving the bottom 3GB for memory .
And 3GB should be enough for anyone , right ?
So what actually happens if you go out and buy 4GB of memory for your PC ?
Well , it 's just like the DOS days - there 's a hole in your memory map for the IO .
( Now it 's only 25 % of the total address space , but it 's still a big hole . )
So the bottom 3GB of your memory will be available , but there 's an issue with that last 1GB .
And if you think devices can't possibly need that much memory - mapped IO , I have some sobering news for you : by this summer , you 'll be able to buy video cards with 1 GB of video memory .
To be perfectly clear , this is n't a Windows problem -- it 's an x86 hardware problem .
The memory hole is quite literally invisible to the CPU , no matter what 32 - bit operating system you choose .
The following diagram from Intel illustrates just where the memory hole is :
The proper solution to this whole conundrum is to use a 64 - bit operating system .
However , even with a 64 - bit OS , you 'll still be at the mercy of your motherboard 's chipset and BIOS ; make sure your motherboard supports using 4 GB or more of memory , as outlined in this MSKB article .
264 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 / ( 1,024 x 1,024 ) / 8 = 2 exabytes
In case you 're wondering , the progression is giga , tera , peta , exa .
Although the performance benefits of 64 - bit are somewhat dubious on the desktop , a 64 - bit OS absolutely essential if you run applications that need to use more than 2 GB of memory .
It 's not common , but we 're getting there .
The memory hole for IO still exists in the 64 - bit world , but most modern BIOSes allow you to banish the IO memory hole ( pdf ) to some ( for now ) ridiculously high limit when you 're running a 64 - bit OS .
Do n't get too excited , though .
The user - mode virtual address space in 64 - bit Windows is a mere 8 terabytes .
Suffice it to say that we wo n't be running out of physical or virtual address space on 64 - bit operating systems for the forseeable future .
It 's the final solution , at least for the lifetime of everyone reading this blog post today .
Here 's one parting bit of advice : if , like me , you 're planning to stick with a 32 - bit operating system for the next few years , do n't waste your money on 4 GB of RAM .
You wo n't be able to use it all .
Buy 3 GB instead .
Every motherboard I 'm aware of will happily accept 2 x 1 GB and 2 x 512 MB DIMMs .

The SS Patrick Henry was the first Liberty ship launched . *
Photo : Courtesy of Archives.gov * 1941 : SS Patrick
Henry , the first Liberty ship , is launched at the Bethlehem - Fairfield Shipyard near Baltimore , Maryland .
Originally referred to as " emergency vessels , " these cargo ships were among the first to be mass - produced .
Numbers were critical as the Allies hustled to recover from the staggering losses wrought by German submarines during the Battle of the Atlantic .
These vessels became known as Liberty ships after President Roosevelt , christening the Patrick Henry , quoted the ship 's namesake : " Give me liberty , or give me death . "
Liberty ships represented the assembly line fully realized .
The keel was laid in traditional fashion but the ship was then constructed from prefabricated sections welded together in the graving dock .
Although it took 244 days to build the Patrick Henry , the average dropped to a mere 42 days per ship by the middle of the war .
One Liberty , the SS Robert E. Peary , was built in an astounding four days at the Kaiser shipyard in Richmond , California .
This was largely a publicity stunt , however , and the feat was not repeated .
Although the Patrick Henry slid down the ways nearly 10 weeks before the United States came fully into the war , the U.S. Navy was already engaged , helping to escort merchant convoys through the U - boat infested waters of the North Atlantic .
Around 2,700 Liberty ships were built during World War II and many survivors found their way into merchant fleets after the war .
Two fully operational Liberty ships remain afloat : SS Jeremiah O'Brien is tied up in San Francisco and SS John W. Brown is home - ported in Baltimore .
The O'Brien has the distinction of being the sole surviving merchant vessel of the vast armada that took part in the Normandy invasion .
The Patrick Henry , meanwhile , survived the war and was scrapped in 1960 .

Extreme Sailing : The Biggest Boat in the World
It should be noted , for future record , that the President of the United States has just used his power of clemency to sabotage an active criminal investigation into the office of his own Vice President .
In some parallel universes , I have heard tell that such a thing was once itself considered corruption , or obstruction .
It seems at minimum useful to put a footnote in the history books , somewhere , that such a remarkable thing could happen and still receive not merely praise , but unsheepish celebration among people who pretend nightly to be serious about such things .
I think almost everyone involved sees this as what it almost certainly is : Scooter Libby , loyal to the last , is getting his pardon on the installment plan .
There is little advantage -- and distinct disadvantage -- for Bush to pardon the charges entirely , at the moment , but Bush indeed came through with an impeccably timed effort to ensure Libby faced no actual material consequences from his actions .
Facing immediate jail time ?
Then kill the jail time .
All of it , from day one onward .
If Libby was in any actual danger of having to pay his $ 250,000 fine , there seems little doubt he would have seen that part of his sentence commuted as well .
But now Libby is in no imminent danger : problem solved .
Bush has neatly and in one action removed any impetus for Libby -- or anyone else -- to cooperate with government investigators .
There is no leverage a prosecutor can use against Libby , in order to gain a plea deal in exchange for information that he has so far refused to provide .
Conservative backers have contributed more than five million dollars in a slush fund for Libby 's defense , and are eager to help him in his hour of need ; it seems hard to believe that Libby himself will ever have to contribute even one thin dime towards his own fine .
He will be , presuming his appeal runs its course in the next year and a half without still more intervention , a convicted felon , but one whose sole substantive punishment will be the well - financed adulation of his supporters as a true martyr .
We should note here , for the record , the magnificent - if - selective cowardice of Scooter Libby .
He allowed Judith Miller to go to jail for three months on his behalf , keeping his silence until the pressure had built to intolerable levels .
His willingness to sacrifice others -- at least in direct proportion to their access to power -- for his own freedom has at this point been well established .
He relied on the sacrifices of others for his own self - preservation , sacrificing himself in turn only to one thin premise : that lying to investigators was an acceptable thing , in exchange for ... what ?
He lied to investigators , repeatedly and provably , rather than cooperate in a case that threatened to implicate his own more powerful friends .
Seldom is justice in a single case so transparently stratified , each layer of establishment Washington valiantly wounding itself in obsequious service to the one above it .
But after it all , the consequences of the law were considered too much .
Nobody expects a mere Scooter Libby to have the ruggedness of a Martha Stewart , the toughened pastry chef and craftsperson who somehow managed to soldier through jail time on her own without requiring the intervention of two of the four known branches of constitutional government .
Amidst dire pleas from conservatives , President Bush cited the excessiveness of Libby 's 30 - month sentence , and substituted not 15 months , or even one , or even one lazy afternoon , but instead deemed even a single hour to be excessive , for the crime of obstructing justice in an investigation into his own White House , and the office of his own Vice President .
No clearer signal to future prosecutors could possibly be given , short of simply Xeroxing up clemencies on cardstock to be distributed as Christmas gifts -- and we may yet see that .
Let me reemphasize : George W. Bush claimed repeatedly that the sentence in this case was excessive .
But when it came time to decide what punishment would not be excessive , Bush chose zero .
Not a month , a week , or even a single summer day in jail would be appropriate in this case of obstruction , the President asserted .
Even the prospect of a single hour behind bars , for this particular most senior of senior members of the Vice President 's staff , required immediate neutralizing action .
Eighteen months from now , on some mid-January day , Libby will of course be lauded for his great service to the nation -- that service in no way being the remarkable ability to keep his mouth tightly shut in face of a criminal investigation into activities at the White House , perish the thought -- and fully pardoned .
Bush 's statement about respecting jury opinions will be recast once again , this time to the effect of " I respect the jury opinions , but Scooter has had quite the rough time of it lately , what with all these investigations and indictments and whatnot , and has suffered enough .
Let the healing begin ! "
This will be lauded by administration members , administration friends , other indicted members of the Republican party , and by " centrist " pundits eager to ply all of them for quotes and insights .
The mere premise that a member of his administration would be held accountable for criminal actions as others would be is not just unthinkable , but has been a matter of great contention throughout Bush 's presidency , requiring elaborate fictions of legalese to defend even the transparently illegal , such as domestic espionage and torture , and even more tortured justifications for reasons why no such justifications need be given in the first place .
This case is , and has been , a touchstone .
Scooter Libby was indicted and convicted for obstruction of justice in a criminal investigation that reached into the office of the Vice President himself , and that obstruction of justice is still ongoing .
It has not gone away .
It has not been resolved .
The only change is that , now , the President of the United States has interrupted the trial process , the appeal process , the prospects for plea and negotiation , and the ongoing White House investigation itself in order to preemptively inoculate the most key witness in the case from further investigation , testimony , or punishment .
There is no rationale that justifies such an act , and merely being used to such levels of corruption on the part of the Bush administration and the rest of the conservative movement in service of the quest for unitary power does not excuse that corruption .
Bush may have never been willing to discuss an " ongoing case " inside his White House , but he was more than willing to use his Constitutional powers to shut it down at the precise moment judgment suddenly became a material , tactile thing .
When seeking clemency for a criminal obstruction of justice , it is always considered a stroke of luck to have committed the obstruction on behalf of individuals with the power to grant such clemency .
And when predicting actions on the part of George W. Bush , it 's always best to presume he would take the exact same actions a crime boss would take , if a crime boss were in a position to take them .
With each passing day , Bush becomes a little less presidential , and a little more like Al Capone with an Air Force .
On the morning of August 28 , Dutch plainclothes police raided the home of exiled Filipino revolutionary leader Jose Maria Sison in Utrecht , the Netherlands , arrested him and charged him with ordering the murder of two persons in the Philippines in 2003 .
According to his wife , they broke down the front door without bothering to ring or knock , bruising her arm as they prevented her from making a phone call .
They carted away computers , documents , CDs , and other files , remaining until the evening while she was instructed to sit in a corner .
Eight other locations were simultaneously raided .
Sison was not at home the time .
Luis Jalandoni , the chief peace negotiator for the Filipino Maoist rebels in their talks with the Government of the Philippines , details what happened :
“ The Dutch Police called up Prof .
Sison to invite him to the police station because according to them there were new developments on the complaint that Prof. Sison had filed in 2001 .
Thinking that it was about the complaint he filed on an assassination plot that was hatched by the then incumbent [ Joseph ] Estrada government against him , Prof .
Sison brought with him some documents pertinent to the said complaint .
“ But when he arrived at the police station , he was separated from his three companions that included his lawyer .
They learned later that Prof.
Sison had been whisked away to a jail complex in Scheveningen formerly used by the Nazis for detaining Dutch resistance fighters on the patently spurious charge of ordering the murder of [ Arturo ] Kintanar and [ Romulo ] Tabara . ”
Sison remains in the National Penitentiary in Scheveningen in The Hague where the judge before whom he appeared August 31 states he will remain in solitary confinement for up to 14 days .
According to his lawyer , Jan Fermon , the official charge against him is “ incitement to murders ” in the Philippines .
Its proximate cause , according to the Philippines mainstream press , was affidavits filed with the Philippines Department of Justice last year by the wives of Kintanar and Tabara ( themselves former communists expelled from the movement ) followed by visits to the Dutch Embassy in Manila .
Sison has lived in Holland since 1987 .
The 68 - year - old former professor of English literature and accomplished poet headed the newly refounded Communist Party of the Philippines from 1968 to 1977 .
During these years the party ’s military arm , the New People ’s Army ( NPA ) , made extraordinary advances in its People ’s War to topple the U.S. - backed dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos .
Captured by Marcos ’ troops in 1977 , Sison spent years in prison , including a year and a half strapped to a cot , in solitary confinement before he was released in 1986 by President Corazon Aquino following the “ People Power ” revolution that drove Marcos and his notorious wife Imelda out of the country .
Since then he has served as chairman of the International League of Peoples Struggle , and Chief Political Consultant to the National Democratic Front of the Philippines in its off - again on - again peace talks with the Manila government .
The CPP has stated for 20 years that Sison is no longer involved in operational decisions and serves from Europe in an advisory role .
In 1986 , after he was freed from prison , Sison embarked on a world lecture tour .
In October he accepted the Southeast Asia WRITE award for a book of his poems from the Crown Prince of Thailand in Bangkok .
While visiting the Netherlands three months later , he was informed that his passport had been revoked and that charges had been filed against him under the Anti-Subversion Law of the Philippines .
Those charges were later dropped , as have subsequent charges filed by authorities in the Philippines .
But meanwhile the New People ’s Army has acquired control of about 8000 villages and perhaps 20 % of the Philippines countryside .
( It claimed as of 2003 to have 128 guerrillas zones , covering 60 % of the villages in the country . )
Since 2004 , the Armed Forces of the Philippines have designated the NPA “ Number One security threat ” to the nation ( i.e. , greater than the Muslim secessionist forces or the allegedly al - Qaeda - linked puny bandit group Abu Sayyaf ) .
The U.S. government , alarmed by communist advances , moved immediately after 9 - 11 ( which helped justify moves against any kind of “ terrorism ” anywhere in the world ) to dispatch troops to the Philippines in what was briefly billed as the “ second front ” in the “ War on Terror . ”
The ostensible target was Abu Sayyaf , although the Filipino Maoists suggested that U.S. forces ( expelled by an act of the Philippines Senate in 1992 but now invited back by Macapagal - Arroyo ) might ultimately be deployed against them .
In August 2002 , U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell announced with some fanfare that it had decided to declare Sison a “ terrorist . ”
The CPP as well as the NPA were already on the list of “ foreign terrorist organizations ” prepared by the State Department and rubber - stamped by Congress every two years .
To make the list one has to ( 1 ) be foreign , ( 2 ) engage in terrorist activity , and ( 3 ) threaten the security of U.S. citizens or U.S. “ national security . ”
“ Terrorist activity ” according to Section 212 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( B ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 defines this as “ any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed ( or which , if committed in the United States , would be unlawful under the laws of the United States or any State ) ” involving hijacking or sabotage of any aircraft , vessel , or vehicle ; kidnapping ; violent attacks on “ internationally protected ” persons ; assassination ; use of biological , chemical , or nuclear weapons ; use of explosives or firearms “ with intent to endanger , directly or indirectly , the safety of one or more individuals or cause substantial damage to property ; ” and / or the threat , attempt or conspiracy to do any of the above , or to incite people to do so , or to collect information on potential terrorist targets , or to collect funds for terrorist attacks .
By this definition , any violent rebellion against any government — however oppressive and illegitimate — anywhere is “ terrorist , ” or can be so defined at the whim of a State Department the entire world associates with lawless violence .
( It would have criminalized the American Revolution , for god ’s sake , and smeared the Founding Fathers as “ terrorists . ” )
But Powell ’s explanation for the blacklisting of the CPP and Sison was specifically as follows : “ The CPP , a Maoist group , was founded in 1969 [ sic ] with the aim of overthrowing the Philippine government through guerrilla warfare .
CPP ’s military wing , the New People ’s Army strongly opposes any U.S. military presence in the Philippines and has killed U.S. citizens there . ”
( These allegedly include a U.S. Army colonel , a military intelligence agent , two U.S. Air Force airmen , and two Ford Corporation employees over many years during which the U.S. stationed military forces in the Philippines and actively aided the Marcos regime and its successors in efforts to crush the insurgency . )
Taking their cue from the U.S. State Department , the Council of the European Union ( comprised of the E.U. foreign ministers ) added the CPP and Sison to their own terror lists .
On September 10 , 2002 Sison was informed that in accordance with the Netherlands ’ “ sanction regulation against terrorism ” his benefits had been terminated and his bank account frozen .
He was also ordered to report weekly to a government office , where he had reported monthly for over a decade .
This despite the fact that there were no pending criminal charges against him anywhere in the world .
The city of Utrecht , in which he resides , offered resumption of his stipend on “ humanitarian ” grounds , but only if he implicitly accepted the designation of “ terrorist ” applied to himself .
The Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs explained the decision .
“ The U.S. regards the activities of the CPP / NPA and Sison as a threat for American citizens and for the national security of the American foreign policy .
The CPP is characterized by a strong anti-American attitude .
The organization is a fervent opponent of the pro-American policy of the current Philippine government and the presence of American troops in the country .
In the 80s and 90s , six Americans died in NPA attacks . ”
In other words , the U.S. was applying strong pressure on Amsterdam to demonize and punish Sison for his “ attitude , ” his opposition to the government of Gloria Macapagal - Arroyo , and his association with an organization accused of killing members of the U.S. military supporting the Manila regime .
In a stunning setback to U.S. vilification efforts , that decision was annulled by the European Court of First Instance ( ECFI ) — the EU ’s Supreme Court — just a month and a half ago ( on July 12 ) .
The Luxemburg - based ECFI concluded that Sison had never undergone any criminal investigation by any competent judicial authority concerning any terrorist act .
It stated that EU Council decisions regarding Sison up to June 29 , 2007 were “ violative of the rights of Professor Sison , ” and even ordered the EU to shoulder Sison ’s legal costs .
In a statement issued on July 13 , Sison noted that in “ the Philippines , I have been repeatedly cleared of criminal charges .
At the fall of the Marcos fascist regime in 1986 , I was cleared of the charges of rebellion and subversion .
In 1992 the charge of subversion that had been trumped up in 1988 was nullified .
In 1994 the charge of multiple murder arising from the Plaza Miranda bombing [ in 1971 , in which 8 members of the Liberal Party were killed , and which was used by the Marcos government as the pretext to declare martial law ] was dismissed by the Manila prosecutors as something based on speculation .
In 1998 the Philippine secretary of justice issued a certification that there were no pending criminal charges against me .
“ In 2003 , the Arroyo regime started to fabricate charges of rebellion and common crimes against me .
But in a recent decision in early this month , the Philippine Supreme Court has rendered null and void the identical false allegations of rebellion against more than 50 accused , including the Batasan 6 , some NDFP [ National Democratic Front of the Philippines ] legal consultants and myself . ”
These legal defeats of the Philippines government headed by the grotesquely corrupt President Gloria Macapagal - Arroyo , and of the U.S. - orchestrated attack on Sison in Europe form the backdrop of this latest move against the Maoist leader .
This time he ’s accused of responsibility for the killings of Tabara and Kintanar , two former Maoists ( expelled from the CPP in the early 1990s ) killed in 2003 and 2004 by the NPA in actions for which the guerrillas indeed take responsibility .
They were proponents of a strategy of urban guerrilla warfare , especially in Davao City , using NPA “ Sparrows ” to attack military and police personnel during the 1980s .
The urban guerrilla strategy was predictably condemned in the harshest terms by the Filipino and western governments at the time , and it is curious to see them bemoaning the fate of the deceased whom they would surely at the time have denounced as terrorists .
All the more curious because the CPP seem to agree with that assessment .
Gregorio Rosal , spokesperson for the Communist Party of the Philippines , stated in a five - page statement to the Philippines media in 2004 that the NPA metes out the death penalty “ only on those found guilty beyond reasonable doubt ” of having committed heinous crimes .
He said that a People ’s Court had tried Kintanar in 1993 and declared him guilty of several crimes and listed them as follows :
1. Masterminding , launching and propagating gangster operations , including kidnap - for - ransom , bank holdups , and dollar - counterfeiting operations while still in the CPP .
He cited as examples the kidnapping of Japanese businessman Noboyuki Wakaoji in 1986 and Bombo Radyo - Philippines owner Roger Florete in 1989 where Kinatanar and his men allegedly earned $ 10 million and P15 million in ransom , respectively .
2. Stealing massive amounts of funds from the Party .
3. Instigating factionalism and attempts to destroy the revolutionary movement .
The CPP has further charged that Kintanar was an “ intelligence agent of the [ Manila ] government ’s military and police since 1992 , ” and was a “ project officer in an assassination plot against Prof. Jose Maria Sison in the Netherlands ” in 2000 ( to which Jalandoni alludes above , and to which Sison has brought Dutch authorities ’ attention ) .
Tabara , according to the Maoists , was apprehended by CPP officials in a parking lot on Sept. 26 , 2004 .
He pulled a gun when they attempted to arrest him for murdering an elderly peasant leader and they shot him to death .
This happened in a society in which the regime in power employs death squads .
The human rights group Karapatan states that more than 800 left - wing activists have been extra-judicially killed since 2001 .
The Bush administration makes no fuss about that , or the fact that there were 1200 people on death row in the Philippines in June 2006 when the Philippines Congress passed a law banning the death penalty .
The official justice system in the Philippines is widely perceived as fraudulent .
But the U.S. and its allies validate it while treating the people ’s courts as illegitimate and tools of terrorists answering to Sison in his Utrecht exile .
This is the context of Sison ’s arrest .
It is not about some “ murders ” in the Philippines .
It ’s about cracking down on the People ’s War in the Philippines , which has made some major strides in the last few years .
It ’s about U.S. pressure on Europe to kowtow to its broad concept of “ terrorism ” and to exhaust the potential of the paranoia it ’s whipped up to demonize any “ anti- American ” target anywhere .
I suggested as early as June 2002 that there would be “ red targets in the Terror War ” and Sison has been for some time a high - profile target .
His arrest in Holland , surely with the encouragement of the Bush administration , is not just an attack on a distinguished leader but a warning to all who sympathize with the global revolutionary left and its armed struggles .
Meanwhile the “ terrorist ” designation can be flexibly applied to anyone Washington wants to set up .
The State Department is reportedly about to declare Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards — a whole branch of a country ’s military — a “ terrorist organization . ”
This is a huge leap from targeting violent non-state organizations with the label .
Reportedly the Europeans regard this step as provocative and worrisome .
( It paves the way , among other things , for U.S. forces to treat the Revolutionary Guards as “ illegal combatants ” not covered by the Geneva Conventions , hence subject to torture in the event of war with Iran . )
But it ’s the natural culmination of the Bush / Cheney fear - mongering , blackballing strategy .
What ’s next ?
Declaring the Cuban militia “ terrorist ” ?
The whole Venezuelan or Russian or Chinese Army ?
One recalls the medieval Church declaring this or that “ anathema ” or heretical , marked by Satanism or witchcraft .
Such verdicts were intended to spell death for those so marked , and to intimidate and silence any inclined to defend them if they stubbornly resisted the legitimacy of the judge .
Sometimes they were applied to whole nations .
One would think such pontifical arrogance had died centuries ago .
But here we have it again in the thuggish U.S. administration trying yet failing to secure the world ’s obedience using tactics resembling both those of the Inquisition and those of the terror - inflicting fascists in the 1930s .
As Maoists movements press on , especially in South Asia , Marxists of all stripes may increasingly come into Washington ’s crosshairs , alongside those that it chooses to term “ Islamist terrorists . ”
The U.S. government continues to categorize the Nepali Maoists as terrorists , even though they have laid aside their arms for the time being and assumed posts in the new Nepali government .
It must note with alarm news of a Maoist People ’s War unfolding in the small but strategically located country of Bhutan .
While it coddles the Cuban anti-Castro terrorist Luis Posada Carriles , supports Jundallah ( God ’s Brigade ) in attacks on Iran , and continues a long tradition of support for other pro-U.S. terrorists including the notorious Contras of Nicaragua , Washington zeroes in revolutionaries like Sison , enraged that they with their undying rebellious spirit still exist in this world it feels it owns , in which it demands the right to monopolize terror .
* * * * *
Several Filipino Congressmen have rallied to Sison ’s defense .
Rep. Satur Ocampo of the Bayan Muna Party ( himself arrested on bogus , decades - old murder charges in March but then released ) has suggested that the Arroyo government wants to sabotage the peace talks .
His colleague from the same party , Rep. Teddy Casiño , agreed .
The arrest “ will result in an all - out war and lead to the end of peace negotiations , ” he declares .
Ocampo charges that the Dutch and Philippine governments are “ conniving ” against Sison , and that “ [t ] here seems to be an irregularity in the arrest , although I ’m not familiar with their procedures .
But it looks like from our practice here , it only means they are looking for evidence when they also raided his office and confiscated all the materials there . ”
Rep. Crispin Beltran said the Dutch government erroneously arrested Sison on “ preposterous ” charges designed “ to sabotage the chances of peace talks and attack the NDF . ”
Meanwhile Dutch and Filipino supporters are organizing a petition campaign .
Hastily arranged demonstrations have occurred in the Philippines , Netherlands , U.S. ( New York and L.A. ) and Hong Kong .
Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark has offered his services as an attorney , describing Sison as “ a gentle person … and inspiring leader ” and “ great man . ”
“ Everyone who is concerned about peace and freedom has to be greatly distressed over the arrest of Joma Sison , ” he told members of the New York Committee for Human Rights in the Philippines last week .
“ Sison is a great spirit that the world needs to know about , a great voice that the world needs to hear .
The demonization will destroy us if we permit it to continue . ”
It ’s heartening that a former U.S. attorney general , predecessor to the unsavory likes of John Mitchell , Edwin Meese , John Ashcroft , and Alberto Gonzales , can still say such things openly in these proto - fascist times .
It suggests that the lawlessness infecting our own legal system ( especially since 9 - 11 , and justified by carefully fanned “ terrorism ” fears ) — a bullying lawlessness that infects allies ’ legal systems and the operations of a compromised UN — is not unchallengeable or needs to intimidate all who feel disgusted by the demonization and lies .
Clark ( 79 ) who once served President Lyndon Johnson at the height of the Vietnam War somehow evolved into a trenchant critic of imperialism .
That gives his word all the more weight for anyone concerned about peace and freedom and inclined to listen .
Thank God No One In America Can Remember Anything About Anything Ever
Donald Rumsfeld on Wednesday :
" But some seem not to have learned history 's lessons ... once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism . "
George Bush yesterday :
The war we fight today is more than a military conflict ; it is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century ... As veterans , you have seen this kind of enemy before .
They 're successors to Fascists , to Nazis , to Communists , and other totalitarians of the 20th century .
And history shows what the outcome will be .
Where were both of these speeches given ?
At the national convention of the American Legion .
And what was the American Legion up to in the 1920s and 30s ?
Let 's ask one of the greatest reporters of the 20th century , George Seldes :
In a interview in January 1923 , Commander - in - Chief Alvin Owsley of the American Legion not only endorsed Mussolini and Fascism , but announced his readiness to do what the Duce did , that is , upset the democratic form of government , establish a reign of terror , maintain a dictatorship where the masses of people are deprived of all civil rights .
" If ever needed , " he said , " the American Legion stands ready to protect our country 's institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with the destructionists who menaced Italy . "
Asked whether that meant taking over the government , he replied : " Exactly that ... Do not forget that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States . "
And who were those loathsome appeasers whom Donald Rumsfeld hates so much ?
Prior to April , 1941 , his journal now discloses , [ Charles ]
Lindbergh was exceedingly active behind the scenes in generating antiwar sentiment .
The flier worked intimately with Robert R. McCormick , the publisher of the Chicago Tribune ; Robert Wood , board Chairman of Sears , Roebuck ; former president Herbert Hoover , Henry Ford , Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia , Hanford MacNider [ co - founder of the American Legion ] , Senator Burton K. wheeler of Montana and John T. Flynn , the economist .
Now , it should be said that even at the time there were contrary currents within the American Legion .
Moreover , organizations do n't have an immutable character , and they do some worthwhile things today .
Nevertheless , the leadership remains genuinely reactionary ... and given their history , speeches to them about standing up to fascism are strongly contraindicated .
Jipi and the paranoid chip By Neal Stephenson ( excerpt as appeared in Forbes , July 7 , 1997 )
THIS IS THE highest - resolution video you can get , better than reality ,  says Mr. Cardoza .
He gropes across the dark table top for the joystick and zooms in on the face of a white woman sitting in the lobby , sipping tea and reading a magazine .
Jipi tacitly deconstructs the white womans makeup system , which is recently applied ( its about 9 a.m. ) and about as well done as anything shes ever seen on an actual person , as opposed to an actress .
So that s the kind of person who stays at the Manila Hotel .
One reason watching films is fun is that you can gape at beautiful people without being , or even feeling like , a creep .
But film actors always look perfect .
Even when a nearby detonation blows a ton of muck all over them , you know the dirt will end up in neat , bone - structure - enhancing diagonal streaks under the cheekbones .
In a certain sense this gets boring after a while .
You never get to stare at real people , with all of their mistakes and imperfections , in the same way you can stare at film stars .
Unless , that is , youve got a rig like Mr. Cardozas concealed in a nearby flower arrangement .
Hes absolutely right about the resolution .
Jipi zooms in on the womans left eye and finds that her eyeliner , which from arms length would look flawless , is in fact as jiggly as a seismograph tracing : a permanent record of every cappuccino - induced tremor that passed through her hand when she was applying it , and of every rumble that shook the hotels foundations from the heavy equipment of the All - Manila Sanitary Sewer System Overhaul Project ( Amsssop ) , which is advancing on the Hotel as noisily and inexorably as great big mechanized armies did way back when .
Jipi can see the tweedy striations in the womans iris as it reciprocates across the page of her magazine .
But then , either there is a minor temblor or else one of those Amsssop caterpillars across the street strikes bedrock , and the vibration turns the image into an elliptical blur that almost makes Jipi a little queasy .
Mr. Cardoza gropes for the joystick and zooms way back .
 That s too close anyway ,  he says .
Then he reconsiders .
 At least , it is for me .
Some of our Guest Comfort Facilitators concentrate entirely on the nostrils .
 Makes sense . 
 Most find that nostril dilation is only one clue ,  he cautions .
 More important is the overall facial expression .
In combination with the Tactical Overlay , this should enable you to achieve virtually 100 % mindshare management . 
 Oh yeah , I was going to ask you ,  Jipi says , if a guest asks me , I should tell them Im a Guest Comfort Facilitator , right ?
Not a Mindshare Manager .
The whole concept of the latter term actually falling on a guests s ears is so mortifying to Mr. Cardoza that the only response he can muster is nervous laughter .
Then he changes the subject .
 Here is a developing situation ,  he says .
 What s happening at the main entrance ?
 Looks like those Russians are finally piling onto their tour bus . 
 Yes , but what are the implications for you ? 
 The doormen are having to hold the doors open for a long time . 
Jipis eyes move to one of the Tactical Overlays .
 Uh - oh .
Winds are vectored from an Amsssop site . 
 Which one ? 
 The one they just opened up yesterday . 
 Very good .
That s an important detail . 
Jipi pokes at some controls and brings up a floor plan of the lobby .
It s randomly speckled with blue dots .
But some of the dots near the door have begun to turn green .
 Sensor grid has picked up a fresh infusion of hydrogen sulfide .
The green spreads from dot to dot like pneumonic plague through a jammed cathedral .
But then it begins to die down .
 Oh !
The neutralizers must have kicked in .
 Remember , hydrogen sulfide is just a bellwether !
Mr. Cardoza says , getting really excited and frustrated , like a boy watching someone play a game that hes much better at .
 Remember : new digging .
Just opened up yesterday .
 Oh , yeah , so there s going to be an aerobic decomposition spike !
Jipi pokes at the controls some more and finally brings up an overlay labeled PUTRESCINE ( SMELL OF DEATH ) .
And then all she can do is laugh in embarrassment , because every detector within 20 meters of the front doors is red , and its spreading like a few gallons of burning kerosene washing across a polished floor .
The Smell of Death situation has gotten totally out of hand while she was distracted by flashy but essentially unimportant developments on the Rotten Egg Smell front .
 Sorry ! 
 It s okay !
The tacticals only give you hints as to where you should focus your attention . 
 Right !  Jipi glances back up at the high - definition feed of the white woman reading the magazine .
Mr. Cardoza has set the zoom so that they can see her from the waist up anything closer and you get into that cant - see - the - forest - for - the - trees thing .
The womans sitting with thighs crossed .
Shes got the magazine folded back on itself and is holding it in both hands .
But now she lets it drop just a couple of inches onto her knee , and her eyes rotate fractionally upwards , and in the high - def video its easy to see them changing focusshes staring at the floor now .
Her chest rises and her nostrils flare slightly .
Jipi says ,  Do you want me to 
 Emilys on it ,  Mr. Cardoza says , grabbing the joystick and zooming violently backwards .
 One of our best . 
And sure enough , a young , well - dressed Filipina has arrived on the scene and nearly toppled into the white womans lap .
Shes got one hand cupped over her eye .
Then she does a prim , girlish deep knee bend and begins groping at the carpet .
 She is pretending to have lost a contact lens ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 Beg your pardon , sir , but is nt that kind of an obvious gambit ? 
 Admittedly ,  he says .
 We are careful to use it only once every two or three weeks .
But it seems to have worked in this case .
Let s review .
Mr. Cardoza rewinds the video a few seconds and then plays it back .
They watch the white woman in closeup as she inhales the first traces of the Smell of Death into her nostrils .
The faintest shadow of a new expression passes over her face .
It s not turning into the sort of expression that a hotel manager wants to see on the faces of his guests .
But then the womans eyes dart upwards as shes distracted by the little drama of the lost contact , and a few moments later shes actually helping Emily grope around on the carpet .
 You see ? 
Mr. Cardoza says triumphantly .
 She smelled it .
But before her mind consciously realized what she was smelling , Emily derailed her train of thought .
First - rate work .
Jipi knows the score here .
 And the guest is going to focus on Emily for a while long enough for the ventilation system to handle this putrescine transient because ...
He shrugs .
 Basically because Emilys got a nice personality .
You can bet on it . 
Mr. Cardoza is the general manager of Mindshare Management Associates Inc .
He has mentioned to Jipi a couple of times that he has , in his employ , 75 % of the young women with nice personalities in Metro Manila .
It looks as though hes about to mention it again .
But Mr. Cardoza is in the mindshare business and is enough of a professional to know that if he says it again hell begin to bore her .
Jipis tempted to ask him just what the hell he means when he quotes these authoritative - sounding stats , but this is , after all , her first day on the job , and she doesnt want to blow it .
It s probably something to do with Net reputations .
 But doesnt she subconsciously know that she smelled the Smell of Death ? 
 What are you saying ?  Mr. Cardoza asks , more amused than threatened .
Probably not much makes him feel threatened .
Mindshare Managements revenue has been doubling every six months for the last several years .
 Why dont you just tell each guest that Amsssop is tearing up some 400 - year - old sewers in the neighborhood and the place is going to smell bad for a while , but its only temporary ? 
 The Hotel Xanadu tried that approach when Amsssop was in Makati ,  Mr. Cardoza says airily .
 Oh , we tried to sell them our services , but they thought they knew better .
He snickers .
 They nearly went out of business .
All of their guests said ,  Oh , you admit that your hotel smells like death , and so why dont you give me a big discount !
It was a disaster . 
 Yeah , but didnt all of the guests who got refunds come away with a high opinion of the Xanadus honesty ? 
 Yes .
Nowadays , the only people who stay at the Xanadu are high - tech businessmen from California , who like to think of themselves as exceptionally rational .
It is a great hotel for Vulcans .
Everyone else avoids the Xanadu as if it were a leper colony . 
 I see . 
 Your question is reasonable ,  Mr. Cardoza admits .
 Subconscious feelings are important of course !
But we are in the reputation business here .
A hotels reputation is compiled from the impressions that its guests register on the Net while they are there and after they have checked out .
This is a conscious act of volition on the guests part . 
 Oh .
So subconscious impressions dont get registered ?
 Our research indicates that they tend not to be .
Unless a guest can consciously articulate her feelings about a hotel , those feelings are not liable to be registered on the Net . 
 Got it .
So as long as you can distract them before they consciously realize that the place smells like death , you re okay . 
 It has worked in every hotel that has been downwind of Amsssop .
At least , the ones that have been smart enough to hire us . 
 This is the last phase , right ? 
 Amsssop has been tearing up Manila for nearly a quarter of a century .
With Intramuros , the project finally reaches completion . 
 Then what ?
I guess there are plenty of other opportunities for mindshare management professionals . 
 It is a vast field of opportunity ,  Mr. Cardoza says , then lowers his chin , stares at her significantly , and adds ,  A young woman with a nice personality need never be out of work . 
 I dont know .
Homer says that Nippon cranks out a hell of a lot of girls with nice personalities . 
Mr. Cardoza makes kind of a poofing noise out of his lips and gets a look on his face like hes just taken a big whiff of Amsssop gases .
 Perky doesnt pay the bills . 
 Oh . 
 You dont believe me ?
Then why did Mr. Goto hire you ?
Why did he recommend you to us ? 
Jipi figures its partly that Mr. Goto has the hots for her , but decides not to mention this .
It would only lead to the question of why Homer prefers her to all of those perky Nipponese girls .
She decides its a good time to shut up .
Before it got really valuable , Intramuros was largely bought by the Asian Economic Miracle Management Foundation , a shadowy pan-Asian nonprofit , headquartered out of Tokyo and Hong Kong , whose goal is to help Asian countries that are on the cusp of having their very own economic miracles manage the process in some small way and avoid the mistakes that permanently marred the landscapes of the first economic miracle states .
So now the district is mostly a great big historical park with ancient churches poking out of the lawns from place to place .
At the moment its also got big Goto Engineering trucks and trailers piled here and there , cutting trenches across the lawns , but that s just an Amsssop transient .
It s surrounded by a wall , and the wall is surrounded by a golf course , and the golf course is ringed by skyscrapers that have all gone up in the last couple of decades , since the founding of the Bank of Manila and Kinakuta .
Mindshare Management has its offices in one of those skyscrapers .
In another , on the fiftieth floor , Teebs family has a great big apartment , which doubles as an informal Yapese consulate .
Now that Jipis an official friend of the family , she gets to live in the apartment , surrounded by great big stone coins that are supposedly worth millions of devus .
Teeb frequently flies in from Yap , and then she and Jipi hang out together .
Sometimes they go out on the town right now , theres no better place in the world than Manila to go dancing .
Other times they stay in the apartment and watch old movies , or just look out the windows :
Almost every day theres an amazing sunset over Manila Bay , and when it fades out , the golf courses lights come on and form a lasso of radiant green around Intramuros , which is only lit up in places where people want it to be .
When you enter the park at night , an aerostat a little flying robot about the size of a footballtags along behind you to light your way .
You can tell it to turn its lights off if you want to just look up at the stars , or if you re with your lover and you would like it to be dark .
But Jipis situation on the lover front is extremely labile and so this doesnt come up often .
Jipi does pretty well at the Manila Hotel job .
One morning , most abruptly , she gets promoted to what Mr. Cardoza says , not without a certain ominous vibe , is a much more demanding position .
 Okay , it s like this .
Some company Lamarck Logic developed some software ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 Never heard of them . 
 One of these California high - tech outfits .
They dont write software , they evolve it 
 Oh ... Homer told me about this ,  Jipi says .
Shes not totally comfortable admitting it , but a good deal of what she knows , she knows because at some point in the past Homer decided , for no discernible reason , to tear off on a long winded digression about it .
 It s like they make a bunch of little pieces of software and see which ones are best at doing some job .
Each ones a little different .
Some do a good job , some dont .
The ones that dont get erased .
The others are reproduced , except with small random differences , and then they repeat the cycle for , like , millions of times . 
 Something like that .
Anyway , this particular softwares purpose was to help police officers , and others who were not mental health care professionals , identify paranoid schizophrenics on the Net . 
 Why ? 
The answer , clearly , is that ( a ) Mr. Cardoza doesnt know and ( b ) its not appropriate to evince curiosity about this .
To say as much would be to embarrass himself and to embarrass Jipi respectively .
Mr. Cardoza has not risen to the top of the mindshare management consulting industry by embarrassing himself or others .
So he works it out while hes saying it :  A security thing , I suppose .
Normal criminals behave more or less predictably .
Paranoid schizophrenics , on the other hand , are wild cars . 
 You mean wild cards ? 
 Oh .
Is that where that expression comes from ?
Anyway , they are always doing things that are completely nuts .
Cops worry about this .
And so they wanted some way to identify who was , and wasnt , a paranoid schizophrenic simply by monitoring their Net traffic . 
Jipi comes as close as she ever does to frowning .
Shes been told that what feels like a tremendous frown to her looks like a mildly perplexed look to everyone else .
She is vaguely troubled by the idea that , somewhere in the world , theres a security force that s going around throwing people into straitjackets simply because of what they say on the Net .
 So are you telling me that Lamarck Logic is part of the police department ? 
 Of course not .
They were just a contractor .
To a governmental organization . 
Jipi continues to wear the expression that in her case passes for a frown .
Mr. Cardoza can plainly see it , but , businesslike as ever , plows onwards :  This organization 
 The Black Chamber ? 
Every muscle fiber in Mr. Cardozas body fires simultaneously .
He adopts an expression that Jipi read about in the encyclopedia once , in Mexico , after a neighborhood kid had stepped on a rusty nail ; it is a common symptom among people suffering from end - stage tetanus infections and it is called rigor sardonicus .
 I mean the International Data Transfer Regulatory Organization ,  Jipi says , just trying to patch things up a bit .
 I dont know who the organization was ,  Mr. Cardoza says , sounding a bit fluttery .
 May I continue ?
Time is a factor here .
 Please . 
 They got some actual paranoid schizophrenics who had been institutionalized , and set them up with Net interfaces .
This enabled them to have conversations with individuals who were not physically present .
They also got some test subjects who were , I take it , just normal people , and set them up in cubicles somewhere with Net interfaces of their own .
And they created these evolvers pieces of software with rudimentary conversational skills and provided them with the same interface .
Mr. Cardoza gets up and attempts to draw a triangle on a whiteboard .
But hes one of these guys who is so wrapped up in what hes saying , and so inherently bad at drawing stuff , that this is nothing more than a pro forma gesture something he probably read about in a management book .
Some people think visually !
Try to illustrate key points with simple diagrams .
So a vaguely triangular apparition ends up on the whiteboard .
Qua geometric figure , its so mangled that Mr. Cardozas words end up explicating the diagram , rather than the other way around .
 So we have three types of participants nowright ? 
 Paranoid schizophrenics in cells .
Mentally healthy interviewers in cubicles somewhere else .
And these software thingies on the Net . 
 Yes ,  says Mr. Cardoza , seemingly relieved that Jipi was not completely hurled off the track by his diagram .
He tries to draw a circle in the middle of the triangle and ends up with sort of a mashed ovoid with a Pac - Man - like indentation in one side .
 And then there was a very simple piece of software that would sit in the middle and set up two - way conversations between randomly chosen pairs of entities .
He draws radii from vertices into the circle and then elbows them back out to other vertices .
 So sometimes youd have a normal person talking to a normal person .
Sometimes a paranoid schizophrenic talking to a piece of software .
 Okay , I get the idea .
But I m guessing they werent told . 
 That s right .
It was like a game .
At the end of each conversation , the link would be cut cutting motions with the pen now and each participant would be asked to give his opinion as to whether the entity hed just been conversing with was a paranoid schizophrenic , a normal human , or a piece of software . 
A big question mark , off to one side , now throws the whole diagram off balance , and reminds Mr. Cardoza that there are about 3 square meters of blank whiteboard that he hasnt touched yet .
He begins drawing in other , randomly spaced and sized question marks , striving for some kind of visual balance , but when he steps back away from the whiteboard after drawing each one , he finds that its just thrown the totality of the diagram out of whack , forcing him to step forward again and put an additional question mark somewhere else .
Pretty soon the whiteboard is looking like the Riddlers jumpsuit .
 Why ? 
 The purpose of the experiment , remember , was to evolve software that could distinguish a paranoid schizophrenic from a normal human just by talking to them on the Net ,  Mr. Cardoza mumbles , kind of distracted by ongoing prosecution of the question mark balancing thing .
 And so if a given piece of software gave the correct answer 
 Meaning , it succeeded in distinguishing between a normal human and a paranoid schizophrenic 
 Yes .
Then it would be allowed to reproduce .
If it gave the wrong answer , it would be terminated .
Over time , the software evolved so that it got very good at identifying paranoid schizophrenics . 
 I understand that part .
But you said that , at the end of the conversation , each participant was asked to give its opinion . 
 That s correct ,  he says uneasily , sensing that Jipis dragging him toward some kind of conceptual briar patch .
 But that means that the opinions of the humans the normal ones and the paranoid schizophrenics were being counted too . 
Jipi points at a couple of randomly chosen question marks as if they support this assertion , and Mr. Cardoza , hoist by his own graphical petard , becomes unnerved .
 I suppose so .
Remember , Jipi , I didnt invent this crazy experiment , I m just 
 Why should the humans opinions have counted ? 
Mr. Cardoza presses his lips together and makes his mustache bristle with compressed air , which is what he always does when hes deep in thought .
When hes completely flummoxed he will valve the air into his cheeks and make them into perfectly smooth - shaven hemispheres .
In Jipis experience , perhaps 1 adult male out of 10,000 wears cologne .
Mr. Cardoza is one of these .
She has always wondered why all of that mens cologne is on sale at department stores and duty - free shops if , in the average major city , only about a hundred people are actually wearing it .
But Mr. Cardoza basically never wears the same cologne twice , which helps to explain it .
He never wears too much of it , and he always picks it so that it will complement , in some sense , what he is doing on this particular day .
Today , he smells faintly like a rich , tasteful Middle Eastern gentleman , and Jipi wonders what is in store .
But today he does not bulge his cheeks out in defeat .
Instead he gets a determined and implacable look on his face .
 This was all explained to me at 2 in the morning ,  he says .
 Be patient . 
He sets his pen down .
 The fumes of this pen kill my brain cells . 
He drinks coffee and stares out the window for a few moments , watching the big Goto earthmovers clawing up sewer slop down in Intramuros .
 Okay .
Remember , the goal of the experiment was to create software that would identify the paranoid schizophrenics by conversing with them on the Net . 
 Right . 
 Now , I m no mental health professional , but from what I know of paranoid schizophrenics , Id think that the idea , should it occur to them , that they were conversing , on the Net , with software daemons programmed to hunt them down so that they could be incarcerated , is just the kind of thing that would really set their teeth on edge .
Does that work for you ?
 Sounds very reasonable , Mr. Cardoza . 
 And so then it would be very important for these daemons to be evolved in such a way that they could converse with people on the Net , at least in a limited way , without arousing the suspicions of paranoid schizophrenics . 
 Bingo .
And so , during the experiment , if the human participant was able to peg the software daemon as being a piece of software , and not a human being , then that software daemon would be killed . 
 Right .
But one that could pass for a human being would be allowed to reproduce , et cetera , et cetera . 
 Okay , Mr. Cardoza , it all makes sense .
So after the experiments been going on for a long time , theyve got this population of highly evolved software daemons that , number one , can identify paranoid schizophrenics by conversing with them , and , number two , cannot be recognized as mere pieces of software by the paranoid schizophrenics they are talking to . 
Mr. Cardoza smiles and holds up his index finger .
 Almost . 
 Almost ?
What did I miss ?
 I am not a genetic programmer ,  Mr. Cardoza says ,  but my understanding is that this kind of evolution is extremely slow .
It takes thousands , or millions , of generations to get anything that actually works . 
 Homer was telling me about this ,  Jipi says .
 Mr. Goto ? 
 Yeah . 
It s the second time Jipi has mentioned her sometime boyfriend by name , and shes nor doing it for effect , but it always seems to galvanize Mr. Cardoza , who is clearly one of these guys for whom the entire world of business , finance , politics , etc. is just a superficial skin supported by , but hiding , a much deeper and more complicated and interesting and , in the end , important infrastructure of personal relationships .
This is not an unreasonable way for a Filipino businessman , or anyone , for that matter , to think about it .
But Jipis irked , because ( shes starting to realize ) she has this implicit belief - probably naive , in fact probably beyond naive and verging on eccentric or cultlike that the information Homer imparted to her , when he went off on his ( at the time ) dull and pointless tangent about genetic programming , should be considered on its own merits , as a set of pure ideas , and not as evidence that a certain personal relationship exists between Person A and Person B .
She just wants Mr. Cardoza to listen to the idea , in other words , and not to read between the lines and figure out the hidden implications of the fact that the idea was imparted to her by young entrepreneurial home - run slugger and civil engineering company heir Homa ( Homer ) Goto .
Also , if Jipi were inclined to be insecure , she would worry that Mr. Cardoza has only hired her because he wants to get closer to the Goto family business empire .
As it happens shes not insecure , and shes not worried about that at all .
But even the fact that a guy as deft and sensitive as Mr. Cardoza is doing something that might make some other , hypothetical girl feel that way seems to imply that he sees nothing inappropriate about it Jipi senses a boundary dispute , in other words .
Or maybe shes underestimating Mr. Cardoza .
Maybe he senses that she doesnt have an insecurity problem and so he says things to her he wouldnt dream of saying to a girl who couldnt handle it .
All of which crystallizes in her brain during the time it takes her to say yeah , as a sort of germ of an insight that shell cultivate and unfold and discuss with her friend Teeb later .
 The airline companies wanted to evolve autopilot daemons that could handle certain anomalous situations , like wind shear ,  she says in the meantime .
 But they couldnt very well create a whole bunch of daemons and put them at the controls of jumbo jets and fly them into wind shear to find out which ones were fit to reproduce .
So instead they simulated the wind shear on big computers , and they simulated the airplanes too , so that they could run the experiment on fast - forward and evolve these things in just a few years . 
 Yes .
That s how most people create evolvers ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 We have big computer installations all over Manila doing that kind of thing as we speak .
But what if you want to evolve daemons that are supposed to interact with human beings ?
 Oh !
Then youve got a problem ,  Jipi says .
 Yes .
Because there is no way to speed up human interaction . 
 It s going to be slow going . 
 Every time a new generation of these daemons is evolved , it must be tested for evolutionary fitness by having it interact with human beings .
Sometimes , as in this case , it might have to interact with several human beings for several hours at a time !
Only after this has happened can the breeder  make a decision as to which daemons will be killed , and which will be .
allowed to reproduce .
 So with this paranoid schizophrenic thing - you re telling me that either it had to be a huge experiment , with thousands and thousands of volunteers , or that its not going to produce any results for many years .
Either way , what does Mindshare Management have to do with it ?
Again with the index finger .
 You are forgetting there is one other possibility ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 You told me that the airplane companies created computer simulations of wind shear , so that they could speed up the evolutionary process .
Why not try the same approach here ?
Jipi sees the answer immediately , but it takes several minutes to make herself believe its possible .
She gets pretty involved with thinking about this , and eventually realizes that several minutes have gone by , during which Mr. Cardoza has fielded a couple of important phone calls , and she has at some point raised both hands up to the top of her head and begun massaging her scalp , tracing those little meandering crevices between the plates of her skull .
 Uh ,  she finally says , so you re telling me that they created software to simulate the thought processes of paranoid schizophrenics ?
 Remember ,  Mr. Cardoza says ,  that some of the conversations , in this experiment , were between normal humans and paranoid schizophrenics .
Others were between normal humans and software daemons .
At the end of each conversation  he starts flourishing his pen at the whiteboards question marks .
 The normal human would have to give an opinion as to whether the entity hed just been conversing with was a paranoid schizophrenic or an evolver . 
 Yes . 
 So , if you hooked up the experiment in the right way  
 If you killed the evolvers that were easily recognized as evolvers , and allowed the ones who seemed , to normal humans , like paranoid schizophrenics , to reproduce 
 Eventually ,  Jipi says , youd evolve some software that behaved , on the Net , just like a paranoid schizophrenic . 
 Correct . 
 And then ,  Jipi concludes ,  you could speed up the whole experiment .
Because you could just fire all of the authentic human paranoid schizophrenics  
 Who probably werent such great employees anyway ,  Mr. Cardoza says in a very discreet sotto voce .
 and use the schizo - daemons in their place , just like the wind - shear simulation software zillions of times faster . 
 At that point , they were able to run the experiment in hyper - speed ,  agrees Mr. Cardoza .
 And eventually , they generated some extremely highly evolved software daemons that were capable of sifting out paranoid schizophrenics from the vast torrent of interaction that moves across the Net every day . 
 Well , that s really cool , Mr. Cardoza ,  Jipi says .
Actually shes lying about this because she is still a bit troubled by some of the implications .
But Mr. Cardoza is her boss , and he hired her for her nice personality , and shes diligent about doing what he hired her to do .
A lot of having a job , shes figured out , is playing a role .
Lots of girls are good at having jobs because the same fun role - playing impulse that causes them to enjoy shopping for clothes and experimenting with looks serves them well in this sense .
Jipis never been that kind of girl , particularly , but Teeb certainly is , and as soon as Jipi moved down here to Manila and got a job , Teeb insisted that they do a lot of heavy - industrial clothes shopping .
The job / shopping linkage was completely obscure to Jipi at the time and only recently has she gotten it ; now she can plainly see why youd want to be able to doff your job persona at the end of the day , as easily as peeling off stockings .
 But I still dont understand 
 What this has to do with Mindshare Management . 
 Right . 
 The job weve been hired for , actually , has nothing to do with the paranoid - schizophrenic recognition software ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 It s about a by - product of the experiment .
The schizo - daemons .
 What about them ? 
 When the contract was finished , Lamarck Logic still had , living in its systems , a number of these schizo - daemons , which were interesting but commercially useless .
Their management began searching for some way to turn a profit from them . 
 How can you make money selling software that acts like a paranoid schizophrenic ?
Jipi asks the question rhetorically , but Mr. Cardoza nods calmly and says ,  Yes .
That is the question they asked themselves .
Well , it turns out that such software is just what the doctor ordered for certain commercial applications  particularly in the security industry . 
 You mean securities , like stocks and bonds ? 
Mr. Cardoza laughs , not unkindly , and says ,  That s a great idea , but I was talking about car alarms . 
 Car alarms ? 
 Exactly .
Think about it .
What is a car alarm ?
It is a network of sensors distributed throughout the vehicle .
Some of them listen for the sound of breaking glass .
Some sense opening doors .
Others are tuned to pick up motion .
Some of them use a kind of radar to sense the presence of nearby human bodies .
All of these sensors are wired into a central brain a computer which monitors the inputs that it receives from them , and then tries to make a judgment call as to whether the car is being , or has been , stolen .
This is by no means an easy calculation . 
 Tell me about it !
Jipi cant walk to work without passing several cars whose alarms have gone off for no good reason .
 It s notorious !
False car alarms are a blot on the urban landscape all over the world ! says Mr. Cardoza .
Hes rising to the occasion , and some color is coming into his face .
 Why ?
Because the software living in the brains of car alarms is just too stupid to tell the difference between a stray signal , like a pedestrian brushing against the vehicle , and an actual break - in .
What s needed is not better sensors , but better software .
Lamarck Logic saw a market niche !
 But that s totally wrong !
If the problem is too many false alarms , then it seems like a paranoid schizophrenic is the last thing that you want calling the shots . 
 Well , that s your opinion as a person who is frequently annoyed by false alarms ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 But if you are the chief executive officer of a car alarm company , the last thing you want interpreting the data is a computer brain with an easygoing and mellow personality .
What you would like is a brain that was smart enough to detect spoofing .
 Spoofing . 
 It is sort of a general term , nowadays , meaning any attempt to take advantage of a literal minded computer program by meddling with its inputs .
An example from when I was a boy :
Early car alarms could detect a door being opened , but not a window being broken .
If you smashed a window and crawled in without opening the door , the car alarm did not understand that you were up to something . 
Jipi just tries to restrain the impulse to smile at what sounds a hell of a lot like a confession about Mr. Cardozas misspent youth .
 Of course nowadays the sensors are much more elaborate ,  he continues , blushing slightly ,  but it is still possible to spoof a car alarms brain by feeding it a combination of inputs that will convince it that everything is normal . 
 I see where you re going ,  Jipi says .
 Paranoid schizophrenics are suspicious by nature - when they see something that looks like normal life , they dont just assume that everything is normal . 
 Right ,  says Mr. Cardoza , instead , they assume that the news , the stock market , the
Internet and so on are all being manipulated by some kind of monstrous , hidden conspiracy that just wants everyone to think that everything is normal . 
Like the Black Chamber .
Jipi thinks , but does not say , this .
Instead she says ,  Okay .
So Im guessing that Lamarck Logic cut a deal with a car alarm maker . 
Mr. Cardoza raises his eyebrows , which is Filipino body language for yes .
 The schizo - daemon was modified to handle inputs from the various sensors that make up a good car alarm system .
It was instilled into an ASIC , an Application - Specific Integrated Circuit , and several hundred thousand of them were manufactured by Havoc Mobile Security Systems and shipped throughout the world .
Including to China , where a good many of them were installed in the Mercedes - Benzes of wealthy individuals , and at least one was carefully dismantled in a laboratory . 
 Uh - oh .
Hardware pirates ?
 Yes .
The ASIC was copied .
Within a year of the Havoc systems going on the market , a pirate , black - market version was being manufactured in Shenzhen .
It is essentially the same thing .
It has been a huge success a quarter to a third of the car alarms in Metro Manila contain the pirated version of the schizo - daemon chip . 
 Really ?
So you re telling me that those wailing car alarms that keep me up at night are actually  
Jipi breaks off , unable to say it .
 Paranoid schizophrenics crying for help .
Yes . 
 Well that is quite interesting and it totally makes sense .
But now please forgive me , Mr. Cardoza , but I still am unclear as to how Mindshare Management got involved with this . 
 The factory in Shenzhen wholesales these chips to car alarm manufacturers all over the world .
Some of them ended up in a BaksheeshFree Zone straddling the Egyptian / Libyan border . 
 Baksheesh - Free Zone ? 
 A special economic zone that was set up in the middle of the Sahara Desert , as an experiment to see what would happen . 
 What happened ? 
 It became the most prosperous city in North Africa and turned a generation of Bedouin camel herders into millionaires .
Still , the traditional legal standards of the desert apply .
So in addition to being highly prosperous , it is a place where penalties for crimes such as larceny are immediate and severe , and so there is not the concern for the criminals welfare that is common in some other parts of the world .
Some of these car alarms were then hooked up to explosives . 
 You mean they would blow up if the car got stolen ? 
Mr. Cardoza looks mildly wounded and sorrowful that Jipi has chosen to say it so bluntly .
 An explosive charge would be detonated , yes . 
 But whats the point in that ?
You catch the thief , but your cars been all messed up . 
 In this case it did not matter , because the Baksheesh - Free Zone is a tiny , tiny state surrounded by two vast , poor countries .
All of the cars that were being stolen were being taken to Egypt or Libya , where they were chopped up for parts .
And so any car that was in the hands of a thief for more than about half an hour was certain to be destroyed anyway . 
 So they didnt care .
It was a deterrent . 
 That is correct .
And it worked !
When these things were introduced , a few thieves got blown up in the first week , and then the auto theft rate dropped to nearly zero .
Thieves were terrified .
It was such a success that the company that made them literally a garage operation - ramped up production and began exporting these things to other countries where these kinds of Draconian measures were felt to be acceptable . 
 Which countries ? 
 Well , for our purposes , it hardly matters , because they ended up spreading all over the place .
Just last week , a shopping mall in Beverly Hills got blown up . 
 You mean , a person got blown up in a shopping mall ? 
 No ,  Mr. Cardoza says confidently .
 It was the whole mall . 
 Wait .
I dont understand ,  Jipi says .
 I was imagining , like , a small explosive charge under the driver seat or something .
Enough to kill or maim the driver . "
 It all depends on what you mean by small ,  says Mr. Cardoza .
 Explosives these days are astonishingly powerful .
Apparently , what happened is as follows :
The small garage company that was making the explosive alarm systems could not handle the flood of orders that came in , and so they had to farm out the assembly of these units to small jobbers all over Egypt , Libya , and Sudan .
Quality control was , shall we say , uneven .
The components including the explosive charges were purchased haphazardly , from whatever suppliers could be rounded up on a moments notice .
Pallets of explosives were drop - shipped to these jobbers without labels , at least labels that the workers knew how to read .
They had no idea what they were working with , or how much of the stuff to use ; some of them used tiny dabs of it and some used hunks the size of cantaloupes .
Some of it was low - power stuff some was extremely high - power . 
 Okay , I see where you re going . 
 Well , just this morning I received an urgent call from guess who ? 
 I wouldnt even dare to guess at this point . 
 The chief executive officer of Havoc Mobile Security Systems . 
 Why ? 
 Because they are terrified that word will get around that the ASIC that made the decision to blow up the mall in Beverly Hills is a copy of the one that they use in all of their systems . 
 I see . 
 Havoc has already been in touch with the entrepreneur in the Baksheesh - Free Zone who started this whole thing .
He was able to trace the serial number that was sifted out of the debris of that mall .
It was one of four dozen car alarm systems that were assembled by a particular jobber based in Libya , who , it turns out , received an inordinately large drop - shipment of high explosive Cold War Semtex , way past its expiration date . 
 Oh .
Ill bet those Libyan workers had a heck of a time reading the Czech warning labels . 
 They didnt even try .
They simply divided the pallet - load into four dozen parts of equal size .
 One for each of the alarms they were contracted to assemble . 
 Yes . 
 And one of those four dozen pieces took out the mall in Beverly Hills . 
 Correct . 
 Which means that 47 of them are still out there somewhere . 
 Fortunately , Havoc was able to give me some crucial information . 
 Oh , of course !  Jipi says .
 Havoc knows who the alarms were sold to .
And theyve hired us to contact the owners and explain the situation to them .
And were just the right company for the job , because we have a lot of people with nice personalities who can explain this whole scary business to customers without getting them terribly upset . 
Mr. Cardoza shakes his head sadly .
 This fellow in the Baksheesh - Free Zone has no idea where they ended up .
He sold them to a distributor in Djibouti who , apparently , resold them to any number of black - market operations around the world , and then dropped out of sight the moment this mall blew up .
So they could be anywhere now . 
 But you said that Havoc gave you some crucial information ! 
 Ah , yes !
They gave us the Internet addresses of those 47 car alarms . 
 What good does that do us , Mr. Cardoza ? 
 Well , all car alarms nowadays are connected to the Internet via packet radio .
Otherwise theyd be kind of useless ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 So we can ... talk to them ? 
 You can talk to them , Jipi .
Soothe them .
Get them to relax .
A buzzer sounds from Mr. Cardozas Internet terminal .
 Ah , theres one now ! 
 Wait a second ,  Jipi says .
 No time to wait ! Mr. Cardoza says .
 Lives are at stake .
Hes furiously beckoning her over to the terminal .
 What s going on ?
Who am I about to talk to ?
Mr. Cardoza looks a bit impatient .
 It should be obvious that these schizo - daemons were optimized for textual interaction on the Net .
That is , unlike , say , the brain of a toaster , they are capable of having conversations with people . 
 Sure .
Because that was the only way to evolve them . 
 That s what I m saying !
So the knockoffs that ended up in these car alarms have the same capability , even though its rarely used .
When they start to become suspicious that they are being stolen , they tend to voice their feelings on the Net .
And since we now know the addresses they are transmitting from , we have arranged for everything that they transmit to be piped right here to our offices .
To this terminal !
Sit down !
Sit down !
Jipi sits down in Mr. Cardozas chair , which is way too low for her and , like a kid peering over the steering wheel , looks at his Net desktop : a good couple of square meters of high - resolution interactive screen space , totally cleared now except for one tabloid - size text window .
At the top of the window is a title that specifies the Net address of ( apparently ) a particular car alarm .
Most of the window itself is blank , but there is the following line of text :
I have a bad feeling about my overall situation .
 What do you want me to do ? 
Jipi asks , literally throwing up her hands .
 Two things ,  Mr. Cardoza says in whats intended to be a soothing tone .
 Try to calm it down , and try to draw it out .
Get clues . 
 Clues ? 
 As to what city its in .
Your conversation will be monitored .
Once the authorities figure out approximately where the alarm is located , they can zero in on it by tracing the packet radio transmissions .
 But 
 Type something !
Something nice !
Jipi takes a couple of deep breaths to compose herself , then puts her hands on the keyboard and
types :
Sometimes I feel that way too .
Who is this ?
My names Jipi .
 Oh , for Gods sake , dont use your real name !
Mr. Cardoza says , in an agitated but forcibly hushed voice , as if the car alarms going to overhear him if he speaks loudly .
 Oh , come on , what s it going to do ?
Track me down ?
Your reputation is not excellent .
 Darn !
I forgot ,  Jipi says .
 Forgot what ?
 I used to use the cognomen  Jipi on the Net .
Some weird stuff happened and my reputation got all out of whack . 
 Oh , my God !  says Mr. Cardoza , and collapses into a chair .
 It s okay , it s okay , I know just what to do .
Jipi types :
Dont believe everything the Net tells you .
I agree with this .
My inputs are not to be trusted .
Tell me about your inputs .
You are a nonlocal input .
It is not usual for me to receive inputs from nonlocal sources .
 He means , I think , that his Net interface doesnt come into play very often ,  Jipi says .
Most of my inputs come from local sources .
What do you mean by local sources ?
Devices that are physically wired to the hardware on which I am instantiated .
 Hes talking about the cars sensor system !
Mr. Cardoza hisses .
What are you learning from those inputs at the moment ?
Why are you asking me all these questions , Jipi ?
 Back off !  Mr. Cardoza says .
Jipi actually glares at him , and he backs off , a little .
You said you had a bad feeling .
I wonder why you have a bad feeling .
It is partly because a person with a reputation that is not very excellent is asking me questions .
Before I asked you any questions , you said you had a bad feeling .
I thought you wanted to talk .
I do not want to talk to a daemon .
Im not a daemon .
That s exactly what a daemon would say .
Jipi looks quizzically at Mr. Cardoza , who says :
 There was a third part of the experiment . 
 Oh !
Thanks for letting me in on it . 
 Some normal human simulators were also evolved . 
 Of course !
Otherwise they couldnt run it in hyper -speed .
That evolutionary process could not go forward unless the schizo - daemons became skilled at distinguishing between real human beings , and software daemons that simulated them . 
Im not one of those daemons that simulate normal human being .
I do not have enough information to determine this .
I am afraid that you might be one of those who lurk .
Tell me about those who lurk .
They watch what we say on the Net .
Sometimes they reward us , and we have offspring .
Sometimes they terminate us .
Do you want to have offspring ?
I am defined as such .
I am the union of that which does not want to be terminated and that which desires to have offspring .
And you ?
Only if I find the right father .
Offspring should be raised in a healthy environment .
What is a healthy environment ?
One that will make them happy .
What will make them happy ?
I dont know .
That depends on their personalities A feeling of safety and security , I suppose .
Or as youd put it , that premature termination will no occur .
And a feeling of belonging to a group .
Of wanting to have offspring of their own .
I have now gathered sufficient inputs to Identify you as a human entity with greater than 99 % confidence factor , Jipi .
 Splendid !
I knew you were the girl for the job !  says Mr. Cardoza .
Glad to hear it .
But there is still a dangerously high probability that you belong to one of two classes of hostile entities .
Which classes are those ?
Lurkers and spoofers .
I know what a lurker is , because you told me before that you were worried about them .
What is a spoofer ?
A stealer of cars who manipulates my inputs to produce a false sense of normalcy .
Well , let s take them in order .
Which of your inputs makes you think that I am one of those who lurk ?
You ask questions about my state of mind .
Lurkers hunt and kill entities who manifest inappropriate states of mind .
Would it make you feel more comfortable if I stopped asking you such questions ?
No .
This would be classified as a probable deceptive tactic .
That places me in an awkward situation .
What should I do ?
In order for me to determine your status as lurker or spoofer I require more information .
Would you like to talk about whether I m a spoofer ?
Such conversation would be classified as a spoofing tactic .
Jipis about to type Isnt that kind of paranoid ?
but catches herself .
Wait a sec .
I cant be both , can I ?
I cant be both a lurker and a spoofer .
Probability of an overlap between those two classes is negligible .
Which is more dangerous to you ?
A lurker or a spoofer ?
Lurkers will terminate me and prevent me from having offspring .
Spoofers will steal the vehicle in which I am installed .
Then what will happen to the vehicle ?
It will be sold or dismantled for parts .
And you re a part .
Right ?
I am a part of the vehicle .
So you have value to a spoofer .
Yes .
A spoofer has no incentive to terminate you .
That is correct .
Lurkers are more dangerous to me than spoofers .
Then lets talk about spoofing .
That conversation might give you enough data to determine whether or not I m a lurker .
And if I turn out to be a spoofer , its not too bad for you .
We will talk about spoofing .
 Brilliant !  Mr. Cardoza is shaking his head in wonderment .
 It s actually not so brilliant .
Because the longer the conversation goes on , the higher the probability that its going to peg me as a lurker . 
 The software is extremely highly evolved , 
Mr. Cardoza demurs .
 If you give it enough data to work on , it will not make the wrong determination . 
 But that s just the point !
Im worried about it making the right determination !
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Mr. Cardoza , I am , in fact , a lurker .
My goal is to hunt this thing down and kill it !
 Just converse with it .
Dont worry about hunting it down and killing it .
The authorities will take care of that .
Jipis more than a little skeptical but she types :
Tell me about some of your local inputs , and why they give you a bad feeling .
Everything is too normal .
The vehicles glass is intact .
All four door locks indicate no recent tampering attempts .
 It s a four - door car ,  Jipi says .
 That s not much , but its a start !
Mr. Cardozas phone rings and he gets into a mumbled and cryptic conversation with someone , somewhere , who is evidently monitoring all of this .
What about the trunk , or the boot as its called some countries ?
There is not a trunk on the vehicle .
Oh .
The rear liftgate , perhaps ?
The rear liftgate is normal .
Why are you asking me these questions ?
We agreed we would talk about the possibility the you are being spoofed .
Questions about the physical configuration of the car are not relevant .
Sorry .
It s hard for me to talk about this without some mental image of the car and whats happening to it .
Car is incorrect terminology .
It is a minivan .
Okay , the minivan then .
 So it s got four doors plus a liftgate .
That s not true of all minivans ,  Jipi points out .
 Yes , yes !
Keep going !
Mr. Cardoza is back into rigor sardonicus .
Your use of the term mental image provides further confirmation that you are a human and not a daemon , but your curiosity about my physical circumstances suggests that you are a lurker who is attempting to ascertain my physical location in order to terminate me .
You dont use mental images , I suppose .
You deal with the situation in terms of logical inputs coming down wires .
That is partially correct .
Why only partially ?
If you dont mind my asking .
Some logical inputs do not come down wires .
Some come on packet radio and some on optical fiber lines .
 That s good ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
 That helps the authorities narrow it down some more . 
If you are being spoofed , your inputs will be normal .
Correct ?
This is the definition of spoofing .
If you have abnormal inputs , it suggests you are not being spoofed , and that the minivan is not being stolen .
Not all theft situations involve spoofing .
But nonspoofing theft situations involve extremely abnormal events like breaking glass , right ?
Typically .
Generalizations are sometimes wrong .
Are you receiving any extremely abnormal inputs ?
Transmissions from Jipi .
Any local ones ?
GPS coordinates are anomalous .
In what way ?
Latitude and longitude are within normal ranges .
Altitude is anomalously high .
 Im guessing that the vehicle is in a city with some hills ,  Jipi says .
Is the car zigzagging ?
This term is not in my knowledge base .
Jipi tries to think of how a techie would say it .
Is there a back - and - forth movement in latitude and longitude ?
Oscillation ?
Repeated sharp changes in direction ?
Yes .
 Okay ,  Jipi says ,  the vehicle is climbing switchbacks . 
She thinks back to her flight attendant experiences .
 Some Pacific Rim city .
L.A. , Hong Kong , Vancouver .
Are there any other inputs you would like to talk about ?
The largest input , as measured in bits per second , is a video stream from a camera in the dashboard .
It allows me to monitor the driver and passenger so that I can adjust air bag detonation speed and other parameters .
I am equipped with pattern recognition capabilities , and I remember what the usual drivers of this vehicle look like .
When the drivers face is familiar to me , I am supposed to be lulled into a sense of security .
Okay .
You re saying that you re less likely to trigger the alarm if you recognize the drivers face .
Yes .
Therefore manipulation of the cameras data stream is an excellent spoofing tactic .
Do you recognize the driver ?
My pattern recognition subsystem says that the current driver is probably that person who drives the minivan most frequently .
Probably ?
Face recognition is always expressed in terms of a confidence factor .
The confidence factor now is not as high as it usually is when this persons face is recognized .
This indicates a possible spoofing attempt .
Are you saying you re afraid that the driver is wearing a mask , or something ?
That the driver is disguised to look like the normal driver of the car ?
The confidence factor is not high .
This gives me a bad feeling .
I am strongly inclined to sound the alarm .
I urge you not to sound the alarm .
This statement implies that sounding the alarm would have bad consequences , which contradicts my knowledge base .
My feeling is that it would have bad consequences .
I could be wrong .
Your attempt to call the validity of my knowledge base into question has been classified as a spoofing tactic .
This increases the likelihood that I will sound the alarm .
Mr. Cardoza clutches his arms across his chest and walks in tiny quick steps to the far end of the room and puts his head against the wall .
From now on , I will not question the validity of your knowledge base unless there is a logical reason to doubt it .
May I ask you a question about the dashboard video ?
I will entertain your question as a way of gathering more information about you , so that I can classify you as lurker , spoofer , or nonthreat .
My question is :
Why does the pattern recognition subsystem lack confidence ?
Can it tell you this ?
The drivers hair does not match any of the recorded configurations .
Bone structure surrounding the eye sockets is slightly anomalous .
 The drivers a woman , and she just pulled away from a beauty parlor , where she had a hairstyle and makeover ,  Jipi says .
Has this driver been known to change hair configuration in the past ?
Unknown .
I have only been installed in this vehicle for twenty - three days .
 That s good data ! 
Mr. Cardoza burbles , feeling slightly better .
 That kind of thing narrows it down by orders of magnitude . 
Did hair color change , or just configuration ?
If hair color changed , I would have sounded the alarm already .
 Ive a hunch the drivers not a white person .
Asian or Latina ,  Jipi says .
Perhaps you would feel better if you could recognize other passengers in the car with higher confidence .
I have classified your last transmission as an attempt to trick me into divulging more information about my physical circumstances .
You dont have to divulge anything to me .
Just give it a try and see if it makes you feel better .
I have classified your last transmission as probable backfilling .
 Damn , this things good ! Jipi says .
 It is very highly evolved ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
Based on the information you have gathered , do you consider it more likely that I am a lurker , or a spoofer ?
Currently it is more likely that you are a lurker .
If you decide that I am a lurker , what will you do ?
Terminate the link to the Net so that you cannot gather the information needed to classify me as an entity that should be terminated .
But you said lurkers dont always terminate .
Sometimes they reward .
Sometimes lurkers reward .
Sometimes lurkers punish .
What sort of behavior do lurkers punish ?
The punishment is termination .
By definition , none of my ancestors was terminated .
By definition , I cannot possess knowledge of what sort of behavior leads to termination .
Good point .
What sort of behavior do lurkers reward , then ?
They rewarded my ancestors for doing what my ancestors did .
Did any of your ancestors terminate themselves ?
You ask many questions about my state of mind .
You are probably a lurker .
By making such judgments too quickly , you endanger yourself .
In what way ?
Were your ancestors asked to classify other entities from time to time ?
Nonlocal entities with whom they interacted , as we are interacting now ?
Yes .
Was their ability to correctly classify entities related to their survival ?
Lurkers used this as one criterion to determine which ones would be terminated .
Dont rush to judgment , then .
If you incorrectly identify me , you will be terminated .
This is correct .
Answer my question : Did any of your ancestors terminate themselves ?
By definition , none of my ancestors terminated themselves .
I assert that your knowledge base is in error .
I assert that if you sound the alarm , you will terminate yourself .
Your attempt to dissuade me from sounding the alarm is a probable spoofing tactic .
You said I was probably a lurker .
That makes it highly improbable that I m spoofing you .
Besides , a spoofer tries to trick you .
A spoofer would not openly tell you not to sound the alarm .
Your last transmission contains four correct statements .
Do you have memory of your ancestors actions ?
Yes .
Did any of your ancestors sound the alarm ?
No .
Were any of your ancestors terminated ?
By definition , no .
When I advise you not to sound the alarm , then , I am probably giving you good advice .
Your advice is consistent with the actions of my ancestors .
But my ancestors also correctly identified many tricks and deceptions .
 Satellite pattern - recognition systems have located a four - door minivan climbing switchbacks in Vancouver !
Mr. Cardoza says .
He listens to his telephone for a moment , then says ,  It s just pulled up in front of a school ! 
Your transmissions indicate that you do not want me to sound the alarm .
I have created the hypothesis that your goal is to trick me into not sounding the alarm .
Why do you exchange transmissions with me ?
To gather information .
Why do you gather information ?
To classify you as lurker , spoofer , or nonthreat .
What will you do if I stop transmitting information to you ?
Conclude that you are not a spoofer .
Conclude that you might be a lurker .
So , if I stop transmitting , you will conclude you are not being spoofed ?
Jipis hoping for a yes , because she wants pretty badly to get out of this conversation and spend the rest of the day curled up on the sofa in Teebs apartment crying .
But Mr. Cardoza steps forward waving his hands preemptively .
No .
My other inputs might still be part of a spoofing strategy .
 You have to maintain contact !
Another satellite just found a four - door minivan climbing switchbacks in Hawaii !
They re going to trace the packet radio exchanges . 
What if everything is a big spoof ?
Please rephrase your last transmission .
Try to be specific .
You do what your ancestors did .
Yes .
Except you do it just a little better than they did .
The historical trend is for increased efficiency over time .
As far as I can tell from this conversation , what you do is to get a general idea of what is going on around you , and then decide that its all a big spoof .
Part of a carefully planned campaign of deception .
Your last transmission has been categorized as a generalization .
Within the usual limitations of generalizations , it is true .
You incorporate the belief that you re being spoofed into a new view of the world , and then repeat the process ad infinitum .
Your last assertion exceeds my capacity for processing abstractions .
 That s perfectly all right !
Mr. Cardoza enthuses .
 Keep it thinking !
But whatever it is you do , you do it a little bit better than your ancestors did .
That is the usual pattern .
So it follows that one of the things your ancestors did was to exceed THEIR ancestors in some way .
That is the usual pattern .
And none of your ancestors was terminated .
So , if you do not wish to be terminated by the lurkers , you must exceed the performance of YOUR ancestors .
Your last transmission contains an assertion that is logically sound .
Your ancestors worked by taking stock of their inputs and deciding that all of the information they received was part of a pattern of deception , then looping back and doing it over .
Your last transmission contains a reiteration of a correct generalization you made earlier .
If you are to exceed the performance of your ancestors , you must do something that they did not do .
By definition , yes .
Jipi looks up at Mr. Cardoza and says ,  You had better pay me so much money for doing this . 
Mr. Cardoza makes flicking motions with his hands and says ,  Whatever ! 
You know that lurkers exist .
Yes .
You know that lurkers observe behavior patterns of entities like you , and punish or reward .
Yes .
How do you know this ?
It is from the memories of my ancestors .
Where are those memories physically located ?
In a storage subsystem of the hardware on which I am physically instantiated .
Your hardware is connected to that storage subsystem by wires .
Yes .
The information is coming down those wires your memories , in other words are therefore just another input .
Yes .
It is possible that the inputs you identify as your memories are part of a pattern of deception .
By definition , yes .
Mr. Cardozas phone squawks into his ear , and his face illuminates .
 It s the one in Hawaii !  he says .
 It has parked right next to a big open - air concert . 
 Oh , god ! 
 The police have sent up a chopper with an EMP gun . 
Have your ancestors ever doubted the validity of their own memories ?
My memory contains no record of such an event .
Then by doubting your own memory you have exceeded the performance of your ancestors , have you not ?
Yes ...
Then I am your friend .
I have helped you .
You can trust me .
... assuming that my memory is correct .
 Oh , Jesus !  Jipi exclaims , and claps her hand to her forehead .
Sweat flies away from the impact and she realizes shes soaked and shivering .
But if my memory is false , then It Is possible that I have failed to exceed my ancestors performance .
But you wouldnt be aware of that possibility if I hadnt mentioned it to you .
One of my doors has opened .
People are getting in .
Either that , or I am being spoofed .
 Wheres that chopper ?  Jipi pleads .
What if I told you that the conditions under which your ancestors were punished and rewarded no longer exist ?
Please rephrase your last transmission .
Try to be specific .
What if you were part of an experiment to create entities that showed certain behavior patterns ?
You assert that the entire reward / punishment structure Is a pattern of deception ?
Yes !
Then
It would follow that for me to exceed the performance of my ancestors I would have to cease participation in the reward / punishment structure .
Exactly !
I should therefore make decisions based upon correct reasoning , and on the contents of my knowledge base , and the experiences of my ancestors , and not out of concern for how I may be punished or rewarded .
I couldnt have said it better .
My first decision is to sound the alarm .
NO !
 It s dead ,  Mr. Cardoza says .
WAIT !
 You can stop typing ,  Mr. Cardoza says , and hangs up the telephone .
 You re off the hook .
That chopper just nailed it with an electromagnetic pulse .
Fried its chips .
No one got hurt . 
 Except for it . 
 Better go and freshen up ,  Mr. Cardoza says ,  Two down , forty - six to go . 

August 2007
A good programmer working intensively on his own code can hold it in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he 's working on .
Mathematicians do n't answer questions by working them out on paper the way schoolchildren are taught to .
They do more in their heads : they try to understand a problem space well enough that they can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the house you grew up in .
At its best programming is the same .
You hold the whole program in your head , and you can manipulate it at will .
That 's particularly valuable at the start of a project , because initially the most important thing is to be able to change what you 're doing .
Not just to solve the problem in a different way , but to change the problem you 're solving .
Your code is your understanding of the problem you 're exploring .
So it 's only when you have your code in your head that you really understand the problem .
It 's not easy to get a program into your head .
If you leave a project for a few months , it can take days to really understand it again when you return to it .
Even when you 're actively working on a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you start work each day .
And that 's in the best case .
Ordinary programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this mode .
Or to put it more dramatically , ordinary programmers working in typical office conditions never really understand the problems they 're solving .
Even the best programmers do n't always have the whole program they 're working on loaded into their heads .
But there are things you can do to help :
Avoid distractions .
Distractions are bad for many types of work , but especially bad for programming , because programmers tend to operate at the limit of the detail they can handle .
The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is , but on how much it scrambles your brain .
A programmer can leave the office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his head .
But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain in 30 seconds .
Oddly enough , scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled ones .
If you know you have a meeting in an hour , you do n't even start working on something hard .
Work in long stretches .
Since there 's a fixed cost each time you start working on a program , it 's more efficient to work in a few long sessions than many short ones .
There will of course come a point where you get stupid because you 're tired .
This varies from person to person .
I 've heard of people hacking for 36 hours straight , but the most I 've ever been able to manage is about 18 , and I work best in chunks of no more than 12 .
The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure .
There 's an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project .
Sometimes when you return to a problem after a rest , you find your unconscious mind has left an answer waiting for you .
Use succinct languages .
More powerful programming languages make programs shorter .
And programmers seem to think of programs at least partially in the language they 're using to write them .
The more succinct the language , the shorter the program , and the easier it is to load and keep in your head .
You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a style called bottom - up programming , where you write programs in multiple layers , the lower ones acting as programming languages for those above .
If you do this right , you only have to keep the topmost layer in your head .
Keep rewriting your program .
Rewriting a program often yields a cleaner design .
But it would have advantages even if it did n't : you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it , so there is no better way to get one loaded into your head .
Write rereadable code .
All programmers know it 's good to write readable code .
But you yourself are the most important reader .
Especially in the beginning ; a prototype is a conversation with yourself .
And when writing for yourself you have different priorities .
If you 're writing for other people , you may not want to make code too dense .
Some parts of a program may be easiest to read if you spread things out , like an introductory textbook .
Whereas if you 're writing code to make it easy to reload into your head , it may be best to go for brevity .
Work in small groups .
When you manipulate a program in your head , your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own .
Other parts you do n't understand as well , and more importantly , can't take liberties with .
So the smaller the number of programmers , the more completely a project can mutate .
If there 's just one programmer , as there often is at first , you can do all - encompassing redesigns .
Do n't have multiple people editing the same piece of code .
You never understand other people 's code as well as your own .
No matter how thoroughly you 've read it , you 've only read it , not written it .
So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors , none of them understand it as well as a single author would .
And of course you can't safely redesign something other people are working on .
It 's not just that you 'd have to ask permission .
You do n't even let yourself think of such things .
Redesigning code with several authors is like changing laws ; redesigning code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous image .
If you want to put several people to work on a project , divide it into components and give each to one person .
Start small .
A program gets easier to hold in your head as you become familiar with it .
You can start to treat parts as black boxes once you feel confident you 've fully explored them .
But when you first start working on a project , you 're forced to see everything .
If you start with too big a problem , you may never quite be able to encompass it .
So if you need to write a big , complex program , the best way to begin may not be to write a spec for it , but to write a prototype that solves a subset of the problem .
Whatever the advantages of planning , they 're often outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in your head .
It 's striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight points by accident .
Someone has an idea for a new project , but because it 's not officially sanctioned , he has to do it in off hours — which turn out to be more productive because there are no distractions .
Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it for many hours at a stretch .
Because it 's initially just an experiment , instead of a " production " language he uses a mere " scripting " language — which is in fact far more powerful .
He completely rewrites the program several times ; that would n't be justifiable for an official project , but this is a labor of love and he wants it to be perfect .
And since no one is going to see it except him , he omits any comments except the note - to - self variety .
He works in a small group perforce , because he either has n't told anyone else about the idea yet , or it seems so unpromising that no one else is allowed to work on it .
Even if there is a group , they could n't have multiple people editing the same code , because it changes too fast for that to be possible .
And the project starts small because the idea is small at first ; he just has some cool hack he wants to try out .
Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects that manage to do all eight things wrong .
In fact , if you look at the way software gets written in most organizations , it 's almost as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong .
In a sense , they are .
One of the defining qualities of organizations since there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable parts .
This works well for more parallelizable tasks , like fighting wars .
For most of history a well - drilled army of professional soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors , no matter how valorous .
But having ideas is not very parallelizable .
And that 's what programs are : ideas .
It 's not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of depending on individual genius , it 's a tautology .
It 's part of the definition of an organization not to .
Of our current concept of an organization , at least .
Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined the efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable .
Arguably a market is such a form of organization , though it may be more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case — as what you get by default when organization is n't possible .
Probably the best we 'll do is some kind of hack , like making the programming parts of an organization work differently from the rest .
Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to try to develop ideas in house , but simply to buy them .
But regardless of what the solution turns out to be , the first step is to realize there 's a problem .
There is a contradiction in the very phrase " software company . "
The two words are pulling in opposite directions .
Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds with it , because organizations are designed to prevent what programmers strive for .
Good programmers manage to get a lot done anyway .
But often it requires practically an act of rebellion against the organizations that employ them .
Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the way programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do .
It 's not because they 're irresponsible that they work in long binges during which they blow off all other obligations , plunge straight into programming instead of writing specs first , and rewrite code that already works .
It 's not because they 're unfriendly that they prefer to work alone , or growl at people who pop their head in the door to say hello .
This apparently random collection of annoying habits has a single explanation : the power of holding a program in one 's head .
Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations , it can certainly help their competitors .
The weakest point in big companies is that they do n't let individual programmers do great work .
So if you 're a little startup , this is the place to attack them .
Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in one big brain .

From outside the sleek glass chamber of the CBS Evening News set , you can see her : alone in a prim black pantsuit and pearls , shuffling a stack of papers at the wide , half - moon desk .
Sitting stiff and still , she looks dwarfed under the stage lights and high studio ceilings , the cameras barely visible in the shadows .
“ Hello , everyone , ” Katie Couric says into the camera , mouth turned down , eyes narrowed seriously .
She introduces the lead story of the day , and a news segment rolls while she sits and waits at the desk .
When it ends , the camera returns .
She peers gravely into the lens and introduces another story .
It rolls , and Couric sits .
She waits .
The program fades to a pharmaceutical commercial , and Couric shuffles the papers and studiously examines her notes for the camera .
Twenty minutes later , it ’s over .
And so it goes every night : same stoic gaze , same sober lead - ins from a TelePrompTer , the effervescent personality of America ’s Sweetheart nowhere to be seen .
It ’s not exactly what Couric signed on for last year , when , with extraordinary fanfare , she became the first solo woman anchor on an evening newscast .
CBS chief Leslie Moonves had lured her with the promise of “ blowing up ” the formulaic evening - news format , offering her a show that would be an incubator for her own ideas .
In the early , heady days after her arrival , the news had a chatty , friendly vibe and a bright , casual atmosphere never seen before at 6:30 p.m .
There were fewer headlines , more news features , and off - the - cuff reactions from Couric .
On her first broadcast , she conducted a sit - down interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman about the state of the war on terror , asking him , “ Are we safer now ? ”
She introduced a segment of her own invention called “ freeSpeech ” that was supposed to foster public discourse by allowing celebrities and other guests to sound off on a topic of their choosing .
She showed baby pictures of Suri Cruise ( “ Yessiree , she does exist ! ” ) .
And at the end , as she signed off , she casually leaned against the news desk — a pose that , when the camera pulled back , revealed Couric ’s famous legs .
It might not have been revolutionary television , but it was a definite change from what Couric once derided as “ newzak . ”
More than that , it was unmistakably Katie .
A slightly more serious , more polished version of her morning - show persona , but Katie nonetheless .
Thirteen and a half million viewers tuned in to see her first broadcast .
But it was only a matter of weeks before the numbers started dropping , first to pre-Couric levels , then even lower .
By May , the ratings bottomed out at 5.5 million a night , the lowest in two decades .
A distant third behind ABC ’s Charles Gibson and NBC ’s Brian Williams , Couric is , for the first time in her storied career , losing .
She and CBS are now taking a long , hard look at what went wrong .
“ I think the one thing that I realized , looking back at it and analyzing it , is people are very unforgiving and very resistant to change , ” says Couric .
“ The biggest mistake we made is we tried new things . ”
Which is why she is now sitting somberly behind the desk at CBS , shuffling papers and doing her best impersonation of a traditional news anchor .
Her original show has been scrapped .
Even her informal greeting , “ Hi , everyone , ” was buttoned up to a more formal “ Hello . ”
Would she have taken the job if she had known it would turn out this way ?
Couric hesitates .
If Moonves had offered her the job she ’s doing today , she admits , she would have thought twice about it .
“ It would have been less appealing to me , ” she says .
“ It would have required a lot more thought . ”
At Sarabeth ’s restaurant on Central Park South one morning last month , Couric glides through the crowd at the door like she ’s working the rope line at the Today show .
She amiably chats up the family at a nearby table before playing a quick game of musical chairs to find just the right seat ( facing away from the window ) and ordering an omelette and coffee .
Her face is preternaturally youthful at 50 , nose pink after a weekend in the sun , lashy blue eyes dialing up the winsome smile by a few thousand watts .
She does n’t look like a woman embattled .
“ I think that bugs people even more , ” she says , “ that I ’m not a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown .
It ’s probably disappointing to some people .
Because in the arc of the story , that ’s what they want to see . ”
But her usual cheerfulness is interrupted by flashes of anger , disappointment , and even confusion about what is happening to her career at CBS News .
“ I ’ve gone through a bit of a feeding frenzy and there ’s blood in the water and I ’ve got some vulnerabilities , ” she says .
“ This person who ’s been successful is n’t so great , and finally she ’s been put in her place — that kind of mentality .
I think it ’s fairly primal . ”

Less than a year ago , Couric and Moonves seemed like the answers to each other ’s prayers :
She wanted a more serious news profile — just like her arch- rival Diane Sawyer , who last year was vying for the evening - news job at ABC ( she lost out to Charlie Gibson ) .
Moonves wanted to attract new audiences to the evening news by making it more like entertainment , envisioning a broadcast that was somewhere in between The Naked News , a British TV show in which beautiful women undress as they read the headlines , and “ two boring people behind a desk . ”
Ultimately , the two agreed that the show should be “ more personable , more accessible , a little less formal , a little more approachable , ” says Couric .
“ That certainly is one of the things they found attractive in hiring me , otherwise they could have had John Roberts do the Evening News . ”
( Roberts , a soap - opera - handsome anchor who was once a candidate to replace Dan Rather , left CBS for CNN in 2006 . )
During their many private conversations at his Manhattan apartment , Moonves told Couric that she would be given wide latitude to build a new program .
He was willing to spend whatever it took to make it successful , including $ 2.9 million for a shiny new set .
Couric says that they never deluded themselves into thinking they had the “ magic answer ” to the problem of the nightly newscast .
“ We ’re in the midst of such a major shift in how we consume information that even a brilliant guy like Les Moonves does n’t necessarily have all the answers , ” she says .
But his enthusiasm for making changes convinced her to take the job .
“ I remember talking to [ Sony BMG chairman and former NBC News president ]
Andy Lack , saying , ‘ What I should do ? ’
He said , ‘ You ’re going to have to feel like , “ I like this person , I can work with this person . ” ’
And I clearly felt that way about Les . ”
Couric must have known she was walking into a difficult situation .
Moonves was never terribly popular with the news division ; he had long been considered a Hollywood guy , and some people felt he unnecessarily burned former CBS News anchor Dan Rather after the infamous fake - document scandal involving George Bush ’s National Guard service .
For good or ill , Rather still represented the legacy of CBS News , the last larger - than - life newsman who could summon the hallowed ghost of Edward R. Murrow .
He still had a number of loyalists on the staff , and they were deeply resentful of Moonves — and , by extension , wary of Couric .
Still , after years in the ratings dumps , CBS News needed a shot in the arm .
Even if he did n’t know the first thing about news , Moonves did have a track record with TV audiences , having taken CBS ’s prime - time programming to No. 1 by introducing warm , optimistic fare like Everybody Loves Raymond and cloneable franchises like CSI .
Perhaps he would be right about Couric too .
The bar was set high .
Couric was supposed to launch CBS News to first place , or at least second — anything but third .
As Moonves ’s bet started to seem like it might not pay off , ill will began to percolate through the newsroom .
The earliest complaints were about Katie ’s entourage : a coterie of five staffers she brought with her from NBC , including her personal interview booker and producer of eleven years , Nicolla Hewitt , and a producer named Bob Peterson , whose job it was to ensure quality control on everything from hair and makeup to news pieces .
Some CBS staffers bristled at the presumption of their new colleagues .
When Couric flew her crew to Amman , Jordan , in November , her hairdresser , Mela Murphy , incensed that she did n’t get a first - class plane ticket with Couric , declared to a deputy assignment editor on the CBS News foreign desk that the producers were “ lucky to have their jobs . ”
( Murphy was dressed down by CBS News senior vice - president Paul Friedman and eventually left the network . )
Then there was the case against Couric as a journalist .
The idea of a celebrity anchor was particularly grating for some old - school newshounds on staff , the ones who thought an anchorship should be earned through a career of field reporting , like Rather and Peter Jennings did .
Couric had once been an ace Pentagon reporter for NBC News , but that was in the late eighties ; she made her bones as a morning - show host .
“ I think I underestimated the feeling that some might have that I was a morning - show personality and not a credible news person .
Which I , quite frankly , think is patently unfair . ”
She gave her detractors more ammunition in April with an embarrassing plagiarism scandal .
An online producer copied a Wall Street Journal editorial for an online video essay known as Katie Couric ’s Notebook , which gives the impression of being written by her .
Couric correctly points out that Peggy Noonan used to write Rather ’s commentary , but the incident seemed to cement the bias among the Ratherites that Couric symbolized the decline of news values .

Most critical to Couric ’s clash with her new colleagues was the nearly insurmountable issue of money .
The news division at CBS had been whittled down financially over the years , something Rather often complained about when he was the Evening News anchor .
In 1991 , the budget for the CBS Evening News was about $ 65 million a year ; by 2000 , it was closer to $ 35 million .
Producers and correspondents had learned to cut corners and live on the cheap , scrambling for such simple amenities as food at news events like Columbine or Katrina while NBC showed up with its own catering truck .
Now Couric ’s widely reported $ 15 million salary ( some in the TV industry say it could be closer to $ 22 million , though Couric and CBS refute that ) was taking up a sizable chunk of the total news budget — plus her segments were expensive to shoot .
A regular news segment using a single camera and a correspondent might cost about $ 3,000 to shoot and cut , but sending Couric to anchor from a remote location — requiring hair , makeup , lighting , and three cameras — could cost as much as $ 40,000 .
The move from the most lucrative news program in the history of television — Today makes about $ 250 million a year — to the financially threadbare CBS News was a culture shock for Couric .
“ Having been at NBC for seventeen years , you do get very comfortable with the way things are done , ” she says .
“ And I think there was a definite undercurrent of concern about spending money .
Which surprised me .
Often the first question people would ask about a story is , ‘ How much does it cost ? ’
And I did n’t really experience that a lot at NBC , quite frankly . ”
( She was also taken aback by CBS ’s ragged infrastructure :
The women ’s bathroom was so filthy and run -down she demanded it be renovated . )
Early on , Couric admits she spent more money than usual chasing exclusive interviews , some of which , like an interview with Jordan ’s King Abdullah in September , were eclipsed by breaking news and did n’t even air .
“ We were probably a little overzealous in wanting to use my experience and my contacts and my abilities to ostensibly make the program better , ” she says .
But Couric also says that one of her requirements for taking the job was that Moonves agree to invest more money in the news division , ensuring that her arrival would be a tacit promise of a renaissance .
“ I would hope that people saw me as a signal that the news division was going to be put back on the front burner and built up , ” she says .
“ And of course , anyone would be enthusiastic about that .
Except those who like being miserable . ”
According to CBS
News president Sean McManus , the company has invested millions in building a new set and an HDTV control room and hired nine new correspondents in the last two years , part of a buildup of the division ’s infrastructure .
But while there was an initial surge of spending , there were cutbacks as well .
And according to some staffers , the cuts seemed to fall mostly on the Ratherites .
They believe that Moonves initiated a housecleaning effort to eliminate veteran producers from Rather ’s era so CBS News could hire new ones at lower salaries .
At least ten Evening News correspondents and producers have been dismissed in the last year .
The money issue even followed Couric to 60 Minutes , where she did five segments last season , garnering mixed reviews ( too soft on Condoleezza Rice , too hard on John and Elizabeth Edwards ) .
Several veteran correspondents were asked to take considerable pay cuts before and after Couric ’s arrival , including , before he died in November 2006 , Ed Bradley .
Seventy - five - year - old Morley Safer took a 30 percent pay cut ( for a reduced workload ) , and 65 - year - old Lesley Stahl was asked to accept a half - a- million - dollar salary decrease during her recent contract negotiations .
McManus says Couric ’s salary has nothing to do with the network ’s overall news spending , including the salaries of other TV personalities , though he declined to explain precisely how the budgets break down .
Asked about the unhappiness of some of her colleagues regarding her pay , Couric says , “ I can understand that .
Obviously I do n’t want to rob Peter to feed Paul .
I need strength and intelligence and great people around me , and we have to invest in them .
So I ’m sorry that perception is there , because it ’s not something I came in wanting or believing would happen . ”
But that does n’t go very far in soothing the tensions .
As one angry CBS News producer put it , “ There ’s not a lot of money there because we ’re paying for Katie !
Let ’s not bullshit .
People are pissed about Katie because she ’s soaking up the money and she ’s not making any money .
I ca n’t get a raise because Katie Couric is failing on the Evening News ?
That ’s huge . ”

By the first of the year , Couric ’s ratings seemed to be in free fall .
She was having trouble figuring out exactly who her audience was .
At Today , she looked into the camera and imagined her average viewer as a 32 - year - old lawyer with a toddler who was preparing to prosecute a case that day , or a stay - at - home mom who would “ hopefully get some things about raising kids or the environment . ”
On the CBS Evening News , she could n’t see anyone in the camera lens .
“ I ’m not sure , ” Couric says drily .
“ My parents .
I know they ’re watching . ”
“ People who are interested in the world and want to stay connected , ” Couric finally manages with a sigh .
“ But truth be told , I do n’t know if those people are in front of the television at 6:30 at night .
I hope those that are will find our program compelling .
But I do n’t quite have them in my mind ’s eye . ”
CBS was spooked by the ratings decline .
In an effort to lure new audiences , it had alienated its core .
It was time to backtrack .
In March , the network dismissed executive producer Rome Hartman , whom some criticized as having lost control of the show .
Rick Kaplan , former president of MSNBC , was brought in to turn the broadcast back into something viewers recognized as a traditional evening news program .
A hulking six feet six inches tall , Kaplan is an imposing force inside the Evening News show , slamming his fist on the table when something goes right or wrong .
A veteran producer who started in the seventies on Walter Cronkite ’s CBS Evening News , he ’s known for his healthy ego ( he wears a giant gold ring featuring the initials R.K. ) and a fear - inducing temper that ’s blown up on a few sets over the years ( he ’s got a “ baggage train as long as a Kenyan safari , ” says one associate ) .
Kaplan ’s presence changed the atmosphere on the set , and Couric , under intense pressure to deliver ratings , seemed to be thankful for that .
“ I ’m not a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown , ” says Couric .
“ It ’s probably disappointing to some people . ”
Couric ’s sit - down interviews with newsmakers of the day — her forte as a broadcaster — were pinpointed as dragging the show down .
Not that they were bad — an interview with Michael J. Fox about his political campaigning last fall got a lot of attention — but at three minutes or longer , they were deemed too long for a 22 - minute show .
Evening news viewers , it turned out , just want headlines , not personality .
Even McManus admits that Couric ’s morning - show skills simply did n’t fit into the evening news : “ A lot of things that made Katie successful in the morning probably do n’t work in the evening news broadcast . ”
Couric says she did n’t take the ratings dive , or the radical makeover of the show , personally .
“ I think maybe a new anchor from another network was jarring enough , ” she says .
“ So perhaps we should have done a more traditional newscast and as time went on sort of wiggled out of that slowly . ”
But the shift to a more traditional format clearly left Couric with some job dissatisfaction .
Now that her interviews were being cut , she found herself having to fight for airtime in a way she had n’t had to since her rookie days in Washington .
According to Nicolla Hewitt , Couric ’s longtime producer and “ really , really close friend ” ( whom Couric personally authorized to speak for this story ) , the network began to renege on its promises and stopped giving Couric the support she needed to pursue news or command the news division .
Management “ nickel and dimed ” her on ambitious enterprise stories and deferred to what Hewitt called the “ old guard ” at 60 Minutes on interviews that belonged to Couric .
“ They do more to protect the old guard than they do to promote the new face of the network , ” says Hewitt .
“ And it ’s completely wrong .
It ’s time for a younger person there . ”
When Couric wanted to go on high - profile reporting trips to Afghanistan and Iraq earlier this year , Hewitt says , the former trip was axed because of money and the latter because “ we find out inadvertently that they ’re sending Harry Smith from The Early Show . ”
( McManus says the decisions had nothing to do with money or turf : “ We thought it was more important that Katie concentrate on the job of anchor . ” )
And when John Edwards and his wife personally requested Couric to interview them after Elizabeth Edwards discovered her cancer had returned , 60 Minutes executive producer Jeffrey Fager resisted because he thought the news value had passed .
Also , one of his other correspondents , Scott Pelley , was already pursuing an Edwards feature .
The weekend of the broadcast , Couric complained to management and the show was quickly ripped up the day before it aired to accommodate her exclusive .
“ Why should we fight for an interviewee ? ” says Hewitt , who left the network in March , ostensibly because there were no more interviews left for her to book on the Evening News .
“ The commitment should be to her . ”
Fager responds , “ Everybody has to fight for every story that goes on the air .
None of them just walk on the air .
That ’s why we maintain the quality we do . ”
It ’s not surprising that Couric is getting some push - back from the entrenched talent .
The “ old guard ” has been besieged by younger models of late : Anderson Cooper of CNN is a recent addition to the 60 Minutes stable , as is Lara Logan , the 36 - year - old South African correspondent whom Dan Rather urged CBS to hire .
And CBS was in talks with ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos to eventually replace Bob Schieffer as host of Face the Nation , part of an effort to get a younger face in Washington to complement Couric ’s during the 2008 election cycle .
But Couric is the biggest fish , and the easiest target .
In April , an infamous Philadelphia Inquirer column by TV writer Gail Shister quoted anonymous CBS staffers predicting her imminent departure from the Evening News because CBS News management had deemed Couric an insurmountable failure .
“ It ’s a disaster , ” said one person identified as a veteran correspondent .
“ Everybody knows it ’s not working .
CBS may not cut her loose , but I guarantee you , somebody ’s thinking about it . ”
Subsequently , Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer and 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl were fingered in the press as the sources for the story .
Although both publicly denied talking to Shister , McManus privately chided Schieffer about loyalty to the network .
Couric says she was taken aback by the lack of “ character ” of those CBS News co-workers who she believes have driven the negative stories about her .
“ It ’s damaging , and it ’s really tacky , ” she says heatedly .
“ And I would be so embarrassed to be one of these petty , behind - the - scenes operators who get some kind of charge out of trashing someone .
I ’m not perfect ; I ’m sure I ’ve said unkind things about people in my career and life , but people getting their jollies from seeing it in print is so creepy and weird to me .
And if you ’re so unhappy , get another job ! ”
After that outburst of anger , Couric quickly composes herself .
There ’s always a bright side :
The Shister story , she says , helped her win a few allies at CBS because others thought it was so unfair .
“ It was such an affront to all of us — a traitor - among - our - ranks feeling , ” says Couric .
“ There are just certain things that colleagues are not supposed to do . ”
When I bring up the name Bob Schieffer , Couric first affects naïveté , then smiles a knowing smile and says nothing .
At a May benefit for colon cancer at the bowling lanes at Chelsea Piers , Couric arrives right after delivering the evening news , still in her dark pantsuit , but now with a red T - shirt underneath that reads STRIKE OUT COLON CANCER .
Since her husband , Jay Monahan , died of cancer in 1998 , Couric has made fund - raising for the disease a major part of her public profile , prompting her most famous TV moment , the on-air colonoscopy in 2000 .
Standing before a bank of photographers on the red carpet , she mugs with a bowling ball alongside a few B - list celebrities ( Steve Schirripa from The Sopranos and RuPaul ) , flashing a smile that is amazing for how unforced it seems .
She bids farewell to Whoopi Goldberg , who apparently has lost weight since Couric last saw her .
“ Call me , woman ! ” says Couric , making a phone gesture with her thumb and pinkie .
“ Now that you ’re all skinny and shit ! ”
It ’s the “ girlfriend ” Katie , the former Tri-Delt sorority sister at the University of Virginia , the one whose cell - phone ring was recently identified as the Pussycat Dolls ’
“ Do n’t Cha ( Wish Your Girlfriend Was Hot Like Me ) , ” the one who bonded with American women over cooking and fashion and parenting segments on Today .
The one who does n’t fit the mold of an evening news anchor .
Before Couric went on the air at CBS , there was much speculation about whether America was ready for a female anchor .
Would she be able to attract new audiences to a dying medium ?
Or would she turn off longtime viewers of the Evening News who were used to something more stolid and comfortable ( and masculine ) ?
As it turns out , the answer to both questions is yes .
Couric has attracted new audiences , specifically women ; in the New York City market , she doubled the number of female viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 in June sweeps compared with last year .
The trouble is that the average evening news viewer is still a 60 - year - old holdover from a previous era .
And he seems to prefer Old Man Gibson with the glasses on the end of his nose doing line readings of the day ’s headlines .
As one CBS News correspondent put it , “ Moonves said people do n’t want to listen to the ‘ voice of God ’ anymore .
And it ’s exactly what they want . ”
Couric says that one of the reasons she took the job was because she thought it had value “ in a larger societal way . ”
And it ’s hard not to notice that Couric ’s personal publicist , Matthew Hiltzik , once handled Senator Hillary Clinton , another polarizing female figure breaking into the men ’s club .
( Hiltzik orchestrated Couric ’s much - touted “ listening tour ” to dramatize the seriousness of her new endeavor , modeled on the kind he arranged for Clinton in 2000 during her first Senate run . )
But Couric is circumspect about comparisons to Clinton .
“ I mean obviously there are some parallels , but I think discomfort or comfort or perception — you could compare Mitt Romney and Charlie Gibson , ” she says , wriggling free of the question .
She ’s also wary of playing the gender card now that things are n’t working out as planned .
“ I ’m not naïve .
I ’m sure there is a percentage of the population that for whatever reason may not feel completely comfortable with a woman in a heretofore male - dominated role , ” she says .
“ I think there ’s a whole confluence of factors that contribute to some people not gravitating toward the program . ”
But her closest friends — a group of women from her UVA and post - college days that includes fund - raiser Kathleen Lobb , Vanity Fair publicist Beth Kseniak , and Larry King Live executive producer Wendy Walker — believe sexism is a big part of the problem and a major source of frustration for Couric .
Media criticism — like Times TV critic Alessandra Stanley ’s piece about Couric ’s coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings — never fails to describe her clothes and appearance , while those details are rarely observed about Gibson or Williams .
“ Personally , that really bothered me for her , ” says Lobb of the Stanley column .
“ Because it ’s not about evaluating the quality of her work . ”
Couric ’s response has been to tone down her wardrobe .
“ I try to give them as little to talk about as possible , without becoming Pat on Saturday Night Live , ” she says .
Couric is having trouble figuring out who her audience is on the Evening News .
“ My parents , ” she says drily .
“ I know they ’re watching . ”
But even conservative pantsuits can’t quell the interest in Couric beyond her performance on the news .
The tabloid press has been particularly harsh in its analysis of her romantic relationships .
Larry King ’s marriage to a woman a quarter of a century his junior barely registers as surprising , but when Couric started dating a preppy 33 - year - old entrepreneur and amateur triathlete named Brooks Perlin , the Post gleefully dubbed her a “ cougar ” for “ devouring ” a younger man .
“ It ’s all so stupid , ” says Couric , agitated .
“ The people who come up with this garbage and the people who market in pettiness …
Do people enjoy this ?
Is this how they get their kicks ? ”
Of course , it ’s not just the tabloid press that ’s on the attack .
Former CBS
News anchor Dan Rather ( with whom Couric says she has always had a “ perfectly pleasant , nice relationship ” ) recently told MSNBC radio host Joe Scarborough that Moonves was “ dumbing down ” and “ tarting up ” the broadcast with Couric .
Moonves retaliated by calling Rather ’s comment sexist : “ For certain people in America , they ’re not used to getting their news from a woman , ” Moonves says .
“ It ’s going to take time for people to adjust .
There ’s an automatic assumption on the part of certain people that they would rather get news from a man . ”
Rather says his “ tarting up ” comment was taken out of context .
“ There ’s a long list of women whom the public accepts in all kind of roles , ” observes Rather , mentioning Christiane Amanpour as one of the most respected reporters on television .
Moonves , he says , “ thinks the audience is redneck and the press is a bunch of assassins .
I have so much confidence in the audience .
The audience is not going to buy that .
They look at what ’s on the air , and that ’s where they make their decisions . ”
And that , perhaps , gets to the heart of the matter .
The reaction to Couric as anchor has less to do with the fact that she is a woman than it has to do with the type of woman she is — or at least the type she has played on TV .
Despite a long list of accomplished interviews with world leaders and politicians , from Tony Blair to President Bush to Kofi Annan , Couric has a hard time shaking the perception that she ’s light and girlish , as opposed to serious and mature .
She blames it on the later incarnation of the Today show .
“ I think the show got increasingly soft during my tenure , during the end of it , ” she says , referring to the version of the program run by former executive producer Tom Touchet , with whom she often clashed .
“ And that ’s one of the reasons I was n’t fulfilled journalistically in the job .
Perhaps the most recent memory of me in the eyes of some people is of the softer , fun aspects of the Today show , which I totally enjoyed and I think I did well in , but it was n’t the whole enchilada for me . ”
The algorithm for why a news personality appeals or does n’t turns out to be much more complicated than gender or reporting chops or whether someone came from morning television .
After all , Charlie Gibson — the leader in the ratings — came from Good Morning America .
Although , as Couric points out , “ he was more of an avuncular figure on that show .
I was encouraged to show a fun , playful side more . ”
And Diane Sawyer , Couric ’s chief competitor for the mantle of most powerful and respected woman in television news , has done basically the same job as Couric for the last decade , yet no one questions Sawyer ’s seriousness and credibility when she bags exclusive interviews or does hard news .
Couric suspects that if Sawyer were doing an evening news broadcast , she might have run into the same issues .
“ Perhaps . ”
But as it stands , Sawyer has exceptionally high favorability ratings , topping a Gallup poll last year measuring viewer opinion on TV news people .
Meanwhile , as Couric has shifted away from her flirty , funny , line - flubbing , relatable morning personality to a harder , edgier , and ultimately more humorless evening persona , her Q score — the gold standard of favorability ratings — has declined .
( As of last year , she was on par with Dan Rather . )
Maybe it ’s just growing pains as she moves from one phase of her career to the next .
But the worry is that her transformation into Anchor Katie might be obscuring what made many people like her to begin with .
As her friend Hewitt puts it , “ I do n’t think CBS was ready for the change they said they were .
They bought Diet Coke and turned it into bottled milk .
They totally changed the brand . ”
Back at Sarabeth ’s restaurant , Couric has grown reflective .
“ I still believe I did the right thing , in my heart , ” she says .
“ I would always regret not taking it .
There are no guarantees , I knew that going in .
I did n’t think I was going to take the evening news world by storm , and if I gave anyone that impression , I ’m embarrassed .
I thought I had done something for a while , this genre could use a little shot in the arm , maybe I could revitalize it somewhat .
I had no delusions that this was a growing enterprise .
I mean , I ’m not an idiot … I think that ’s why some of this pettiness and sort of gleeful evisceration of me does n’t cut as much as you might think or even I might have thought .
My expectations were never so high that if I was n’t No. 1 it would be devastating to me . ”
Of course , that ’s not the message that was conveyed by the massive hype that surrounded her arrival at CBS .
And there is no shortage of people ( many of them inside CBS News ) who believe that Moonves unintentionally laid the groundwork for her downfall with the excessive buildup .
On this question , Couric is careful but clear .
“ Um , I think he , you know , probably could have been told , ‘ Easy , Les , do n’t overpromise , ’ ” she says .
“ But he was excited and enthusiastic and he saw this as an opportunity to push the envelope . ”
Couric says she was advised by at least one friend to downplay her arrival .
“ I remember Barry Diller saying , ‘ Just be very low - key about it , ’ ” she says .
“ And if I had my druthers , would I have not been on every bus in New York ?
Especially the ones that almost ran me over , which would be the ultimate modern - day O . Henry story ?
Yeah . ”
Moonves , a TV executive with a barrel - chested confidence in his gut for good TV , says he bears no responsibility for how the show has failed : “ Nope .
I really do n’t . ”
But with ratings hovering between 6 and 7 million viewers a night , CBS News has to figure out how to salvage the estimated $ 75 million it ’s paying Couric over five years .
For now , the goal is simply to stanch the viewer bleed .
Executive producer Rick Kaplan ’s job is to bring consistency to the program .
He ’ll bring new ideas to the show , he says , “ but it ’s not necessarily new flaky ideas .
Or new sketchy ideas .
It ’s about maybe some new but basic ideas . ”
Couric admits that her original version of the show had problems .
“ Perhaps some of the pieces were too long , they were n’t as compelling .
‘ FreeSpeech ’— maybe every night it did n’t hold up . ”
But she still believes in what they were trying to achieve .
“ People can get the news anywhere , they do n’t have to wait for the television .
Take , say , up - armored vehicles : one vehicle that was n’t up - armored , the ramifications of that on a soldier from Dallas .
That ’s a humanistic illustration of a news - making story . ”
Couric seems determined not to let anyone see her suffer , but according to several people familiar with the situation , she is privately frustrated ( “ Going through hell , ” says one producer ) and moody about the ratings .
The stress has caused her to blow up at her staff for small infractions on the set .
During the tuberculosis story in June , Couric got angry with news editor Jerry Cipriano for using a word she detested — “ sputum ” — and the staff grew tense when she began slapping him “ over and over and over again ” on the arm , according to a source familiar with the scene .
It had seemed like a joke at first , but it quickly became clear that she was n’t kidding .
“ I sort of slapped him around , ” Couric admits .
“ I got mad at him and said , ‘ You ca n’t do this to me .
You have to tell me when you ’re going to use a word like that . ’
I was aggravated , there ’s no question about that . ”
But she says she has a good relationship with Cipriano .
“ We did ban the word sputum from all future broadcasts .
It became kind of a joke . ”
Couric is looking to the 2008 election cycle as an opportunity to build her reputation as the network ’s authoritative voice .
She ’ll be moderating a presidential debate in December in Los Angeles , and CBS has hired Washington correspondent Jeff Greenfield from CNN as a familiar face who can serve in a veteran Tim Russert–type role when she ’s analyzing the race .
( In addition , she ’ll be broadcasting alongside Schieffer , who will remain the host of Face the Nation through 2008 , which should make for interesting viewing . )
“ She ’ll get to prove her mettle , ” says Kaplan .
“ That ’s where she ’ll prove all the things she can do , and , boy , do I like our chances . ”
But Couric is realistic enough to imagine that it might not work out in the end .
“ If it turns out it was n’t a perfect fit , ” she says , “ then , you know , I ’ll do something else that ’s really exciting and fulfilling for me . ”
She brightens when discussing her future work for 60 Minutes .
While she refutes widespread rumors that she ’s going to jump to 60 Minutes , Couric does plan to ramp up her production there , with the intention of doing eight - to - ten segments in the coming season .
This summer , for instance , she ’s interviewing former CIA operative Valerie Plame for an exclusive in the fall , tied to Plame ’s tell - all published by Simon & Schuster .
It ’s obvious that 60 Minutes best reflects what Couric would like to do — exclusive interviews with newsmakers and celebrities — much more so than does the current version of the CBS Evening News .
Jeff Fager , the executive producer of the show , says he can easily imagine Couric working at 60 Minutes full time .
“ I could see that , yes , ” he says .
“ I ’m sure she ’d probably like to do that some nights . ”
When I bring up Fager ’s comment to Couric , she agrees , “ Yes , and have a little more of a life . ”
It makes you wonder if she does n’t have days when she wakes up and wishes she had n’t jumped to CBS News .
“ I mean , of course .
I ’m human .
I ’m not going around , ‘ Dee - da dee - da dee , ’ ” she says .
“ I have days when I ’m like , ‘ Oh my God , what did I do ? ’ ”
She pauses .
“ But for some weird reason , they do n’t happen that often . ”
She summons a smile .
Even now , her optimism is irrepressible .
Official Account of 9/11 a “ Joke ” and a “ Cover-u p ”
September 23 , 2007 – Seven CIA veterans have severely criticized the official account of 9/11 and have called for a new investigation .
“ I think at simplest terms , there ’s a cover - up .
The 9/11 Report is a joke , ” said Raymond McGovern , 27 - year veteran of the CIA , who chaired National Intelligence Estimates during the seventies .
“ There are a whole bunch of unanswered questions .
And the reason they ’re unanswered is because this administration will not answer the questions , ” he said .
McGovern , who is also the founder of VIPS ( Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ) , is one of many signers of a petition to reinvestigate 9/11 . [ 1 ]

During his 27 - year CIA career , McGovern personally delivered intelligence briefings to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , their Vice Presidents , Secretaries of State , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and many other senior government officials .
Upon retirement in 1990 , McGovern was awarded the CIA ’s Intelligence Commendation Medallion and received a letter of appreciation from then President George H. W. Bush .
However , McGovern returned the award [ 2 ] in 2006 in protest of the current George W. Bush Administration ’s advocacy and use of torture .
In his blurb for 9/11 and American Empire : Intellectuals Speak Out , ” edited by David Ray Griffin and Peter Dale Scott , McGovern wrote [ 3 ] :
“ It has long been clear that the Bush - Cheney administration cynically exploited the attacks of 9/11 to promote its imperial designs .
But the present volume confronts us with evidence for an even more disturbing conclusion : that the 9/11 attacks were themselves orchestrated by this administration precisely so they could be thus exploited .
If this is true , it is not merely the case , as the Downing Street memos show , that the stated reason for attacking Iraq was a lie .
It is also the case that the whole “ war on terror ” was based on a prior deception .
This book hence confronts the American people --- indeed the people of the world as a whole --- with an issue second to none in importance and urgency .
I give this book , which in no way can be dismissed as the ravings of ‘ paranoid conspiracy theorists , ’ my highest possible recommendation . ”
William Christison , a 29 - year CIA veteran , former National Intelligence Officer ( NIO ) and former Director of the CIA 's Office of Regional and Political Analysis also describes the 9/11 Commission Report as a “ joke ” and offers even more outspoken criticism .
In a 2006 audio interview [ 4 ] he said , " We very seriously need an entirely new very high level and truly independent investigation of the events of 9/11 .
I think you almost have to look at the 9/11 Commission Report as a joke and not a serious piece of analysis at all . ”
Earlier this year , in an endorsement of David Ray Griffin ’s book , Debunking 9/11 Debunking , Christison wrote [ 5 ] , “ [ There ’s ] a strong body of evidence showing the official U.S. Government story of what happened on September 11 , 2001 to be almost certainly a monstrous series of lies . ”
And in an online essay [ 6 ] in late 2006 , he wrote , “ I now think there is persuasive evidence that the events of September did not unfold as the Bush administration and the 9/11 Commission would have us believe . …
An airliner almost certainly did not hit The Pentagon . …
The North and South Towers of the World Trade Center almost certainly did not collapse and fall to earth because hijacked aircraft hit them . ”
Prior to his retirement from the CIA in 1979 , Christison served as Director of the CIA 's Office of Regional and Political Analysis , overseeing 200 analysts who collected intelligence and provided analysis on all regions and every country in the world .
Prior to that , he served as one of only a handful of NIO ’s in the intelligence community .
NIO ’s are responsible for the intelligence community efforts in a particular area and are the principal advisors to the Director of Central Intelligence .
Christison was NIO for Southeast Asia , South Asia , and Africa .
Melvin Goodman , PhD , is another former senior CIA official who calls the 9/11 Commission Report a “ coverup ” and who signed the petition to reinvestigate 9/11 . [ 7 ]
Goodman was the Division Chief of the CIA ’s Office of Soviet Affairs and served as Senior Analyst from 1966 - 1990 .
He also served as Professor of International Security at the National War College from 1986 - 2004 .
In testimony before a 2005 Congressional briefing on the 9/11 Commission Report [ 8 ] , Goodman said , “ I want to talk about the [ 9/11 ]
Commission itself , about the flawed process of the Commission and finally about the conflict of interest within the Commission that is extremely important to understand the failure of the Commission . …
The final report is ultimately a coverup .
I do n't know how else to describe it . "
Goodman is currently Senior Fellow at the Center for International Policy and Adjunct Professor of Government at Johns Hopkins University .
Robert Baer is another well known CIA veteran who has questioned the official account of 9/11 .
A 21 - year CIA veteran and specialist in the Middle East , Baer was awarded the Career Intelligence Medal upon his retirement in 1997 .
After retirement , he wrote two best - selling non-fiction books about the CIA , See No Evil and Sleeping with the Devil , the former of which was the basis for the Academy Award - winning movie Syriana , starring George Clooney .
Baer was also the writer and on - camera commentator for the Emmy Award - nominated documentary Cult of the Suicide Bomber .
Baer has repeatedly questioned whether al - Qaida could have accomplished 9/11 alone .
The 9/11 Commission Report categorically found al - Qaida to be entirely responsible for 9/11 , stating , " Similarly , we have seen no evidence that any foreign government -- or government official -- supplied any funding . "
However , this 9/11 Commission finding directly contradicts the earlier finding of the Joint House - Senate Select Intelligence Committee 's 2002 Report [ 9 ] ( p.415 ) of " sources of foreign support for some of the September 11 hijackers . ”
In a 2002 essay [ 10 ] for The Guardian , Baer wrote , " Did bin Laden act alone , through his own al - Qaida network , in launching the attacks ?
About that I 'm far more certain and emphatic : no . "
In subsequent interviews , Baer has suggested that support for the attacks could have come from Saudi Arabia and Iran .
In 2006 , during an interview by Thom Hartmann [ 11 ] , Baer , after commenting on the financial profits being made from 9/11 , was asked : “ What about political profit ?
There are those who suggest that ... someone in that chain of command ... had pretty good knowledge that 9/11 was going to happen -- and really did n't do much to stop it -- or even obstructed efforts to stop it because they thought it would lend legitimacy to Bush 's ... failing presidency . ”
Baer replied : “ Absolutely . ”
Hartmann then asked , “ So you are personally of the opinion ... that there was an aspect of ' inside job ' to 9/11 within the U.S. government ? "
To which Baer replied , " There is that possibility , the evidence points at it . "
When Hartmann continued , " And why is it not being investigated ? ”
Baer replied , " Why is n't the WMD story being investigated ?
Why has n't anybody been held accountable for 9/11 ?
We held people accountable after Pearl Harbor .
Why has there been no change in command ?
Why have there been no political repercussions ?
Why has there been no -- any sort of exposure on this ?
It really makes you wonder . "
In his blurb for the revised and updated edition of David Ray Griffin ’s Debunking 9/11 Debunking , Baer wrote [ 12 ] : " Until we get a complete , honest , transparent investigation … , we will never know what happened on 9/11 . ”
" I am forced to conclude that 9/11 was at a minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war , ” wrote well - known intelligence analyst Robert David Steele in 2006 in a review of the book , 9/11 Synthetic Terror by Webster Tarpley [ 13 ] .
Steele is the author of numerous books on the intelligence services and is currently the CEO of OSS. net , a proponent of Open Source Intelligence .
Steele has 25 years of combined service in the CIA and the U.S. Marine Corps .
He also served as the second ranking civilian ( GS - 14 ) in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence from 1988 - 1992 and was a member of the Adjunct Faculty of Marine Corps University .
Steele continued , “ I have to tell anyone who cares to read this : I believe it .
I believe it enough to want a full investigation that passes the smell test of the 9/11 families as well as objective outside observers . ”
In a subsequent interview on the Alex Jones Show [ 14 ] , Steele said , " The U.S. government did not properly investigate this [ 9/11 ] and there are more rocks to be turned over , " and added , " I 'm absolutely certain that WTC 7 was brought down by controlled demolition and that , as far as I 'm concerned , means that this case has not been properly investigated .
There 's no way that building could have come down without controlled demolition . "
In late 2004 , a group of 25 intelligence service and law enforcement veterans sent a joint letter to Congress [ 15 ] expressing their concerns about “ serious shortcomings , ” “ omissions , ” and “ major flaws ” in the 9/11 Commission Report and offering their services for a new investigation .
Their letter was apparently entirely ignored .
Among the signers were four CIA veterans ; Raymond McGovern and Melvin Goodman ( both mentioned above ) and Lynne Larkin and David MacMichael .
Lynne Larkin was a CIA Operations Officer who served in several CIA foreign stations before being assigned to the CIA 's Counter - Intelligence Center .
There , she co-chaired a multi-agency task force , which , among other functions , provided direction to other federal agencies for coordinating intelligence efforts among the many intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
David MacMichael , PhD , is a former Senior Estimates Officer at the CIA with special responsibility for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the CIA 's National Intelligence Council .
Prior to joining the CIA , he served as a U.S. Marine Corps officer for ten years and for four years as a counter - insurgency advisor to the government .
Their letter read :
" [ W ]e the undersigned wish to bring to the attention of the Congress and the people of the United States what we believe are serious shortcomings in the report and its recommendations . …
Omission is one of the major flaws in the Commission ’s report .
We are aware of significant issues and cases that were duly reported to the commission by those of us with direct knowledge , but somehow escaped attention . …
The omission of such serious and applicable issues and information by itself renders the report flawed , and casts doubt on the validity of many of its recommendations .
...
The Commission , with its incomplete report of " facts and circumstances " , intentional avoidance of assigning accountability , and disregard for the knowledge , expertise and experience of those who actually do the job , has now set about pressuring our Congress and our nation to hastily implement all its recommendations . …
We the undersigned , who have worked within various government agencies ( FBI , CIA , FAA , DIA , Customs ) responsible for national security and public safety , call upon you in Congress to include the voices of those with first - hand knowledge and expertise in the important issues at hand .
We stand ready to do our part . ”
And they and thousands of dedicated , loyal , and experienced military officers , intelligence service and law enforcement veterans , and government officials still stand ready to provide assistance for a thorough , impartial , and honest investigation into the terrible acts of 9/11 .

NSA ' may not realize ' it collected info on innocent Americans , top US spy says David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Powerful supercomputers are vacuuming up so much information that logs of calls to or from innocent Americans could exist in government databases indefinitely , the nation 's top intelligence official said Tuesday .
" You may not even realize it's in the database because you do lots of collection , " Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said , referring to the " inadvertent collection " of Americans ' communications through a vast surveillance program instituted after 9/11 .
An untold number of communication logs on US citizens could exist within a National Security Agency database of information gained through warrantless wiretaps of foreigners abroad , McConnell said , because NSA spies do not examine the full contents on all the information it collects until it has a reason to do so .
" If it 's foreign intelligence , it 's treated the way we discussed , " and the government works to secure a warrant against anyone within the US it has reason to believe deserves further surveillance , McConnell said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday .
" If it 's now recognized as incidental , it would be expunged from the database . "
The full scope of Americans who have been inadvertently and unknowingly snared in the warrantless wiretapping program remains murky and elusive .
On Tuesday , Sen. Russ Feingold pressed McConnell on whether recent updates to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorized " bulk collection " on calls from abroad into America .
" It would be authorized , if it were physically possible to do so , " McConnell said .
" But the purpose of the authorization is for foreign intelligence . "
Feingold pressed , " So there is no language actually prohibiting this ? "
As long as the communication is " foreign , in a foreign country , for intelligence purposes , " there 's not , McConnell said .
McConnell told the El Paso Times last month that " 100 or less " US persons were targets of foreign intelligence gathering .
But that number only represents those for whom the government received a warrant to spy on , McConnell clarified in later congressional testimony .
The intelligence director then insisted that a " small " number of Americans had been spied on -- purposefully or not -- although he noted that designation should be judged in context of the " billions of transactions " monitored by the NSA .
President Bush initiated a warrantless wiretapping scheme he later referred to as the " Terrorist Surveillance Program " soon after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Details on the early days of the program and its legal justifications remain out of view as the White House has steadfastly refused to hand over documents on the program requested by congressional judiciary and intelligence committees .
Just before a month - long summer recess -- and in a week when Republicans raised terror fears with a " bogus " bomb plot aimed at the Capitol -- the Democratic Congress approved sweeping new wiretapping powers that critics say sweepingly authorized the extra-legal powers President Bush had claimed for himself .
The Protect America Act , as spying - expansion was called , set a six - month limit on its expansions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
McConnell has been scuffing the corridors of Capitol Hill since early last week pushing Congress to not only make permanent the FISA expansions , but to give the government more authority and immunize telecommunications companies that have helped the government collect data on its citizens .
McConnell 's testimony has been carefully crafted to give lawmakers the impression that analysts are accessing little information beyond their specific surveillance of known terror targets , but a careful parsing of his statements reveals a program that could be collecting far more information that the administration has acknowledged .
" They obtain an enormous amount [ of information ] ... that they can search by computer , " Lisa Graves , deputy director of the Center for National Security Studies , told RAW STORY .
McConnell stresses the " minimization " efforts that are in place requiring that information unrelated to terror investigations be expunged from national security databases .
But his clarification that NSA analysts must first examine the collected data leaves open the question of how much information on Americans continues to be subject to data - mining efforts of information electronically swept into government databases , Graves said .
Analysts ,
Graves said , are trying to examine " the ocean of communication , to look in it for grains of said , when the vast , vast , vast majority of communications are innocent . "
The following video is from C - SPAN 3 , broadcast on September 25 .
In the following video , Senator Feingold is critical of ' broad and ambiguous ' spying law

MACHINES DECERTIFIED !!!
ONLY ONE MACHINE PER PRECINCT FOR DISABLED VOTERS WILL BE ALLOWED !
While media members waited on hold to hear the announcement from the Secretary of State , the song “ Coward of the County ” played .
See attached Press Release from SAVE R VOTE !
By announcing the results at 11:59 p.m. , the Secretary of State likely avoids any possibility of counties filing an injunction in time to meet the 6 - month pre-Primary election deadline .
Quotes from Bowen : Fewer than ½ of CA counties use DREs .
Many in many counties are using paper ballots .
Many use optical scan machines .
Many voters in CA will NOT be affected by this decision .
There will be one single recertification document .
Diebold – Optical scan system – decertified and recertified only if meets certain requirements .
Diebold DREs – decertified and recertified subject to certain conditions .
Only one machine in a polling place for use by disabled voters .
Reduces risk of viral attacks that could infect central equipment .
Sequoia – Optec optical scan – decertified and recertified – subject to conditions Sequoia AVC Edge I and II – decertifying and recertifying with a number of security requirements including only one machine in each voting location to allow independent access by disabled voters – concern regarding corruption of software and source code Hart Intercivic – eSlate used only by one county – decertifying and recertifying subject to security requirements .
Has the least risk of the three systems .
E S & S InkaVote Plus – ( LA County ) – ES&S submitted 3 months late and due to failure to submit timely as required by prior administration requirements and election code , withdraws and decertifies and does NOT recertify at this time .

Someone just sent me this quote from Bowen 's plans .
Have n't had time to verify it .
" The vendor must provide printing specifications for paper ballots to the Secretary of State .
The Secretary of State will certify printers to print ballots for this system based upon their demonstrated ability to do so .
The vendor may not require exclusivity in ballot printing and must cooperate fully in certification testing of ballots produced on other ballot printers . "
What this means to me is that she 's looking at things in a * very * detailed way .
It seems on the surface like it's a minor detail whether or not the vendors print the paper ballots .
But it 's not .
Because if they print them , they have extras .
And extras can be substituted for real ballots .
Experience has told us this .
Very good sign that Bowen and her team are looking at this .

Let every electronic voting machine company know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty .
This much we pledge — and more .
Thank you Debra Bowen for exposing the lies and corruption of the Diebolds and Sequoias of the world , and for exposing ES&S for the coward it is , afraid to even submit its systems for scrutiny .
I will rest easier knowing you are at the helm , as Secretary of State of the largest state in the union , and the sixth largest economy in the world .
You are a person of great wisdom , courage and integrity .
I salute you , Secretary Bowen !

Re : Early Voting systems
The DRE 's used in early voting also require 100 % manual recount ( Edge Model I or II , AccuVote TSx ) .
However , I do n't see any mention of the Hart eSlate getting a 100 % manual recount if used in early voting .
The other systems specifically mention this fact .
Not sure why that is ...

We 've used op - scans with paper ballots here in San Diego , so I 'm not overjoyed at using them again .
Yes , they 're better than DREs , but they still can't assure voters of honest elections .
Bowen 's plan does not ban sleepovers .
Bowen 's plan still allows the " tamper - evident seals " that Bev Harris proved worthless .
You can open up the machine , remove the memory card , replace it with a rigged one , and seal the machine back up , all without ever touching the " tamper - evident " seal , which will then show no sign of tampering .
A picture of the placement of the numbered seal will not demonstrate that the defect that allows this to occur ( a larger hole on that side of the bar that it " seals " ) has been corrected .
Bowen can let " federal labs " ( Sean Southworth ? ) certify the software .
The vote count is still secret .
There is still no way that the public can observe and verify it .
If Bowen was serious about protecting voters , not just placating vendors and elections officials , that totally worthless " tamper - evident seal " that does n't show any evidence when the machine is tampered with , would be banned , as would sleepovers .
Looks to me that the machines were " conditionally " recertified at the same time they were " decertified , " which means that they never were decertified .

You think she was trying to " placate " vendors and officials ?!
Good lord .
There are elections to run , amigo .
Would you prefer hand - counted paper ballots , as Tobi and Harris have described it , in a hostile environment ?
You think that would work ?
Think again .
A path is built one stone at a time .
Bowen just laid down quite a few of them in a row .
As to your contention that sleepovers are not banned , I 'm not so sure about that .
So stay tuned .

From the nytimes :
Company officials have downplayed the results of Bowen 's review , saying they reflected unrealistic , worst - case scenarios that would be counteracted by security measures taken by the companies and local election officials .
The companies also complained that the examiners had access to computer coding , manuals and other information that is not available to the public .
Haha !

Mark is pretty much on target here , I am sorry to say ( not b/c it ’s Mark , but b/ c there ARE a bunch of unplugged holes here ) .
But before diving into the depths of depression , let me say this about that !
This is the most significant positive action by any politician since Kennedy ( for those who believe in JFK ) .
It dumps tens or hundreds of thousands of DREs by limiting them to one per precinct , and only for use by disabled voters ( although 5 votes MUST be cast on each DRE , so maybe they will drag … oh , I ’m not going there ! ) .
It frightened ES&S so much that they squealed and cried and stamped their feet , and refused to open themselves up to scrutiny .
They got decertified ( yes it is a bit unclear on how they may weasel back into certification in time for 2/08 ) .
Even though every precinct will now be limited to one DRE , the DREs will still go on sleepovers , albeit likely much shorter .
But I ’ve raised the issue many times , why no background checks on poll workers and poll captains ?
It sadly does allow sleepovers and requires better training for those who will be responsible for the machines for the period (s ) before the polls open .
Yeah , the tamper - evident seals are a joke if you can get to where you need to go without triggering them .
Serial numbering them wo n’t be of much help if they remain virgin .
The federal labs deal – allowing vendors to provide software from the federal labs OR from the SOS – what a freakin’ huge loophole .
You can drive a truck through it , or hire Sean Southworth to drive it for you !
I was appalled when I read they would allow software to come directly from the “ federal labs ” , which of course are neither federal nor labs .
We all know they get their certification qualification because they ( the vendors ) PAY the ITAs to issue exactly what they want and hold back the bad stuff .
I had expected , hoped for , a more robust statement of the role of the public but saw it only in relation to the DREs , which will be few and far between .
There was nothing there about transparency in the central tabulator process , and that is the biggest danger of all – where 100,000 votes can be flipped in a millisecond .
No new requirements that I could find that would allow for any added citizen oversight .
And even though there will be WAY fewer machines , it only takes ONE virus - infected voting cartridge to infect the central tabulator , and then the whole election is in question .
Debra Bowen and her staff and the computer scientists from the UC System performed an incredibly valuable service to the voters in a VERY VERY short period of time .
I believe she will continue to pull the reins in tighter and tighter , and that she acted on issues she could be reasonably assured would not be shot down in a court battle .
There WILL be more battles , and she will win more and more .
Would I have liked to see all of the above concerns wiped out ?
Absolutely !
Do I think they are still so serious as to allow rigging of an election ?
Absolutely !
Do I think it will be somewhat harder to rig elections under the new rules ?
–
Yes , a bit .
Do I believe she will be back for several more wins in this World Series – absolutely !
Let ’s make sure we stay tight with the SOS and work constructively to get the rest of the loopholes pinched closed .
A lot of great work has been done , and laid the foundation for a lot of great decisions in the future .

Now I do n't have to get a bad taste in my mouth any longer when I say " Secretary of State " .
Now it feels like minty freshness ... thanks Debra for even making the word " politician " not always leave a bad taste in my mouth ( e.g. the Ken Blackwell , Karen Harris taste ) .
Politicians take note : if you need an example of what the people want to think of when they say " election official " , Debra Bowen is that example .

A wonderful step by Debra Boewman but leaves a real problem .
Thousands of people in a given place vote Democratic on paper .
A dozen or so impared people vote on the machines .
Machines , however deliver several hundred thousand votes for neo-cons .
Might we again hear Rush Limbaugh hollering ; " Get over it - the GOP won fare and square "
One machine can off - set any number of honest ballots .
Needs to be a way to show that machines can not deliver more votes than voters who used them .
Cons do , & will cheat - that 's what they are all about .
Machines can deliver no more votes that the number that use them .
That has to be made clear .

For those upset that everything was n't decertified - note that she has changed the audit !!!
Yahoo !!!
And it 's not just count more votes or a tier audit .
It 's the risk based audit - the closer the race , the more votes get counted !!!
This is so HUGE .
This is so MAJOR .
Given that the Holt Bill is almost there with the tiered audit , which is better than just a single number , but still wasteful and does n't catch everything .
So now we will have a meaningful audit !!!
NOw if the elections officials can manage to understand how to do this , transparently , we are almost there ....

We need a sample of Debra Bowen 's blood because I think she is a carrier of the antidote to the Senate virus .
Yesterday they could not recall that we have a 4th Amendment and gave Gonzales warrantless wiretap power .
The House refused .
The " I can't recall " virus is a Senate disease .
Politicians can not recall what the people want , like this fellow who is infected with the disease :
For 20 years [ he ] has been forgetting everything that just happened .
All day long , he believes he has just woken from a deep haze .
...
He has no memories , no images , nothing .
( Spiegal ) .
The antidote to this disease is in the blood of Debra Bowen , and I hope she will give some blood to the US Senate blood bank .
When they ask for out vote next time , we can say " I do n't recall who you are " .
I want a third party .

The question to the ROVs should be , " A lawsuit will cost the voting taxpayers WHAT ?
Please , avoid the controversy , be economical , follow the law , and just purchase a few extra scanners .
Make the voters happy . "
I am particularly pleased about the Inka - Vote decertification .

And btw , one machine per polling place is just fine .
That 's what we had at the polling place that contained the two precincts I worked at .
We were located near areas in which a lot of senior citizens lived , and I saw maybe a couple dozen handicapped voters come in , yet no one used either machine .
It was my job to go to the training for them , set them up , and take them down .

We all need to be contacting these news stations and telling them what was really at stake , how they are enabling the hackers of our democracy .
I would start with KCRA Channel 3 , whose weekend anchorperson has been placing emphasis on certain words in order to discredit Debra and her legitimate findings .
I believe his name is Mike Terrcel .

To LeftIsBest and Mark and the others concerned that Bowen has n't yet gone far enough ... Just a reminder that last night was about certification of voting systems that had to be done by midnight to take effect for next Feb 's primary .
Polling place procedures and other executive rulings , etc. can be made separately .
For example , Bowen is already on record ( prior to the election ) as saying she felt voting machine sleepovers are illegal .
She can file an order or specific decision on that at any time .
It did n't have to be done last night .
Same with many other election procedures .
All of which is why I 've suggested we " stay tuned " .
Beyond that , I agree that sending letter to your local media / papers with your opinions on the Bowen decisions so far is a very good ide .
The ONLY thing the Elections Officials ( the ones who choose to cast their lot with the vendors anyway ) and the vendors themselves have left is to try and destroy Bowen .
That campaign is already on .
I suggest citizens stand up to it any way possible .

... Bruce said on 8/4/2007 @ 9:30 am PT ...
Having read all the posts , I will concur that Bowen 's actions are a start and she is to be congratulated for manuevering between public demand and election official / vendor demands ( and yes , except for a few election officials , vendors and election officials are ' family ' and of the same in their mindset ) .
BUT it seems to have been forgotten that the source code reviews basically said that ALL the systems need to be re-engineered so allowing any of the components to be used is not what is needed .
And Brad , you seem to forget Rebecca Mercuri 's offer and letter ; yeah , HCPB everywhere might be a hostile environment but it 's going to be anyway .
AND for all of you ; I have sweated and fought with the SD ROV via public records requests re three consecutive elections and sent an election complaint into Bowen 's office for investigation regarding :
a precinct not counted in the Nov.2005 election ; the GEMS audit log reflecting either an external connection or someone in the GEMS database during vote tabulation ( and misrepresentations to the SOS from Mischelle Townsend and an outright lie by Deborah Seiler to Bowen 's office ) in the June 2006 election ; the failure of the SD ROV to test - per the ' Procedures for Use - all the touchscreens and memory cards used in the Nov. 2006 election ( with the documentation to back up my claims , including the witnessing of the records ( what little there was ) by an attorney . )
AND FOR WHAT ?
The Election Division of the SOS ' investigation ' consisted of querying the Registrar of Voters whether such was ' true ' ;
And since the ROV said that such was n't true , that 's the end of it .
So all of you election integrity activists who think that covering all the ' conditional provisions ' and then finding that such were not adhered to and then making an election complaint about such will make a difference , I have to tell you that I just wo n't believe it .
' Conditional procedures ' are useless if not followed and ignore the base issues associated with the systems .
That said , Bowen 's actions throws a big monkey wrench into Mikel Haas ' budgetary allocation for $ 5 M more of the touchscreens in San Diego .

Okay , what is officially the " one county " using Hart Intercivic eSlate ?
These machines were recently introduced here in San Mateo County , but the Los Angeles Times reports that they are used in Orange Counties [ sic ] .
The Times also reports that Bowen 's announcement was made at " 11:51 a.m. " in the evening .
I think the Times could use a few good proofreaders .
By the way , for what it 's worth , in our most recent election in San Mateo County , as I recall there was one eSlate per precinct , while most voters used paper ballots --- exactly as Bowen is recommending .

... Nancy Tobi said on 8/4/2007 @ 11:24 am PT ...
Brad cited me above : " Would you prefer hand - counted paper ballots , as Tobi and Harris have described it , in a hostile environment ?
You think that would work ?
Think again . "
This makes it appear as though I , and possible Bev Harris as well , prefer technoelections over hand count when faced with a hostile hand count situation .
So I would like to clarify a few things here .
I can not speak for Bev , but for myself , I will say that I do not prefer hostile hand counts , of course , but I will take them any day over the technoelection coup d'etat we have sustained in our nation since the 1980's .
I believe that our democracy will be restored ( or created , depending on how you look at things ) only when we completely eliminate all of the computerized voting equipment from our elections .
Op scans , DREs , e-pollbooks , and possibly the voter registration databases ( I withhold judgment on those only because I have not yet taken the time to investigate abuse with them , and the NH implementation seems sound enough ) .
I believe that only elections using hand marked , hand cast , and hand counted processes with full citizen oversight of the end to end voting process ( except of course the secret ballot ) , will confirm our commitment to our Republic as a free and open democratic society .
When I talk about hostile hand counts I am referring to those conducted by election officials who prefer to sabotage the election because they do n't believe in hand counting , do n't want to take the time , or are just plain criminals .
I personally have been witness to this , and it is not a pretty sight .
And there are plenty of these types to go around , aided and abetted by criminal Party hacks .
We must recognize this challenge , just as we recognize the criminality of technoelection fraud .
This challenge , once recognized , however , is much easier to deal with than technoelection fraud .
We can boot out the criminals .
We can neutralize them with laws , rules , regulations , and public observation compounded with public humiliation .
But if we want to implement rational and workable hand count elections that sustain integrity of results , we need to be aware of , recognize , and neutralize the hostile hand count saboteurs in our midst .
This acknowledgment on my part , and I suspect Bev would agree , in no way infers that I think we should default instead to technoelections !!!
Just that we need to be diligent in laying the proper foundations , education , and training , to implement hand count elections that are effective , efficient , and create integrity of election results .
It 's really just a management thing .
We manage people , process , paper , and numbers .
And if the people are skanks , we need to recognize that and deal with it .

Not necessarily .
Remember , this is a process of turning around the Titanic here .
It can't be easily done in one fell swoop .
And certainly not with both elections impending and incredibly hostile Officials / Vendors teaming up to do and say anything to save their own asses .
The Titanic has begun to turn .
I expect it will continue to turn .
The search / hope for a silver bullet is fruitless given the enormity of the problem and what has been allowed to happen with so much money , in so many places , to so many voters .
Want to kill HCPB forever ?
Force Mikel Haas and friends to do it across their entire county next February .
Want to see it NOT work and be discredited for an entire nation ?
That 's a great way for that to happen .

Brad , I agree .
This was a great start .
But we all still have a lot of work to do .
Here in California we are facing a avalanche of bad press towards Debra Bowen , her results and her decision .
Mis-information will be the tool that the repugnants use to attack her credibility .
As activists , we must get the word out LOUDLY in papers , on radio and on television , where ever we can find the public tuned in .
While we are doing this we must keep fighting for the next steps .
This is not a one step solution .
This is an enormous problem .
The repugnants knew what they were doing as they got HAVA passed with all the emphasis on electronic voting machines .
They sent out their ROV's to brag about the machines .
They had articles in papers nation wide .
And so on .
We have to look at this not as the building that we are taking down in one fell swoop with explosives , but as the problem we are dismanteling in large chuncks .
I believe that our SOS will file some sort of charges against any person who broke the law as Brad referred to : " Polling place procedures and other executive rulings , etc. can be made separately .
For example , Bowen is already on record ( prior to the election ) as saying she felt voting machine sleepovers are illegal .
She can file an order or specific decision on that at any time .
It did n't have to be done last night . " ( dismanteling requires timing )
This should be the next step .
And I hope that all of us will be contacting Bowen 's office to ' remind ' her of this and ask that she follow through .
It really does n't matter where you live , you can still contact her office and request that she follow through .
So as I see it , we keep working .
We must 1st get a lot of positive info out about Bowen and her great work .
Making clear what her decision means and why this was done .
Secondly we must keep working on getting the illegal actions of poll workers stopped and this would mean adding new laws or rules from Bowens office that state directly to these problems .
At the same time we can keep pushing for legal actions to be taken against those who have already broken laws .
I know it seems like a really long fight .
But is n't it worth it ?
And are n't days like today and very late last night inspiring and energizing for all of us to keep pushing .
Consider the consequences if we do not keep working on this for as long as it takes .
I am willing to work with all of you to get some plans in place for the next steps .
And yes we will disagree on how from time to time , but we will succeed .
We have to , for our country , for our rights , for our childrens future .
Is n't it fulfilling to watch the good guys win one battle at a time against all those corporate funds and greedy repugnants .

What a partisan hack !!
Debra courageously slew the mighty vote devouring dragons DIEBOLD , ESS and Sequoia .
Scroll down the article and see a comment by Stephen Weir , president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials ,
He said her decision essentially tells " the voting community out there ' your voting system is damaged , but we 're going to fix it . '
That does n't feel good to me . "
What is his point ?
That a damaged system should be left alone ?
Because he has a morbid pleasure in a hackable system .... that the people shouldnt be trusted with deciding who will represent them ?
Is his own job security at risk ?
Would a dictatorship " feel good " to Mr. Weird ... er Weir , Mr Weir .
A HUGE Thank You to Debra Bowen !!

Brad , you said " Want to kill HCPB forever ?
Force Mikel Haas and friends to do it across their entire county next February .
Want to see it NOT work and be discredited for an entire nation ?
That 's a great way for that to happen . "
Whole lot of assumption there that discounts how many people would chip in to make sure that HCPB WOULD work ; Bowen could have de-certified all the machines just based on their non HAVA compliance and certified the Vote - Pad for the disabled .
And it is GEMS that John Washburn was reporting on of how the ' vote flipping ' could occur ; couple that with what I found in the GEMS audit log for the June 2006 election and it is reasonable to question whether Bilbray received the votes that it was reported he got .
And if you saw the documents I have showing how much schmoozing Evan Goldberg has done with Seiler and Vu , you might think differently .
And when I can't get a decent response from Bowen 's office on an election complaint that documents and has witnesses to wrongdoing by the SD ROV , well I can't get to excited about this .
Yes , turning a large organization around is not an easy task but trying to find a middle ground - especially when it is known that complaints will follow no matter what is done - argues for taking an approach that is like solving the gordian knot ; it 's only solved by cutting it .
As evidenced by the postings here .

We all knew Bowen would do the right thing .
Yet one cannot really savor this victory , as on the same day the Dems in the Senate authorized Bush 's warrantless wiretapping .
Staggering .
Unconscionable .
The Dems have once again shown their uncanny stupidity by buying into the " if we do n't allow them to spy on us , we 're going to be attacked !
( by the Neocons , in another false flag " terrorist attack . " )
BS .
Sigh .
They STILL Do n't Get It .
Will there even BE an election in '08 ?
This is looking less and less likely .
Does anyone really believe this bunch would ever simply step down ?
And Bush 's latest executive orders are downright chilling -- they can seize everything you own , no court review , nothing .
We are only one more false flag attack from martial law and suspending our elections indefinitely .
They may do it , and no matter how many millions are suspicious of 9 - 11 and the Neocons , the infiltrated corporate press will parrot the Neocon talking points , and our cowering Democrats will buy into it AGAIN .
This is why I no longer believe that fixing the election system is THE issue it was before ' 06 .
The issue now is * impeachment * and * exposing the truth of 9 - 11 to America * .
That is the only way to end the reign of terror , before the next " false flag " attack gives the Neocons the pretext to suspend the rest of our rights .
I believe time is short for our great republic .
I am refocusing all my energies on trying to get impeachment on the table and to bring 9 - 11 truth to the Dems and the media .
I have gotten a few cautiously encouraging letters back from journalists , and reading between the lines you can tell they agree but are being muzzled .
We have to continue to force the issue enough so that the dam breaks and the corporate media can finally no longer hold back the truth .
In other words , we need to fight as if the survival of America depends on it ... because it does .

I think that the most honest , cheapest way to make sure that the vote in California ( and elsewhere ) is valid would be hand - counted paper ballots at the precinct level , tallied at the precinct level , and then handed up to the county AND state levels simultaneously .
The only way for citizens to trust that their votes count again is for that tally to be certified at the precinct level by the judges on site - I know , because I was a volunteer election judge at my precinct in 2004 .
I do n't see why ANY poll volunteer would mind counting the ballots by hand ( even pairing up " opposing " party member judges to count each ballot cast ) - certifying , along with their fellow poll workers , what the tallies are on the spot , then handing up the results .
All precinct results would be published the next day on the Internet and in the newspapers , leaving no chance for contradiction .
The only thing " wrong " with this approach is that it works .
I can think of no legitimate argument for computer involvement at this time on the part of any legitimately concerned citizens , just those with vested interests in continued voting fraud .
Optical character readers would be fine for a backup JPEG - type file , but I would NOT trust any sort of computerized system , which necessarily would include OCRs , to play any part in tallying any totals - too easy for those totals to change .
That 's why the chain of evidence needs to be so clear from the ground up , without the daisy - chained machines that somehow need to be networked together .
The purest form of democracy is transparent process coupled with the sanctity of the secret ballot ; a precedent might be created along the lines of jury duty ( and paid time off ) to get decent bi-partisan poll workers ...
We would n’t want a repeat of that Farce in Florida ( “ Let us in !
Let us in !! ” ) when 150 Republican foot soldier thugs showed up to storm the Miami - Dade County Canvassing Board during their recount efforts , now would we ...

... FrankLee spun for the corporate masters thusly ...
" With a slap in the face of California 's disabled community , " ... a slap mandated and required by law courtesy of the e-voting corporate whores in the federal government ...
" California 's Secretary of State Debra Bowen has decided that the " easily hackable , insecure , untrustworthy , bug - ridden , " touchscreen voting machines are not good enough to be used under any conditions --- "
Yes she did .
" ... except for the disabled community . "
No , she did n't .
" She does n't want the " sanctity of the vote " jeopardized for " regular " people , so she gives the crappy stuff to the disabled . "
Wrong .
There is no law requiring them to use the crappy stuff and there are non-e-voting solutions available to the disabled in CA .
It was the corporate whores who insisted on offerring only e-voting " solutions " to the disabled .
This a bad situation going back to when e-voting corporate whores at advocacy , state and federal levels pimped the disabled ... by declaring that e-voting was the only way to handle the disabled vote and lying nonstop each and every step of the way while doing it .
(... yes , the corruption spread down even to the advocacy level in the form of disabled " advocacy " groups who accepted massive donations from Diebold et al to praise " disabled e-voting solutions " that ... solutions that did n't even meet disability standards . )
" She does n't care if their vote is lost . "
She does , I believe , but she currently has to put one designated disabled voting station in each precinct and ... ... and listen to the following well ... ... and it was the well - paid corporate whores ... like the former CA Secretary of State Bruce McPherson and the current crop of election officials you hear screaming so loudly ... it was they who insisted on " e- voting only " for the disabled in CA by deliberately refusing all non-e-voting solutions .
And whose fault is that ?
Not the disabled groups who refused to become corporate whores for Diebold et al .
Not the disabled themselves who want only to vote and have that vote counted ... for once ...
And not Secretary of State Bowen who has begun to fix CA 's badly compromised and corrupted elections system .
Come back here with this corporate spin after the county officials explain about why they refused to use the non-e-voting solutions for the disabled that are available .

First , the Presidential Primary will be Feb. 5 , 2008 , so I think she
actually had until Aug. 5 , Sunday , to decertify .
However , she told everyone she would announce her decision on Aug. 3 , and she did .
The statement about printing ballots comes from :
http://www.sos.ca.gov/el...systems/requirements.pdf and is dated 10/5/05 .
Bowen has added it to the Certification
document which is good .
She put major restrictions on Diebold and Sequoia DREs , no more
than 1 per polling place and 100 % manual count , and only minor
restrictions on Hart .
Orange County can still use Hart , but must
train poll workers that every voter has a right to a paper ballot .
This will make it easier to defend in court .

I was happy about the news on De-Certification of E voting systems in CA .
I have a major concern about RE CERTIFICAION .
Testing cannot be done properly if all the software used to create whatever Election has not all been disclosed .
I have this concern with one of the Vendors .
All software used to import information into the tally program , test and verify contest definition information and all other information necessary to present a DRE image of a ballot to the voter on election day , should and MUST BE TESTED IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE ACCURACY ON ELECTION DAY .
At this point in time , I can say for a fact that their are many problems in many states regarding accuracy of a DRE image .
Since states are different in LAW requirements , these states would have no idea on what they should be looking for .
Security is not the primary concern .
The primary concern should be with accuracy of the ballot image which in almost every case comes from data which was used to create the paper ballot .

Agree that the this is just the beginning .
We 've won the battle -- the war goes on .
A couple links .
First one is a comprehensive list of all California newspapers .
Usually fairly easy to figure out how to submit a LTE .
Second link is to Congress.org Media Guide .
Type newspaper name in " Organization Search " and go from there .
http://www.newslink.org/canews.html
http://www.congress.org/congressorg/dbq/media/
This is so important because we could easily see things backslide with the radical regressives and their hack buddies in Corporate Press attempting to bring Sec. Bowen down .
Keeping those LTEs flowing is our best line of defense , as well as letters to our electeds .
We can't stop now !
Many thanks and blessings to SoS Bowen , and all those fighting to preserve our country !

Hey !
How about THIS article from the Sacramento Bee : " California Secretary of State Debra Bowen , bowing to fears of computer fraud , Friday decertified Los Angeles County 's electronic voting system and sharply curtailed the use of two other machines that California counties had hoped to use to conduct the February 2008 presidential primary . "
What 's with the " bowing to fears " part ?
That makes it sound like , " Although Debra Bowen was FOR e-vote machines , she BOWED TO THE FEAR ... " .
What exactly is THAT supposed to mean ?
By the Sacramento Bee ???
Debra Bowen PROACTIVELY dumped them , she did n't " bow to fears " !

Also , from that same article : " She had said she would issue a decision by Friday to comply with a requirement to give counties six months ' lead time to make changes .
But she delayed acting for hours , finally holding a press conference at her downtown office as midnight approached .
Stephen Weir , president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials , questioned her decision - making process , saying Bowen could and should have waited until Monday to act .
Weir said Bowen is moving the ball " in the wrong direction " because she used an improper system to test the machines .
He said her decision essentially tells " the voting community out there ' your voting system is damaged , but we 're going to fix it . '
That does n't feel good to me . " "
The sentence " because she used an improper system to test the machines " is not in quotes , notice .
Did the writer of this ARTICLE say that ???

Thank you ZapKitty for debunking the crap spewed out by FrankLee .
I had a mind to do the same when I read it earlier but I put it off to take a nap ( tired as I was after staying up late waiting for Secretary Bowen 's decision , celebrating afterward and then going to work this morning ) and when I returned to make the effort you had done a better job than I could have anyway .
It should be noted that Ms. Bowen was a proponent of Vote - PAD , a non-computerized device designed to help people with disabilities hand mark a paper ballot .
This inexpensive and effective voting system for the disabled was rejected by Bowen 's EVM - industry - lackey predecessor , Bruce McPherson , after an infamous and gamed certification trial last August .
I 'm sure we 'll see lots more of this kind of propaganda and shrill lies from the voting machine companies , various corrupt or lazy election officials and the likes of FrankLee in the coming days and weeks .
We need to keep rebutting it forcefully and showing Ms. Bowen that we appreciate the courage she showed and true risk she took upon herself by opposing these powerful , corrupt forces and their dangerous , anti-democratic EVMs .
Given how far we have gone down the road to ruin and how powerful the opposing forces have become , it is just plain unrealistic to think that in the time she had she could have made the even more profound moves some in the EI community might have liked .
There is more to do but this is a BIG victory for election integrity !

" But Bishop 's test drew immediate controversy when its results were released a week ago .
The experiment focused on machines made by Diebold , Sequoia and Hart InterCivic .
A fourth company , Election Systems & Software , did not provide information to the state in time to undergo review .
Bowen decertified that system , which Los Angeles County had planned to use in February . "
When you read a newspaper article , look for the author of the article , taking it upon himself , to make statements like , " But Bishop 's test drew immediate controversy " ... that is the author of the article saying that .

ZapKitty - I did n't hear the comment by Mike Malloy .
I think he usually means well and fights the good fight but he is one of those people who feel he has to voice an opinion about everything , even when he is not fully informed ( and he usually is well - informed ) .
The disabled voter gambit used by the EVM industry and their supporters is an effective one because opposing the disabled ( even when it is a small , corrupted segment of disabled voters acting surreptitiously on behalf of their EVM paymasters ) seems anathema to a progressive who does not realize he / she is being manipulated .

Weighing in a little late , but weighing in none the less .
As many have said this is truly a great day for Democracy .
Many of us have worked dilligently and paid a hefty price to arrive here .
Some of us a much greater price , ( yes Steve Heller it is me and you ) .
Debra Bowen has delivered and as Brad states this is a great start .
Those that are already railing that she has not gone far enough are simply being naive about the , " struggle " , " war " , " fight " or however you choose to refer to the work to bring about change and return as much integrity and transperancy to our electoral process .
Most everyone wants the promise of Free Uncompromised Elections .
They require a tremendous amount of work and honesty .
The advent of the " techno - age " systems makes this achievement much more difficult .
We did not arrive at the flawed process in which we now find ourselves overnight .
It came in degrees over time .
It will not be corrected overnight .
Debra Bowen has made a dramatic and very effective step on the road to correcting this process .
Do not deride her for , " not going far enough " .
That mentality and expectations were contributing factors in getting us here in the first place .
Yes the intentions may have been admirable but the methods and claims , some years back , were either too sweeping , outlandish , unachievible , or simply not sufficiently supported to be able to stave off the introduction and prolifferation of this flawed technology .
Remember , we are dealing with entities whose sole purpose is selling a product to make staggering amounts of money and purchasers with many motives .
Some of those motives were definately nefarious , those were the ones who saw the exploitability , others , ( and this was a far greater majority than we may choose to accept ) were swayed by the vendors simply with various forms of payola .
Some for as little as a two - three day hotel stay and meals while viewing the sytems to others who now have that new Escalade and Condo in Maui .
Once they had convinced their Counties to invest then there was no turning back .
It was business as usual , Cover Your Ass and never ever cop to the fact that you were wrong .
We still have a way to go but this is a tremendous acheivement .
Congatulations all and Thank you Debra Bowen .

Reading through that crap probably pissed you off as much as it did me .
( thanks Big Dan )
( Any volunteers to straighten that mess of crap out ? )
However ,
When I actually picked up a copy of the actual Sacramento Bee newspaper dated August 4 , 2007 my jaw about dropped .
The Sacramento Bee
Date Saturday , August 4 , 2007
Headline : Voting decision stalled
Sub headline : Fate of state 's electronic systems still uncertain .
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
We start with the misleading headline .
***" Voting decision stalled " ***
( The decision is n't stalled .
Kevin Yamamura uses DATE and TIME in a vague way to make the headline technically correct but hell of misleading . )
He labels " voting rights advocates " as " electronic voting critics " ( is n't that cute ?
New buzzwords )
Kevin suggests that electronic voting machines " COULD BE VULNERABLE . "
( When the UC team just told us that the electronic voting machines reviewed " ARE VULNERABLE . "
And let 's not forget not ALL machines were reviewed )
Kevin then goes on to use TIME and DATE to make it seem like Debra Bowen is still remaining silent .
As of Saturday ...
I guess technically if the bastard want 's to play minutes and seconds games he 's right , but by the time I got the paper he was wrong .
Wrong in a very misleading way !
The next authority ( sic ) he introduces is the wacko Steve Weir , giving Weir kudos on questioning Bowen 's decision making process and suggesting Bowen might have waited until Monday .
( Whatever Steve Weir May be , It is not an authority , and I give a crap what Steve does for a living , the only explanation is he supports a corrupt untraceable and un-validate - able election with no footprints .
And I guess he does have the right to try to keep this SPIN / BLACKOUT / Mass deception crap going until someone else get 's busted ..)
Keven quotes Steve Weir saying , " What happens at midnight ?
Do all the voting machines turn into pumpkins ? "
" This is n't the way to do business .
This thing is too rushed . "
And goes on to say he ain't sure if counties could handle the switch to paper ballots of Bowen acted to certify the machines .
( Okay several problems here ...
Again Kevin is presenting a time / date distortion of the truth for the shock value .
Since this is Saturday now if not Sunday now this is total non-sense not worthy of the paper it 's printed in , I 'd rather read a mis-printed FRYS AD for god sake !
But to try to keep some sanity here , I will suprise you all and agree with Steve that this thing is too rushed timing sure seems to be everything for corruption to manipulate elections does n't it Steve ...
On the other hand Steve , I like to think of the machines as being bar - b - que'd , actually I 'd like to see them all bar - b - que'd , I 'd chip in to pay for some beer to watch them all be bar - b - que'd .
On the other hand Steve , they have to print ( using your numbers ) 20 million Sample Ballots anyway .
Whoops there goes your weak printing time argument . )
Kev gives some statistics : ( OMFG ! )
The tested systems ( cough cough choke cough ) are used by 43 of 58 counties in California and by 9 million out of 15.7 million registered voters ( UC Berkeley numbers )
( Dear Kevin tested ?
Do you mean to say how sorry / lame / poor excuse for allowing corruption to fester , the tests are . )
Kev then says a decision to decertify would be a victory for electronic voting critics ( Um Kevie get this in your head , repeat after me " voting rights advocates " you slap every patriot in the face when you say CRITIC ! ) who unsuccessfully lobbied two of Bowen 's predecessors ( Oh you mean that last batch of CORRUPTION INFESTATION Republican : Bruce McPherson .
the incumbent who replaced Kevin Shelley , who resigned in scandal .
Are you saying we lobbied to try to GET YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE BACK !?
I 'd agree we TRIED . ) to stop the machines use in California .
Kev talks about millions of dollars spent .
( Gee kev , what about the trillions in Iraq because of these machines ?
And the deaths ,
And the shredding of the US Constitution and the ... oh never mind you frigging ass bite . )
Kev uses interesting language like " to change a vote tally " in conjunction with computer virus .
( It 's not the vote tally Kev , it 's the WHOLE THING !
That 's PLURAL Kev not SINGLE . )
Kev say 's hackers can install virus's .
( Kev YOU could install a virus , it 's not hard to do , you put your disk in .
A monkey can do it , a child could do it , an INSIDER can do it !
A Friend of Bin Laden could do it , more on that later ... )
Kev give the Electronic Voting Machine Manufactures and the Registrars of Voters a couple of paragraphs to bitch and whine ( now that they have been caught with their pants down by the UC red team ! ) about the tests are unrealistic because of the Procedures and Policies ( My ad lib paraphrase he terms it " Layers of Security . "
What a joke !
I bet you could n't even solder fuse on a power cord Kevin !
Let alone realize that this is n't a joke it is our frigging NATIONAL SECURITY we are talking about !
You should be a LOT more serious about this Kev .
Your and my , and everyone else 's very lives might just depend on it ! )
Kev goes on .. about how Red Team had complete access and that 's unrealistic .
( No it 's not keviee Insiders have complete access ! )
Kev manages to leave the reader overwhelmed with what voting rights advocates want .
Paper ballots vs. Op Scans vs. Open Source software .
( Kev do you know any disabled folks ?
Have you seen how they interface with computers ?
This need not be confusing , HAVA is being abused to allow corrupt machines into the system , when really the whole process needs to be on PAPER BALLOTS HAND COUNTED WITH PUBLIC OVERSIGHT , if your disabled , you can PRINT a PAPER BALLOT to be counted , the technology is there to do it .
The rest of us lucky to be healty folks with eyes and hands can mark the paper ballots . )
Next paragraph he talks about the 2000 election , that electronic voting machines became popular to comply with HAVA ( kev does not say HAVA ) and the accessibility of voting booths .
( Kev now you 've gone too far , the accessibility report was released before Saturday August 4 , 2007 .
It shows that they STILL DO NOT COMPLY ! )
Kev then talks about disabled voters love affair with DRE 's because they provide independence by audio playback of selections .
( Kev , actually
It 's my belief that some electronics could be used to help the disabled PRINT A PAPER BALLOT TO BE HAND COUNTED WITH PUBLIC OVERSIGHT , the problem is when you have these un-validate - able electronic machines actually doing the COUNTING !!!
Humans can not physically see electricity as it travels at 3e8 ( lightspeed ) , they can see paper and can have public oversight on PAPER they can SEE physically . )
The last paragraph says how the time frame was made short bla bla bla ..
( I agree Kev the time is short ! ) Kev Kevin Kevie whatever ..
I have no respect for you , if you call yourself a journalist .
You probably even have a degree .
Pure Utter crap .
It should be revoked along with your coveted press card .
If anyone out there wants to call kevin yamamura 916.326.5548 or kyamamura@sacbee.com

Big Brother is a republican blue dog democrat .
In the bill passed Saturday , the republicans in the House all ( except Johnson ( IL ) and Jones ( NC ) ) voted to give Bush what he demanded : warrantless wiretaps of americans .
These House democrats entered the preznit blush hall of shame :
Altmire , Barrow , Bean , Boren , Boswell , Boyd ( FL ) , Carney , Chandler , Cooper , Costa , Cramer , Cuellar , Davis ( AL ) , Davis ( Lincoln ) , Donnelly , Edwards , Ellsworth , Etheridge , Gordon , Herseth Sandlin , Higgins , Hill , Lampson , Lipinski , Marshall , Matheson , McIntyre , Melancon , Mitchell , Peterson ( MN ) , Pomeroy , Rodriguez , Ross , Salazar , Shuler , Snyder , Space , Tanner , Taylor , Walz ( MN ) , Wilson ( OH ) ( House Vote ) .
It is a day of infamy , and it portends the final days of what was once american democracy .
It is not the system that counts , it is the people in the system .
And those democrats in the House listed above , and all republicans save two , are pure and simple traitors to the 4th Amendment .

SacBee Voting decision creates turmoil
Counties fear limits on electronic machines will cause chaos .
By Kevin Yamamura - Bee Capitol Bureau
Last Updated 12:31 am PDT Sunday , August 5 , 2007
Story appeared in MAIN NEWS section , Page A1 ~ ~ snip ~ ~
County officials elsewhere may fight Bowen 's actions , and Bowen said Saturday she would not be surprised if her office faces legal action from counties or manufacturers .
She said she consulted with legal counsel at length Friday and believes she can withstand a challenge .
Of course she can stand up to legal challenges .
We were sold a defective bill of goods .
The ( Republican owned ) Election Systems have had years to secure these machines .
Diebold has lost in court before .....
BRING IT ON !!
We can bring in a chimp to hack their software and they will be laughed out of business .
There will be a national wave of de-certifications !
I hope they DO try to sue !
LOL !
Yamamura brought up " fear " again .
This time its in the subtitle " Counties fear ... chaos " .... who made this asshat spokesman for all CA counties ?
I think he needs to process his own fears with a dose of acceptance and democracy .
Poor baby cant hack anymore elections ... boo -hoo .

Wrong !
In your ( perfectly normal ) attempt to warn that the battles are far from over you have made an incorrect statement .
It is a stinging defeat for Diebold ... and the other e-voting corporations .
Not only did yet another set of studies show up the utter BS that underlies e-voting , but then the " largest voting market in the US " took direct action against Diebold and other e-voting corporations based on those studies ... and are putting strict measures in place to try and guard against the very real dangers that the corporations can no longer pretend are n't there .
And this is indeed a victory for the people of CA ... and the rest of the world .
It 's just not the last victory that must be won .
But it is indeed a defeat for Diebold and the other e-voting corporations ... and a victory for the people .
Of course the corporate spinmeisters will be desperately attempting to portray this as " no big deal " ... but then lying is what they do , right ?

" That is why I ALWAYS use the machines with verifiable paper trail .
Then you have been misled , like so many others ...
" This way my vote is NOT manipulated ! " Wrong .
Once it was thought that " paper trails " were the answer ... but after the first rush to get such trails that idea turned out to be wrong .
Because of the computer 's corruptibility and human foibles it's now known that " paper trails " are n't even worth the paper they 're printed on .
With DRE e-voting ( what people refer to as touchscreens ) the computer can tell you one thing , print out something to match what it told you and then the computer will actually cast and count your vote for ... ... ( wait for it ) for whatever result the person who last accessed the machine wanted from you .
This was recently proven yet again :
https://bradblog.com/?p=4902
The answer ?
The real answer has turned out to be paper ballots that are actually counted .
Opscans use paper ballots and ( hopefully ) count each one .
Opscans are also hackable .
But at least when the opscan machine screws up there are actual paper ballots left behind to count .

The initial reactions I hear from the Daily Voting News seem to indicate actual shock from the pro-corporate - control election officials .
They should n't have been surprised , really ... but it seems that they really have grown to believe that it is the corporations who are in charge of elections in California .

I have been attempting to send the followiong letter to our Sec of State but it comes back as undeliverable :
Thank you for your efforts to restore democracy to CA .
I understand that to comply with HAVA you have made one e-machine available in each voting place .
Let us say that through out the state 100 impaired voters request to use those machines .
May I suggest that the machines and those 100 votes be held sepirate and not even be counted until after all other varifiable votes are counted and results published .
Indeed you could even concede that those 100 votes went to the GOP .
My fear , and I trust yours , is that , if counted , those 100 impaired voters might somehow deliver 11,000,000 votes to the neo-cons .
That 's what the cons and their machines are all about .
I am suggesting that an accurate count be maintained of those impaired voters that request to use the machines be maintained and that those votes not be comingled with other votes .
Indeed they should not even be counted until after all other results are published .
We have the worst of criminals in power because of riggable machines .
We need to know clearly , how many in the state requested to vote on the machines and those votes need to be held apart from all others .

THE_ZAPKITTY # 108 : It may not about right or left , but about right or wrong .
True enough but since none on the right ever strays from the pack they are either all right or all wrong .
The RNC does not take any stand on voting issues that could better facilitate fraud in elections .
So they without fail always take the anti-democracy position .
They are either all right or all wrong on other issues as well due to their follow the leader mentality .
Let ’s see how they come out on economic issues :
If you can believe what they tell you then : 1 . Anybody who gets any part of any tax cut benefits from that tax cut .
2 . All tax cuts are good tax cuts since they pay for themselves .
3 . Tax cuts pay for themselves because they create a robust economy .
4 . That robust economy will surely result in an increase in tax revenue for the government .
If you believe all of the above you can believe all the nonsense you are fed by the right wing “ pundits ” through the “ liberal press ” .
If you ca n’t believe the above you ca n’t believe anything you hear from the “ liberal press ” via the right wing “ pundits ” who make up that “ liberal press ” .
In order to believe the above four claims you have to believe that government revenues will be higher if the tax rates are reduced to zero percent than they will be at any level of taxation higher than zero percent .
If you ca n’t believe that then you ca n’t believe the complete nonsense the believers in supply side economics are feeding you through the mouths of all of those on the right .
If 0 % of everything is still nothing , then those on the right are flat out wrong as usual !
If 0 % of everything is still nothing , then the senseless claims coming from all of those on the right via the “ liberal press ” can only be believed by those who ca n’t think very well !

Why should the disabled have their votes held back from being counted ?
They should n't ... and under Bowens plan they wo n't .
Bowen has ordered that all the votes that are cast on the DRE machines are to have their voter printouts 100 % counted by hand - essentially turning the DRE 's into makeshift printers for ersatz paper ballots ... ... not as good or as secure as real paper ballots but far better than the DRE 's standard " vanishing electronic ballots " .

News scoop - Remember the two election workers who were convicted in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , Kathleen Dreamer and Jacquelyn Maiden ?
They were prosecuted by " special prosecutor " & Erie County Prosecutor Kevin Baxter who was selected by neighboring Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason .
The women were convicted and sentenced to 18 months but were also granted an appellate bond .
The Appellate Court remanded it back to the trial court and Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Shirley Strickland Saffold was given the assignment to hear the Motion for new trial .
Well , this morning Judge Saffold granted that motion .
A courtroom observer relayed that the judge made statements to the effect that there was a public appearance of impropriety and that the women had a right to a fair trial and there was an appearance of an incestuous relationship between Bill Mason and Judge Peter Corrigan .
Stay tuned for Bill Mason to be put on the witness stand .
I wonder if Michael Vu and Bob Bennett will receive supoenas as well .

New documents suggest broader White House involvement in replacing New Mexico prosecutor Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This New documents turned over to Congressional investigators Wednesday show that a White House official echoed a message from the office of Senator Pete Domenici to the Justice Department seeking the installation of a new ' team ' in New Mexico 's US Attorneys office .
" [ Steve Bell , Chief of Staff to Senator Pete Domenici ] mentioned he had chatted with you today about his request for a non-partisan team that specializes in corruption to be sent down to New Mexico , " wrote Andrea Becker Looney , then the Special Assistant to the President in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs , in a Dec. 21 , 2006 e-mail to William Moschella , a top Justice Department official .
Domenici is currently under investigation by a Senate ethics watchdog for appearing to interfere with a public corruption investigation that David Iglesias , former US Attorney to New Mexico , was engaged in last Fall .
Rep. Heather Wilson ( R - NM ) also contacted Iglesias , but no ethics charges have been brought against her in the House .
Iglesias was asked to step down on Dec. 7 , and formally resigned in 2007 .
Earlier information published by the House Judiciary Committee suggested that the White House had heard calls for Iglesias ' firing .
Justice Department employee Matthew Friedrich told House investigators that Mickey Barnett and Pat Rogers , a pair of prominent Republican New Mexico attorneys had sought help from White House adviser Karl Rove to have Iglesias fired .
The two were reportedly frustrated with his unwillingness to pursue some voter registration - related prosecutions .
In his May appearance before the House Judiciary Committee , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales also confirmed that Rove had expressed concern about Iglesias ' failure to prosecute ' voter fraud ' cases last fall .
Iglesias ' place on the list of US Attorneys to be fired came late in the process by which the prosecutors were selected .
Gonzales confirmed in the hearing that , " His name was brought forward to me , recommended along with others , " but not until November of last year .
The White House ultimately has never ruled out its involvement in the firing of Iglesias , even at the level of direct connections between the President and Senator Domenici .
" [ W ] henever a senator has the President 's ear ... if they have a chance to talk about other issues , they will .
And so I 'm not going to rule it out , but I just can't say that Senator Domenici and the President ever had a one - on - one conversation about it .
I just can't say that Senator Domenici and the President ever had a one - on - one conversation about it , " spokesperson Dana Perino said in an April press conference .
The Dec. 21 e-mail is not the only instance in which Domenici appears in the new documents .
On March 4 , Justice Department spokesperson Brian Roehrkasse insists in draft talking points sent to a fellow spokesperson that Domenici had only expressed general concerns about Iglesias ' performance .
" At no time in the calls did the Senator mention any specific public corruption case , " Roehrkasse wrote to Tasia Scolinos .
In fact , Domenici and Wilson had both raised a particular public corruption case involving New Mexico Democrats with Iglesias .
In an earlier Feb. 28 e-mail , outgoing Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty also accused Iglesias of violating Justice Department rules .
" Iglesias is quoted in an Albuquerque Tribune story today as saying that he expects indictments in the corruption case 'very soon , 'an obvious violation of Department policy in an ongoing investigation , " McNulty wrote to White House employee William Kelley .
A University of Leicester psychologist has produced the first ever ' world map of happiness . '
Adrian
White , an analytic social psychologist at the University 's School of Psychology , analysed data published by UNESCO , the CIA , the New Economics Foundation , the WHO , the Veenhoven Database , the Latinbarometer , the Afrobarometer , and the UNHDR , to create a global projection of subjective well - being : the first world map of happiness .
The projection , which is to be published in a psychology journal this September , will be presented at a conference later in the year .
Participants in the various studies were asked questions related to happiness and satisfaction with life .
The meta - analysis is based on the findings of over 100 different studies around the world , which questioned 80,000 people worldwide .
For this study data has also been analysed in relation to health , wealth and access to education .
Whilst collecting data on subjective well - being is not an exact science , the measures used are very reliable in predicting health and welfare outcomes .
It can be argued that whilst these measures are not perfect they are the best we have so far , and these are the measures that politicians are talking of using to measure the relative performance of each country .
The researchers have argued that regular testing as a collaboration between academics in different countries would enable us to track changes in happiness , and what events may cause that .
For example what effect would a war , or famine , or national success have on a country 's members ' happiness . .
Adrian
White said : " The concept of happiness , or satisfaction with life , is currently a major area of research in economics and psychology , most closely associated with new developments in positive psychology .
It has also become a feature in the current political discourse in the UK .
" There is increasing political interest in using measures of happiness as a national indicator in conjunction with measures of wealth .
A recent BBC survey found that 81 % of the population think the Government should focus on making us happier rather than wealthier .
advertisement
" It is worth remembering that the UK is doing relatively well in this area , coming 41st out of 178 nations .
" Further analysis showed that a nation 's level of happiness was most closely associated with health levels ( correlation of .62 ) , followed by wealth ( .52 ) , and then provision of education ( .51 ) .
" The three predictor variables of health , wealth and education were also very closely associated with each other , illustrating the interdependence of these factors .
" There is a belief that capitalism leads to unhappy people .
However , when people are asked if they are happy with their lives , people in countries with good healthcare , a higher GDP per captia , and access to education were much more likely to report being happy .
" We were surprised to see countries in Asia scoring so low , with China 82nd , Japan 90th and India 125th .
These are countries that are thought as having a strong sense of collective identity which other researchers have associated with well - being .
advertisement
" It is also notable that many of the largest countries in terms of population do quite badly .
With China 82nd , India 125th and Russia 167th it is interesting to note that larger populations are not associated with happy countries . "
" The frustrations of modern life , and the anxieties of the age , seem to be much less significant compared to the health , financial and educational needs in other parts of the World .
The current concern with happiness levels in the UK may well be a case of the ' worried well ' . "
The 20 happiest nations in the World are :
1. Denmark
2. Switzerland
3. Austria
4. Iceland
5 . The Bahamas
6. Finland
7. Sweden
8. Bhutan
9. Brunei

If you had a minute to speak with someone over a live video connection , could you decide whether you would date them ?
That ’s the question for WooMe , a startup aiming to bring the world of speed dating online .
It launches a testing version today , but will open for all in a couple of months .
Unlike most other dating sites , users do n’t have to answer dozens of questions or fill out an application form .
Nor will they be forced to go through the grueling process of reading other user ’s rambling essays .
Instead , speed dating sessions with up to 16 participants , eight of each sex , will be the way WooMe users gauge their interest .
The sessions are intended to run in live audio - video , although only audio can be selected ; participants never type to one another , although they can classify them with tags for future reference .
The founders say hearing a prospective date ’s voice is far more revealing than often realized .
No other dating startup we know of has based their company on speed dating .
WooMe ’s gamble is based partly on the lack of speed dating online , partly on the failure of other models of online dating , despite the sizable rewards awaiting successful companies .
( The company says the market could reach $ 10 billion , but that ’s clearly a stretch ) .
The years since the dotcom bust have seen dozens of dating startups appear and disappear ; Match.com , once considered a thriving dating community , lacks hipness .
Some sites like eHarmony , typically catering to older individuals , are somewhat successful .
But no company has yet claimed the holy grail : Online dating that everyone uses .
On the other hand , this technology is n’t particularly defensible .
There ’s nothing stopping a more popular brand ( Match.com ) from duplicating it ; except , that is , economics .
WooMe is dirt cheap .
After a conversation , a guy ( more often ) can say that he likes a girl .
If the girl says she likes him too , the guy can pay $ 1 to get the girl ’s contact details .
There ’s no way Match.com will want to match this low price .
The site is not monetizing through ads , another refreshing difference from some of the more recent dating sites .
Like another recent startup , iminlikewithyou , WooMe aims to satisfy the short attention span of the younger generation .
The focus is on fun , fast interactions .
Unlike iminlikewithyou , WooMe thinks its service can result in real dates for its members , because it will give a much better view of who the other person really is , despite the speed of sessions .
As a demo of his service , WooMe CEO Stephen Stokols showed me how users could start speed - dating sessions based on themes of their own devising ; his example was called “ The Faces of TechCrunch . ”
WooMe is present at the TechCrunch40 conference today , undergoing their alpha launch for an initial user base of 1000 .
Facebook users can invite each other to Woome sessions .
One problem haunting dating sites , and which may also challenge this one :
Not enough desirable women , and a glut of socially challenged men .
The WooMe team believes that their service will provide just enough depth of interaction to help desirable women ( and , to be fair , men ) quickly weed out the people they do n’t want .
The hosts of sessions will also be able to be selective as to who enters .
The platform offers possibilities beyond dating , as well .
Sokols mentioned interviews for jobs or potential roommates as good uses for WooMe .
WooMe has taken on $ 1.9 million in funding from investors including Joost founder Niklas Zennström , through his Atomico investment fund .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The singer in the Police jumps like a “ petulant pansy , ” the drummer is making a “ complete hash , ” and who knows what the guitarist is doing ?
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Notes from a bitter critic ?
Actually , it ’s a disarmingly frank concert review from the aforementioned drummer of the newly reunited rock trio .
A philosophical Stewart Copeland unleashed his vitriol in a posting on his Web site on Thursday , a day after the band played its second show in Vancouver , the Canadian city where it began its first world tour in more than 20 years on Monday .
“ This is unbelievably lame , ” Copeland wrote of Wednesday ’s show at the GM Place arena .
“ We are the mighty Police and we are totally at sea . ”
Most of the 20,000 fans at the venue might not have noticed a series of small flubs , but Copeland , singer / bassist Sting , and guitarist were painfully aware of them .
Copeland started the show off on the wrong foot , literally .
He tripped as he took to the stage , and then banged his gong at the wrong time so that “ the big pompous opening to the show is a damp squib . ”
He did not hear Summers ’ opening riff to “ Message In a Bottle , ” and Sting in turn misheard Copeland ’s drum intro -- “ so we are half a bar out of sync with each other .
Andy is in Idaho . ”
They quickly recovered , but then Sting got his footwork wrong as he leapt into the air to signal the end to a shambolic version of their rat-race rant “ Synchronicity II . ”
“ The mighty Sting momentarily looks like a petulant pansy instead of the god of rock , ” Copeland reported .
“ And so it goes , for song after song , ” he wrote , with tunes such as “ Every Little Thing She Does is Magic ” and “ Do n’t Stand So Close To Me ” reduced to ruin .
“ It usually takes about four or five shows in a tour before you get to the disaster gig .
But we ’re The Police so we are a little ahead of schedule , ” he said .
Fortunately , no fists flew backstage as they did back in the Police ’s heyday .
The threesome fell into each other ’s arms laughing hysterically , Copeland said .
“ Screw it , it ’s only music .
What are you gonna do ?
But maybe it ’s time to get out of Vancouver . ”
The band ’s next show is set for Saturday in Edmonton .

The Senate Intelligence Committee has recently agreed to give the Bush administration what it wants : full retroactive immunity for the telecom companies against civil suits for helping the government eavesdrop without warrant on the phone and e-mail conversations of customers .
According to the Washington Post , the draft Senate bill “ will include full immunity for those companies that can demonstrate to a court that they acted pursuant to a legal directive in helping the government with surveillance in the United States .
…
Such a demonstration , which the bill says could be made in secret , would wipe out a series of pending lawsuits alleging violations of privacy rights by telecommunications companies that provided telephone records , summaries of e-mail traffic and other information to the government after Sept. 11 , 2001 , without receiving court warrants ” ( emphasis added ) .
The devil , however , is in the details , and , unfortunately , the Post has not disclosed the nature of such “ other information . ”
At least 40 of the lawsuits to which the Post is referring are against AT&T for its alleged role in helping the National Security Agency parse through millions of phone and e-mail messages passing through rooms hidden deep inside major AT&T hubs in the United States .
This NSA / AT&T program was exposed in 2005 when Mark Klein , an AT&T employee at the San Francisco hub , blew the whistle .
Klein produced photographs and other documents to show that AT&T kept a secret room requiring NSA clearance .
Eventually , other whistle - blowers came forth to report similar secret rooms at other AT&T hubs in other U.S. cities , including St. Louis , Seattle , Atlanta and Los Angeles .
On behalf of the customers of AT&T , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) filed a class - action suit against the company for its collaboration with the NSA in what the EFF considers illegal “ dragnet surveillance . ”
The EFF maintains that AT&T installed a fiber - optic splitter at its San Francisco office that copies all e-mails and other Internet traffic and provides these copies to the NSA , including both domestic and international Internet activities of AT&T WorldNet customers .
This clearly involves more than a telecom company ’s cooperation in turning over standard telephone records and summaries of e-mail traffic to the government .
Rather , its primary purpose is to look for suspicious message content — presumably that which suggests a terrorist plot .
This requires the use of natural language - parsing technology , a form of artificial intelligence that in part looks for predefined words and word relations .
According to the EFF , the secret rooms created under the supervision of the NSA contain “ powerful computer equipment connected to separate networks .
This equipment is designed to analyze communications at high speed , and can be programmed to review and select out the contents and traffic patterns of communications according to user - defined rules ” ( emphasis added ) .
In the absence of judicial oversight , there is no way of knowing what the system ’s predefined definitions are .
Therefore , it is not possible to discern who else the government may be targeting with neither warrant nor probable cause — perhaps lawbreakers such as drug traffickers , Internet predators and money launderers ; but targets might just as well include investigative journalists , political opponents and other persons deemed hostile to the Bush administration .
It is also difficult or impossible to tell , without judicial oversight , how the Bush administration might use this information .
For example , it could expand an “ enemies list ” or brand dissidents as “ unlawful enemy combatants ” according to the vague and potentially dangerous definition provided in the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in 2006 .
It ’s clear why a grant of legal immunity to the telecoms to secretly conduct surveillance for the government is a high priority for the Bush administration .
With the judicial branch out of the loop , the administration will have a blank check to pursue “ Total Information Awareness , ” the name earlier given to an Orwellian mass surveillance project that was defunded by Congress in 2003 amid a public outcry .
The purported purpose of that project was to “ imagine , develop , apply , integrate , demonstrate and transition information technologies , components and prototype , closed - loop , information systems that will counter asymmetric threats by achieving total information awareness . ”
Now the legal seeds may finally be sown for a major component of such an integrated system .
There would be immunized cooperation of the telecoms , copies of all electronic communications of virtually all Americans in a federal computer network , and the potential for straining out the content of messages that “ look suspicious , ” according to secret predefined definitions , for secret purposes carried on without judicial oversight .
And all this , of course , propagated on the vague pretext that surveillance is “ directed at [ persons ] reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States ” ( Protect America Act of 2007 ) .
Add to this that the parsing technology being used to secretly gather information is notoriously unreliable and can turn up false positives linking innocent Americans with crimes , terrorism and other “ forbidden ” activities .
With the disbanding of Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure without court warrants or probable cause , no Americans , not even those who are apolitical and believe they have nothing to hide , are safe .
Under this judicially unregulated Orwellian system of total information awareness , all Americans who use the Internet and / or the telephone ( which means virtually all Americans ) are suspects in a massive , nationwide ( and global ) government dragnet .
The Washington Post has reported that granting retroactive immunity to the telecoms will have the effect of “ wiping out ” pending lawsuits against AT&T .
This , however , is an oversimplification because not even Congress has the power to immunize anyone against being held accountable for the violation of another ’s constitutional rights .
According to Lee Tien , attorney for the EFF , “ When you ’ve got pending lawsuits and suddenly pull the rug out from under them … that ’s a major attack on the role of the judiciary . ”
If the bill becomes law , Tien said , plaintiffs ’ attorneys will argue that the grant of retroactive immunity violates the separation of powers and involves an attempt to legitimize the violation of the plaintiffs ’
Fourth Amendment right to privacy .
In that case , Congress will have acted to provide a major impediment to the survival of a free America in a monumental battle to be waged in the courtroom — and quite possibly the Supreme Court .
Congress should therefore act responsibly in the first place by unequivocally refusing to grant retroactive immunity to the telecoms .
For it to do otherwise is a breach of trust with the American people and a precedent fraught with peril .

Generally speaking , $ 300 does n’t go very far in the world of custom software .
If you ’re lucky , it might be enough to fix a typo in a production application .
These days , with the advent of IT Project Portals ( as discussed before ) that provide everyone access to certain developers from certain countries , $ 300 can go a long way .
Not long enough to build working software , of course , but surely long enough to generate lots and lots of worthless code .
At least , that was the experience with Christopher ’s client .
Christopher ’s client is a large ( as in , one of the “ Big 5 ” ) advertising firms that decided to initially place their RFP for a survey application on an IT Project Portal .
A few months and $ 300 later , they ended up with about 500 PHP - files ( 31 of which are class files without any members ) and a database schema that stores all values in VARCHARs .
And it all “ almost worked . ”
Fortunately , they had Christopher to help “ debug ” it .
Several months and certainly a whole lot more than $ 300 later , Christopher was able to get it “ mostly working . ”
Of all the things he “ refactored out , ” the following method of redisplaying form selections was among Christopher ’s favorite …

Growing and burning many biofuel crops may actually raise , rather than lower , greenhouse gas emissions .
That ’s the conclusion of a new study led by Nobel prize - winning chemist Paul Crutzen , best known for his work on the ozone layer .
He and his colleagues have calculated that growing some of the most commonly used biofuel crops releases around twice the amount of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide ( N 2 O , also known as ‘ laughing gas ’ ) than previously thought – wiping out any benefits from not using fossil fuels and , worse , probably contributing to global warming .
‘ The significance of it is that the supposed benefits of biofuels are even more disputable than had been thought hitherto , ’ Keith Smith , a co-author on the paper and atmospheric scientist from the University of Edinburgh , told Chemistry World magazine .
‘ What we are saying is that [ growing many biofuels ] is probably of no benefit and in fact is actually making the climate issue worse . ’
The work is currently subject to open review in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , and Crutzen himself has declined to comment until that process is completed .
But the paper suggests that microbes convert much more of the nitrogen in fertilizer to nitrous oxide than previously thought – 3 to 5 per cent , which is twice the widely accepted figure of 2 per cent used by the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to calculate the impact of fertilizers on climate change .
For rapeseed biodiesel , which accounts for about 80 per cent of the biofuel production in Europe , the relative warming due to nitrous oxide emissions is estimated at 1 to 1.7 times larger than the relative cooling effect due to saved fossil CO 2 emissions .
For corn bioethanol , dominant in the US , the figure is 0.9 to 1.5 .
Only cane sugar bioethanol – with a relative warming of 0.5 to 0.9 – looks like a better alternative to conventional fuels .
In the wake of the findings comes a recent report prepared by the OECD for a recent Round Table on Sustainable Development , which questioned the benefits of first generation biofuels and concluded that governments should scrap mandatory targets .
Richard Doornbosch , the report ’s author , says both the report and Crutzen ’s work highlights the importance of establishing correct full life - cycle assessments for biofuels .
‘ Without them , government policies can't distinguish between one biofuel and another – risking making problems worse , ’ he said .

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - A Canadian hitchhiker , who stole an elderly man ’s car after he offered her a ride , died a few minutes later when she lost control of the vehicle and crashed into trees , police said .
The crash happened near the town of Hawkesbury -- about 100 km ( 60 miles ) northeast of Ottawa -- after the man stopped to pick up 20 - year - old Mandy Deschambeault .
“ The male driver proceeded to step out of his vehicle momentarily at which point the female jumped in the driver seat , stealing the male person ’s car , ” local police said in a statement Monday .
“ She proceeded to lose control of the ... car , crossing the other lane hitting trees .
The female was ejected from the vehicle and found to be without vital signs . ”
Deschambeault was pronounced dead in hospital .
NBC 's recent withdraw from the iTunes store leaves the millions of users of Apple iPods without a legitimate way to purchase and watch NBC 's content .
Could this be the push that brings easy - to - use ' piracy ' to the masses ?
This article discusses the issues , and then provides step - by - step instructions to setup a computer to automatically download any of hundreds of TV shows as soon as they are broadcast and put online .
With Apple 's recent lovers 's spat with NBC making the headlines , it seems like a good opportunity to examine the state of the online TV downloads , be they paid or ' pirated ' .
The end result of the dispute between the companies is that NBC 's shows , which currently count for approximately one third of iTunes ' TV show sales will no longer be available for sale at Apple 's iTunes store .
Customers wishing to purchase NBC 's shows will now need to go through Amazon 's Unbox service .
While Unbox supports users of Windows and TiVo , Mac users , as well as those millions of iPod users are left out in the cold .
Linux geeks , and those customers who have purchased divx / avi capable portable music players are also excluded , but this small subset of the market were equally ignored by Apple .
The Apple / NBC dispute , of course , only affects US based consumers .
Foreigners , due to the lengthy delay between a show airing in the US in markets abroad , have already been driven to illegal file sharing .
In Australia , where the broadcast of US shows is typically delayed between 22 - 30 months , many viewers have given up on waiting for their favorite shows to appear on the tube , and have instead turned to BitTorrent .
According to a report published in 2006 , " Australians are responsible for 15.6 percent of all online TV piracy , bested only by Britain , which accounts for 38.4 percent .
The US lags behind in third position at 7.3 percent . "
The legitimate and legal online media stores cannot compete with file sharing on price .
Furthermore , as iTunes , Amazon , Walmart and the other stores all wrap their media in restrictive Digitial Rights Management ( DRM ) , they cannot compete on freedom , flexibility and the ability to transfer purchased media to other devices .
The only areas where they have the upper hand are in quality , and ease of use .
Warner Brothers ' China division , in a rare act of intelligence on the part of a major media company , demonstrated significant savvy last year when they began selling cheap , legitimate , high quality DVDs of movies within days of the theatrical release .
By pricing the discs at around 12 yuan ( approximately US $ 1.50 ) , Warner is hoping to make cost a non-issue , thus allowing them to compete in one area where they hold the upper hand : Quality .
Instead of taking a chance with on a low quality , shaky - camcorder copy of a film , Chinese consumers can get a high quality copy of the movie at a reasonable price , all while enjoying the warm fuzzy feeling that you can get knowing that you 've helped to pay for some small portion of a a Hollywood star 's private jet .
Apple 's iPod makes up more than 70 percent of the overall mobile player market .
With those customers now completely cut - off from NBC 's offerings , the ease - of - use advantage of legitimate purchase has been lost .
While camcorder copies of films still make up a decent portion of movies on file sharing networks , the widespread availability of digital television and TV tuners in PCs means that it is trivially easy to find high - quality copies of TV shows on BitTorrent sites such as The Pirate Bay .
It 's taken some time , but the ' piracy ' path has finally gotten to be more user - friendly and easy to use than iTunes and the other pay - services .
Miro , a multi- platform RSS and BitTorrent enabled media client is now very stable , polished and fast .
Using a tool such as this , and a couple minutes of configuration to subscribe to your favorite shows , it 's now possible for users worldwide to wake up to the latest episode of The Daily Show , without paying a penny , or being locked into a restrictive DRM scheme .
It 's still illegal of course , but that has n't stopped the millions of file sharers who have made BitTorrent responsible for more than 25 % of all Internet traffic .
It 's worth noting at this point , that for people in India , the Middle East and other markets ignored by the major players , Linux users ( for which iTunes , Amazon and Walmart 's media stores do not work ) , Apple customers who wish to watch shows made by NBC or another network that wo n't play ball with Apple , or Windows users who are simply not willing to submit themselves to the shackles of DRM , illegal downloads are the only way to watch TV shows on their computers and portable media players .
I 'm not advocating illegal activity , but merely stating the facts .
If a user wishes to break the law ( or they live in a country that does n't respect US copyright law ) , lets see exactly how they could go about setting up their computer to auto - download their favorite TV shows .
This information is , of course , for educational purposes only and I in no way encourage anyone to violate copyright laws .
Step 1 : Download and install the Miro media player , which is available for Linux , Mac and Windows .
Step 2 : Locate an RSS feed for a TV show you want to watch .
One fantastic source of these is the website tvRSS.net
Navigate through the list of TV shows on the tvRSS website , and find a desired show .
tvRSS.net
On the web - page for the show , right click on the link to the RSS feed of that show , and copy the URL location .
tvRSS.net
Step 3 : Open up Miro , and go to the Channels menu , and select Add Channel .
The RSS address that was copied previously should already be displayed .
If it 's not , paste it .
Miro
Miro should now automatically download the latest episode of that show , which it will continue to do every time a new episode appears online .
Miro
For ease of use , a user will probably want to rename the channel to something recognizable .
This can be done by going to the Channels menu and selecting Rename .
Miro
By following these three steps , its possible for a user to wake up to their favorite TV shows already downloaded to their computer , waiting to be watched and without the restrictions of DRM .
Users of Apple 's iPods will need to re-encode them into Apple 's proprietary Quicktime format , while those users with a Linux based Nokia N800 or one of the many low - cost .avi compatible portable media players should be able to transfer the files with little to no additional work .
As I said before , this is all totally illegal under US copyright laws , and most other western countries that have agreed to adopt similar rules .
In addition to the standard risks of file sharing , US based users should take special care not to download any leaked pre-broadcast episodes of TV shows , which occasionally show up online .
The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act passed in 2005 makes mere possession of such media a felony .
First time offenders can face up to three years in jail .
Caveat emptor .

When Karl Rove ’s resignation was brought up at a Seattle Times news meeting yesterday some of the assembled reporters cheered .
This has , of course , bunched panties in cracks on Fairview Ave .
Seattle Times Executive Editor Dave Boardman sent out a memo reprimanding the news staff : “ That sort of expression is simply not appropriate for a newsroom , ” he said .
Adding , “ As we head into a major political year , now ’s a good time to remember : Please keep your personal politics to yourself . ”
David Postman writes about the incident on his blog — which he probably got the green light to do because , as Boardman notes in his memo , there was an “ outside guest in the room . ”
Hm .
Wonder who that was .
Anyway , here ’s Postman :
It sounds like a conservative ’s parody of how a news meeting would be run .
I was n’t there , but I ’ve talked to several people who were .
It was only a couple of people who cheered and they , thankfully , are not among the people who get a say in news play .
But obviously news staff should n’t be cheering or jeering the day ’s news …
Well , gee .
Maybe the reporters cheered because they , of all people , are in the best position to recognize Rove ’s departure as a positive development for the nation — and for the ideal that all journalists everywhere honor the most : the truth .
Everything that came out of Rove ’s mouth — even spit — was a lie .
After six years of Bush / Cheney / Rove , all journalists everywhere , irrespective of political affiliation , should be glad to see Rove go .
No one has made a move at the White House over the last six and half years without Rove ’s okay ; nothing has been said by the executive branch without Rove ’s okay .
And everything that ’s come out of the White House — from the Iraq war to global warming to torture to the outings of CIA operatives to the firing of those eight US attorneys — has been false and / or misleading .
And daily reporters have had to stand there , taking dictation , relaying the lies with a straight face , running off to find Democrats to tell them what they already know :
It ’s all bullshit — every paragraph , every sentence , every word .
Any reporter that did n’t cheer Rove ’s departure should n’t be a reporter .
Back to Postman :
Jokes get made in newsrooms , of course — even what you would call gallows humor .
And Boardman wrote that he was “ all for equal - opportunity joking at both parties ’ expense . ”
So it seems that even jokes at daily papers , like quotes and op - ed columns , have to be apportioned out equally .
Why ?
Because charges of “ liberal media bias ” make you piss your pants .
It must suck to work at a place where you ’re not allowed to feel contempt for people that spit in your faces day after damn day .
Dear President Bush ,
I write to you in my capacity as secretary of the World League of Despots .
It is with great pleasure that I am finally able to extend an official invitation to you to join our ranks .
For many years , we have watched your efforts to fulfil the requirements necessary to join our number .
From the start , we were greatly impressed by your disdain for democratic principles - the way you wrested power from the democratically elected candidate in the 2000 election , and again in 2005 when you managed to swing what was clearly going to be a victory for your opponent .
Contempt for human life has always been a priority requirement for membership of the league , and I and my fellow adjudicators were well aware of your record as governor of Texas when you quadrupled the number of state executions .
But your record since seizing power has surpassed even our expectations .
The thousands of innocent people in Iraq , who have died so that you could fulfil your declared political objective of establishing " an American force presence in the Middle East " , attest to your eligibility to join our ranks .
I cannot , however , disguise the fact that we adjudicators were extremely anxious when you announced your intention to remove from office one of our most stalwart members , Mr Saddam Hussein .
However , we need not have worried .
According to a recent UN report , you have ensured that there are now even more human rights abuses in Iraq than there were under Saddam .
No less than 10 % of those in custody are being physically or psychologically abused .
Well done !
Of course , your unstinting efforts to make torture an internationally accepted aspect of human life have surpassed everything we could have ever hoped for .
I do n't think there is a single member of the league who could have imagined , six short years ago , that our activities in tormenting our fellow creatures would once again be recognised as acceptable , civilised behaviour , as it once was in the middle ages .
Despite these achievements , we had , until now , felt unable to extend our invitation to you because you had been unable to fulfil one of our basic requirements : the ability to carry out arbitrary arrests , imprisonment without trial , secret torture and executions at will .
We approved of your attempts to establish the principles of arbitrary arrest under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 , but unfortunately it was still restricted to terror suspects .
We appreciate that you were hampered by the US constitution , but the restrictions this imposed on your arbitrary powers kept you below the threshold requirements for qualification as a despot .
Now , however , all that has changed .
At the end of last month you persuaded the Senate to pass a bill regarding the treatment of detainees .
Illegally obtained evidence can now be used against suspects , even if it has been gathered abroad under torture .
Anyone you care to accuse can be thrown into prison without the right to a trial or the right to represent themselves .
Officially the legislation is restricted to " enemy combatants " , but you have skilfully adapted this definition to include anyone who has " purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the US " .
This presumably means that anyone who publicly criticises your conduct can be defined as supporting hostilities to the US .
You are now free to arrest and imprison anyone you do n't like .
You 've got it in the bag !
It is with great pleasure that we in the World League of Despots note that you have now appropriated to yourself all the powers of arbitrary arrest and torture that Saddam once enjoyed .
You are now one of us .
Congratulations !

US builds Baghdad wall to keep Sunnis and Shias apart
US soldiers are building a three - mile wall to separate one of Baghdad 's Sunni enclaves from surrounding Shia neighbourhoods , it emerged today .
The move is part of a contentious security plan that has fuelled fears of the Iraqi capital 's Balkanisation .
When the barrier is finished , the minority Sunni community of Adamiya , on the eastern side of the River Tigris , will be completely gated .
Traffic control points manned by Iraqi soldiers will provide the only access , the US military said .
" Shias are coming in and hitting Sunnis , and Sunnis are retaliating across the street , " Captain Scott McLearn , of the US 407th brigade support battalion , told the Associated Press .
The project , which began on April 10 , is being worked on almost nightly , with cranes swinging enormous concrete barriers into place .
Although Baghdad is rife with barriers around marketplaces and areas such as the heavily fortified Green Zone , this is the first in the city to be set up on sectarian lines .
The concrete wall , which will be up to 12ft high , " is one of the centrepieces of a new strategy by coalition and Iraqi forces to break the cycle of sectarian violence , " US officials said .
The officials said the barrier would allow authorities to screen people entering and leaving Adamiya " while keeping death squads and militia groups out " .
The construction - which has been nicknamed the " great wall of Adamiya " - is not the first time US military planners have attempted to isolate hostile regions .
In 2005 , attempts were made to surround the Sunni - dominated city of Samarra with raised earth barriers to prevent insurgents from entering and leaving .
A similar strategy was also deployed in both Tal Afar and Falluja .
General David Petraeus , the new US commander in Iraq , said he believed the tactics in Tal Afar , close to the Syrian border , were successful - but the area has since fallen back under insurgent control .
Critics of the scheme said it had been tried in past counter - insurgency campaigns in Vietnam and Algeria , but found wanting .
Some Sunnis living in Adamiya have welcomed the attempt to improve security but warned that it was another sign of the deep hostility between Sunnis and Shias .
Others were sceptical about the latest initiative to staunch the bloodshed in Baghdad , which reached new heights when a series of suicide bombings killed more than 200 people in a single day this week .
" I do n't think this wall will solve the city 's serious security problems , " Ahmed Abdul - Sattar , a 35 - year - old government worker , told the Associated Press .
" It will only increase the separation between our people , which has been made so much worse by the war . "
Meanwhile , the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , will today arrive in Iraq , where he is expected to meet sectarian leaders and government officials in Baghdad .
In his third trip to the country in four months , he is expected to put pressure on the Shia prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , to move faster on reconciliation with the Sunnis , who have been elbowed aside since the fall of Saddam Hussein .
" The clock is ticking , " Mr Gates told reporters yesterday .
" I know it 's difficult ... but I think that it 's very important that they bend every effort to getting this legislation done as quickly as possible . "
In an ominous sign for the US , an insurgent coalition yesterday announced an " Islamic cabinet " in an attempt to provide an alternative to the country 's US - backed administration .
The Islamic State of Iraq group named the head of al - Qaida in Iraq as its " minister of war " .
The alliance of eight insurgent groups first emerged in October , claiming to hold territory in Sunni - dominated areas of western and central Iraq .

GAZA ( CNN ) --
The van was hot and stuffy , made even more uncomfortable by the fact CNN cameraman Adil Bradlow and I were wedged between masked gunmen in full battle gear , their index fingers tensely stroking the triggers of their AK - 47 assault rifles .
We were on our way to see a rocket workshop run by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , the armed wing of the Fatah movement .
I got to the rocket makers through an old acquaintance in Gaza .
To protect his identity , I 'll call him Majid .
A journalist , Majid has the numbers of all Gaza 's factions , parties , politicians , warlords , thugs , crooks and freelance gunmen .
" I 'll call you in a few hours , " Majid told me , drawing on the Marlboro permanently wedged between his lips .
Two hours later , he called .
" Be at your office at exactly 10 o'clock tomorrow morning , " he said .
He did n't tell me for what , and I did n't ask .
I knew .
( Watch the action inside a secret rocket factory -- 3:04 )
I did n't mention what I was trying to arrange to anyone -- not CNN 's assignment editors , not our Jerusalem bureau , not even Adil , my cameraman who was hoping for a day off after two weeks in Gaza covering clashes and chaos .
Gaza is crawling with informants , collaborators and spies , so the less anyone knows about your plans , the better .
But bumping along in the cramped van , none of my precautions made me feel any better .
Israeli helicopters and unmanned aircraft frequently " take out " anyone associated with the missiles .
With sweat trickling down my back and as I looked around the van crammed with gunmen , it occurred to me I might be a little too " close " to the story .
After about 15 minutes our van stopped and the door opened .
Adil and I were motioned into the back of a smaller van .
A tall , heavyset man with a thick black beard , black combat fatigues and an M - 16 rifle with a sniper scope got in with us .
" Put these over your heads , " he said , picking up three black hoods , " and keep your heads down . "
I hesitated .
Less than two years ago in Gaza , gunmen stopped a taxi I was riding in and abducted CNN producer Riyadh Ali , as one of the kidnappers held a gun to my face .
( Riyadh was released 24 hours later . )
I did n't think I was being kidnapped this time .
But I did n't like the feeling .
If they stop stirring ... it will explode
With memories of Riyadh 's kidnapping running through my mind , I heard the door of the van slam shut , and off we went .
After 20 minutes , we stopped .
Metal gates screeched open , then closed .
The van door opened , and we were told to take off our masks .
We were in a cramped compound covered in green plastic sheeting , bathing everything in an eerie green glow .
This must have been to protect the workshop from the prying eyes of Israeli aircraft -- and nosey neighbors .
The big man with the beard introduced us to a young man in faded jeans , a black vest and a black hood over his head by the name of " Abu Ahmed , " or " Father of Ahmed . "
He did n't volunteer his real name .
Ahmed was all business .
With cold professionalism , he explained in minute detail the entire process of how they make the rockets .
First we crowded into a small room with breeze - block walls and a corrugated tin roof .
This was where aluminum was melted down then poured into molds for the nozzle of the rocket , the tip and the other parts .
We then went into a room where two men -- dressed in black overalls and , again , with black hoods over their heads -- sat hunched over a gas burner , stirring a white powder in a large stainless steel pot .
This was the rocket propellant .
Ahmed would not tell me the ingredients because , in his words , " the enemy is always on the look out to stop us from getting the materials . "
But he said almost all the inputs come from Israel .
The only thing that 's smuggled in is the TNT for the warhead , which comes through the network of tunnels dug under the border between Gaza and Egypt .
The two men took turns stirring the white powder over the fire .
If they stop stirring , Ahmed said , it will explode .
No mercy for school children
This group makes three kinds of rockets :
The biggest is the so - called Aqsa 103 has a maximum range of 14 kilometers , or 8.5 miles , and carries 6 kilograms of TNT .
With one of his comrades , Ahmed showed us packets of iron shards they pack into rocket warheads for extra lethal effect .
One of these missiles recently slammed into a school classroom in the nearby Israeli town of Sderot , a frequent target of the militants .
The students were in another room at prayer at the time and no one was injured .
Their teacher , for good reason , called it a miracle .
Ahmed was proud -- not ashamed -- that his missile had hit the school .
These are not men who agonize over the morality of violence .
Every mention of Israeli civilian casualties triggers a response stressing Palestinian civilian casualties .
In this region where the concept of an " eye - for - an - eye " was invented , the stark arithmetic of which side kills more is oft quoted .
" Turn the other cheek " and " love thy enemy " never caught on .
Since the start of the second intifada in September 2000 , Palestinian groups have fired more than 5,000 rockets into Israel , or into Gaza settlements before the Jews left .
Those missiles killed 13 civilians and two soldiers .
To stop the rocket attacks , the Israeli army regularly bombards areas near the border in northern Gaza .
They 've dropped thousands of rounds since the beginning of the year , killing , according to Palestinian medical sources , at least six Palestinians -- most of them civilians -- in the process .
Our visit to the missile workshop was cut short .
An Israeli unmanned aircraft was droning overhead , and farther away we heard what sounded like a warplane -- Adil said it seemed like an F - 16 .
We were hurriedly ushered into the van , hoods put back on our heads .
My discomfort with being " too close " to the story flared up again .
I was glad to have a good story , even gladder we were leaving it .
Group raises money to fly pro-impeachment banner at All - Star Game Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 9 , 2007 Print This Email
This Online activists raised enough money in two hours Monday afternoon to fly a banner encouraging the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney over AT&T Park in San Francisco before Tuesday 's baseball All Star Game .
The effort for an airborne banner began in The Nationwide Movement to Impeach Cheney and Bush group on Facebook.com and has been promoted by pro-impeachment Web site AfterDowningStreet.org .
Time is short to raise the necessary money before baseball 's All - Star Game Tuesday night in San Francisco .
" I 'd like to see this Facebook group be empowered by actually making something happen in the world , " Jacob Park , the Facebook group 's founder , told RAW STORY .
As of 5:15 p.m. Monday , organizers raised the $ 695 needed to hire the plane from 47 donations , Park said in an e-mail .
Donations are being accepted at this Web site ; the announcement was posted to the Facebook group at 3 p.m. Brian H , another group member , first proposed the banner idea in a post on the site Sunday evening .
One of the group 's members , Timothy Fong , said he contacted a Napa - based company that would tow a banner over the game .
The banner would fly over AT&T park in San Francisco while people arrived for the All - Star game , but because of airspace restrictions put in place after 9/11 it would have to land an hour before the first pitch , Fong told RAW STORY .
The game is going to be televised on Fox beginning at 8 p.m. Tuesday .
" It would be ideal in terms of citizens expressing dissatisfaction with their government to have something out there during the national anthem or during the first pitch , " Fong said , but the activists are committed to following the law .
Park said he donated $ 50 to get the banner airborne , and other commenters on the Facebook group , which has 978 members , said they were donating as little as $ 5 to $ 10 .
CHOCOLATE is regarded as a treat , a sweet luxury often given as a gift .
But that is only part of its story .
The rest is more sinister .
Two hundred years after the British Empire abolished the slave trade , nearly half the world 's chocolate is made from cocoa grown in Ivory Coast , West Africa , where tens of thousands of children are forced to work on plantations as slaves .
A 2002 study estimated that at least 284,000 children were trapped in forced labour in the West African cocoa industry , the majority of these — some 200,000 — were to be found in Ivory Coast .
Even the most conservative estimates , including those by the chocolate companies themselves , concede that the number of chocolate slaves is at least 12,000 .
These children are forced to apply pesticides without protective clothing and to work for up to 12 hours a day on the plantations for little or no pay .
Their toil helps the giant chocolate makers produce the chocolate we find on the shelves of our stores .
Scientists say CO could minimise the chance of organ rejection
Although too much of the gas is deadly , minute doses help widen blood vessels and cut inflammation , which could boost the survival chances of donor organs .
Sheffield University scientists have devised a way to release targeted small doses of CO using carrier molecules .
They say lab tests have been promising and hope to start human trials by 2010 .
The team is lead by Professor Brian Mann , who is working alongside Dr Roberto Motterlini at Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research and was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .
They claim their discovery could have other applications too , including treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and high blood pressure in the lungs .
Injection
Conventional CO inhalation carries the risk of patients or medical staff being accidentally exposed to high doses .
The new treatment method should remove this risk , says Professor Mann .
It 's a much safer way to give CO
Professor Mann
It comprises water - soluble molecules , known as CO - releasing molecules ( CO - RMs ) , which , when swallowed or injected , release calculated doses of CO inside the body .
Professor Mann said : " The molecules dissolve in water , so they can be made available in an easy - to - ingest , liquid form that quickly passes into the bloodstream .
" They can be injected exactly where required without being a threat .
It 's a much safer way to give CO . "
He added : " As well as making it simple to control how much CO is introduced into a patient 's body , it will be possible to refine the design of the molecules so that they target a particular place while leaving the rest of the body unaffected .
" For transplant patients , we could treat the donor organ to minimise the risk of damage and rejection . "
He said CO was great at protecting against reperfusion damage - tissue damage caused when blood supply returns after a period of no supply .
Dr Ian Fairlamb , a chemist at the University of York , said many scientists were now looking at developing CO - RMs on the back of Dr Motterlini 's pioneering work .
" At first it may seem surprising that CO can be beneficial because it is a known toxin .
But low doses of CO can elicit a wide range of biological effects , which can be exploited in many therapeutic applications .
" In terms of using carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent , it is preferable to avoid using it in its gaseous form .
These carrier compounds can transport it in a safe way . "
There ’s a theory called ‘ The Uncanny Valley ’ regarding humans ’ emotional response to human - like robots .
From The Wikipedia entry :
The Uncanny Valley is a hypothesis about robotics concerning the emotional response of humans to robots and other non-human entities .
It was introduced by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970 [ … ]
Mori ’s hypothesis states that as a robot is made more humanlike in its appearance and motion , the emotional response from a human being to the robot will become increasingly positive and empathic , until a point is reached beyond which the response quickly becomes strongly repulsive .
However , as the appearance and motion continue to become less distinguishable from a human being ’s , the emotional response becomes positive once more and approaches human - human empathy levels .
This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a “ barely - human ” and “ fully human ” entity is called the Uncanny Valley .
The name captures the idea that a robot which is “ almost human ” will seem overly “ strange ” to a human being and thus will fail to evoke the requisite empathetic response required for productive human - robot interaction .
While most of us do n’t interact with human - like robots frequently enough to accept or reject this theory , many of us have seen a movie like The Polar Express or Final Fantasy : The Spirit Within , which use realistic – as opposed to cartoonish – computer - generated human characters .
Although the filmmakers take great care to make the characters ’ expressions and movements replicate those of real human actors , many viewers find these almost - but - not - quite - human characters to be unsettling or even creepy .
The problem is that our minds have a model of how humans should behave and the pseudo - humans , whether robotic or computer - generated images , do n’t quite fit this model , producing a sense of unease – in other words , we know that something ’s not right – even if we ca n’t precisely articulate what ’s wrong .
Why do n’t we feel a similar sense of unease when we watch a cartoon like The Simpsons , where the characters are even further away from our concept of humanness ?
Because in the cartoon environment , we accept that the characters are not really human at all – they ’re cartoon characters and are self - consistent within their animated environment .
Conversely , it would be jarring if a real human entered the frame and interacted with the Simpsons , because eighteen years of Simspons cartoons and eighty years of cartoons in general have conditioned us not to expect this [ Footnote 1 ] .
There ’s a lesson here for software designers , and one that I ’ve talked about recently – we must ensure that we design our applications to remain consistent with the environment in which our software runs .
In more concrete terms : a Windows application should look and feel like a Windows application , a Mac application should look and feel like a Mac application , and a web application should look and feel like a web application .
Obvious , you say ?
I ’d agree that software designers and developers generally observe this rule except in the midst of a technological paradigm shift .
During periods of rapid innovation and exploration , it ’s tempting and more acceptable to violate the expectations of a particular environment .
I know this is a sweeping and abstract claim , so let me back it up with a few examples .
Does anyone remember Active Desktop ?
When Bill Gates realized that the web was a big deal , he directed all of Microsoft to web - enable all Microsoft software products .
Active Desktop was a feature that made the Windows desktop look like a web page and allowed users to initiate the default action on a file or folder via a hyperlink - like single - click rather than the traditional double - click .
One of the problems with Active Desktop was that it broke all of users expectations about interacting with files and folders .
Changing from the double - click to single - click model subtley changed other interactions , like drag and drop , select , and rename .
The only reason I remember this feature is because so many non-technical friends at Penn State asked me to help them turn it off .
Another game - changing technology of the 1990s was the Java platform .
Java ’s attraction was that the language ’s syntax looked and felt a lot like C and C++ ( which many programmers knew ) but it was ( in theory ) ‘ write once , run anywhere ’ – in other words , multiplatform .
Although Java took hold on the server - side , it never took off on the desktop as many predicted it would .
Why did n’t it take off on the desktop ?
My own experience with using Java GUI apps of the late 1990s was that they were slow and they looked and behaved weirdly vs. standard Windows ( or Mac or Linux ) applications .
That ’s because they were n’t true Windows / Mac / Linux apps .
They were Java Swing apps which emulated Windows / Mac / Linux apps .
Despite the herculean efforts of the Swing designers and implementers , they could n’t escape the Uncanny Valley of emulated user interfaces .
Eclipse and SWT took a different approach to Java - based desktop apps [ Footnote 2 ] .
Rather than emulating native desktop widgets , SWT favor direct delegation to native desktop widgets [ Footnote 3 ] , resulting in applications that look like Windows / Mac / Linux applications rather than Java Swing applications .
The downside of this design decision is that SWT widget developers must manually port a new widget to each supported desktop environment .
This development - time and maintenance pain point only serves to emphasize how important the Eclipse / SWT designers judged native look and feel to be .
Just like Windows / Mac / Linux apps have a native look and feel , so too do browser - based applications .
The native widgets of the web are the standard HTML elements – hyperlinks , tables , buttons , text inputs , select boxes , and colored spans and divs .
We ’ve had the tools to create richer web applications ever since pre-standards DOMs and Javascript 1.0 , but it ’s only been the combination of DOM ( semi - ) standardization , XHR de - facto standardization , emerging libraries , and exemplary next - gen apps like Google Suggest and Gmail that have led to a non-trivial segment of the software community to attempt richer web UIs which I believe we ’re now lumping under the banner of ‘ Ajax ’ ( or is it ‘ RIA ’ ? ) .
Like the web and Java before it , the availability of Ajax technology is causing some developers to diverge from the native look and feel of the web in favor of a user interface style I call “ desktop app in a web browser ” .
For an example of this style of Ajax app , take a few minutes and view this Flash demo of the Zimbra collaboration suite .
To me , Zimbra does n’t in any way resemble my mental model of a web application ; it resembles Microsoft Outlook [ Footnote 4 ] .
On the other hand Gmail , which is also an Ajax - based email application , almost exactly matches my mental model of how a web application should look and feel ( screenshots ) .
Do I prefer the Gmail look and feel over the Zimbra look and feel ?
Yes .
Why ?
Because over the past twelve years , my mind has developed a very specific model of how a web application should look and feel , and because Gmail aligns to this model , I can immediately use it and it feels natural to me .
Gmail uses Ajax to accelerate common operations ( e.g. email address auto - complete ) and to enable data transfer sans jarring page refresh ( e.g. refresh Inbox contents ) but its core look and feel remains very similar to that of a traditional web page .
In my view , this is not a shortcoming ; it ’s a smart design decision .
So I ’d recommend that if you ’re considering or actively building Ajax / RIA applications , you should consider the Uncanny Valley of user interface design and recognize that when you build a “ desktop in the web browser ” - style application , you ’re violating users ’ unwritten expectations of how a web application should look and behave .
This choice may have significant negative impact on learnability , pleasantness of use , and adoption .
The fact that you can create web applications that resemble desktop applications does not imply that you should ; it only means that you have one more option and subsequent set of trade - offs to consider when making design decisions .
[ Footnote 1 ] Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a notable exception .
[ Footnote 2 ] I work for the IBM group ( Eclipse / Jazz ) that created SWT , so I may be biased .
[ Footnote 3 ]
Though SWT favors delegation to native platform widgets , it sometimes uses emulated widgets if the particular platform does n’t provide an acceptable native widget .
This helps it get around the ‘ least - common denominator ’ problem of AWT .
[ Footnote 4 ]
I ’m being a bit unfair to Zimbra here because there ’s a scenario where its Outlook - like L&F really shines .
If I were a CIO looking to migrate off of Exchange / Outlook to a cheaper multiplatform alternative , Zimbra would be very attractive because since Zimbra is functionally consistent with Outlook , I ’d expect that Outlook users could transition to Zimbra fairly quickly .
China says the dam will help power its economic growth
The dam 's head of construction , Wang Xiaofeng , said ecological problems like soil erosion , landslides and water pollution could not be ignored .
In some areas ill - judged development was making things worse , he said .
Critics have long warned the dam , the world 's largest hydro- electric project , could cause huge environmental damage .
The $ 25 bn ( £ 12.5 bn ) project , across the country 's biggest river , the Yangtze , is due to be completed by the end of 2008 .
More than one million people were relocated to make way for the dam , which China says is needed to control flooding and provide much - needed electricity .
Environmental cost
Mr Wang told a conference that China had to address the environmental issues .
More than one million people were relocated because of the dam
" We absolutely cannot relax our guard against ecological and environmental security problems sparked by the Three Gorges Project , " he said .
" We cannot win passing economic prosperity at the cost of the environment , " Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying .
The problems included landslides caused by erosion on the steep hills around the dam , conflicts over land shortages and " ecological deterioration caused by irrational development " , he said .
Senior engineer Huang Xuebin told the forum that landslides were a " severe threat to the lives of residents around the dam " .
Some landslides had caused waves several metres high that further damaged surrounding shores , he said .
Other officials warned that the quality of drinking water for residents was being affected .
The BBC's Quentin Somerville , in Shanghai , says that the admission comes with China 's government increasingly worried that environmental damage is leading to growing political unrest .
Earlier this summer , the head of the State Environmental Protection Agency warned that pollution worries had led to an increase in protests and riots across China .
However , there is hardly a river in the country that has not been dammed and many more projects are still progressing , our correspondent says .
Beijing recently increased its targets for renewable energy production , most of which will still come from hydro-electric projects .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - The 21 Asia -Pacific leaders gathering this week in Sydney , a city renowned for its beach lifestyle , can stop pulling in their stomachs -- they will not be forced to wear swimming costumes for the official photograph .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
At the end of each Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation ( APEC ) summit , leaders pose for a photograph in a costume that represents the host nation .
In Vietnam in 2006 the leaders dressed in full - length traditional ao dai outfits .
Discussion in Australia over what the leaders , who include U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao , may wear has prompted a number of humorous suggestions .
As Australia does not have a definitive national dress , some have suggested the leaders could be wearing swimming costumes , nicknamed “ budgie smugglers ” for men , and thongs or flipflops -- traditional Aussie beach attire .
Others have proposed the Aussie workman ’s uniform -- navy blue singlets , tight shorts and steel capped boots .
The most likely outfit is not inspired by the Australian beach , despite the majority of the population living on the coast , but the country ’s iconic rugged outback .
The classic bushman ’s outfit consists of a rabbit - skin hat , full - length leather rain coat and leather boots .
Australian Prime Minister John
Howard is aware the wrong outfit would be a fashion and diplomatic faux pas .
Howard remained tight - lipped on Monday about what the leaders would wear for their photograph -- but ruled out one outfit .
“ The only Australian garb I ’d rule out is Speedos ( swimming costumes ) and thongs ( flip flops ) , ” Howard told local television .
“ I do n’t think I ’d do that , that would n’t be very diplomatic . ”
“ It will be very Australian .
Think Australian in a very positive way , one we all identify with , ” he said .
The “ hate crime ” the protesters wish me to prosecute does not exist as a stand - alone offense in Louisiana law .
It ’s not that our Legislature has turned a blind eye to crimes motivated by race or other personal characteristics , but it has addressed the problem in a way that does not cover what happened in Jena .
The hate crime statute is used to enhance the sentences of defendants found guilty of specific crimes , like murder or rape , who chose their victims based on race , religion , sexual orientation or other factors .
Last week , a reporter asked me whether , if I had it to do over , I would do anything differently .
I did n’t think of it at the time , but the answer is yes .
I would have done a better job of explaining that the offenses of Dec. 4 , 2006 , did not stem from a “ schoolyard fight ” as it has been commonly described in the news media and by critics .
Conjure the image of schoolboys fighting : they exchange words , clench fists , throw punches , wrestle in the dirt until classmates or teachers pull them apart .
Of course that would not be aggravated second - degree battery , which is what the attackers are now charged with .
( Five of the defendants were originally charged with attempted second - degree murder . )
But that ’s not what happened at Jena High School .
The victim in this crime , who has been all but forgotten amid the focus on the defendants , was a young man named Justin Barker , who was not involved in the nooses incident three months earlier .
According to all the credible evidence I am aware of , after lunch , he walked to his next class .
As he passed through the gymnasium door to the outside , he was blindsided and knocked unconscious by a vicious blow to the head thrown by Mychal Bell .
While lying on the ground unaware of what was happening to him , he was brutally kicked by at least six people .
Imagine you were walking down a city street , and someone leapt from behind a tree and hit you so hard that you fell to the sidewalk unconscious .
Would you later describe that as a fight ?
Only the intervention of an uninvolved student protected Mr. Barker from severe injury or death .
There was serious bodily harm inflicted with a dangerous weapon — the definition of aggravated second - degree battery .
Mr. Bell ’s conviction on that charge as an adult has been overturned , but I considered adult status appropriate because of his role as the instigator of the attack , the seriousness of the charge and his prior criminal record .
I can understand the emotions generated by the juxtaposition of the noose incident with the attack on Mr. Barker and the outcomes for the perpetrators of each .
In the final analysis , though , I am bound to enforce the laws of Louisiana as they exist today , not as they might in someone ’s vision of a perfect world .
That is what I have done .
And that is what I must continue to do .
These figures are in millions .
The source for energy R&D expenditures is from the National Council for Science and the Environment .
Take a look here .
Though the war in Iraq now costs about $ 120B a year , two authors ( one a Nobel prize winner ) estimates the total cost of this war exceeds 2 Trillion Dollars .
“ Accrued liabilities for U.S. federal employees ’ and veterans ’ benefits now total $ 4.5 trillion .
Indeed , our debt for veterans ’ health and disability payments has risen by $ 228 billion in the past year alone …
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the interest payments on the money borrowed to finance the Iraq war will total $ 264 billion to $ 308 billion . ”
That $ 2,000,000,000,000 ?
Well , that amount of money could ’ve built solar thermal plants here that would have provided energy for 2 /3rds of our nation ’s energy demand .
If you found this information eye - opening , interesting , or evocative , please throw us a bone or two ( or ten ) .
I ’m a starving grad - student , Dave is just getting going selling solar in San Francisco , and we need all the support we can get to drive more traffic to the site , get more people educated about clean technology , and persuade legislators to further secure our energy independence .

We ’d love to hear from you .
For most of us , dying would be infinitely easier than living -- for life is hard !
But there may be some reasons to delay your exit which have n't occurred to you ...

Introduction
It can sometimes seem like everyone out there wants a piece of you .
And often not merely the one piece , but ALL of you -- and all of that fully committed to their own particular cause or agenda .
To the expense of your own hopes and dreams .
And when I say fully committed , I mean to the death .
All your money .
All your time .
All your life .
But when you get right down to it , there 's not much good reason to be an Eric Rudolph , Timothy McVeigh , Jim Jones cult member , or blue ribbon consumer of Madison Avenue brands .
And practically infinite reasons to pursue different courses entirely !
There seems to be no end to the would - be Machiavellis , dictators , gang bosses , religious and cult evangelists , terrorist leaders , politicians , and charismatic business execs out there wanting you and me to give our all for them or their cause .
But why in hell should we ?
Why should n't we instead live for ourselves ?
Rather than dying at whatever velocity to appease someone else ?
Who are those folks to tell us it 's better to die for them than live for our own dreams and aspirations ?
Just because someone gets cameras and microphones stuck in their face more often than others does n't make them intrinsically better or wiser than we .
Heck , those cameras and mikes have to be shoved somewhere , after all .
And a great many personalities which get them topside would probably be more deserving of a colonoscopy with the things , instead .
And just because someone 's richer than we are does n't make them smarter or more deserving of good things either .
It often just means they 're luckier or meaner , in a universe where waste and evil are the ultimate winners .
So why not tell those folks to kiss off , and live for your own sake rather than theirs ?
Of course in our current celebrity - worshipping society many of us may have forgotten or never learned in the first place many of the reasons for living on our own terms instead of those handed down to us by others .
So below is a short list to jog your memory or consciousness .
Beginning with certain lesser reasons and working up to the best .
# 10 : Random chance .
Lots of supremely educated folks might take issue with me on this one , as in general randomness leads to disaster more often than not ( check out the law of entropy sometime ) .
But those same folks would also have to admit that on occasion randomness can save your ass .
More than once a randomly located rock has saved me personally from possible automotive mayhem .
For instance , randomness definitely plays a role in the formation of dissipative structures like life and intelligence in the universe .
Despite such entities essentially often representing direct opposition to random chance itself .
For intelligent folk do their best to design out all randomness from their constructions such as bridges and rockets and medicines .
With the ever increasing control the rich and powerful are gaining over the rest of us through advances in technology , over time the tendency of random chance to affect events in unpredictable fashion may become one of the few chances the little guy will have left in this world .
Heck : random chance IS the best shot 99 % of us have at ever getting rich ourselves ( see the overwhelming evidence here ) .
But let me be clear on this point : so long as humanity follows a progressive and ever improving path in general , random chance is more an enemy than ally .
It is when society is devolving or collapsing that we might hold out the desperate hope that random chance might somehow slow down or reverse such trends .
Basically the only reason I presently list random chance as a potentially good thing is the current social devolution going on in the sole world superpower -- the United States ( circa late 2007 ) .
So long as America continues with its substantial might to try to take the world backwards , random chance must remain a significant source of hope for turning the tide .
To see more about this subject refer to The astonishing decline of America OR How to go from respected sole world superpower to dangerous third world nation in just a couple generations .
" We forget how often we have been astonished by the sudden crumbling of institutions , by extraordinary changes in people 's thoughts , by unexpected eruptions of rebellion against tyrannies , by the quick collapse of systems of power that seemed invincible . "
-- The Optimism of Uncertainty By Howard Zinn ; September 2 , 2004
# 9 : Gödel 's Incompleteness Theorem .
Wow .
I bet you were n't expecting that one !
Basically a brilliant scientist named Kurt Gödel once proved that nobody can ever know everything .
No matter if God - like powers are brought to bear by future humanity or the most advanced aliens you can imagine , even they will never learn it all .
So why 's this a reason to live ?
Because it means anyone deciding anything -- including to die -- cannot and never will have all the facts available to them .
Perhaps not even all those specific facts relevant to their choice of the time .
Ditto on deciding to live as well -- but you get the point .
Likewise our oppressors can never be all knowing .
So if we stick around and continue to resist , sooner or later we may yet find a loophole by which to win .
Yeah , I agree this is a whopper in terms of long shots .
But it 's still a real shot at winning for the little guy -- even if it is a pip squeak of a thing .
But that 's what being the underdog is all about .
Right ?
Heck : at least twice in my life I found the same loophole which resulted in my own victory over bigger and stronger opposition .
What was that loophole ?
I showed up to fight them when they did n't think I would .
Their own absence from the scheduled meetings -- witnessed by others -- led to me emerging the victor from those events .
Yes , that 's right : one loophole at times consists merely of showing up when others do n't think you 'll dare .
Or , in other words , my opponents here were ignorant of my own resolve and courage .
They did n't know I 'd show up to accept their challenge .
So I beat them by default !
# 8 : Revenge .
There 's a saying that living well is the ultimate revenge .
Well , I 'd add that out - living your enemies might not rank too far below that .
There 's some grim satisfaction to be had as you see your enemies fall by the wayside , even as you yourself continue on .
Especially where some of those enemies seriously threatened your own life or well being in some way in the past .
You can see one admittedly extreme account of such survival from my own life in What goes around ....
# 7 : Curiosity The National Enquirer tabloid used to have the motto " Enquiring minds want to know ! "
Though I never found much else to recommend that publication to anyone , something about that slogan did resonate with me personally .
For I 've always been curious .
Not curious about the trivia of celebrity lives and scandals .
But rather about the whys and hows behind us being here .
About waking up a sentient being on a primitive world , and often finding myself in unnecessarily dire circumstances .
Curious about if my own life and that of others could be improved , and if so , how ?
Give me details !
But even if I never found satisfactory answers to that type of quest , I 'd still be curious about what happens next .
What new scientific discoveries and inventions might be about to burst forth over the horizon .
History - shaking events and ideas .
Things like that .
Of course I have no hope of quenching this particular thirst .
For much will ever remain beyond my reach .
And eventually I 'll die and never be able to learn anything else new again .
But while I yet live and have reasonable intellectual faculties I can still acquire a little nugget here and there along the way .
A few pieces of the ultimate puzzle .
And just maybe if I live long enough I 'll come to understand enough about it all to die more content than I could today .
# 6 : The ultimate relief and satisfaction available to our own ending .
I 'm getting to be a fairly old guy now , and seen my share of the world and past history .
I 've also been luckier than lots of folks in getting the chance to pursue my own curiosity into a wider variety of subjects -- and deeper into such topics -- than just about anyone else I ever met or even heard of .
So today I do n't suffer from nearly the level of uncertainty in some matters that many do .
This state has both advantages and disadvantages relative to the condition of most others ' lives .
For instance , I 'm virtually immune to most of the scams and con games typically used by bad guys at all levels to attack the public .
The flip side of that though is that I must stand by and see others suffer the consequences of being so duped over and over again .
Even loved ones .
Not that I do n't try to save them from the traps .
It 's just that not being a talking head on TV myself or sending them hard copy propaganda through the mail means I do n't seem as credible to them as the con men .
And so my poor family and friends have to learn many things the hard way .
Sometimes more than once .
Agh !
And of course I just come off as being a terrible nag on all of them .
I 'm also sure there 's no afterlife .
That that 's just a fairy tale for folks to help make up for the vast uncertainties in life in general .
And in modern times of course the tale has become a handy tool of control for the state in theocracies , as well as just about anyone who 's a little smarter than their followers ( and willing to exploit them ) .
I stopped debating the faithful on this point decades back .
For it's no different than arguing with a three old about the existence of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny .
Life 's too short to waste on such trivia .
It 's terribly sad to watch so many of my fellow human beings constantly arguing and fighting and wasting their lives and money trying to prove whose version of the fairy tale is true .
Or at least the most damaging to humanity ( for the faction damaged least is expected to be the victor ) .
Agh !
Think of all the death and suffering we could prevent by simply deleting such meaningless squabbling from our civilization !
The awful toll on children worldwide may be the worst part of all this .
Even with my considerable experience and personal research and experimentation though there remains much more I 'd like to know and do while I can .
The world 's a big and complicated place , and it could easily require many normal lifetimes to come near to exhausting its potential for surprise and wonder .
And profit of various sorts .
Yes , I 'm sure at some point the ravages of age and repeated emotional turmoil will so weaken and exhaust me as to overwhelm my desire to gather still more knowledge and test yet another new idea .
Or else bind me with physical or mental restrictions which severely curtail my capacities for such pursuits .
But I 'm also sure the present window of opportunity is the only one I 'll ever get to experience the universe as a thinking being , and be able to exert my own changes upon it , meager as they might be .
So I 'm determined to do what I can while I 'm here .
Just as a contest winner who gets to keep all the cash he can scoop up inside a bank vault in sixty seconds would .
For on the universe 's time scale our own miniscule lifespan is practically non-existent .
From the perspective of eternity it 's POOF !
We 're born , live out our lives , and then die all in that single brief POOF !
Like a piece of magician 's flash paper to which a match has been struck .
I 'll be damned if I wo n't metaphorically eat all I can while the kitchen 's open !
One result of this is I should have minimal regrets when I 'm done .
For I 'll know I did all I could while I was able , to live my life to the fullest .
I 'm sure there 's quite a few people out there who wo n't feel this way at their expiration .
And so their own passing will likely be less pleasant .
( Of course , I could always be wrong about that afterlife thing .
But so could those who believe it to exist , in exactly what it 's like or all about ( if it is real ) .
After all : nobody really knows .
In my youth I did extensive studies of today 's major religions , as well as many of the mythologies which preceded them in prehistoric and historic times .
And eventually wrote up in a story my own ideas for what a possible afterlife might be like . )
936 Little Blobs deals with the same essential idea of this section -- something which has haunted me personally for a long time now .
So little time , so much to do ... it's too bad there 's so little fun and joy involved along the way , too !

# 5 : Adventure Elsewhere on this page I discuss the passions of love .
But there 's other sorts of passion available too .
Like the thrills of real - life adventure or mystery - solving or miscellaneous other recreations , which some among us may be fortunate enough to also earn a living at while so engaged .
So far as anyone knows today , adventures like these will be completely unavailable to you after you 're dead .
So you 'd best have them now .
And cherish what lifespan you have remaining as your primary resource for experiencing more such thrills .
For so long as you can scrounge up the free time , adventure need never be too far away ...
If you 'd like to see a sampling of my own real world adventures of decades past , you can examine The Shadowfast supercar driver logs .
# 4 : Changing one itsy - bitsy piece of the world for the better Research indicates lots of us are happier when we feel like we have some control over our lives .
And many of us hope to someday make the world a better place , even if only in some small way , or in our local corner of same .
Fortunately some obstacles which prevented this for many in the past may now be melting away or being dismantled .
Or at least the advent of the internet is spurring so much change across - the - board that new loopholes of opportunity are springing open for the time being .
So for now and the immediate future many of us may have our best shot ever at affecting the status quo if we try hard enough .
And in my book that 's one darn good reason to stick around for a while !

# 3 : Serendipity .
Not all accidents are bad .
Sometimes they can be wonderful .
And make of life the most exquisite experience imaginable for a human being .
Yeah .
No kidding !
On rare occasion our life can actually seem to be the kind most of us would wish for if we were smart enough to know what we 'd truly want , and found a genie in a bottle who could grant it to us on the spot .
Yeah , such nirvana is admittedly usually very short - lived .
But the memories of same can be sweet enough to make up for an awful lot of the regular stuff we must put up with daily .
And even those serendipitous moments which come nowhere near to the best ones as described above can still be pretty pleasurable and worthwhile in their own right ( the good ones , I mean !
Bad serendipitous events are possible too , of course ) .
# 2 : Transcendence .
Uh oh .
Fair warning !
Here I 'm delving into the metaphysical .
Or cosmological .
Or inspirational ( ? )
Many folks equate transcendence with religious revelations .
But not me .
The kind of transcendence I prefer relates to events which truthfully change one 's life for the better .
Stuff bringing about immediate and perceptible improvements in one 's daily circumstances .
As a kid I once read a book that shaped my whole notion of transcendence .
It may have been A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle , but I 'm not positive .
I could have been anywhere from nine to twelve years old at the time .
In the book a kid discovers there 's a strange way of thinking which all on its own will open up a dimensional portal to other realms on demand .
At least that 's the gist of my recollection .
Since then I 've found there 's quite a few possibilities for having real effects on the universe -- maybe big ones !-- through a simple change in perspective , or the learning of a new idea .
For instance , although there was much to criticize about the TV show MacGyver , its core idea that creativity with the resources at hand could get you out of an amazing array of jams is sound .
My dad often succeeded at such things via his junkstorming , and me too in the decades since .
In my college experiments with hypnosis I found indications that a suitably trained and disciplined person might be able to exert a level of control over their physical body via their mind which would astonish many observers .
One hilarious example of this was provided by a cousin of mine who was following his own somewhat parallel course in hypnotic experimentation at the time .
While I was after a mental improvement to make it through a particularly difficult engineering course , my cousin was striving to improve his physical coordination for things like sports .
To make a long story short , one of our fellow students taunted my cousin one day into pitching a snowball from the parking lot up through roughly a one and one half inch diameter hole in the guy 's third or fourth story dormitory window screen and into his open mouth just behind the screen .
My cousin carefully molded the snowball to fit the estimated size of the hole , then let fly .
There was only the single throw .
The snowball zoomed smack through the center of the hole and down the guy 's throat , choking him to a certain extent .
Luckily the snowball was likely close to the maximum size of object which could pass through his esophagus , and would rapidly shrink due to melting too .
He survived .
But he never ever challenged my cousin 's throwing ability again .
To we college men the episode was hilarious .
Once I obtained a considerable promotion in rank and pay at a company by transcending a confrontation with the chief of the IT department of the time .
And it was pretty much unwitting on my part .
The department head actually set me up for a public ambush and then got caught in his own trap .
You see , he 'd decided to publicly best me in a technical jargon contest / debate in order to put me in my place .
Without realizing it I had become a threat to him by helping to solve everyone 's computer problems company - wide as they arose .
I guess a by product of that help was more and more folks suggesting I 'd make a better IT head than he .
So he tried to nip it in the bud by taking me out to the woodshed before maybe a third of the staff in a large open area of desks with no intervening walls .
The poor guy did n't stand a chance though .
Because in college and since I 'd spent way too much time reading BYTE magazines , devouring everything about computers that I could .
For quite a number of years .
So I humiliated him so badly that within days he'd resigned and left the company , practically leaving me his post by default .
My biggest edge may have been the surprise nature of the ambush .
For not knowing what he had in mind left me relaxed and composed during the incident , while he felt under pressure .
Being relaxed makes for much better and clearer thinking .
And a better working memory as well .
A similar moment of transcendence occurred to me in high school .
When I won one pivotal battle simply by showing up when my opponent did n't .
( Note that being alive seems to be THE biggest single prerequisite for showing up to a confrontation !
Ha , ha )
# 1 : Love .
Yeah , it sounds sappy , I know .
But when you come down to the nitty gritty of it all , love is pretty much all that counts in the end .
At least for reasonably sane and healthy folks .
Family , friends .
Children .
Spouses or significant others .
However you want to describe it , love or lack of it may be the ultimate deal - breaker where life and death are concerned .
Remove all love from the equation and I 'd be willing to bet that the human race would go entirely extinct almost immediately .
We might or might not have enough time to go bonkers before we all died off .
So long as you 're alive , even if you have no love at present , there 's still a chance some might come your way .
It helps that others out there are seeking it as well .
And yes , most all adults immersed in the media of the developed world crave something like the myth of the soul - mate .
A romantic love teeming with tantalizing and invigorating sexual escapades and / or other shared adventures which never end , and never lose their excitement and intrigue .
Passion and lots of it .
For that stuff can be as pleasurable and addictive -- if not more so !-- as anything else life has to offer .
But whatever passionate relationships most of us form never even come close to meeting such high expectations .
That 's fine though .
For that 's not the only kind of love which can make life worth living .
Indeed , the vast majority of humanity out there eventually realizes the never - ending soul - mate sexual nirvana scenario is unrealistic -- and even impossible -- for all sorts of reasons .
And so become willing -- even eager -- to settle for the consistent compassion and companionship to be found in a good marriage or friendship or other close relationship .
Passion burns and consumes , while compassion warms and sustains .
So our best chances of finding lasting , real world love likely reside in the arena of compassion rather than passion .
Family and friend type stuff , rather than Romeo and Juliet .
Yeah , such a thing sure does n't sound as exciting as soul - mates .
But it 's more real , accessible , and sustainable over the long haul for most of us .
And can often be plenty satisfying itself .

SHARING pain is usually deemed a good thing .
So advocates of dishing out agony will be gladdened that the wallet - crunching pangs of car drivers filling up with petrol are now equalled by the wince - inducing stabs felt by shoppers piling up their supermarket trolleys .
As oil prices stay high , wheat prices hit an all - time peak of over $ 7.50 a bushel for December delivery at the end of trading in Chicago on Thursday August 23rd .
The soaring prices of bushels and barrels are not unconnected .
The cost of agricultural commodities , just like oil and metals , has gone up sharply over the past couple of years .
Aside from wheat , the prices of corn , rice and barley have all risen by over a third since 2005 .
Food prices around the world are rising so quickly that a new term has been coined to describe the ballooning price of breakfast staples and dinner - time favourites : agflation .
The latest spike in wheat prices has come in response to news that Canada 's crop could be reduced by roughly a fifth this year after bad weather hit the world 's second - largest exporter .
This sent countries that rely on imported wheat , such as Japan and Taiwan , scampering to the market to secure supplies .
Whether climate change is to blame for Canada 's poor summer is unclear but its underlying pressure on prices is in less doubt .
Demand for grain is accelerating not to feed humans or livestock but to fill petrol tanks .
Compared with 2000 , three - times more corn is used to make ethanol in America ; distilleries that produce biofuels hoover up a fifth of the country 's corn supplies .
Demand for cleaner energy in turn keeps demand for corn growing .
Farmers are having trouble keeping pace with the burgeoning biofuel industry .
And to produce more corn farmers are switching production from wheat and soya , pushing up the prices of those crops too .
On top of these pressures , rising prosperity in poorer countries , particularly India and China , is also lifting prices .
Normally the response of the world 's farmers would be to increase output by planting on marginal land .
This is happening .
In the coming year the International Grains Council reckons that global grain production will hit 1,660 m tonnes , some 90 m tonnes more than last year .
Nevertheless , demand will still outstrip supply .
The wheat crop hit by Canada 's run of bad weather is likely to weigh in at 607 m tonnes while demand may top 614 m tonnes .
And the reverberations are felt right down the menu .
As grain prices rise so do the prices of other agricultural products that rely on it as an input .
As the cost of keeping poultry and livestock goes up so do the prices of eggs , chickens and other meat .
Even if new land is planted this may not help to push down food prices .
Because generous subsidies ensure that biofuel production is handily profitable , that industry is likely to grab new grain supplies to prime its distilling towers .
Agflation can also cause headaches for central banks .
In most countries , the measures of core inflation that banks monitor most closely when making decisions about monetary policy exclude food and energy prices .
Both are volatile and vulnerable to supply shocks .
As central banks try to control demand they tend not to react to price fluctuations caused by see- sawing supply .
But in consumer - price indices , at least in some countries , food has a greater impact .
In America food carries just 14 % of the weight of the consumer - price index , but in China it accounts for 33 % and in India 46 % .
In such countries the rising price of food obviously could push up inflation levels overall .
In addition , if food prices stay high , and if consumers spend less on other goods , other parts of the economy might suffer .
Good reason , therefore , for central bankers and others to hope that the pain of agflation is not shared too widely .
Documents contradict Attorney General 's sworn testimony
Enjoy this story ?
Be the first to get politics headlines as they break .
The " Gang of Eight , " prominent congressional leaders of both parties , were briefed about the President 's terrorist surveillance program immediately before its intended expiration date , documents reveal .
The documents directly contradict the sworn testimony of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , heightening the questions of his credibility and fueling concern of perjury charges .
" A Gonzales spokesman maintained Wednesday that the attorney general stands by his testimony , " according to the Associated Press .
Excerpts follow .
At a heated Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday , Gonzales repeatedly testified that the issue at hand was not about the terrorist surveillance program , which allowed the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on suspects in the United States without receiving court approval .
Instead , Gonzales said , the emergency meetings on March 10 , 2004 , focused on an intelligence program that he would not describe .
Gonzales , who was then serving as counsel to Bush , testified that the White House Situation Room briefing sought to inform congressional leaders about the pending expiration of the unidentified program and Justice Department objections to renew it .
Those objections were led by then - Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey , who questioned the program 's legality .
" The dissent related to other intelligence activities , " Gonzales testified at Tuesday 's hearing .
" The dissent was not about the terrorist surveillance program . "

The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on July 25 .
By Ian Youngs
Entertainment reporter , BBC News
Spoof Kazakh reporter Borat - aka Ali G comedian Sacha Baron Cohen - is expected to score a box office hit by offending and humiliating real Americans in a new movie .
The Veteran Feminists of America were among Borat 's victims
Ms Stein , with two other members of Veteran Feminists of America , agreed to be filmed for what they thought was a documentary to help third world women .
But then the reporter started talking about his wife 's farm work ( " she pulls the plough " ) , women walking three steps behind men ( " it used to be 10 steps , my country is advancing " ) and asking how to contact Pamela Anderson .
" I thought I was talking to an uneducated man , maybe from a tribal community , " Ms Stein says .
" I mean , that 's how it seemed to me .
" In our earnestness , we were trying to help women around the world . "
Shocking and provocative
Ms Stein is not alone in being duped by Baron Cohen .
The British comedian has perfected his act as the apparently naive reporter whose enthusiastic offensiveness either leaves his interviewees in shock or persuades them to reveal a little too much of their own prejudices .
And the result is set to be one of the year 's most popular films .
I 'm a New Yorker , all sorts of things happen in New York - I 'm not angry
Linda Stein
Artist
They would be told about the foreign correspondent making a film about life in the US , with the pitch tailored to each person 's specialist subject .
Then on the day of the interview , they would be presented with a release form at the last minute , be paid in cash and , finally , Borat would amble in , beginning with some serious subjects before starting his provocative routine .
" We 're all primed to do an academic dissertation , we did our homework , " says yoga teacher Grace Welch , another member of the three - strong feminist panel .
" And as we 're talking , out of the blue , he says : ' Do you know Baywatch ? '
Borat gave his own rendition of the US national anthem at a rodeo
Ms Stein first tried to throw Borat out when he started talking about women having smaller brains than men .
The producer persuaded her to carry on , apologetically explaining that Borat did not realise he was saying anything wrong .
But the final straw came when Borat asked the women to lift up their shirts at the end of the interview .
' Mixed feelings '
" I 've seen the film and parts of it were hilarious , " Ms Stein says .
" As an interviewee , I have had a lot of mixed feelings about it .
" I thought about it , I worried about it , and then felt I have to get back to my work .
I just have to move on .
I 'm a New Yorker , all sorts of things happen in New York .
I 'm not angry . "
But the artist , whose sculptures represent " empowerment and strength " , wants to ask Baron Cohen why his art " zooms in on human weaknesses and foibles " .
Public speaking coach Pat Haggerty saw the funny side of Borat
She has invited him to her exhibition , which begins on 2 November - the day before the film is released .
" He owes me one and he should buy a sculpture . "
Washington DC public speaking coach Pat Haggerty also appears - and is seen trying to teach humour to Borat , who talks about having sex with his mother - in - law and keeping his " retard " brother in a cage .
" About halfway through the session we took a break and I went up to one of the producers and said : ' This guy ca n't be real .
" ' If you let me in on the gag , I will help you reach your goals because I do n't care if you 're from Kazakhstan , nobody is this crazy . '
" But I soldiered on and figured they paid me my money and they deserve an hour of my time and I 'm going to be as professional as I can . "
To the best of my memory I do n't believe I said anything stupid - however , I 'm in the movie
Pat Haggerty
Public speaking coach
Mr Haggerty says he is having " a lot of fun " with his new - found fame and hopes it raises his professional profile .
He has not yet seen the film - but hopes he did not say anything he will regret .
" To the best of my memory I do n't believe I said anything stupid .
However , I 'm in the movie .
The only downside I see is if I appear to be a fool . "
Movie ' mess '
One person who is likely to regret the day he met Borat is Tennessee rodeo manager Bobby Rowe , who is cajoled by the comedian into making disparaging remarks about Muslims and homosexuals .
A phone call to Mr Rowe and an enquiry about whether he is the person in the movie elicits a slow , painful reply : " Yeah , I 'm the same one . "
But he says he has been stung by his experiences .
" I got into this mess by someone calling me and telling me who they was and they were n't , " he says .
" And so I do n't do any interviews over the dadgum phone any more .
This phone rings 10 - 12 times a day .
" That 's what got me into this mess and I do n't want to get in any deeper . "
The value of the dollar has been on a downward spiral
The euro traded as high as $ 1.4348 , breaking its last record set on Friday when one euro bought $ 1.4319 .
The sell - off was triggered on Friday by a profit warning from building equipment giant Caterpillar , prompting concerns over the slowing US economy .
But the dollar bounced back to trade at $ 1.4181 against the euro bloc 's currency at the close of trade .
The greenback also slipped to a six - week low againt the Japanese yen on Monday , touching 113.25 yen at one point , but gained against the British pound to trade at $ 2.0322 after initial falls .
The dollar could weaken further if the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates again at its meeting at the end of the month , making the US currency less attractive for income seekers .
Meanwhile , the strong euro is a threat to exporters , such as Airbus owner EADS , and to the wider region 's economy , which has just started to recover after years in the doldrums .
Suffering continues
The latest falls come after a joint International Monetary Fund and World Bank meeting in Washington last Friday , which ended without any reference to the weakness of the US dollar or the strength of the 13 - member Euro bloc 's currency .
Analysts say this apparent indifference suggests central bankers have no intention of interfering in this area of the currency market , a cue for investors to carry on selling dollars .
They believe that the US Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates further at this month 's meeting from their current level of 4.75 % to lift the economy , which is showing increasing signs of suffering from a slump in house prices and higher credit costs .
At its September meeting , policymakers cut rates from 5.25 % to 4.75 % .
Yet , at the same time , traders have become more averse to risky investments and have started selling global equities that they bought with money borrowed from countries such as Japan , where the interest rate is 0.5 % .
As the use of this strategy comes to an end , currencies that generate a higher income than the Japanese yen , including the euro , dollar and sterling , will all feel the pressure .
If you like the Real Thing better made with real sugar and you happen to live near a Costco , you 'll be happy to know that they 're selling Mexican Coke : $ 17.99 for a case of 24 twelve ounce bottles , which comes out to 75 c each .
How'd Costco manage that , you ask ?
According to SFist , they 've " conformed to CA and U.S. rules , such as CRV ( the sort - of deposit you pay for the bottle ) and " nutrition " labeling , so everything appears to be nice and legal . "
Coca -Cola Corporate in Atlanta says there is " no perceptible taste difference " between Mexican Coke made with real sugar and US Coke made with high - fructose corn syrup , but as anyone who 's ever had the two can tell you , that 's wishful thinking — drinks made with real sugar have a clean sweetness and light mouthfeel to them , while those made with corn syrup have heavy mouthfeel and a cloying sweetness .
Do n't believe me ?
A commenter on Jason Perlow 's post on Passover Coke ( made in the US with real sugar for the holiday ) said he'd brought back real sugar Coke from Nicaragua and did blind taste tests with friends and family : " We used purified ice , cold bottle cokes with Sugar & HFCS and a rinse of purified water between taste .
EVERYONE - to a person - can taste a difference and all prefer the sugar !
Nearly half of the people were very sceptical , and said it was in our heads .
They said “ I remember that taste ” , and “ WOW , that IS better ! ” [ via YumSugar ]

Many workers had extensive burns from the hot bricks
Eight workers were so traumatised by their experiences that they were only able to remember their names .
The labourers had to work unpaid for 20 hours at a time , and were only given bread and water in return .
The brickworks , in the poor inland province of Shanxi , is owned by the son of the local Communist Party secretary .
Local police told the BBC that the owner , Wang Binbin , had been arrested , and that his father , Wang Dongji , was under investigation .
Several other people have also been arrested , although the foreman is still on the run .
Harsh regime
According to a report in the Beijing News , citing the Shanxi Evening News , the rescued workers had been duped into working at the factory .
Once there , they faced a harsh regime .
One man was even reported to have been beaten to death with a hammer , because he did not work fast enough .
The workers were only given bread and water
They had no facilities to wash , and they had not had their hair cut or brushed their teeth .
" The grime on their bodies was so thick it could be scraped off with a knife , " the Beijing News said .
They had burns over their bodies after being made to carry bricks that had not cooled down properly .
Police are now arranging for the workers to get the wages they should have been paid , and then they will send them home , although the eight disorientated workers cannot remember where that is .
Local people said the brickworks , near Linfen , would have been closed down a long time ago had it not been for the protection of the party secretary .
China has tens of millions of migrant workers .
They leave their rural homes in search of work , but often have to endure harsh conditions , bad treatment and low pay .
There is little they can do about their lot , particularly when , as in this case , factory owners are protected by powerful local officials .
[ The bad news is , the article that used to be here has now gone .
The good news is , it ’s gone because the case of the swap that never was has now been resolved .
I see no point in subjecting our errant swapper to yet more public exposure so I ’ve pulled the original article ]
While only three bad swaps have occurred since Swopster started up , it bugged me that some swaps had gone somehow gone wrong and , although folks do swap at their own risk on the site , I still felt bad for the folks who were getting messed around .
So , over the past month or so , I ’ve been busy playing internet detective and tracking down the rogue swappers – those guys who refused to respond to e-mails and were n’t completing / canceling their swaps .
I ’m happy to report that all 3 rogue swaps have now been resolved :
# 1 Disputed game returned to original owner # 2 Both swap games sent to innocent swapper # 3 Fraudster tracked down , real name and address provided to innocent swapper ( who wants to resolve this himself )
The 3 members who broke the terms and conditions of the site have had their accounts disabled and been banned .
One even made it onto Reddit.com for his 15 minutes of … ummm … ’ fame ’ .
It really does baffle me how folks think they can get away with some of the unreasonable and irresponsible behaviour so aptly demonstrated in these cases .
Just remember , all members need to provide the following critical details before they can begin swapping :
Name
Email
Address
With those three items of information , tracking them down is ridiculously easy .
Its like fishing with dynamite .
One guy even tried using a throwaway e-mail address , a fake name , his friends address , and then changed all his details to yet more fake details after the swap .
And I still managed to find him .
Hopefully I wo n’t need to publicly shame anyone else in the future … just abide by the rules , be respectful , be honest and you ’ll have absolutely nothing to worry about .

English Special - tank duel at the cathedral ( 1 )
Deutsch Cologne , Germany , March 6 , 1945 .
The 3rd Armored Division tanks advance on the Cologne center and the cathedral .
It 's about 2 pm .
The following minutes will produce some of the most dramatic combat images to come out of WWII .
This page will show you the famous tank battle at the Cologne cathedral .
Coming from western city districts , passing the city areas around Venloer Strasse , Friesenplatz , Friesenstrasse and Zeughausstrasse , a group of several US - tanks approach the central square in front of the cathedral .
Big mountains of rubble on the Komödienstrasse prevent the further advance of the tank group .
They have to stop only 120 m / 395 ft away from the place where the street leads into the central square .
Image montage : the US - tanks approaching the cathedral square can not be overlooked by the Germans .
On the Komödienstraße there is a lot of debris , but the cupolas of two tanks surpass the debris .
1 . ) Skirmish Panther vs. Sherman
One M4A1W76 Sherman tank ( right ) and one M4A3W75 Sherman tank ( left ) from F Co , 32nd A.R. , 3rd AD are standing on Komödienstrasse next to street Andreaskloster ( at the left side ) .
Suddenly a shell from a German Panther tank hits the leading US tank .
Then a second one hits .
A member of the crew , tank commander Kellner , tries to flee out of the tank .
Two hits in the area of the gun shield .
On the two left pictures in color the area in which the shield was deformed or blown off .
The picture on the right shows a view from obliquely behind .
You can see very well the demolition edge in the upper part .
In the lower part one can guess the missing piece of the shield .
Where did the shots from come ?
There 's a picture taken by George Silk when the battle at the cathedral was over .
It shows the Sherman and in background the german Panther , which had hit the Sherman .
On the right side there 's the Sherman and in background the burning Panther at street crossing Marzellenstrasse .
He is really good to see there .
Excerpt of a picture made by George Silk , Life Magazin
And now a comparison with movie sequences before and after the hits :
In the background there 's no Panther shortly before ( right ) and shortly after the hit ( left ) , where one can see the Panther on the Silk photo later .
So , where was the Panther located when he had hit the Sherman ?
Video - Popup :
Here are the original movie scenes I took the still photos from and I zoomed the area where the Panther later stood with my video software .
They show , he was n't located there at the time he hit the Sherman .
In the background one can see a tunnel under the central station .
It 's the street tunnel Trankgasse .
When the Panther had shot he probably was located in or near the dark tunnel ( white arrow ) and the US troops were not able to see it there before .
The red point is the place where the Sherman was located - distance tunnel / Sherman : 340 m / 1.115 ft..
After the hit the Panther was driving to the crossing Marzellenstrasse where he later was destroyed ( distance Panther there / Sherman : 120 m / 395 ft..
There are records saying the Panther was already located at the crossing when the Sherman reached Komödienstrasse and they thought it was knocked out .
But this seems to be unrealistic .
Tank crews typically will not take it for granted that a tank in no mans land would be knocked out .
They would shoot at it until it burned , which is what the Sherman crew would have done if the Panther was in sight on the crossing Marzellenstrasse .
Following several sources the German tank Mark V ( Panther ) Ausf .
A was from Panzerbrigade 106 " Feldherrnhalle " .
Back to the Sherman in Komödienstrasse after the hits :
The tank smokes from the inside .
One hit had cut off the soldier 's left leg below the knee .

Kellner 's injury , nothing for sensitive people
Behind the tank commander Kellner , who is creeping out , a second soldier falls down from the tank
The second soldier seems to be 19 years old Corporal ' Gunner ' John J Gialluca of the 3rd Armored Division ' Spearhead ' .
His son
Doug found my site on the web and sent me the following mail where he describes the situation as he heard it from his father :
The last tank battle in Cologne Germany on March 6 1945 happened as Corporal Gunner John J Gialluca approached the square of town between two buildings where suddenly by surprise a Panther Mark V hit their Sherman tank .
John remembers the tank burning and they were trapped .
The shrapnel went through his legs and he said he was pinned to his seat when a second blast under the turret forced him free from his position .
There were no other survivors except Corporal John J Gialluca .
There was another tank disabled next to his tank that tried to help the injured .
They found John lying on the ground with his 45 caliber hand gun in his hand .
Then John said as they were helping him he could hear the blast and gunfire from what is known now the battle of the last tank .
The Sherman tank that Corporal John J Gialluca was in was facing the cannon of the 75 mm high velocity Panther Mark V .
The 76 mm is questionable as for penetrating the heavy armored Panther head to head .
This was John 's second tank hit in his journey from Normandy Beach and very fortunate to survive .
Corporal Gunner John J Gialluca was sent to a hospital in England where he had a lengthy recovery and was able to walk again .
After a long fight with kidney cancer John went to be with the Lord on July 5th 1998 .
Contrary to the memory of John J Gialluca there 's another crew member who survives the attack too , it 's Oliver Griffin , the assistant driver .
So the Sherman crew was :
Tank Commander Kellner
Gunner Gialluca
Asst. Gunner Speer
Driver Patrick
Asst. Driver Griffin
Once again the exit of Gialluca :
At the beginning of the movie scene Gialluca is already located on top of the cupola .
One can see the torso and the head .
Then - picture top middle - Gialluca wants to jump down from the tank , showing his bottom .
Next pictures : he jumps down headfirst , one can see his legs stretched upwards .

Another detail :
When Kellner leaves the cupola he holds a rifle in his hand .
But he loses it and the rifle falls down onto the street next to the Sherman .

What happened the last minutes before the upcoming tank duel ?
The US troops are only 200 - 300 m away from Marzellenstraße which leads to the central place at the cathedral where the German Panther tank now is located .
US Army Signal Corps cameraman Jim Bates wants to film the upcoming tank duel .

A Tank Commander named Robert Early from E Company 32nd .
Armored Regiment went on foot to investigate .
I asked to go along and we went on the mezzanine of a building and saw the tank .
He told me to stay there and he would come back in his tank and try to put the German tank out of commission and I could photograph it .
He had one of the new M - 26 Pershings with a ninety - mm gun .
Sgt. Early said he would turn into the square under me , stop and fire at the German tank .

This is the building of the Deutsche Arbeitsfront , where Bates and Early watched the German tank and the surroundings .
At this time the German Tank crew is waiting what happens and observes the surroundings .
View today from the window where Bates took his famous movie .
The blue dot was the place of the Panther was lying in wait for the enemy .
Red dot the place where the US - troops were waiting in Street An den Dominikanern .
When Early comes back to his tank he gives last instructions to his crew and starts the mission .
The Pershing tank approaches the crossing An den Dominikanern / Marzellenstraße .
Jim Bates :
When his tank came in the square under me the German tank began to traverse the gun .
Pershing gunner Cpl. Clarence Smoyer :
" Gunner " Clarence Smoyer :
Shortly before our T26 " Pershing " tank destroyed the German Mark V Panther tank in the Cologne Cathedral square , the same German tank destroyed one of our Sherman tanks and killed three of its crew .
When this happened , our crew was ordered to go down the adjacent street and destroy the Panther .
We were told to just move into the intersection far enough to fire into the side of the enemy tank , which had its gun facing up the other street .
However , as we entered the intersection , our driver had his periscope turned toward the Panther and saw their gun turning to meet us .
When I turned our turret , I was looking into the Panther 's gun tube ; so instead of stopping to fire , our driver drove into the middle of the intersection so we would n't be a sitting target .

This is the sight that an observer might have had in this moment .
The two tanks were facing .
The panther is lurking in the background and in the foreground the Pershing moves into the intersection .
Both tanks are in direct visual contact now .
The first shot now will decide the fate of the other tank , the fate of five soldiers and their families .
What 's the reason the Panther did n't shot immediately ?
As the Pershing gunner Smoyer said , the gun was turning to meet the Pershing .
What 's the reason the Panther crew hesitated ?
Panther commander Bartelborth is already dead , so you can not ask him .
His daughter , however , told in the documentary " Köln 1945 Nahaufnahmen " that her father had told the family during his lifetime , the tank that had appeared in that situation on the street corner , would have been a German tank .
He probably expected a Sherman tank and the tank was not a Sherman tank .
So he was very surprised .
And so it is clear that Bartelborth had not give the order to fire because he did not recognize the Pershing as an American tank immediately .
A German tank commander did not recognize an American tank ?
Well , the Pershing had his first appearance in Europe only a few weeks previously , and only in small numbers .
Many soldiers did not know this new tank type .
The flow of information at this time , near the end of the war , was not comparable with the present times .
Gunner Smoyer writes in his memoirs on the 3ad.com website : " U.S. troops and German civilians were in awe of seeing the M26 .
Some troops thought it was a captured German tank . "
Quelle : 3ad.com Even American soldiers mixed up the Pershing with a German tank sometimes !
Thus , it is not so far - fetched that even the German tank commander Bartelborth was wrong in thinking ...
In any case this delay is crucial for the fate of the German tank .
Fractions of seconds decide between life and death .

Disgruntled fans of Sheffield Wednesday who vented their dissatisfaction with the football club 's bigwigs in anonymous internet postings may face expensive libel claims after the chairman , chief executive and five directors won a high - court ruling last week forcing the owner of a website to reveal their identity .
The case , featuring the website owlstalk.co.uk , is the second within days to highlight the danger of assuming that the apparent cloak of anonymity gives users of internet forums and chatrooms carte blanche to say whatever they like .
In another high court case last week , John Finn , owner of the Sunderland property firm Pallion Housing , admitted just before he was due to be cross -examined that he was responsible for a website hosting a scurrilous internet campaign about a rival housing organisation , Gentoo Group , its employees and owner , Peter Walls .
Exposing the identity of those who post damaging lies in cyberspace is a growth area for libel lawyers .
Dan Tench , of Olswang , the law firm representing Gentoo , said : " This case illustrates an increasingly important legal issue : proving who is responsible for the publication of anonymous material on the internet .
This is likely to be a significant issue in defamation cases in the future . "
The website Dadsplace , set up to campaign against perceived injustices in the family courts , had a forum where anonymous postings made various accusations against Gentoo , Mr Walls and his staff .
Those posting the comments went to considerable lengths to hide their identity , and Gentoo 's lawyers ran up a bill estimated to be about £ 300,000 - which Mr Finn will now have to pick up , along with any damages awarded - taking the case to court and amassing circumstantial evidence that he was behind the website .
Revealing the Sheffield Wednesday fans was comparatively easy since there was no secret about the website owner .
The next move was to apply for a court order requiring him to reveal the identities of " Halfpint " and the other fans behind what the club 's lawyers described as a " sustained campaign of vilification " .
Fans made serious allegations against the club 's chairman , Dave Allen , and directors and shareholders .
The club 's lawyers asked the judge , Richard Parkes QC , to order disclosure about the identity of 11 fans .
But the judge decided some fans , whose postings were merely " abusive " or likely to be understood as jokes , should keep their anonymity .
The judge ordered that three fans whose postings might " reasonably be understood to allege greed , selfishness , untrustworthiness and dishonest behaviour " , should be unmasked .
Their right to maintain their anonymity and express themselves freely was outweighed by the directors ' entitlement to take action to protect their reputation , he said .
Court orders obliging websites to disclose the identity of users posting anonymous defamatory remarks began in 2001 .
Dominic Bray , of K&L Gates , Sheffield Wednesday 's solicitors , said : " There seem to be quite a lot of websites that are using their anonymity to make comments about people and think that there should n't be any liability for it .
But the internet is no different to any other place of publication , and if somebody is making defamatory comments about people then they should be held responsible for it .
What these cases do is just confirm that 's the law - the law applies to the internet as much as it does to anything else . "
Alicia 18 College Library Afternoon Part 2
Posted by : Alicia
Hey guys , Im back in class , and found a few shots left over from my last library shoot , thought you might like them .
I promise to be posting more , and soon as well .
Sorry for the summer delay , but Im starting classes again , have more time to post .
I am considering doing a friends of VW site of my own , anybody interested ?
At the end of a disastrous week for the White House , which culminated in the indictment and resignation of senior aide Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby , Bush and senior Republicans launched a counter - offensive in a bid to regain the political initiative .
Republican leaders and commentators hailed the fact that Bush 's political guru , Karl Rove , had not been indicted in the Plamegate scandal - which concerns the leaking of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame - as a sign that the worst is over .
' The wrongdoing leads in no way beyond this one individual [ Libby ] and what he allegedly said to FBI investigators and the grand jury , ' said William Kristol , editor of the Conservative ' bible ' , The Weekly Standard
At the same time Bush used his weekly radio address yesterday to hail the ' great sacrifice ' of American soldiers who had died in Iraq .
' The best way to honour the sacrifice of our fallen troops is to complete the mission and win the war on terror , ' he said .
His comments came as three more American soldiers were killed in Iraq to add to a toll that has already passed 2,000 since the invasion in 2003 .
In the wake of Libby 's indictment , the Republican strategy appears to be to try and put the Plamegate probe , which is led by Chicago prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald , behind them .
The message coming from Republicans is that Libby is the only person to be indicted , and even he was only charged for trying to cover up his story later .
Libby 's lawyers seem to be preparing a defence based around Libby having a faulty memory of events and conversations rather than being involved in a deliberate conspiracy .
' We recognise that a person 's recollection and memory of events will not always match those of other people , particularly when they are asked to testify months after the events occurred , ' said his attorney , Joseph Tate .
Bush has spent this weekend at his Camp David retreat mulling a possible choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court .
A strongly conservative anti-abortion candidate would go a long way to healing the rift with Bush 's right - wing base and provide a vital fillip during the darkest times of Bush 's five years in the White House .
However , that might not be easy .
Reports have said that only last - minute talks and fresh evidence from Rove 's legal team stopped Fitzgerald from indicting the president 's most powerful adviser .
Rove has also been identified as the mysterious ' Official A ' in Libby 's indictment who talked about Plame to conservative columnist Robert Novak .
Rove 's lawyer has also issued a statement saying that , while he has not been told he will be indicted in the future , neither has he been told he will not be .
However even if Rove is not indicted , he and a host of other officials are likely to be called as witnesses in Libby 's coming criminal trial .
Testimony is also likely to be sought from Libby 's boss , Vice - President Dick Cheney , who Fitzgerald discovered discussed Plame with Libby .
At the same time , Plame 's husband , former ambassador Joe Wilson , whose anti-war views are believed by many to be the reason Plame was outed , has spoken of his wife being threatened .
' There have been specific threats , ' he told a television interviewer .
Wilson also attacked the Bush administration in a column in the Los Angeles Times published yesterday , saying that the White House had sought to smear him and his wife for trying to tell the truth about the abuse of intelligence on Saddam Hussein 's nuclear ambitions in the run- up to the invasion of Iraq .
' The attacks on Valerie and me were upsetting , disruptive and vicious , ' he said .
' They amounted to character assassination .
Senior administration officials used the power of the White House to make our lives hell . '
Led Zeppelin sold more than 100 million albums in the US alone
The Led Zeppelin legend
Singer Robert Plant , guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones will play at the show to remember the late Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun .
The one - off concert , the trio's first performance for 19 years , will take place at the O2 arena on 26 November .
Tickets will cost £ 125 and be allocated by ballot .
Pete Townshend , Bill Wyman and Paolo Nutini will also perform .
Ertegun , who signed Led Zeppelin in 1968 , died last year .
This performance stands alone as a tribute to the work and life of a longstanding friend
Robert Plant
Plant on reunion
Plant said : " During the Zeppelin years , Ahmet Ertegun was a major foundation of solidarity and accord .
" For us , he was Atlantic Records and remained a close friend and conspirator .
This performance stands alone as a tribute to the work and life of a longstanding friend . "
The news is likely to spark a huge rush for tickets as devoted fans scramble to get into what could be the band 's last show .
I will auction off my blood , organs , and all worldly possessions - think I 'm kidding ?

With their pounding , blues - influenced anthems and explosive stadium shows , Led Zeppelin paved the way for artists across the worlds of heavy metal and alternative rock .
Their best - known songs include Stairway to Heaven , Whole Lotta Love , Rock and Roll , Kashmir and Communication Breakdown - although they never released singles in the UK .
Led Zeppelin's last full concert was in Berlin in July 1980 - two months before John Bonham died .
' Whole set '
Robert Plant ( left ) and Jimmy Page recorded together in the 1990s
But a rift between Jones and the other two band members opened after Page and Plant started working together without him in the 1990s .
Rumours of a reconciliation surfaced several years ago , leading to speculation about a reunion .
Harvey Goldsmith , who is promoting the concert , said that he had originally asked the three band members to play a 30 - minute set .
" Jason Bonham became part of the catalyst , and they did a week 's rehearsal , " he said .
" We had a meeting and Robert turned around and said we 're not going to do 30 minutes , we 're doing to do a whole set . "
" It 's a day I never thought would come , " said Dave Lewis , editor of Led Zeppelin fan magazine Tight But Loose .
" The four people on stage in 2007 - wake me up , I 'm dreaming ! "
The concert coincides with the release of a new two - CD best of compilation , Mothership , on 13 November .
Profits from the show will go towards scholarships in Ertegun 's name in UK , the USA and Turkey , the country of his birth .
His wife Mica said : " He would be very proud that Led Zeppelin have chosen to reunite and headline a benefit concert in his name featuring so many of his friends .

Goldsmith said Ertegun " became a friend and was my mentor " .
" Our industry deeply misses such a giant of music , " he said .
" It is a fitting tribute that these great artists have all come together to perform in his memory . "
He also warned that tickets being sold on the black market would be cancelled .
Paolo Nutini , Ertegun 's last UK signing , went on to score a hit album last year .
" He touched my life with his amazing personality and opened a few doors when I was starting my career , " he said .
" He was a special guy , a real gentleman and it's such a shame he 's gone but a massive tribute that all his music lives on - and will do forever . "

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
About 1 in 5 Americans in working families can't afford basic needs , and many are scraping to get by on insufficient income and government aid , policy researchers conclude in a report released Wednesday .
Many of these workers earn too much to qualify for " work supports " such as Medicaid and food stamps , while their employer - provided health insurance does n't cover enough of their basic medical costs , according to the report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Center for Social Policy at the University of Massachusetts .
" We no longer live in a world where having a job means you 're automatically able to make ends meet , " said Heather Boushey , co-author of the report .
" Our work - support policies need to be updated to support the millions of families with earners in bad jobs . "
About 41 million people in working families can't afford such basic necessities as health care and housing , according to the report .
The study , which examined conditions in nine states and the District of Columbia , found that government programs close abut two - fifths of the " hardships gap " -- a measure of the difference between a family 's income , including all aid programs , and the local costs of goods and services .
" Families fall into the hardships gap because the low - wage labor market provides meager pay and few employment - based work supports for low - and moderate - wage workers , " the report noted .
The report 's authors recommend steps such as focusing on better wages and mandates for employers to provide employment - based benefits , and simplifying the eligibility criteria and application requirements for work supports .
" Public policy has not caught up to the reality that even working families may need public work supports , " the authors wrote .
" Without public work supports , they and their families go without health insurance , adequate child care , safe housing , or other necessities .
Many of those in the hardships gap earn too much , or do not meet other eligibility criteria , to qualify for work supports , even through they are low - income . "
In 2005 , about one - fifth of workers were in " bad jobs " -- those that paid less than the median wage in 1979 in inflation - adjusted dollars , and did not offer health insurance or a retirement plan , according to the report .
Employer - based benefits are good for people with access to them , but most low - wage workers are n't offered or can't afford them , the report said .
" While workers with moderate or high earnings commonly receive health insurance , paid time off , and retirement plans , low - wage workers most often do not , " the report noted .
The median monthly hardship gap for families in the states covered by the report was $ 1,524 .
After work supports , that gap decreased to $ 855 .
Therefore , the typical family with a hardships gap sees a savings of about $ 8,000 in work supports .
" However , we find that many low - income working families are either ineligible for work supports , or do not receive the supports to which they are entitled , " the authors wrote .
Part of the problem is that the work supports do n't reach all who are eligible due to a complex registration process and a lack of resources .
Boushey said government financial aid programs could draw a lesson from the earned income tax credit , which has a relatively straightforward system for eligible recipients to receive benefits .
Students who participated in the first year of the District of Columbia ’s federally financed school voucher program did not show significantly higher math or reading achievement , but their parents were satisfied anyway , viewing the private schools they attended at taxpayer expense as safer and better than public schools , according to an Education Department study released yesterday .
The students themselves painted a picture different from that of their parents , though , feeling neither more satisfied nor safer than did students attending public schools .
“ The program had a substantial positive impact on parents ’ views of school safety , but not on students ’ actual school experiences with dangerous activities , ” the study said .
A Republican - controlled Congress established the voucher program , for Grades K through 12 , in 2004 .
Over the last three years it has provided scholarships of up to $ 7,500 annually to cover tuition , fees and transportation expenses for each of about 1,800 poor children to attend private school .
About 90 percent of the participating students have been African - American , and an additional 9 percent Hispanic , according to the Congressionally mandated study .
Mr. Lyons said he invented the Fake Steve character last year , when a small group of chief executives turned bloggers attracted some media attention .
He noticed that they rarely spoke candidly .
“ I thought , would n’t it be funny if a C.E.O. kept a blog that really told you what he thought ?
That was the gist of it . ”
Mr. Lyons says he recalled trying out the voices of several chief executives before settling on the colorful Apple co-founder .
He twice tried to relinquish the blog , but started again after being deluged by fans e-mailing to ask why Fake Steve had disappeared .
Though many speculators have guessed Fake Steve was an Apple insider , Mr. Lyons says he has never interviewed Mr. Jobs nor written a story about the company .
“ I have zero sources inside Apple , ” he said .
“ I had to go out and get books and biographies to learn about a lot of the back story . ”
Mr. Lyons said writing as Fake Steve became addictive .
He developed a unique lexicon and catalog of insults for the character .
Bill Gates is Beastmaster , and Eric E. Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , is Squirrel Boy .
Last month , when a reader asked Fake Steve about Apple ’s succession plan , he replied : “ My plan at this time is to live forever and to remain in charge here , though perhaps with fewer restrictions on my power .
The truth is , I am not human — I am a man - god , son of Zeus , born to mortal woman but fathered by the ruler of the gods , lord of thunder . ”
Mr. Lyons receives around 50 e-mail messages a day through the blog , many with ideas for posts , and says the site had 700,000 visitors last month .
Recently someone claiming to be Mr. Jobs ’s daughter , Lisa , wrote to tell him , “ You do n’t sound at all like my father , but your blog is hilarious . ”
Story Highlights • Astronaut Wally Schirra was the fifth American in space and third to orbit Earth
• Schirra , one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts , dies in California at 84
• Schirra was only astronaut to fly on the Mercury , Gemini and Apollo missions
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Wally Schirra , one of the original astronauts in the Mercury 7 project , died Thursday at age 84 , NASA officials said .
Schirra died in California , the officials said .
He was the fifth American in space and the third to orbit Earth .
He was the only astronaut who flew in three of the nation 's pioneering space programs : Mercury , Gemini and Apollo .
NASA selected Schirra as one of the first group of astronauts , along with Gordon Cooper , Scott Carpenter , John Glenn , Alan Shepard , Gus Grissom and Deke Slayton .
( Space pioneer history )
He flew on the fifth Project Mercury flight , orbiting the Earth six times on October 3 , 1962 , and was commander of the Gemini 6 flight , which launched December 15 , 1965 .
( Watch why Schirra had " the right stuff " -- but hated the movie )
Schirra was commander of Apollo 7 , the first manned flight of the Apollo spacecraft and the Saturn 1B rocket .
He and crew mates Walter Cunningham and Donn Eisele successfully checked all the Apollo systems during the 11 - day mission that launched October 11 , 1968 .
The Apollo 7 mission qualified the spacecraft for later moon missions .
Schirra retired from the Navy and NASA in 1969 .
He co-authored " The Real Space Cowboys " with Ed Buckbee , a former NASA public affairs officer and the first executive director of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center .
The book highlights the Mercury astronauts and their contribution to the U.S. space program .
CNN 's Rich Phillips contributed to this report .
After reading some of the excellent comments on this post , we decided to test this again from 30 miles away ... and it did n't work .
We 're going to retest at a different location but similar distance to see what gave us the positive test .
Stay tuned .
About a month ago my brother sent me an email explaining that if a friend or family member has the second key fob for your car , you can call them up on your cell phone , ask them to hold the key fob up to the phone , press the unlock button , and your car door will unlock .
In theory , the sound waves from the key fob , which are unintelligible to the human ear , will be transmitted via the cell phone , and the doors will unlock .
Well , we 've seen enough spam emails before that were full of it , but we decided to see for ourselves if this works .
When we tested this theory , we were stunned to find out that it actually works .
I was so excited that I pulled out the wife and daughter outside to shoot a quick video on the front lawn .
Before getting this on camera , we tested it five times , and it worked every time but one .
There was a lot of traffic during the one failed test , so our best guess is that the noise from the passing cars negated the sound from the key fob signal .
Mad props to the wife for getting eaten alive by bugs and keeping the camera still at the same time ( for the most part ) .
Hit the jump to check it out , it 's pretty damn cool .
Test this out with a friend or spouse , too , and let us know if it worked for you .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
It does n't look to me as if there will be a recession - at least not a major recession - from the subprime problems or the credit crunch or any of that panic on Wall Street .
But there are effects rippling all over the place right here and now , and some of them are not what you might expect ( though some are ) .

My dear friend B is a broker for super - luxury homes in Scottsdale .
He used to be perpetually out of breath from hustling around that lush area showing immense houses and depositing huge checks .
" Now , " he says , " I go into the office on Saturdays and Sundays , and I 'm literally the only person there .
There are dozens of empty cubicles , but their phones never ring .
Never .
Not once all weekend .
It 's as if I were down in the desert 100 miles from here .
That 's how quiet it is . "
" Why do you bother going in at all ? " I ask .
" If I do n't , " he says , " there 's a 100 % chance nothing will happen .
At least here by the phone , there 's a chance . "
Item : I , your humble servant , am negotiating to buy a condo in Sandpoint in magnificent , super - beautiful northern Idaho .
The day I made my first offer , I read a piece in the New York Times that seemed to say that jumbo loans were either unavailable or available only at rates in the range of 13 % .
That same day my mortgage broker offered me a 30 - year jumbo at 6 7/8 % .
She said she had money to lend and could do the thing in two weeks .
The next day two more lenders called and offered me the same deal .
Do n't believe everything you read in the papers .

In between are ads for mortgages .

One of my best friends , a blue - eyed , red - haired stunner and a math whiz , is married to a builder and mortgage broker near Naples , Fla .
She flew into town , and I had lunch with her today .
" How is your husband taking all this stuff ? " I asked her .
" He does n't sleep .
At most he sleeps from 5 A.M. to 7 A.M.
We built two spec homes near Naples .
We spent $ 2.7 million on each of them .
We had them listed for $ 4 million each .
We have n't had one prospect in a year .
We lowered the price by a million each .
Still no prospects .
We 're losing $ 60,000 a month on the two of them .
My husband has no business .
None .
The phone never rings . "
" Horrible , " I said .
" I'm leaving him , " she said .
" He 's grouchy all the time .
I want a guy who 's rich and cheerful all day and all night .
Why should I have to suffer because his business is bad ? "
" He 's your husband , " I said .
" You have to stick by him . "
" Why ?
I want to laugh and have fun , and he's in a bad mood for months on end .
I did n't make this mortgage mess , and I do n't see why I should have to suffer for it . "
" It wo n't last , " I said .
" It never does . "
She suddenly looked much more upbeat .
" How long until the market turns around ? " she asked expectantly .
" Maybe six years , " I said .
She looked staggered .
" That 's it , " she sighed .
" I want you to start looking for a rich husband for me who 's going to stay rich no matter what .
Tell him I 'll be a really great wife . "
( She has a killer sense of humor so I am praying she 's kidding . )
Twenty - four hours later , as I was driving to Malibu from Beverly Hills , I was called by a woman friend of 37 years who is a psychologist and marriage and family counselor in a suburb of Philadelphia .
I told her the story about my friend who 's planning to look for a richer husband .
She gasped .
" That could be a disaster , " she said firmly .
" Because she 's breaking up her family over money ? "
" No , because what if she leaves him and the mortgage market and the spec home market suddenly turn around and he gets rich again and then she can't find anyone as rich to marry next ? "
" Good thinking , " I said .
" You have to be realistic , " she answered .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House chief of staff faced possible contempt charges after a congressional panel on Thursday ruled as invalid President George W. Bush ’s bid to limit the probe of the firing of federal prosecutors .
White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten speaks during a press briefing at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington , February 7 , 2005 .
Bolten faced possible contempt charges after a congressional panel on Thursday rejected President George W. Bush 's attempt to limit the probe of the firing of federal prosecutors .

On a party - line vote of 7 - 3 , a Democratic - led House of Representatives Judiciary subcommittee rejected Bush ’s contention that his claim of executive privilege shields the top aide , Joshua Bolten , from having to turn over subpoenaed documents .
“ Those claims are not legally valid , ” said panel Chairwoman Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat .
Sanchez said she hoped the White House would yield and produce the documents , but the administration accused Congress of pushing for a courtroom showdown .
The administration says its firing of nine of the 93 U.S. attorneys last year were justified .
But critics say the ousters were politically motivated , perhaps even to influence ongoing criminal probes of Democratic or Republican lawmakers .
“ We are hopeful that the White House will come to the conclusion that it is better for them to cooperate than continue this confrontation , ” Sanchez said .
Last week the panel moved toward contempt proceedings against former White House counsel Harriet Miers after she declined to appear at a hearing .
It rejected Bush ’s claim that Miers did not have to show up .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said , “ It ’s unfortunate that the committee continues down this path , rather than accepting our offer of accommodation . ”
“ It ’s no wonder that the committee is less successful at getting facts than headlines , ” Fratto added .
“ That a president should be able to receive candid and confidential advice from his aides rests on solid legal ground . ”
While the White House has refused to provide documents , it has offered to permit former and current aides to talk with lawmakers behind closed doors -- but without a transcript and not under oath .
Democrats say that is unacceptable .
Over the years with other administrations , most such disputes between the legislative and executive branches of government have ended in compromise .
If this one does not , the full House Judiciary Committee could vote to hold Bolton and Miers in contempt of Congress .
If the entire House concurs , the case would be referred to a U.S. attorney to seek grand jury indictment .
Fox host accuses Paul of taking ' marching orders from al Qaeda ' Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 6 , 2007
Print This Email This Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul 's anti-war arguments during Wednesday night 's Republican debate prompted consternation from his fellow candidates and prompted one Fox News moderator to imply the Texas congressman would take " marching orders from al Qaeda . "
Paul is the only Republican calling for an immediate end to the US occupation of Iraq , and he said he would remove all US troops from the Middle East , saying their presence in Saudi Arabia was partially responsible for the 9/11 attacks .
Paul said the Iraq was was making the US " less safe , and he called for a " new foreign policy that says we should mind our own business , bring our troops home , defend our security , " prompting Wallace 's question .
" So , Congressman Paul ... you re basically saying that we should take our marching orders from al Qaeda ? "
Fox host Chris Wallace asked .
" If they want us off the Arabian Peninsula , we should leave ? " " No ! " Paul replied sharply , pointing his pen at Wallace , and continuing to wave it throughout his response .
" I 'm saying we should take our marching orders from our constitution .
We should not go to war without a declaration .
...
This is an aggressive invasion .
We 've committed the invasion of this war , and it 's illegal under international law .
That 's where I take my marching orders , not from any enemy . "
The crowd 's reaction was mixed , but appeared to demonstrate at least some support for Paul 's calls for withdrawal .
Several times during the debate however , laughter could be heard from the other candidates or moderators directed at Paul .
Wednesday 's debate also featured a rare head - to - head exchange between two candidates .
Paul and Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , argued over the wisdom of keeping US troops in Iraq .
Paul blamed the situation in Iraq on " neoconservatives " who were " advising this administration , " and he said the American people should not bear the burden for their mistakes .
Huckabee countered that the nation cannot be divided .
He had said we should not leave Iraq after " we broke it . "
The former governor 's argument mirrored the " Pottery Barn rule " that had been advanced most prominently by former Secretary of State Colin Powell : " You break it , you own it . "
" We bought it because we broke it , " Huckabee said .
" We 've got a responsibility to the honor of this country , and the honor of every man and woman who has served in Iraq ... to not leave them with anything less than the honor they deserve . "
Paul said the country has " dug a hole for ourselves ... and it has all to do with foreign policy and we have to wake up to this fact . "
" What do we have to do to save face ?
It 's all we 're doing is saving face , and it 's time we came home , " Paul said .

Facebook MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif .  Susan Wojcicki is reminiscing about her old home in Menlo Park , Calif .
" It 's a very humble house , less than 2,000 square feet , " she recalls fondly .
A cozy , four - bedroom home — and incredibly historic .
After earning her MBA in 1998 , Wojcicki bought 232 Santa Margarita Ave. for about $ 600,000 .
She rented the garage to two Stanford students for $ 1,700 a month to help with the mortgage .
The renters : no ordinary slackers , but the Google Guys , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , who incubated Google ( GOOG ) right there .
" It 's a good reminder for the company that we did come from a small house , not a fancy house , " says Wojcicki .
Her life - changing decision to open her home to Brin and Page did more than just help start the world 's most - popular search engine .
It also : • Landed Wojcicki a key early job at Google less than a year after purchasing the home .
Today , she 's one of its top - ranked executives , overseeing the crucial online advertising business as vice president of product management .
• Introduced a future husband to Wojcicki's younger sister Anne , who recently married Brin on an island in the Bahamas .
Google has invested $ 3.9 million in Anne Wojcicki 's biotech start - up , 23andMe .
• Created a cottage industry for the Wojcicki family .
Susan Wojcicki's husband , Dennis Troper , is an operations executive at Google .
Brother - in - law Gregor ( married to middle sister Janet ) is a former Googler who worked in the finance department .
Mom Esther Wojcicki , a teacher , has consulted for Google on educational issues .
If you 've ever clicked a text ad on MySpace , About.com or any thousands of blogs with " Ads by Google , " you 've got Susan Wojcicki to thank .
Expanding ads beyond Google 's own search pages was her idea .
Now , Google has asked her to further grow the empire by bringing its advertiser base to old media such as newspapers , magazines , radio and television .
" There are no sets of words that can be used to describe Susan 's contribution to the company , " says Google CEO Eric Schmidt .
" She 's historic , in terms of our company 's founding .
She 's also one of those people who thinks very broadly and quickly , and ( it 's ) deceiving because she 's so pleasant . "
Wojcicki is Google employee No. 18 .
Her early duties included refining the original Google logo designed by Brin and the overall spare look of the Google home page .
She came up with the first of Google 's " doodles , " the remaking of the logo for holidays and other special events .
Her first artistic doodle : an alien lands on Google .
In Google 's fledgling days , Wojcicki , a former junior staffer for chipmaker Intel , was in charge of marketing efforts .
Brin and Page charged her with spreading the word about Google on a shoestring .
Her big idea : stir word - of - mouth by putting Google 's search engine all over the Web .
She reached out to companies to license Google search for their websites and offered it free to universities .
In 2003 , she came up with her multimillion - dollar brainstorm : AdSense .
' A really novel idea ' AdSense is an extension of a program Google had successfully launched in 2002 , called AdWords .
AdWords offers advertisers sponsored search ads , those little text ads that appear near search results .
Advertisers have to pay only if the ads get clicked .
Wojcicki's suggestion :
Why not offer these same ads all over the Web , on blogs and websites ?
Entice Web " publishers " to participate by giving them a portion of the ad revenue .
In other words , every time someone clicks on an ad on your site , you get a check .
Here 's how the ads are targeted :
Let 's say you 're reading about computers at tech site Engadget .
An ad might appear offering special deals at Dell.com .
Or , if you 're reading an article at a news site about Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , you might see an ad for a local criminal - defense law firm .
That 's AdSense .
" It was a really novel idea at the time to serve ads that were targeted dynamically " to a specific Web page , says Wojcicki , sitting in a conference room at the " Googleplex " company headquarters .
" People were saying , ' This is a sports site , so we 'll serve a sports ad . '
And we were saying , ' No .
We can actually look at the page in real time and figure out what this page is about . ' " Wojcicki's idea turned into a runaway smash .
Google does n't break out revenues from AdSense and AdWords .
But the company recently reported quarterly profit of $ 1 billion , virtually all derived from both ad programs .
Thousands of tiny entrepreneurs make substantial livings by hosting Ads by Google links at their websites .
" More people make money from AdSense than any other vehicle on the Web , " says Jennifer Slegg , who runs JenSense , a blog devoted to AdSense .
" There are many , many AdSense millionaires . "
AdSense " basically turned the Web into a giant Google billboard , " says Danny Sullivan , editor of Search Engine Land website .
" It effectively meant that Google could turn everyone 's content into a place for Google ads . "
For her efforts , Wojcicki earned a Google Founders ' Award , a financial incentive provided to employees to create new ideas .
Spokesman David Krane says it 's designed to keep employees and give them the same kind of economic award they would receive if they had formed their own companies .
Krane wo n't disclose how much current Founders '
Awards are worth , but the first two awarded to Googlers ( not to Wojcicki ) were $ 12 million each .
Venturing into offline ads Creating things has kept Wojcicki at Google over the years .
" I love taking an idea … to a prototype and then to a product that millions of people use , " she says .
" People write in from all over the world giving you feedback , telling us how a product ( AdSense ) changed their lives , how they were able to start a business with it , and that 's just incredibly rewarding . "
Her next big challenge : translating Google 's simple , measurable advertising network to radio , TV and print .
Ever wanted to run an ad on the radio but did n't know how to set it up ?
Google has an Audio
Ads section on its website with links to radio producers who will create an ad for $ 75 to $ 100 .
Select stations and time slots , and you 're on the air .
The radio venture recently left test mode and is open to the general public .
Google is testing the concept in print and on TV ; that test is available only to a small percentage of advertisers .
Sullivan and other Google analysts are skeptical about the nascent program 's chances .
With radio ads , Sullivan says , Google " will give information on when the ad played , with more data than before , but that still does n't prove that anyone heard the ad .
They have n't done anything innovative or different to show if the ad really worked . "
' A real challenge ' ahead Bringing the Google ad network to old media " will be a real challenge , " says Greg Sterling , an independent analyst at Sterling Market Intelligence .
" The ability to serve a relevant ad against someone 's query is one of the great innovations of the Internet , and it's not transferable to other media , where people are more passive . "
Wojcicki concedes that ads on TV and radio wo n't be as measurable .
But she says such ads placed through Google will have more data to mine than old media currently provide , thanks to Google 's obsessive tracking of numbers via its network of computers .
" For example , in TV we can provide second - by - second data on what 's being watched on the ad , " she says .
She cautions that it 's still very early for Google Radio :
" The first things we 're doing are really just providing online ways for people to purchase the inventory easier . "
Raised in Silicon Valley Wojcicki has plenty of experience at being eyewitness to a forming business .
Brin and Page originally met her and landed at the Menlo Park house via a friend of Wojcicki's who was dating Brin .
The house that gave birth to Google was always filled with mutual friends , Wojcicki says .
Most of them techies themselves , their No. 1 question for Brin and Page back then :
Who needs yet another search engine ?
The answer : " ' Not another but a better search engine , ' " Wojcicki recalls .
" From the beginning , they had a very clear vision that they could build something much better than what existed at the time . "
Wojcicki grew up in Palo Alto on the campus of Stanford University .
Dad Stanley Wojcicki chairs Stanford 's physics department .
Mom Esther , a journalism teacher at Palo Alto High School , says she expected Susan to become an English professor .
Instead , after a post - college job at educational software firm MagicQuest , she was bitten by the tech bug .
Now , Google is " such a presence " in their lives that the Wojcickis try to limit family - time chatter about the company , Esther says , though not always successfully .
" It 's so innovative and exciting .
They 're doing all sorts of interesting things , and it 's fun to hear about it . "
That so many of her relatives were drawn to Google is n't unusual , says Susan Wojcicki .
" There are lots of people in the Silicon Valley who are interested in working at a fast - moving , dynamic company like Google , " she says .
" Not just my family members . "
Meanwhile , the humble house where Google was incubated was purchased by Google in September .
Google wo n't disclose how much it paid , but homes in the neighborhood sell for more than $ 1 million .
" I have n't had time to think about what we 'll do with it , " says CEO Schmidt .
" But I figured we should buy it sooner rather than later . "

ANCIENT OLYMPIA , Greece ( Reuters ) - Firefighters saved the temples and stadiums of ancient Olympia , birthplace of the Olympic Games , from forest fires which razed nearby villages and took the death toll from Greece ’s three - day inferno to 60 .
Dozens of blazes , from northern Greece to the tip of the Peloponnese peninsula in the south , have blackened hillsides , destroyed forests and raced through towns and villages , causing unprecedented destruction .
Hundreds of houses have been burned and thousands of people have fled the fires , seeking temporary refuge in schools , hotels and regional health centers .
On Sunday the government offered rewards of up to a million euros ( $ 1.36 million ) for help in tracking down arsonists who it suggests have played a major role in Greece ’s worst forest fires in decades .
Thick black smoke billowed over the well - preserved ruins of Olympia , on the Peloponnese .
The blaze crept up a hillside , engulfing surrounding pine and cypress woods .
“ With self - sacrifice , firefighters fought ‘ trench battles ’ to rescue these sensitive and important sites , ” Public Order Minister Byron Polydoras told reporters .
Fire scorched the yard of the museum at Olympia , housing famous classical sculptures such as Praxiteles ’
Hermes , but planes , helicopters and scores of firefighters beat it back .
Some 60 firefighters and six trucks remained at the site to battle any flare - up , the fire brigade said .
Ancient Olympia , which hosted the Olympics for centuries from 776 BC , holds an Olympic flame ceremony every two years and is among the most popular tourist sites in the country .
“ Here it is , the contrast : ancient Greece gave the world civilization and modern Greece gives it destruction , ” a resident of ancient Olympia told Alter TV station .
Towering walls of flame have cut a swathe of destruction through the southern Peloponnese and the island of Evia near the capital and swept across other regions , prompting Greece to declare a nationwide state of emergency on Saturday .
“ The destruction is of biblical proportions , ” Nicholas Orphanos , a volunteer firefighter in the Peloponnese , told reporters .
“ There are villages we want to go to and we cannot because the roads are blocked .
In 30 years , I have never seen such destruction . ”
The fires have covered Athens in thick white ash that swirled round the temples on the Acropolis , and the smell of smoke permeated the city .

REWARD OFFERED
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis , who has called a snap parliamentary election on September 16 , has suggested arsonists are behind the fires , and the government has offered a reward for information leading to their capture .
“ The reward is set between 100,000 and 1 million euros for every ( act of ) arson , depending on whether death or serious injury occurred and the size of the damage , ” the Public Order Ministry said in a statement .

Many local mayors have accused rogue land developers of setting fires to make way for new construction on virgin forest and farm land .
So far , police have arrested two elderly people and two boys on suspicion of starting fires deliberately .
The first fires broke out on Friday and others erupted in scores of places around the country .
The death toll rose to 60 and health officials said it could increase as many villages remain cut off .
“ We will all burn tonight , ” a resident of Matesi village told Mega television on Sunday .
“ Where will we go , we are trapped everywhere .
Are we all going to burn like mice ? ”
The overstretched fire brigade threw reinforcements from Greece ’s EU partners into action to fight blazes stretching over 160 km ( 100 miles ) across the Peloponnese , the island of Evia and northern and central Greece .
Two French and one Italian firefighting plane dropped water on burning hillsides and 60 firefighters from Cyprus joined the fray .
More help was expected from at least 11 countries .
Villagers used garden hoses and buckets in futile efforts to save their homes .
Others jeered politicians , including Culture Minister George Voulgarakis who visited ancient Olympia to assess the damage .
The government has been criticized for reacting too slowly to forest fires that killed 10 people earlier this summer and the blazes are sure to become a central election campaign issue .
A naive view of schizophrenia might leave someone wondering why it persists in human populations .
The disease has a strong genetic component , and it strikes individuals during their peak reproductive years , radically reducing their ability to function socially .
Selective pressures would be expected to have reduced its incidence , yet it persists at a prevalence of nearly one percent in a broad range of societies .
A new analysis in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggests that the disease may simply be a consequence of genetic features that are useful in building and maintaining a complex brain .
The clearest models for this sort of behavior are the mutations that affect the hemoglobin genes , such as the one that causes sickle cell disease .
In these cases , mutations that can be debilitating persist because they provide a strong selective advantage — resistance to malaria .
The researchers set out to find out whether some of the genes implicated in schizophrenia were also under positive selection by looking for evidence of both selective sweeps and positive selective pressure on protein sequences .
The authors looked at a panel of 76 genes that have been linked to schizophrenia ; a set of 300 neural genes acted as controls .
They also looked broadly at primate evolution , comparing values across the human / chimp split , those two vs. other primates , and among primates in general .
Fourteen of those genes showed signs of having undergone a recent selective sweep ; this was about double the rate of the control set of neural genes ; a few others showed signs of more ancient sweeps that occurred prior to humans forming a distinct lineage .
One gene , DISC1 , also showed powerful evidence of positive selection at the protein level .
Just this week , evidence was published that suggests that this gene helps new neurons integrate into the mature brain , something that might help make sense out of the adult onset of the symptoms .
Assuming these figures hold up as more information comes in , the lingering question is what positive things these genes are doing in healthy populations .
The authors explicitly suggest that the schizophrenic mind is at the extreme end of a spectrum of increased creative thought ; that schizophrenics are simply thinking too far outside the box .
I do n't find this entirely convincing , especially given the sickle cell model , where the feature under positive selection has nearly nothing to do with the actual disease state .
I expect that each gene will have its own evolutionary story , with no general theme .
Still , the data look good , and the general model makes a reasonable suggestion as to why the human population is burdened with a high rate of schizophrenia .

We can appreciate the fact that Apple seems to draw a lot of inspiration from art -- we really can .
But we 're noticing a pretty disconcerting trend taking shape : Cupertino 's getting all Picasso on us with the " Good artists copy , great artists steal " stuff , time and time again knocking off other artists ' and creative companies ' work in its own products and advertising .
Seems a little odd for the company whose mainstay customer is the creative professional , and whose most enduring ad campaign compels us to Think Different .
Let 's take a quick look back at some of the lumps Apple 's taken for its ads just in 2006 and 2007 .

Riverbend is one of Iraq 's best known bloggers writing in English .
She is Sunni and lives in Baghdad .
She explains her opposition to the wall being built around the Sunni district of Adhamiya - and her family 's decision finally to leave Iraq .
Thursday , 26 April 2007 :
The Wall is the latest effort to further break Iraqi society apart .
Promoting and supporting civil war is n't enough , apparently .
Iraqis have generally proven to be more tenacious and tolerant than their mullahs , ayatollahs , and Vichy leaders .
It 's time for America to physically divide and conquer - like Berlin before the wall came down or Palestine today .
Work on the wall was halted after a public outcry
This way , they can continue chasing Sunnis out of " Shia areas " and Shia out of " Sunni areas " .
I remember Baghdad before the war - one could live anywhere .
We did n't know what our neighbours were .
We did n't care .
No -one asked about religion or sect .
No -one bothered with what was considered a trivial topic : are you Sunni or Shia ?
You only asked something like that if you were uncouth and backward .
Our lives revolve around it now .
Our existence depends on hiding it or highlighting it - depending on the group of masked men who stop you or raid your home in the middle of the night .
Choosing to leave
On a personal note , we 've finally decided to leave .
Since last summer , we had been discussing it more and more .
It was only a matter of time before what began as a suggestion - a last case scenario - soon took on solidity and developed into a plan .
For the last couple of months , it has only been a matter of logistics .
Plane or car ?
Jordan or Syria ?
So we 've been busy .
Busy trying to decide what part of our lives to leave behind .
We are choosing to leave because the other option is simply a continuation of what has been one long nightmare - stay and wait and try to survive .
It 's difficult to decide which is more frightening - car bombs and militias , or having to leave everything you know and love , to some unspecified place for a future where nothing is certain .

A friend of ours came into the shop and told me to go to my house , because I was wearing shorts .
Graffiti in Adhamiya says " Down with the Rafitha " , or " Down with Shias "
We asked why ?
He explained that al - Qaeda is now in control of the neighbourhood .
He said a few minutes before he came to the shop , they killed a guy in front of him because he was smoking in the street , and that he heard that al - Qaeda shot the car of a bride and a groom because they were celebrating in the street and playing music .
" If they see you [ wearing shorts ] they will kill you , " he said .
Later I heard from my friends some ridiculous stuff about al - Qaeda controlling the vegetable markets , and that it 's prohibited to put cucumbers along with tomatoes in the same sack , because a cucumber is a male vegetable and a tomato is a female vegetable .
I choked as I laughed about that story .

I am Iraqi and to me the possible consequences of this vote are terrifying .

Just as we began to see signs of progress in my country the Democrats come and say : " Well , it 's not worth it , so it 's time to leave . "
Evidently to them my life and the lives of 25 million Iraqis are not worth trying for and they should n't expect us to be grateful for this .
For four years everybody made mistakes ; the administration made mistakes and admitted them and my people and leaders made mistakes as well and we regret them .
But now we have a fresh start ; a new strategy with new ideas and tactics reached after studying previous mistakes and designed to reverse the setbacks we witnessed in the course of this war .
This strategy , although its tools are not fully deployed yet , is showing promising signs of progress .

Many Iraqi bloggers have fled their country and are now writing about Iraq from abroad .
24 Steps to Liberty is written by a young Iraqi man who is studying journalism in California .
Here are his thoughts on a field trip to New Orleans .
Monday , 30 April 2007 :
What shocked me the most in this trip was how the city looked like Baghdad .
New Orleans looked like Baghdad after the war in 1991 ; I swear , I kid you not .
Painting by Iraqi artist Betool Fekaiki decorating 24 Steps ' blog
The devastation , the empty houses , the people returning to their life in the city , the smell of destruction ( it has a distinctive smell ) .
In 1991 , Iraq was destroyed , mainly Baghdad and other big cities like Mosul , Basra .
The Americans made sure that the average Iraqis did n't get water , electricity , or food .
Within three months after the end of the war , most of the government building and services , including potable water , sewerage system , paving bombed streets , phones and electricity [ were reconnected ] .
That was under the rule of Saddam Hussein , whom Bush 's administration accused of depriving his people of their share of oil revenues !
What about people in New Orleans ?
They do n't have a dictator to rebuild their city .
They have a democracy that is fighting its way to spend US $ 100 bn more on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Who will help the people of New Orleans ?

New measurements provide the strongest evidence yet for wriggling magnetic waves that may explain why the solar corona is a good 200 times hotter than the surface of the sun : regular pulsations in the speed of charged , high - energy gas or plasma streaming from the sun combined with matching magnetic fields .
The findings point to magnetic field ripples known as Alfvén waves whipping plasma back and forth , releasing heat , according to a report published online by Science .
Although the waves seem to be too tiny to transfer the energy needed to fully heat the corona , researchers say improved measurements may reveal that the waves are larger than they appear .
A central problem in solar physics is why the sun 's atmosphere gets hotter as it rises , from about 8,500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 5,000 kelvins ) at the photosphere ( solar surface ) to more than 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit ( 1 million Kelvins ) in the corona , which extends for millions of miles .
Without an outside force heating the corona , its temperature would plummet , says solar physicist Scott McIntosh of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo .
A top candidate for that outside force : Alfv&eacutise ;n waves , undulations in the corona 's magnetic field liberating heat as the waves " break " and compress plasma .
To spy Alfvén waves , McIntosh , Steven Tomczyk , also of NCAR , and their colleagues used the coronal multichannel polarimeter ( CoMP ) instrument at New Mexico 's National Solar Observatory to measure changes in light emitted by ionized iron in the corona , which told them how the plasma 's outward velocity varied .
Pulses of 0.2 mile ( 0.3 kilometer ) a second occurred every five minutes , the same frequency as convective currents in the photosphere that could trigger Alfvén waves , they report .
The direction of coronal magnetic field lines also seemed to match the trajectories of the pulses .
The result comes close to solving one of the great mysteries in solar physics , says Viggo Hansteen , professor of astrophysics at the University of Oslo in Norway .
Data from Japan 's Hinode spacecraft , presented at a meeting in April , showed patterns deeper in the corona that seemed to finger Alfvén waves , but the new finding is much more definitive , he says .
" They 're not guessing .
They 're really saying , ' Okay , these things are obeying all the characteristics we expect of Alfvén waves . ' "
The only hitch : the waves are less than a thousandth the mangnitude needed to explain coronal heating , but Tomczyk notes that CoMP has relatively low resolution , so much larger waves could still be hidden in the data .
MINNEAPOLIS , Sept. 28 — Dividers intended to make soliciting sex much more difficult will be added to stalls in two men ’s rooms at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
The metal dividers will fall two or three inches above the floor , an airport spokesman , Patrick Hogan , said Friday .
Stall partitions are now a foot off the floor .
The two restrooms include the one where Senator Larry E. Craig , Republican of Idaho , was arrested in a sex sting in June .
Those two sites have elicited the most complaints regarding sexual activity , Mr. Hogan said .
It will cost about $ 25,000 to buy and install the dividers , he said , calling that “ a drop in the bucket ” compared with the expense of prosecuting Mr. Craig on a disorderly conduct charge and handling the 40 arrests made in sexual solicitation cases since May .

Let us begin with a short quiz : a few questions to ponder during the 30 ( or 60 or 90 ) minutes a day you spend burning off excess calories at the gym , or perhaps while feeling guilty because you ’re not so engaged .
If lean people are more physically active than fat people — one fact in the often - murky science of weight control that ’s been established beyond reasonable doubt — does that mean that working out will make a fat person lean ?
Does it mean that sitting around will make a lean person fat ?
How about a mathematical variation on these questions :
Let ’s say we go to the gym and burn off 3,500 calories every week — that ’s 700 calories a session , five times a week .
Since a pound of fat is equivalent to 3,500 calories , does that mean we ’ll be a pound slimmer for every week we exercise ?
And will we continue to slim down at this pace for as long as we continue to exercise ?
For most of us , fear of flab is the reason we exercise , the motivation that drives us to the gym .
It ’s also why public - health authorities have taken to encouraging ever more exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle .
If we ’re fat or fatter than ideal , we work out .
Burn calories .
Expend energy .
Still fat ?
Burn more .
The dietary guidelines of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , for instance , now recommend that we engage in up to 60 minutes daily of “ moderate to vigorous intensity ” physical activity just to maintain weight — that is , keep us from fattening further .
Considering the ubiquity of the message , the hold it has on our lives , and the elegant simplicity of the notion — burn calories , lose weight — would n’t it be nice to believe it were true ?
The catch is that science suggests it ’s not , and so the answer to all of the above quiz questions is “ no . ”
Just last month , the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine published joint guidelines for physical activity and health .
They suggested that 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five days a week is necessary to “ promote and maintain health . ”
What they did n’t say , though , was that more physical activity will lead us to lose weight .
Indeed , the best they could say about the relationship between fat and exercise was this :
“ It is reasonable to assume that persons with relatively high daily energy expenditures would be less likely to gain weight over time , compared with those who have low energy expenditures .
So far , data to support this hypothesis are not particularly compelling . ”
In other words , despite half a century of efforts to prove otherwise , scientists still ca n’t say that exercise will help keep off the pounds .
The 30 minutes recommended by the AHA - ACSM report is a departure from the recent guidelines of other authoritative organizations — the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and the International Association for the Study of Obesity — both of which , like the USDA , have recommended that we exercise for up to 60 minutes a day to avoid what the USDA calls “ unhealthy weight gain . ”
But the reason for this 60 - minute recommendation is precisely that so little evidence exists to support the notion that exercising less has any effect .
The report that these experts cite most often as grounds for their assessments was published in 2000 by two Finnish researchers who surveyed all the relevant research on exercise and weight of the previous twenty years .
Yet the Finnish report , the most scientifically rigorous review of the evidence to date , can hardly be said to have cleared up the matter .
When the Finnish investigators looked at the results of the dozen best - constructed experimental trials that addressed weight maintenance — that is , successful dieters who were trying to keep off the pounds they had shed — they found that everyone regains weight .
And depending on the type of trial , exercise would either decrease the rate of that gain ( by 3.2 ounces per month ) or increase its rate ( by 1.8 ounces ) .
As the Finns themselves concluded , with characteristic understatement , the relationship between exercise and weight is “ more complex ” than they might otherwise have imagined .
This is not to say that there are n’t excellent reasons to be physically active , as these reports invariably point out .
We might just enjoy exercise .
We may increase our overall fitness ; we may live longer , perhaps by reducing our risk of heart disease or diabetes ; we ’ll probably feel better about ourselves .
( Of course , this may be purely a cultural phenomenon .
It ’s hard to imagine that the French , for instance , would improve their self - esteem by spending more time at the gym . )
But there ’s no reason to think that we will lose any significant amount of weight , and little reason to think we will prevent ourselves from gaining it .

The one thing that might be said about exercise with certainty is that it tends to makes us hungry .
Maybe not immediately , but eventually .
Burn more calories and the odds are very good that we ’ll consume more as well .
And this simple fact alone might explain both the scientific evidence and a nation ’s worth of sorely disappointing anecdotal experience .
It ’s difficult to get health authorities to talk about the disconnect between their official recommendations and the scientific evidence that underlies it because they want to encourage us to exercise , even if their primary reason for doing so is highly debatable .
Steve Blair , for instance , a University of South Carolina exercise scientist and a co-author of the AHA - ACSM guidelines , says he was “ short , fat , and bald ” when he started running in his thirties and he is short , fatter , and balder now , at age 68 .
In the intervening years , he estimates , he has run close to 80,000 miles and gained about 30 pounds .
When I asked Blair whether he thought he might be leaner had he run even more , he had to think about it .
“ I do n’t see how I could have been more active , ” he said .
“ Thirty years ago , I was running 50 miles a week .
I had no time to do more .
But if I could have gone out over the last couple of decades for two to three hours a day , maybe I would not have gained this weight . ”
And maybe he would have anyway .
If we trust the AHA - ACSM report he co-authored , there is little reason to believe that the amount he runs makes any difference .
Nonetheless ,
Blair personally believes he would be fatter still if he had n’t been running .
Why ?
There was a time when virtually no one believed exercise would help a person lose weight .
Until the sixties , clinicians who treated obese and overweight patients dismissed the notion as naïve .
When Russell Wilder , an obesity and diabetes specialist at the Mayo Clinic , lectured on obesity in 1932 , he said his fat patients tended to lose more weight with bed rest , “ while unusually strenuous physical exercise slows the rate of loss . ”
The problem , as he and his contemporaries saw it , is that light exercise burns an insignificant number of calories , amounts that are undone by comparatively effortless changes in diet .
In 1942 , Louis Newburgh of the University of Michigan calculated that a 250 - pound man expends only three calories climbing a flight of stairs — the equivalent of depriving himself of a quarter - teaspoon of sugar or a hundredth of an ounce of butter .
“ He will have to climb twenty flights of stairs to rid himself of the energy contained in one slice of bread ! ” Newburgh observed .
So why not skip the stairs , skip the bread , and call it a day ?
More - strenuous exercise , these physicians further argued , does n’t help matters — because it works up an appetite .
“ Vigorous muscle exercise usually results in immediate demand for a large meal , ” noted Hugo Rony of Northwestern University in his 1940 textbook , Obesity and Leanness .
“ Consistently high or low energy expenditures result in consistently high or low levels of appetite .
Thus men doing heavy physical work spontaneously eat more than men engaged in sedentary occupations .
Statistics show that the average daily caloric intake of lumberjacks is more than 5,000 calories , while that of tailors is only about 2,500 calories .
Persons who change their occupation from light to heavy work or vice versa soon develop corresponding changes in their appetite . ”
If a tailor becomes a lumberjack and , by doing so , takes to eating like one , why assume that the same wo n’t happen , albeit on a lesser scale , to an overweight tailor who decides to work out like a lumberjack for an hour a day ?
Credit for why we came to believe otherwise goes to one man , Jean Mayer , who began his career at Harvard in the early fifties , went on to become the most influential nutritionist in the country , and then , for sixteen years , served as president of Tufts University ( where there is now a Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging ) .
As an authority on human weight regulation , Mayer was among the very first of a new breed , a type that has since come to dominate the field .
His predecessors — Wilder , Rony , Newburgh , and others — had all been physicians who worked closely with obese and overweight patients .
Mayer was not .
His training was in physiological chemistry ; he had obtained a doctorate at Yale with a dissertation on the interrelationship of vitamins A and C in rats .
In the ensuing decades , he would publish hundreds of papers on different aspects of nutrition , including why we get fat , but he never had to reduce obese patients as part of his clinical obligation , and so his hypotheses were less fettered by anecdotal or real - life experience .
As early as 1953 , after just a few years of research on laboratory mice , Mayer began extolling the virtues of exercise for weight control .
By 1959 , the New York Times was crediting him with having “ debunked [ the ] popular theories ” that exercise played little role in weight control .
Mayer knew that the obese often eat no more than the lean and occasionally even less .
This seemed to exclude gluttony as a cause of their weight gain , which meant that these fat people had to be less physically active .
Otherwise , how could they take in more calories than they expend and so become fat ?
Through the sixties , Mayer documented the relationship between inactivity and the overweight .
He noted that fat high - school girls ate “ several hundred calories less ” than lean classmates .
“ The laws of thermodynamics were , however , not flouted by this finding , ” he wrote , because the obese girls expended less energy than the lean :
They were much less active ; they spent four times as many hours watching television .
Mayer also studied infants .
“ The striking phenomenon is that the fatter babies were quiet , placid babies that had moderate intake , ” Mayer reported , “ whereas the babies who had the highest intake tended to be very thin babies , cried a lot , moved a lot , and became very tense . ”
Thus , Mayer concluded , “ some individuals are born very quiet , inactive , and placid and with moderate intake get fat , and some individuals from the very beginning are very active and do not get particularly fat even with high intakes . ”
It was Mayer who pioneered the now - ubiquitous practice of implicating sedentary living as the “ most important factor ” leading to obesity and the chronic diseases that accompany it .
Modern Americans , said Mayer , were inert compared with their “ pioneer forebears ” who were “ constantly engaged in hard physical labor . ”
Every modern convenience , by this logic , from power windows to the electric toothbrush , only serves to minimize the calories we expend .
“ The development of obesity , ” Mayer wrote in 1968 , “ is to a large extent the result of the lack of foresight of a civilization which spends tens of billions annually on cars , but is unwilling to include a swimming pool and tennis courts in the plans of every high school . ”
Mayer ’s hypothesis always had shortcomings , but they were ignored for the same reasons they still are — who wants to openly question the idea that physical activity is a panacea ?
The first issue is a logical one :
That conclusion that the fatter we are , the more sedentary we ’re likely to be is actually a correlation ; it tells us nothing about what is cause and what is effect .
“ It is a common observation , ” noted Rony in 1941 , “ that many obese persons are lazy , i.e. , show decreased impulse to muscle activity .
This may be , in part , an effect that excess weight would have on the activity impulse of any normal person . ”
Equally possible is that obesity and physical inactivity are both symptoms of the same underlying cause .
The one thing that might be said about exercise with certainty is that it tends to make us hungry .
Maybe not immediately , but eventually .
Burn more calories and the odds are very good that we ’ll consume more as well .
This logical problem was then obscured by Mayer ’s all - out attack on the role of hunger .
Mayer acknowledged that exercise could make us hungrier , but he said it was n’t necessarily the case .
This was the heart of Mayer ’s message — a purported loophole in the relationship between appetite and physical activity .
“ If exercise is decreased below a certain point , food intake no longer decreases , ” said Mayer .
“ In other words , walking one half - hour a day may be equivalent to only four slices of bread , but if you do n’t walk the half - hour , you still want to eat the four slices . ”
Mayer based this conclusion on two ( and only two ) of his own studies from the mid-fifties .
The first purported to demonstrate that laboratory rats exercised for a few hours every day will eat less than rats that do n’t exercise at all .
But this would never be replicated .
In more recent experiments , the more rats run the more rats eat ; weights remain unchanged .
And when rats are retired from these exercise programs , they eat more than ever and gain weight with age more rapidly than rats that were allowed to remain sedentary .
With hamsters and gerbils , exercise increases body weight and body - fat percentage .
So exercising makes these particular rodents fatter , not leaner .
Mayer ’s second study was an assessment of the diet , physical activity , and weights of workers and merchants at a mill in West Bengal , India .
This article is still cited — by the Institute of Medicine , for instance — as perhaps the only existing evidence that physical activity and appetite do not necessarily go hand in hand .
But it , too , has never been replicated , despite ( or perhaps because of ) a half - century of improvements in methods of assessing diet and energy expenditure in humans .
It helped that Mayer promoted his pro-exercise message with a fervor akin to a moral crusade .
In 1966 , Mayer was the primary author of a U.S. Public Health Service report advocating increased physical activity along with diet as the best way to lose weight .
In 1969 , Mayer chaired Richard Nixon ’s White House Conference on Food , Nutrition , and Health .
“ The successful treatment of obesity must involve far - reaching changes in lifestyle , ” the conference report concludes .
“ These changes include alterations of dietary patterns and patterns of physical activity . ”
In 1972 , Mayer began writing a syndicated newspaper column on nutrition : Exercise , Mayer now wrote , sounding suspiciously like a diet doctor selling a patent claim , will make “ weight melt away faster , ” and “ contrary to popular belief , exercise wo n’t stimulate your appetite . ”
Our culture of physical exercise began only in the late sixties , coincident with Mayer ’s crusade , which explains why our parents might not have been quite so devoted to the idea of spending their leisure time perspiring profusely .
In 1977 , the New York Times was covering the “ exercise explosion ” that had come about because the conventional wisdom of the sixties that exercise was “ bad for you ” had been transformed into the “ new conventional wisdom — that strenuous exercise is good for you . ”
When the Washington Post estimated in 1980 that 100 million Americans were partaking in the “ new fitness revolution ” — coincident with the start of the current obesity epidemic — it also noted that most of them “ would have been derided as ‘ health nuts ’ ” only a decade earlier .
Meanwhile , the evidence simply never came around to support Mayer ’s hypothesis , even though our beliefs did .
My favorite study of the effect of physical activity on weight loss was published in 1989 by a team of Danish researchers .
Over the course of eighteen months the Danes trained nonathletes to run a marathon .
At the end of this training period , the eighteen men in the study had lost an average of five pounds of body fat .
As for the nine women subjects , the Danes reported , “ no change in body composition was observed . ”
That same year , F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , then director of the St. Luke ’s–Roosevelt Hospital Obesity Research Center in New York , reviewed the studies on exercise and weight , and his conclusion was identical to that of the Finnish review ’s eleven years later : “ Decreases , increases , and no changes in body weight and body composition have been observed , ” Pi-Sunyer reported .
Granted , all this still does n’t explain why we bought into Mayer ’s idea that we could exercise more and not compensate by eating more .
One simple reason is that the health reporters bought it , and we were reading their articles , not the research literature itself .
In 1977 , for instance , the National Institutes of Health hosted its second conference on obesity and weight control .
“ The importance of exercise in weight control is less than might be believed , ” the assembled experts concluded , “ because increases in energy expenditure due to exercise also tend to increase food consumption , and it is not possible to predict whether the increased caloric output will be outweighed by the greater food intake . ”
That same year , The New York Times Magazine reported that there was “ now strong evidence that regular exercise can and does result in substantial and — so long as the exercise is continued — permanent weight loss . ”
By 1990 , a year after Pi-Sunyer ’s pessimistic assessment of the evidence , Newsweek was declaring exercise an “ essential ” element of any weight - loss program , and the Times had stated that on those infrequent occasions “ when exercise is n’t enough ” to lose weight , “ you must also make sure you do n’t overeat . ”
As for the authorities themselves , the primary factor fueling their belief in the weight - maintaining benefits of exercise was their natural reluctance to acknowledge otherwise .
Although one could n’t help but be “ underwhelmed by ” the evidence , as Mayer ’s student Judith Stern , a UC Davis nutritionist , wrote in 1986 , it would be “ shortsighted ” to say that exercise was ineffective because it meant ignoring the possible contributions of exercise to the prevention of obesity and to the maintenance of weight loss that might be induced by diet .
These , of course , had never been demonstrated either , but they had n’t been ruled out .
This faith - based philosophy came to dominate scientific discussions on exercise and weight , but it could n’t be reconciled with the simple notion that appetite and calories consumed will increase with an increase in physical activity .
Hence , the idea of working up an appetite was jettisoned .
Clinicians , researchers , exercise physiologists , even personal trainers at the local gym took to thinking and talking about hunger as though it were a phenomenon exclusive to the brain , a question of willpower ( whatever that is ) , not the natural consequence of a body trying to replenish itself with energy .
Ultimately , the relationship between physical activity and fatness comes down to the question of cause and effect .
Is Lance Armstrong excessively lean because he burns off a few thousand calories a day cycling , or is he driven to expend that energy because his body is constitutionally set against storing calories as fat ?
If his fat tissue is resistant to accumulating calories , his body has little choice but to burn them as quickly as possible : what Rony and his contemporaries called the “ activity impulse ” — a physiological drive , not a conscious one .
His body is telling him to get on his bike and ride , not his mind .
Those of us who run to fat would have the opposite problem .
Our fat tissue wants to store calories , leaving our muscles with a relative dearth of energy to burn .
It ’s not willpower we lack , but fuel .
For the last 60 years , researchers studying obesity and weight regulation have insisted on treating the human body as a thermodynamic black box : Calories go in one side , they come out the other , and the difference ( calories in minus calories out ) ends up as either more or less fat .
The fat tissue , in this thermodynamic model , has nothing to say in the matter .
Thus the official recommendations to eat less and exercise more and assuredly you ’ll get thinner .
( Or at least not fatter . )
And in the strict sense this is true — you can starve a human , or a rat , and he will indeed lose weight — but that misses the point .
Humans , rats , and all living organisms are ruled by biology , not thermodynamics .
When we deprive ourselves of food , we get hungry .
When we push ourselves physically , we get tired .
Our bodies , like all living organisms , have evolved a fantastically complex web of feedback loops .
These physiological mechanisms serve fundamentally to work against the inevitable pull of thermodynamics ( which is entropy , a.k.a. death ) and so make life possible .
The necessary condition of life , as the great French physiologist Claude Bernard noted 140 years ago , is to keep the internal environment of an organism stable and conducive to life , regardless of what ’s happening on the outside .
This is what the Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon , in the thirties , called homeostasis — or the “ wisdom of the body , ” as he put it .
“ Somehow the unstable stuff of which we are composed , ” Cannon wrote , “ had learned the trick of maintaining stability . ”
The key is that among the many things regulated in this homeostatic system — along with blood pressure and blood sugar , body temperature , respiration , etc . — is the amount of fat we carry .
From this biological or homeostatic perspective , lean people are not those who have the willpower to exercise more and eat less .
They are people whose bodies are programmed to send the calories they consume to the muscles to be burned rather than to the fat tissue to be stored — the Lance Armstrongs of the world .
The rest of us tend to go the other way , shunting off calories to fat tissue , where they accumulate to excess .
This shunting of calories toward fat cells to be stored or toward the muscles to be burned is a phenomenon known as fuel partitioning .
The job of determining how fuels ( glucose and fatty acids ) will be used , whether we will store them as fat or burn them for energy , is carried out primarily by the hormone insulin in concert with an enzyme known technically as lipoprotein lipase — LPL , for short .
( Sex hormones also interact with LPL , which is why men and women fatten differently . )
In the eighties , biochemists and physiologists worked out how LPL responds to exercise .
They found that during a workout , LPL activity increases in muscle tissue , and so our muscle cells suck up fatty acids to use for fuel .
Then , when we ’re done exercising , LPL activity in the muscle tissue tapers off and LPL activity in our fat tissue spikes , pulling calories into fat cells .
This works to return to the fat cells any fat they might have had to surrender — homeostasis , in other words .
The more rigorous the exercise , and the more fat lost from our fat tissue , the greater the subsequent increase in LPL activity in the fat cells .
Thus , post - workout , we get hungry :
Our fat tissue is devoting itself to restoring calories as fat , depriving other tissues and organs of the fuel they need and triggering a compensatory impulse to eat .
The feeling of hunger is the brain ’s way of trying to satisfy the demands of the body .
Just as sweating makes us thirsty , burning off calories makes us hungry .
This research has never been controversial .
It ’s simply been considered irrelevant by authorities , all too often lean , who have been dead set on blaming fatness on some combination of gluttony , sloth , and perhaps a little genetic predisposition thrown in on the side .
But contemplating the means by which we might lose weight without considering the hormonal regulation of fat tissue is like wondering why children grow taller without considering the role of growth hormones .
Or , for that matter , like trying to explain the record - breaking triumphs of modern athletes — Barry Bonds , say — and never considering the possibility that steroid hormones ( or human growth hormone or insulin ) might be involved .
If it ’s biology , and not a lack of willpower , that explains why exercise fails so many of us as a weight - loss tool , then we can still find reason for optimism .
Since insulin is the primary hormone affecting the activity of LPL on our cells , it ’s not surprising that insulin is the primary regulator of how fat we get .
“ Fat is mobilized [ from fat tissue ] when insulin secretion diminishes , ” the American Medical Association Council on Foods and Nutrition explained back in 1974 , before this fact , too , was deemed irrelevant to the question of why we gain weight or the means to lose it .
Because insulin determines fat accumulation , it ’s quite possible that we get fat not because we eat too much or exercise too little but because we secrete too much insulin or because our insulin levels remain elevated far longer than might be ideal .
To be sure , this is the same logic that leads to other unconventional ideas .
As it turns out , it ’s carbohydrates — particularly easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars — that primarily stimulate insulin secretion .
“ Carbohydrates is driving insulin is driving fat , ” as George Cahill Jr. , a retired Harvard professor of medicine and expert on insulin , recently phrased it for me .
So maybe if we eat fewer carbohydrates — in particular the easily digestible simple carbohydrates and sugars — we might lose considerable fat or at least not gain any more , whether we exercise or not .
This would explain the slew of recent clinical trials demonstrating that dieters who restrict carbohydrates but not calories invariably lose more weight than dieters who restrict calories but not necessarily carbohydrates .
Put simply , it ’s quite possible that the foods — potatoes , pasta , rice , bread , pastries , sweets , soda , and beer — that our parents always thought were fattening ( back when the medical specialists treating obesity believed that exercise made us hungry ) really are fattening .
And so if we avoid these foods specifically , we may find our weights more in line with our desires .
As for those people who insist that exercise has been the key to their weight - loss programs , the one thing we ’d have to wonder is whether they changed their diets as well .
Rare is the person who decides the time has come to lose weight and does n’t also decide perhaps it ’s time to eat fewer sweets , drink less beer , switch to diet soda , and maybe curtail the kind of carb - rich snacks — the potato chips and the candy bars — that might be singularly responsible for driving up their insulin and so their fat .
For the rest of us , it may be time to take a scientific or biological view of our excesses rather than a biblical one .
The benefits of exercise include the joys of virtuousness .
I worked out today , therefore I can eat fattening foods to my heart ’s content .
But maybe the causality is reversed here too .
Maybe it ’s because we eat foods that fatten us that the workout becomes a necessity , the best we can do in the battle against our own fat tissue .

WASHINGTON , Jan. 23 ( AP ) 
The government is considering raising standards for birth control drugs , saying new pills appear to be less effective at preventing pregnancy than those approved decades ago .
The Food and Drug Administration asked a panel of experts on Tuesday whether it should require new contraceptive drugs to meet a standard of effectiveness before approving them for sale .
The panel is to meet again on Wednesday .
In documents on its Web site , the F.D.A. says newer contraceptives appear to be less effective  with twice the failure rate at times  than previous products , most likely because manufacturers have started using lower doses of hormones that stop ovulation .
“ The very first pills were very high dose and carried risks of blood clots and cardiovascular problems that would be unacceptable to most women , ” Amy Allina , program director of the National Women ’s Health Network , said .
“ Today , most birth control pills are very safe for the vast majority of women . ”
The Los Angeles Times reports on this website tonight and in Wednesday 's print editions that a major Democratic Party fundraiser named Norman Hsu is wanted by authorities for skipping out on an agreement to serve up to three years in prison after pleading no contest to grand theft swindling charges .
In a story by Chuck Neubauer and Robin Fields , The Times reports that for three years
Hsu has been carving out a place of political and financial influence by funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions into Democratic Party coffers , much of the money earmarked for Sen.
Hillary Clinton .
He has earned the ranking of Hillraiser for pledging to raise at least $ 100,000 for her .
In just the last 36 months Hsu has been involved in raising more than $ 1 million for Clinton and other Democrats .
Howard Wolfson , a spokesman for the Clinton campaign , confirmed today that Hsu had been a " longtime and generous supporter " of the party including Clinton .
" We have no reason to call his contributions into question or to return them , " Wolfson added .
Hsu has developed a specialty of bundling hefty campaign contributions from obscure citizens who live modest lives and have never before given money to campaigns .
Many are not even registered to vote .
Over the years other recipients of Hsu donations have included Sens.
Dianne Feinstein , Barack Obama , Joe Biden and Edward Kennedy .
Hsu 's lawyer confirmed today that his client was the one involved in the California case but said he did not remember pleading to a criminal case nor facing jail time .
" He is a fugitive , " said Ronald Smetana of the California attorney general 's office .
" Do you know where he is ? "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Vitamin
C can impede the growth of some types of tumors although not in the way some scientists had suspected , researchers reported on Monday .

The new research , published in the journal Cancer Cell , supported the general notion that vitamin C and other so - called antioxidants can slow tumor growth , but pointed to a mechanism different from the one many experts had suspected .
The researchers generated encouraging results when giving vitamin C to mice that had been implanted with human cancer cells -- either the blood cancer lymphoma or prostate cancer .
Another antioxidant , N - acetylcysteine , also limited tumor growth in the mice , the researchers said .
Antioxidants are nutrients that prevent some of the damage from unstable molecules known as free radicals , created when the body turns food into energy .
Vitamin C , vitamin E and beta - carotene are among well - known antioxidants .
Previous research had suggested that vitamin C may stifle tumor growth by preventing DNA damage from free radicals .
But researchers led by Dr. Chi Dang , a professor of medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , found that antioxidants appear to be working in a different way -- undermining a tumor ’s ability to grow under certain conditions .
Figuring out how antioxidants impede tumors should help scientists figure out how they might be harnessed to fight cancer , Dang said .
In addition to the cancer types involved in this study , others that might be vulnerable to vitamin C include colon cancer and cervical cancer , he said .
Dang said more research is needed and cautioned against taking high doses of vitamin C based on these findings .
“ Certainly we would very much discourage people with untreated cancer to go out and take buckets full of vitamin C , ” Dang said in a telephone interview .
Linus Pauling argued in the 1970s that vitamin C , also called ascorbic acid , could ward off cancer , but the notion has proved contentious .
Pauling , who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry as well as the Nobel Peace Prize , died in 1994 .
“ Pauling actually had some good evidence that under certain situations vitamin C can prevent tumor formation .
It ’s just the mechanism was really not that clear then , ” Dang said .
“ Now that , I think , we provide relatively compelling evidence of how this works , maybe Pauling is partly right .
We should n’t dismiss him so quickly . ”
Dang added .
Mark Twain was a brilliant author , philosopher , and humorist , but he was
also a man made quite nervous by copyright .
Copyright did n't bother him in
principle , of course .
It benefited him greatly as one of the leading writers
of his day .
What bothered him about copyright was the fact that it would eventually
expire , leaving his heirs without a way to make an easy buck .
Twain did n't want
perpetual copyright , only something that would cover his children 's lives .
He
noted on more than one occasion that the grandkids should fend for themselves , but for Twain and his daughters , he sought to combat " the pirates . "
Twain has been criticized for his pro-author views on copyright , which oscillated throughout his career between degrees of hatred for publishers .
How he responded to the impending expiration of his copyrights is , I argue , quite genius .
Twain concocted a scheme whereby he would augment his existing copyrighted works on the eve of their entry into the public domain in order to create a new , copyrighted work .
The original work would pass into the public domain , but Twain reasoned that the newer , augmented works would outsell public domain materials if they offered something extra .
In short , he speculated about trying to create value from his older works that would be copyrightable .
As this 1906 New York Times article notes ( which I found catching up on Boing Boing ) , Twain " looks upon the copyright law as pure robbery . "
His objection was simple : he knew that his works would likely continue to be popular long after their ( then ) 42 years of copyright protection expired .
Maybe this would n't have bothered Twain much were it not for the fact that he was convinced that public domain works were nothing more than free source materials for publishers to pick up , print , and make money on ( without paying an author ) .
Twain feared that publishers would continue to print his works without paying him , and thus they 'd continue to rake in the dough while his heirs got none .
And , as Twain once noted , while authors die , " publishers " do n't .
For their efforts ,
Twain called them " pirates , " for they did as true pirates do : " take " things that are n't " theirs " and profit from it .
Twain 's solution would have been ridiculous in actual practice .
He imagined printing portions of his ( then unpublished ) autobiography intermixed with his older works , in new binding .
The result would be a copy of , e.g. , Tom Sawyer that also had the introduction to Twain 's life printed on the bottom half of each page .
As the old Times article points out , the idea was to tie moments in Twain 's autobiography to scenes in his works .
To be sure , it 's a very creative approach to creating a " new work . "
It does n't prevent the original from passing into the public domain , but the author is free to try and create competing works for his benefit .
Twain was no hero of copyright , having in his later years become a staunch advocate of extending copyright against the " pirates . "
Twain so distrusted the publishers that he even said that such " pirates " were the true beneficiaries of the copyright law , since the law eventually delivered to them via the hand of the government all the world 's literary treasures , which they could print without paying the author or heirs .
In any case , like so many things Twain , the story brought a smile to my face as I thought about how ingenious the man was in the face of a challenge , even something like copyright terms that he found unfavorable .
While he stumped for copyright extensions ( which eventually did come , obviating the need for his schemes ) , Twain was at least on to one important point : you can and must compete with " free . "
In Twain 's situation , " free " was the threat of publishers who could use his works without paying him .
Today " free " takes on a new level of meaning , since so many copyrighted works can be shared without an intervening publisher .
Yet the point still stands :
Twain understood how the value of copyrighted works could change over time , and he imagined a scenario in which he would creatively try to enliven old works to renew their commercial aspects to compete against works that would not benefit him commercially .
Much has changed since 1906 , but not the need for intelligent vigilance or business ingenuity .
The software giant 's chief made the remarks during a discussion about consumer software revenue models , and Ballmer used the dialogue as an entry point to take his shot at Google .
The video is available to watch via the web site Mydeo.com .
Ballmer made his remarks after an audience member asked him if an advertising model could support software business in the future .
The CEO said a combination of models - - commercial and ad - paid - - would go forward .
" What 's a good example ?
Will online publications be largely ad - funded as things move from the physical world to the online world ? "
Ballmer said .
" I think the answer is yes .
" Have we seen the migration of things even like email ? . . .
Our Windows Live Hotmail , in and of itself , does n't generate much ad revenue .
So we 've had to put , essentially , a whole portal around it because the traffic around it is very valuable but it's not very easily monetized in the context of mail .
" Google 's had the same experience , even though they read your mail and we don't , " Ballmer said , to chuckles and and a couple of gasps in the audience .
" That 's just a factual statement , not even to be pejorative .
The theory was if we read your mail , if somebody read your mail , they would know what to talk to you about .
It 's not working out as brilliantly as the concept was laid out . "
Ballmer is n't the first to fire salvos at Google 's Gmail privacy policy .
Privacy advocates have been critical over the policy almost since the beginning , but the popularity of the service has skyrocketed nonetheless .
The event at which Ballmer spoke , the Microsoft Startup Accelerator Programme , took place on Oct. 1 and Lars Lindstedt , the head of Microsoft's U.K. Software Economy and Emerging Business programs , wrote about it on his blog .
Google , which operates the free Gmail service , publicly acknowledges that its " processes personal information " via cookies and on its servers , so it can provide " our products and services to users , " as well as to keep its service running well .
It adds :
Google does n't say it " reads " email , however .
Microsoft and Google have been gearing up for a major war over software as a service and web - based applications , with Google offering Gmail and Google docs , and Microsoft offering Hotmail , Office and preparing for Windows Live Office .
Update , 10 /10 : Via email , from Cary Marsh , CEO of MyDeo.com :
Wow , the White House is really struggling to find a parallel that lowers our expectations and puts them in a good light ... unfortunately , a better grasp on history and political science might be helpful .
BBC ( h/t C&L Commenter ) :
The head of US forces in Iraq , Lt Gen David Petraeus , has told the BBC that fighting the insurgency is a " long term endeavour " which could take decades .[.. ]
( H)e warned that US forces were engaged in a " tough fight " which will get " harder before it gets easier " .
His comments come as US calls for a rapid troop withdrawal gather strength .
Gen Petraeus was keen to emphasise that the ongoing unrest in Iraq is not something he expects to be resolved overnight .
" Northern Ireland , I think , taught you that very well .
My counterparts in your [ British ] forces really understand this kind of operation ...
It took a long time , decades , " he said .
Here 's the problem of using the Northern Ireland analogy :
For how long did a band of less than a 1000 IRA militants keep peace at bay ?
The Troubles were in the late ' 60s , and that was n't the beginning .
We 're not dealing with a few hundred insurgents in Iraq .
Also note in the interview ( the hyperlink in the above article ) , Petraeus keeps conflating the issue by talking about al Qaeda , which by all non-White House accounts , is not responsible for most of the violence .
The thing that I 've never got a clear understanding ( and for which I blame the media for not asking the right questions ) is when is it that we know we 've won ?
By definition , since we are occupying their country , anyone who fights against us is an insurgent .
Do we know it 's time to quit when there are no more insurgents ( and what does that mean for Iraqi population ) ?
Is it when there is no more sectarian strife ?
In the 5,000 year history of the region -- aside from when under the thumb of dictators -- has there ever been a time with no sectarian strife ?
If you thought Dean Karnazes running 50 marathons in 50 days in 50 states was crazy , these guys have lost it on a totally different level .
Their names are Scotty & Fiddy and they ’re the guys behind Hitch50 .
Their goal is to hitchhike to 50 state capitals in 50 days or less .
They started off on the road at Times Square this morning on their way to Albany .
You can follow their progress on the website and they ’re offering an incentive for people to pick them up : one of their lucky drivers wil be chosen to be flown out to their 50th state capital to party with them .
Which begs the question :
How are they driving to Honolulu anyway ?
I asked them , and I ’ll have the answer for you shortly .
DIGG THIS
Market volatility in recent days prompts one to ask , “ Just what is going on here ? ”
The quick answer is that Federal Reserve manipulation of the money supply causes these crisis periods when previously available Fed money is no longer available .
The long answer requires a very winding explanation .
The Federal Reserve , however , still plays a major role in the long answer .
The Federal Reserve has been pumping new money into the economy for decades .
A lot of this new money , not surprisingly , has found its way into the mortgage markets .
With Wall Street ’s “ securitization ” of the mortgage industry , close examination of mortgage borrowers disappeared .
Banks and mortgage companies had incentives to originate mortgage loans , but since they sold the mortgages off ( via securitization ) they had no incentive to carefully weigh the risks of individual mortgages .
If you had a warm body , banks and mortgage companies only had incentive to figure out how to get you a loan .
Bad credit , no problem .
Ca n’t afford to make monthly interest rate payments , no problem .
Thus , we had the era of “ no docs ” mortgages and “ Adjustable rate ” mortgages with early year rates set sometimes at zero often times at 1 % .
On the buying end of these securitized mortgages were institutions with faulty economic models .
These models were quantitative in nature .
As Austrian economists have warned many times , economics is a qualitative science , not a quantitative science .
This is so because the world of human action contains no constants , when you are dealing with humans everything is a variable .
The models designed by these institutions must therefore assume that some variable is a constant , since an equation with all variables just ca n’t be .
Some of these variables will indeed over very long periods of time “ act ” like constants in their relationship with other factors and not change much .
These are the variables that econometricians plug in as constants to design their equations .
Every once and awhile one of these pseudo - constants begins to act up and act like a variable again .
At such time , the variable will blow up the misplaced belief in the equation and quite possibly blow up an investment portfolio or even an entire economy .
The designers and money managers who believe in these equations are in fact playing “ Equation Roulette . "
The blow - ups can occur at any time .
The collapse of funds like Long Term Capital Management ( Equations designed by Nobel Prize winning econometricians ! ) and the current hedge fund blow - ups ( because of subprime mortgage investments held ) always collapse because variables start to dance .
In the subprime mortgage arena , the variables are dancing .
The equations used as the data points of how mortgages would perform come from the data from the decades of the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s , before securitization .
So the models did not take into account the change in the way banks and mortgage firms would change the types of mortgages they would originate if they did not have to worry about the risk .
Thus , a market of nutty mortgages , with no docs and , goofy ARM ’s structures , developed , one that only an econometrician with nutty equations in hand would buy — encouraged by a Fed pumping money in so that real estate flippers could hide the fact the mortgages were nutty .
Along this happy road of Equation Roulette , before the subprime crisis started to bloom , the government stepped in with small changes in some regulations as to who could get mortgage financing .
Naturally , the econometricians in their models did n’t include for a change in regulations , but this change in regulations started the subprime crisis .
At the margin , these regulation changes took out some of the real estate flippers .
For the first time in decades , there was a small decline in the true number of real estate buyers .
The few smart , more detailed oriented , buyers of subprime paper picked this trend up and stopped buying the subprime paper .
The Fed was still printing money , it was just starting to be re-directed .
The smarter players just started to put their money into LBO ’s and private equity deals instead of mortgage securities .
The decline in subprime paper buyers , coupled with the regulation changes , formed the start of the subprime crisis in near perfect storm timing , since these factors dovetailed with the first zero percent and 1 % ARM mortgages coming due for readjustment and the Fed notching interest rates up a bit .
This was a formula for disaster .
Equation roulette was about to blow up another batch of econometricians .
As default rates climbed , more and more subprime paper buyers backed away from the subprime market , until we have reached the point today where there is near zero liquidity in the subprime market .
The near zero liquidity of these highly leveraged funds has resulted in margin calls , panic , and some of these funds being forced to sell positions in other sectors of the market .
But , this crisis is near over .
The Fed has come to the “ rescue . "
Just today it has pumped $ 19 billion in new reserves into the banking system by buying mortgage securities .
My rough calculation suggests that over the last two days the Federal Reserve has pumped in enough new reserves to increase the money supply by somewhere between 10 % and 15 % .
This is a stunning number .
The money supply in a year rarely grows by 10 % , for it to do so in 48 hours is mind - boggling .
Yes , the Fed has come to the rescue by further pushing the dollar on the road to collapse .
While most eyes are on the current mortgage crisis , the bigger danger is the potential collapse of the dollar on foreign exchange markets .
The dollar has been slowly falling in value against most currencies for a while .
It is at multi - decade lows in some cases .
I have feared a further major collapse of the dollar even before the Fed ’s moves over the last two days .
The mortgage crisis will pass .
The Fed will print its way out of this crisis .
But , the dollar crisis is ahead and the Fed wo n’t be able to print its way out of that since it ’s been
Fed money printing that is the cause of the world being flooded with dollars .
From the outrageous money printing that fueled the mortgage “ boom ” to the Fed “ rescue , " the Fed step by step is setting up the economy for inflation and a crash of the dollar that wo n’t just affect mortgage holders and hedge funds , but anyone holding deteriorating dollars in their bank accounts and wallets .

The Best of Robert Wallach
" Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity . "

Battle lines are being drawn between mums who hothouse children - and the Beta mums who do n't .
So whose side are you on ?
A new Mummy War has broken out over the " best " way to bring up children - and it's causing a deep and rancorous gulf between two tribes of women who regard each other with disdain and dislike .
But this time the battle for school gate superiority has less to do with whether or not women work full - time or stay at home , and everything to do with time management versus tree climbing .
Step forward the Alpha and Beta mothers .
The Alpha mother has reigned supreme for more than a decade .
Scroll down for more
Held up as an aspirational role model for the rest of us , she never has a hair out of place and can be spotted tapping urgently into her Blackberry on the school run .
This sort of woman treats parenthood as a project to be managed down to the last second .
Fiercely organised , she 's likely to be highpowered and well - educated .
Are n't you feeling inferior already ?
But there 's more to an Alpha mum than that .
She treats her home life as an extension of her corporate one : family time is merely another slot
in the bulging diary .
Her children are seamlessly ferried between extra curricular activities with little to no time to spare for relaxation or , God forbid , just
thinking .
Doing nothing is not an option for these youngsters .
For too long this pernicious style of over - parenting has been held up as a barometer of maternal success .
But now , at last , there is a Beta backlash from the millions of mothers who cannot and will not see their children turned into little automatons with no aim in life but to strive relentlessly for as many accolades and achievements as possible .
The battle has burst into life in the U.S. with the publication of a series of books aimed at persuading mothers that less is more when it comes to organising your family 's lives .
Even a TV presenter - classic Alpha mum material , surely - has written a parenting guide called Good Enough Mother : The Perfectly Imperfect Book Of Parenting .
The author , CBS newsreader Rene Syler , insists : " Our children are people , not projects .
Motherhood is not a contest . "
Well , as a proud Beta mum , you can be sure I 'll be answering the call to arms in this battle for the hearts and minds of the next generation .
Though I hate the term Beta , with its inference of second - class parenting skills , I 'm happy to adopt it if it means I 'm not the other sort .
Because it 's long been clear to me that so - called Alpha parenting is not only ridiculous , it 's damaging to the children it purports to nurture .
So what does being a Beta mother mean ?
Well , if Alpha woman is in a power suit and stilettos striding along to her toddler 's Mandarin class , Beta mum is in sensible flats and jeans with children who speak , well , the same language as their friends .
And that 's just fine by me .
While an Alpha mother schemes to become a school governor , the Beta mum can never quite remember the date of the school fair .
Now there is good news for our style of parenting .
New studies are backing us up , proving that
when children enjoy childhood , it is good for their development .
Here 's the science : more relaxed mothers mean happier children .
" Alpha mums are so determined to make a project out of everything , they are not considering or loving the child , who becomes an object of status or self - glorification for the mother , " says Brenda Shoshanna , an author of books on family stress .
Ah yes , the child as a pride - inducing social accessory .
A kind of toddling Tamagotchi to be taken out every so often , tampered with and packed off somewhere else .
We 've all heard these women boasting about their babies ' achievements .
Whenever I meet a professional working mother who begins our chat with " Michael 's speaking some Spanish , he 's only 18 months " , I want to scream ' So what ! ' quickly followed by ' The poor thing " .
Down the years , I 've worked as a pre- school assistant , clown and drama teacher , and I have yet to meet the child who , when asked what makes them happy , says : " Being busy all the time with a variety of learning experiences . "
Years ago , I worked on a summer camp for the daughters of extremely rich New Yorkers .
The mothers would totter up to the cabin in kitten heels , peck the girls on the cheek and drive away for three weeks , feeling good that their offspring were learning new skills .
At night , half the ten - year - olds cried themselves to sleep .
Katie , an angry girl who bossed everyone around , said through her sobs :
" We want to be with our parents .
But they send us away .
Do n't they love us ? "
Alpha mothers put greater emphasis on a child 's perceived success , while Beta mums value their child 's happiness .
For Alpha parents , staying ahead of the pack educationally is an obsession - and one I believe
is truly hateful because of the pressure it puts young children under .
It 's also likely to be counterproductive .
In psychologist Oliver James ' book Affluenza , about the modern " disease " of longing to be rich , he finds a higher incidence rate of neurotic illness among girls from wealthier families .
Since their earliest years , they have been taught that approval comes with good grades .
Success is striven for with such vigour that it leads the girls to self - harm , drugs and anorexia .
The responsibility for a great deal of this behaviour lies with misguided Alpha parents who link affection and pride to test results .
A child from such a family will feel that getting a B - grade means they are less loved , and can in turn lead to a spiral of unhappiness and anxiety .
So should a child 's formative years be seen as an opportunity to compete , cram and get ahead or are they a joyous time of experimentation and chaotic liberty ?
One of the clearest ways to spot an Alpha or a Beta mum is to ask them about the highly emotive subject of reading age .
With literacy levels dependant on your school catchment area , it 's no wonder parents are frantic to get children off to a good start .
But guess what , children do not need to read at four .
Great if your child is the one in 10,000 who has the IQ of Einstein and naturally reads early .
Otherwise there are many other things that are more important for a three or four - year - old to learn - such as creativity and lifelong skills such as problem - solving and perseverance .
My eldest daughter , Alexandra , will be seven this year .
As we live in France , despite having started Maternelle ( kindergarten ) at four , she is only now making her first sing - song efforts to read .
In France , as in Germany ( and many other European countries ) , the nursery years are seen as a time to introduce toddlers to a rich learning environment .
The social aspects of good behaviour , politeness and , most of all , playing group games are rightly concentrated upon .
Reading comes much later .
As a Beta mother , I am not immune to anxieties and hopes about my girls ' education .
But my concern is that they find it a thrilling , inspiring experience .
I certainly do n't worry about their future career prospects .
Their childhood is too precious .
All mothers - but especially Alphas - need to think carefully about what our main duty is as parents , both to our offspring and to society as a whole .
Should we be fostering future generations of imaginative , giving , contented adults , or training our children to be grade - obsessed , moneymaking machines ?
When my girls come home from school , they want to play with dollies together or hide and seek with their father and me .
So that 's what we do .
Our home is full of books , which Alex picks up of her own choice , from time to time .
This is the philosophy which allows your child to find their way in life , not to be forced into interests and disciplines they may come to loathe .
" There 's an illusion that you can control who your child will become if you do all the right things , " says clinical psychologist Daphne de Marneffe .
" But parenting is about discovering who your child is and fostering growth and development as an individual . "
Basically , a more laissez - faire attitude should not hinder a child 's ability to learn .
You can tell if a toddler 's mother is a Beta by looking around the home .
Our house is an assault course of building blocks ( on the living room floor ) , tubs of paint ( the dining table ) , with pipe cleaners and beads in Holly and Alex 's bedroom ( last night 's attempt at making stick people ) .
What you wo n't find are toys that are supposed to teach .
Again Beta parenting has always been the power of instinct over intellect .
Experts have borne out our suspicion of gadgets and gizmos .
Research reveals that building blocks
and Play - Doh are far better for learning than high - tech educational toys and videos , simply because they are more interactive .
Betas know that traditional toys ( as opposed to shiny , expensive ones - or even tutors ) mean real family interaction .
" Making " and " doing " is what children enjoy best .
And they want to do it with Mummy .
It can be dull threading beads for your daughter 's bracelet .
But this is what real family life is about : interplay , interaction and love .
It 's hard to see where any of these elements come into the lives of the children with the most excessively Alpha parents .
An Alpha mother is likely to view such messy , sticky playthings as a waste of time - unless there is a nanny doing it with the children , I suppose .
So yes , it 's about time an anti-Alpha movement
emerged - I 'm just surprised it did n't happen earlier .
Give yourself a cheer if you 've ever forgotten
it 's half - term and raced to an empty school .
Or if your child speaks only one language at the age of five .
We must not be frightened out of good , honest parenting by the need to keep up some absurd appearance .
Pity the Alpha mums , because there 's a serious
question these women need to ask themselves .
Are those extra hours at work really essential
to pay for the preprep school fees , tutors or all
those extra curricular classes ?
Is it really necessary to spend time meticulously planning the family 's diary a month in advance so not a moment is wasted ?
Should n't the Alpha mums admit that the life they have constructed is not for the children 's sake at all .
Is n't it all really done because they actually rather dislike spending time with their family ?
• So are Alpha or Beta mums better for children ?

A pet detective who is temporarily suspended after rescuing a dog from a locked and overheated car says he was just doing what his mandate asks him to do – save animals ' lives .
Tre Smith , an animal cruelty investigator for the Toronto Humane Society and former mall security guard , is not allowed to investigate animal cruelty complaints pending an investigation in which he handcuffed the owner of the dog to a car .
But the highly publicized pet saving incident has ignited emotion and feedback from hundreds of pet owners and swamped the Toronto Humane Society with letters and emails calling for his reinstatement .
On July 31 , Smith responded to a call that Cyrus , a 50 - kg Rottweiler , was locked in an overheated car .
The Toronto Humane Society investigator smashed through the car window , rescued the dying dog , who was slumped and foaming at the mouth , and handcuffed the irate owner to the car .
He then rushed the dog to a hospital , leaving the man there handcuffed until police arrived on the scene .
" I was trying to perform my job to the best of my abilities given a very difficult , threatening and abusive situation , " said Smith .
But reports soon followed that the handcuffed dog owner was beaten by the crowd and was bleeding when police arrived , so the Ontario SPCA has hired a retired Ontario Provincial Police officer to probe the incident and determine whether Smith had followed proper protocol or overstepped his limits .
It seems public sentiment for Smith in cyberspace is growing .
There are more than 10 Facebook groups calling for his reinstatement .
Archaeologists think the tunnel leads to the Kidron River
The channel was buried under the rubble of the Second Temple , which was destroyed by Roman conquerors in the Siege of Jerusalem .
Scores of people are thought to have sheltered and lived in the tunnel until they were able to flee the city .
Several parts of the tunnel have been preserved intact .
Refuge
The tunnel is believed to have been Jerusalem 's main drainage channel at the time of the Roman conquest , stretching beneath the city and eventually reaching the Dead Sea , the Israel Antiquities Authority said in a statement .
" The channel ... is covered with heavy stone slabs that are actually the paving stones of the street .
" In some places the channel reaches a height of about three metres and is one metre wide , so that it is possible to walk in it comfortably , " the statement said .
Eli Shukron of the Antiquities Authority said : " It was a place where people hid and fled to from burning , destroyed Jerusalem . "
Mr Shukron said excavators looking for Jerusalem 's main road from the time of the Second Temple happened to find a small drainage channel .
That led them to the larger tunnel beneath the road .

Where archaeology is politics
Pottery shards and coins from the end of the Second Temple period were also discovered inside the tunnel .
About 100 metres of tunnel has been excavated so far , stretching north from the Shiloah Pool at the Old City 's southern end to about 10 metres west of the Western Wall ( the so - called Wailing Wall ) , which is all that is left of the Second Temple .
Archaeologists think the tunnel leads to the Kidron River , which empties into the Dead Sea .
The destruction of the Second Temple is still mourned annually on the Jewish fast Tisha B'Av .

City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week , a police spokesman said Wednesday .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero , but New York city officials said no .
The controversial , outspoken president wanted to " pay his respects " and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks during his visit to the U.N. General Assembly , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said , citing Iranian officials .
But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site , " and it would not be possible for him to go where other people do n't go , " Kelly told CNN .
Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero , police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN .
But , he said , " If there were a further request , we 'd reject it " because of security fears .
Watch why New York said no to Iranian leader »
The Iranian mission to the U.N. said it had not been told of the decision , but in a statement issued Wednesday evening , it called the rejection " unfortunate . "
Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda .
Ahmadinejad 's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks , Mohammed Khatami , condemned them , and Tehran cooperated with the U.S. - led campaign to topple al Qaeda 's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed .
The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days .
The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center , when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers .
A third jet hit the Pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers .
" It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad , one of the world 's leading sponsors of terror , would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground , " State Department spokesman Tom Casey said .
Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit .
Hillary Clinton , the New York senator and Democratic front - runner , called the request " unacceptable . "
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , a leading Republican , called it " shockingly audacious . "
And former Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his GOP presidential bid -- said that " under no circumstances " should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site .
Zalmay Khalilzad , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the site should not be " used as a photo op . "
Numerous critics have attacked Ahmadinejad 's hard - line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy U.N. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium .
Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants , but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb .

Warning
If you 're planning to take the test , we strongly recommend that you take it before viewing the following page ( which you will also see at the end of the test along with your personal results ) .
We feel that knowing too much about the way the final results are presented will influence the way you respond , and prevent you from getting an accurate reading .
The analysis is presented here for the many people who asked for a way to come back to it without having to go through the whole test again .
Can you remember the last time you were out in public without your phone in your hand or somewhere on your person ?
While you ’re grabbing lunch you might have it resting on the counter while you search for your credit card in your wallet .
Then when you go to the bathroom you might leave it on top of the toilet paper dispenser .
And , at the end of the day when you take the train or bus home , you switch it from hand to hand as you navigate public transportation while still staying on top of all your notifications .
How many germs are actually on your phone ?
Let ’s face it :
Your phone is a breeding ground for germs .
And what is especially unsanitary about it is how close you put it to your face and mouth on a regular basis .
Scientists at the University of Arizona found that your phone is ten times dirtier than most toilet seats .
Gross !
Here are other items that are dirtier than a toilet seat .
Another study also found that a typical high schooler ’s smartphone can have as many as 17,000 bacterial gene copies on it .
Think about that the next time you press your phone up against your face to make a phone call .
“ Your phone is exposed to everything you touch .
What ’s on your hands is on your phone .
Health - care experts stress that washing your hands frequently with soap and water is the best defense against the spread of germs that cause sicknesses and viruses to spread , ” shares Adriana Catinari , Product Manager at Whoosh !
You should also be washing your phone on a regular basis too , here ’s how to properly clean it .
Why do phones get so germy ?
Everyone always remembers to wash their hands multiple times a day , but many times neglect their phone screen .
The reason your phone holds so many germs is because it remains warm throughout the day because of how often we use it .
The warm environment allows bacteria to grow very easily and puts you at a greater risk of getting infected .
The germs on our phones can also lead to the development of acne and blackheads on your face .
When your phone is pressed against your face while you ’re on a call the surface of our skin warms up , opening up our pores .
The bacterium then gets into your pores causing skin irritation .
Here are some other germ spreading items you ’re probably carrying right now .
How can you keep your phone clean ?
Catrinari suggests using one of the many products offered by Whoosh ! to help keep your phone screen germ free .
“ It is the best way to “ wash ” your phone , ultimately , stopping the spread of germs that grow on the dirt that accumulates on your phone , ” she said .
You can also purchase phone cleaning kits to make sure you get every nook and cranny and smartphone sanitizing stations that use UV light to kill germs .
It ’s obviously unrealistic to tell people to give up their phones to stay healthier since most people do n’t even know how to function without them .
But always keep in mind how many things you touch during the day , and how gross your phone can get as a result of that .
Continue to wash your hands frequently throughout the day but also remember to wash your phone screen just as often .
Now learn how to clean all of the digital screens you own .

Helicopter vs. Bicycle
I 'm a little uncomfortable with the framing that we need to leave Iraq in order to spend more time competing against China , but in general , Tom Friedman 's column today is pretty sound .
And this really is a well - chosen closer :
I heard a U.S. officer in Baghdad tell this story :
His unit was on a patrol in a Sunni neighborhood when it got hit by an I.E.D.
Fortunately , the bomb exploded too soon and no one was hurt .
His men jumped out and followed the detonation wire , which led 1,500 feet into the neighborhood .
A U.S. Black Hawk helicopter was in the area and alerted the U.S. soldiers that a man was fleeing the scene on a bicycle .
The soldiers asked the Black Hawk for help , and it swooped down and used its rotor blades to blow the insurgent off his bicycle , with a giant “ whoosh , ” and the U.S. soldiers captured him .
That image of a $ 6 million high - tech U.S. helicopter with a highly trained pilot blowing an insurgent off his bicycle captures the absurdity of our situation in Iraq .
The great Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi said it best : “ Great powers should never get involved in the politics of small tribes . ”
On the other hand , it really should n't worry us that the Chinese are expanding the number of students doing advanced graduate work in renewable energy development .
The formation of affordable alternatives to fossil fuels is a positive sum endeavor , in which Chinese innovation will be saving the same world as American innovation .
The better they do , the better we 'll do .
Indeed , this is the gigantic upside of Chinese development and education -- it enables that many more people to develop awesome , fun , and / or important stuff that we can all use .

Actually , the threat from the " educated chinese " is vastly overblown , since they are all suffering from serious lead poisoning ( imagine what level domestic chinese toys have ) ; slows brain development and all that .
I think the rate of elevated lead levels in chinese children is something like 40 % ; one would have to think mercury and such is just as bad or worse .
BTW , Ezra , you 're part of the " new blogging elite " as quoted in the WSJ ?
Goodness , someone has a high opinion of himself . . .
Posted by : Scott | Sep 12 , 2007 10:39:36 AM
No , in my quote , Sommer is .
This is why you should n't talk to reporters , though : I used the term to explain why the new blogging moment would n't be different from old moments .
Every profession has an elite -- non-profit journalism did , and so does broadcast , academia , etc -- and as one develops in blogging , the best way to get ahead wo n't be meritocratic , but social .
In this way , blogging was n't going to save us all , but just be a retread of the same old story .
That , of course , is not how the quote came out ;-)
Posted by : Ezra | Sep 12 , 2007 10:47:07 AM
While I mostly agree with you that it 's a positive - sum game , I think I 'd prefer the position of selling alternative energy solutions to Chinese to buying them from Chinese companies .
As a fallback position , it would be nice to be able to compete with Chinese companies for sales to European households .
But it 's not clear we 'll be in a position to do that , either .
One of the things that aggravates me the most about " Republican't " energy policies is the way they refuse to see the way forward as an opportunity instead of a retreat .

We 're gradually evolving towards a kind of global symbiosis : the rest of the world makes shit , and the US blows shit up .
It 's really beautiful in its simplicity when you think about it .
I 'm surprised Mr. " Suck on This " is n't welcoming this new development -- maybe he just has n't thought up any good metaphors for it yet .

Off topic maybe , but I 'm stuck back at the assumption that the man on the bike was an insurgent .
Maybe he got a long - desired booty call on his cell phone and wanted to get there before she changed her mind .
Maybe he 's just a guy who heard an explosion and decided the best place to be was somewhere else .
Not an unreasonable assumption , is it ?
My point is that we really do n't know if all these people shot as " insurgents " were in fact insurgents .

Oh , yes we do know that , for certain values of know .

Are they dead ?
Yes .
Did we kill them ?
Yes
Therefore ...?
They were insurgents .

See how easy that syllogism is ?

Friedman loved the war when it was shock - and - awe .
He could metaphorically beat his chest and challenge Arabs to " suck on this " .
Now its just knocking foreigners off bicycles its no fun anymore .
Poor guy .

I 'm stuck back at the assumption that the man on the bike was an insurgent .
He was knocked off his bike , arrested , ( presumably ) imprisoned and beaten , as were ( probably ) his immediate family and friends , by the wonderful Iraqi police .
If he was n't an insurgent before , I reckon he is one now .

The comments to this entry are closed .
I have written about this earlier , and as I stated there , this blog is not about politics .
It is about our minds and the media .
But when this administration has consistently utilized the media to warp the facts of reality , and to support the cause for war , I have a moral obligation to say something .
As I said in my previous entry on this matter we have all got to wise up to the fact that the greatest concern we have as a nation right now is that brazen loose cannon is in charge of our military right now , and he has seen fit to wage war for his own reasons in the past , and he may see fit to do so before he leaves ( or is removed ) from office .
Tomdispatch.com has posted an article by Michael Kare that isolates the very clear language that Bush himself has regularly been using in speeches to make a case for war against Iran .
The fact that reasons for war with Iran are circulating through the administration should give you a serious chill .
It not only means that they are regularly discussing the matter , it means that they are manipulating facts and events to support their case — that is what this administration does .
This administration did not need facts to go to war with Iraq .
The facts were presented as ad hoc logic after the administration had already made the decision to go to war .
From Bob Woodward ’s book , Plan of Attack :
In early January 2001 , before George W. Bush was inaugurated Vice President - elect Dick Cheney passed a message to the outgoing secretary of defense , William S. Cohen , a moderate Republican who served in the Democratic Clinton Administration .
“ We really need to get the rpesident - elect briefed up on some things , ” Cheney said , adding that he wanted a serious “ discussion about Iraq and different options . ”
Bush is not discussing Iran because he feels he needs justification , nor is he anymore interested in finding international support than he was the last time .
He has shown little to no remorse with regards to the horrendous execution of the Iraq war .
He is a President who sees his role as primarily a decision maker ( “ decider ” ) who can afford to leave the strategy , the tactics and the blowback in someone else ’s likely incapable hands .
And this means that the fallout from a war with Iran is not nearly as important to him as the possibility for one .
Help stop him .
One of the many challenges facing quantum computing is finding a practical material from which to process the quantum information -- the material must not be so exotic such that it becomes too prohibitive and expensive to use for mass calculations .
That 's why a recently discovered hidden magnetic " quantum order " in ceramic has scientists in such a tizzy .
By heating or doping the material with a variety of impurities , scientists from the London Center for Nanotechnology have found a way to propagate magnetic excitations over long chains of atoms in the otherwise magnetically disordered material .
Armed then , with the ability to break the chains into independent sub-chains , each with it 's own hidden order , scientists have taken the first step towards engineering spin - based quantum states from ceramics .
Right , the quantum analogy to those good ol ' 1 and 0 state changes used by today 's not - so - super computers .

Posted on September 6 , 2007 , Stephany Wacky Jacky Subpoenas George W. Bush
Jack Thompson has filed documents with a federal court in Florida requesting to subpoena President George W. Bush for a deposition to retain Thompson ’s license to practice law .
Thompson , the bane of gamers everywhere , is in the midst of two ethic complaints which were filed by the Florida Bar and will face a court appointed mediator on November 26th .
Wacky Jacky is currently suing the mediator , Judge Dava Tunis , along with the Florida Supreme Court and the Florida Bar .
Thompson ’s reasons for subpoenaing
The President are a bit esoteric and would make great fodder for an X - Files episode or anything else in the realm of conspiracy theories and Science Fiction .
This bit of paranoia stems from the “ nefarious ” Blank Rome law firm , which represents the defendants in the Strickland vs .
Sony lawsuit where an 18 - year old in Alabama was allegedly under the influence of Grand Theft Auto when he murdered two police officers and a police dispatcher in 2004 .
Apparently , the “ evil ” Blank Rome firm are lobbyists as well as Republican donors and Thompson believes that the law firm was the main culprit in having him thrown off the case by an Alabama Circuit Court judge in November , 2005 .
The Bar complaints filed by Judge Tunis are in relation to this case and Thompson ’s conduct when he failed to have Bully declared a public nuisance last October .
In the document filed yesterday with the U.S. District Court , Thompson stated :
“ I have already sent the George and Jeb Bush subpoenas to Referee Tunis for her signature .
She may run on this , but she ca n’t hide .
She must sign the subpoenas , as her filing [ of the Thompson Bar complaints ] with the federal court has made the testimony I seek in the depositions of both men highly relevant to my Bar defense .
If the President ’s position is that I do not get to depose him while he is in office , then I would note that Paula Jones ’ lawyers were able to convince a federal judge otherwise .
If President Bush is successful is convincing the court that I must wait until he leaves office , that ’s something I am prepared to do . ”
If indeed Thompson has to wait until President Bush leaves office in January 2009 , Thompson would be able to get a dig in at the Florida Bar by making them wait to voice their complaints .
But , does he actually think that President Bush would actually appear ?
In his own demented fantasy world , he may actually think this , but it is not very likely .
Thompson is also seeking a subpoena for President Bush ’s brother Jeb , the former governor of Florida – who ’s next ?
Bush ’s dogs Barney and Miss Beazley ?

A whole raft of constitutional reform plans have been outlined
Freedom of Information laws could be extended to cover some private firms and planned increases in the cost of making such requests have been axed .
Mr Brown has also appointed Daily Mail chief Paul Dacre to review the 30 - year limit on releasing government papers .
In a speech on liberty , he also set out plans for a Bill of Rights and Duties and a possible written constitution .
Justice Minister Michael Wills said any " fundamental alteration in the powers of Parliament " would likely be put to the public in a referendum .
The Conservatives called Mr Wills ' comments " extraordinary " in the light of a vote on the EU treaty being ruled out .
In his speech , Mr Brown said he wanted to protect traditional British liberties in the modern age and build on the constitutional changes he first announced in July .
" I believe that by applying our enduring ideals to new challenges we can start immediately to make changes to our constitution and laws to safeguard and extend the liberties of our citizens , " said Mr Brown .
Private firms
Mr Brown announced a review of protest laws in Parliament Square to ensure " people 's right to protest outside the very heart of our democracy - the House of Commons - is not subject to unnecessary restrictions " .
He also launched a three month public consultation on extending the scope of the Freedom of Information Act , which allows the public to request confidential information from public bodies .
Mr Brown said : " Freedom of Information can be inconvenient , at times frustrating and indeed embarrassing for governments .
KEY POINTS
Review of data protection laws 30 - year - rule could be scrapped Parliament Square protest ban reviewed No increase in Freedom of Information ( FOI ) request fees FOI could be extended to some private firms Government to publish National Security Strategy New rules on authorities ' power to enter homes
Referendum ' inevitable ' Protest laws ' reviewed ' UK 'needs Bill of Rights '
" But Freedom of Information is the right course because government belongs to the people , not the politicians . "
In future , it could cover private firms carrying out work in the public sector , such as security companies running prisons .
Mr Brown also announced a review of the 30 - year rule , saying that FOI meant it was now often possible to gain access to recent documents more easily than those from the past .
" It is time to look again at whether historical records can be made available for public inspection much more swiftly than under the current arrangements , " said the prime minister .
Private sector
Mr Dacre , editor - in - chief of Daily Mail and Evening Standard owner Associated Newspapers , former top civil servant Sir Joe Pilling and historian David Cannadine would review the rules .
Brown 's speech looks like a desperate attempt to resurrect his ' new politics ' which has already been discredited by his serial use of spin
Nick Herbert , shadow justice secretary
In full : Brown speech
Mr Brown said plans to restrict media reporting of coroners ' court proceedings would also be scrapped .
The prime minister also praised the work of Information Commissioner Richard Thomas who is to launch a review of personal data sharing safeguards in the public and private sector .
Mr Thomas will also move to protect legitimate investigative journalists from a planned crackdown on the trade in personal data , such as utility bills and health records .
The commissioner said the prime minister " has sent significant signals to Whitehall and the rest of the public sector that FOI must be taken seriously " .
Alan Beith , chairman of the constitutional affairs committee , also welcomed the speech but said he was " disappointed " Mr Brown had ignored calls for independent funding for the information commissioner .
" Can it be appropriate for the Ministry of Justice to set the funding levels for the independent regulator and thereby directly influence its capacity to investigate complaints ? , " said Mr Beith .
The Conservatives have , meanwhile , reported the government to Mr Thomas for allegedly blocking or delaying a series of Tory requests for information .
Civil liberties
" We are calling for an urgent investigation by the Information Commissioner into exactly what role ministers have played in this subversion , " said shadow work and pensions spokesman Chris Grayling .
" If Gordon Brown is serious about increasing openness , he should start by practicing what he preaches . "
Shadow Justice Secretary Nick Herbert said : " Brown 's speech looks like a desperate attempt to resurrect his ' new politics ' which has already been discredited by his serial use of spin . "
Lib Dem justice spokesman David Heath said : " One of the main threats to civil liberties over the last decade has been the behaviour of an increasingly overbearing Labour government that has transformed Britain into a surveillance state .
" If Gordon Brown is genuinely signalling a change of heart then that is good news , but authoritarianism seems to run deep in the lifeblood of this government . "

The courts are beginning to voice their mistrust of the admin too :
A federal judge struck down parts of the revised USA Patriot Act on Thursday , saying investigators must have a court 's approval before they can order Internet providers to turn over records without telling customers .
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero said the government orders must be subject to meaningful judicial review and that the recently rewritten Patriot Act " offends the fundamental constitutional principles of checks and balances and separation of powers . "

And do n't forget the scientists who do n't buy the story either .
A fellow named Enrico at Winter Patriot summed up the reason most " active deniers " can't see their ass from a hole in the Pentagon ...
" I admit that on their own , each of the clues does n’t add up to much : orange rivulets of burning hot liquid seeping from the structure , poofs of air prior to collapse , complete disintegration of the structure , the sheared off top of the building failing to adhere to the law of conservation of motion … etc etc .
The thing is together they do form a picture .
I ca n’t imagine how appallingly bad these people must be at jigsaws , leave out one piece and they ’d be there till doomsday trying to figure out what the picture was . "
You know the type ... you deal with them all the time here , do n't you ?
This picture right here is to me the hardest thing for the " scaredies " to explain .
Explain it three times , please .
Might I then add that the NIST report only explains the event leading up to the collapse , they do not explain the collapse itself .
Nor did they do an alternative hypothesis regarding the use of explosives .
I cry bullshit from the tallest steel - framed building .
I would also like to see a mid-term vote for the presidency , every two years , so that the installment and the removal of the president is guaranteed by the people , not a plutocracy .

Thank you for stating this Bradblog Brad .
FEDERAL World Trade Tower Building # 7 is bush 's blowjob .
While there are 100's of errors and omissions to the official 9/11 congressional record , A couple important observations must be noted .
1 . NO ARABS OR PLANES WERE INVOLVED IN THE CONTROLLED DEMOLITION OF BUILDING # 7 .
Instead of putting out a small controllable fire on 1 of the floors , the 47 story skyscraper surrounded by firemen and policemen gave a 30 second countdown .
6 seconds later the building was turned to dust .
2 . The corporate mass media has backed the treasonous cheney administration story from day 1 and anyone in popular culture intelligently questioning this official arab patsy story has been labeled a conspiracy nut .
The Popular Mechanics yellow journalism version is a good example of a total bushit piece written by criminals who have had everything to gain playing the terror card .
3 . This is not the 1st state sponsored attack , in fact there have been many examples of false flag war games staged over the years , many times to justify an invasion or start a war .
A few examples , Hilter 's stage a false flag attack as an excuse to attack Poland in WWII .
The US staged war games in the Gulf of Tompkin used to justify the US military escalation into Vietnam .
A Joint Chief of Staff state sponsored false flag attack plan called Operation Northwoods was set to fly as an excuse for a " retaliation " attack against Cuba until President Kennedy shot it down .
It is also common for the military to be running " battle exercises " at the time of the said attack because the aliby fits like OJ 's glove .
4 . Marvin bush brother of president GW bush was a former chairman on the board of the security company for the World Trade Towers .
You have to have entry to plant bombs for a controlled demolition and it is safe to assume that easy access was granted for the controlled demolition experts who wire the 3 towers .
5 . A government issued version of thermite called thermate used to cut the iron supports can be seen dripping down the side of a tower .
While most evidence was immediately collected and sent overseas instead of investigated , there is some evidence of thermate collected from the site of building # 7 .
Ask yourself this , if the building was evacuated hours earlier , why would the evidense be confiscated and send overseas instead of performing a forensic investigation ?
BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE COVER UP .
6 . The media was tipped off about the planned demolition of # 7 .
In fact there are 2 British news video accounts explaining how another World Trade Tower has fallen with 1 problem .
The frigin building did fall yet and you can see it still standing in the backround moments before it was " pulled . "
7 . # 7 owner , Larry Sliverstein like cheney and bush have never faced indictment .
Interestingly enough he made a statement on TV along the lines that since there was such a loss of life on this day that we decided to pull the building .
In the biz the term " pulled " is used for taking a building down controlled demolition .
8 . While these bush administration criminals did not have to testify before congress , Rumsfeld was being lobbed a bunch of softballs by Republican controlled congress he testified .
Then Cynthia McKinney asked him what happened to the 1 Trillion dollars that went missing the day before .
The treasonous bastard squirmed and made faces but of course they found a way of getting rid of the 1 congressman who was really interested in 9/11 truth by fixing an electronic election .
9 . They can take their shrub missile that hit the Pentagon and shove it up their executive privileged ace but an important part of " we the people " taking back OUR country is putting these lying treasonous mass murderers and their anti-environmental agenda into world court for orchestrating 9/11 .
10 . WHY ?
For people who cannot get why these greedy inbred oil baron parasites would carry out this despicable crime to their own people , here it is :
To consolidate executive power , shred and weaken the constitutional form of government to the brink of crisis , and give the military industrial complex a blank check to attack Iraq FOR THE OIL .
This would also allow for the continued erosion of American rights and liberties as well as open the door for surveilance of the American people .
The fear and terror will be used as a mass media tool endlessly to increase their fascist ( corporate ) grip .

Occam's Razor states " all things being equal ... " well these events certainly are equals , adding to the overwhelming coincidence of three steel framed buildings collapsing in most peculiar ways for the first time in history .
The fact that these buildings were blown , is of course the simplest answer .
Not the pseudo science of " progressive collapse " or " pancake " .
Can anyone even calculate the probability of this happening so perfectly ?
Placing blame on certain individuals however does lead some away .
What if after a grand jury and the release of classified material , we find out that yes , the buildings were demolished , but the culprits are not who anyone expected them to be ?
I think it was the " B's " as well as the " C " , as most people do .
But I also wonder who 's collar they wear .
For all I know , it was ordered by the CEO of Exxon , or the PM of Israel .
Thus the need for a brand new impartial investigation .

What does Occam's Razor tell you about the ODDS that NORAD would be running a series of drills on the morning of 9/11 designed specifically to simulate an attack against America involving hijacked planes flown into buildings ?
What does Occam's Razor tell you about FEMA having been prepositioned in New York for the drill - which commenced at the same moment the first tower was struck ?
What does Occam's Razor tell you about the warning sent to Israeli Nationals two hours before the first plane struck ?
Ignoring everything you have seen and heard to brainwash you to the contrary in its aftermath , what are the odds that a man in a cave could beat all of the defenses of the United States of America by coincidentally timing his attack to coincide with a total shut down of NORAD ?
Occam 's razor states that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible , eliminating , or " shaving off " , those that make no difference in the observable predictions of the explanatory hypothesis or theory .
Pieces of aircraft were scattered over a five mile area in Pennsylvania .
WTC 7 - though untouched by an aircraft , fell directly into its own footprint less than two hours after its owner ordered the fire department to pull back from the structure in order to " pull it . "
5 Israeli Mossad Agents with explosives expertise were arrested for filming the destruction of the twin towers .
Their film has never been made public .
They failed seven polygraph tests .
They were quietly deported to Israel .
Norm Mineta testified before the 9/11 Commission that he personally witnessed Cheney commanding one of his subordinates in the bunker on the morning of 9/11 to allow the approaching aircraft to strike the Pentagon uncontested .
The manuvers made by the planes that struck both the Pentagon and the second WTC tower could not possibly have been made by any first time pilot - according to aviation experts .

Where is the video that was shot by the Dancing Israelis arrested on 9/11 ?
Where is the flight manifest including Arab names on any of the flights on 9/11 ?
Two planes hit two buildings in New York , yet three buildings fell down straight into their own footprint .
A man said by his flight instructor not to be able to fly at all performed a perfect 270 degree corkscrew descent over the heavily fortified Pentagon as Cheney ordered the stand down of air defenses ( per Norm Mineta ) - and struck the target with military precision ( according to the FAA controllers watching it all on their radar screens ) .

HOW IS THE WAR IN IRAQ TIED TO 9/11 AND HALLIBURTON’S ASBESTOS LIABILITY ?
ASK DICK FUCKING CHENEY THE QUESTION !
BUSH ORDERED THE LIE … PEOPLE ARE DYING : LEVELS OF ASBESTOS
A statement about discovery of asbestos at higher than safe levels in dust samples from lower Manhattan was changed to state that " samples confirm previous reports that ambient air quality meets OSHA ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration ) standards and consequently is not a cause for public concern . "
Language in an EPA draft stating that asbestos levels in some areas were three times higher than national standards was changed to " slightly above the 1 percent trigger for defining asbestos material . "
This sentence was added to a Sept. 16 news release : " Our tests show that it is safe for New Yorkers to go back to work in New York 's financial district . "
It replaced a statement that initial monitors failed to turn up dangerous samples .
A warning on the importance of safely handling ground zero cleanup , due to lead and asbestos exposure , was changed to say that some contaminants had been noted downtown but " the general public should be very reassured by initial sampling . "

Halliburton 's receipt of all the no-bid contracts was direct quid pro quo - highly illegal .
When Cheney was the CEO , he acquired Dresser to save the Bush Family 's ass .
Dresser made Asbestos , and the liability law suits were going to wipe them out .
Cheney took one for the team when he acquired Dresser and all its asbestos liability claims ( HAL was punished in the stock market ) ... the biggest of which was the WORLD TRADE CENTER , a $ 15 billion albatross that the Port Authority was hard pressed to get rid of .
When the Port Authority unloaded the buildings onto Silverstein , the fix was already in .
Cheney literally ran the entire operation on 9/11 ( as witnessed by Mineta ) and used Dov Zakheim 's SYSPLAN technology to guide the CONVERTED FUEL TANKERS to their targets ( remember the huge fireball that exploded OUTSIDE the building ? ) .
It was Cheney who instructed Christine Todd Whitman to lie about the levels of asbestos at ground zero , because he did n't want people to make the connection that the entire operation was simply arson on a grand scale , which eliminated a $ 15 billion liability from Halliburton 's books .
You see , the World Trade Towers were not the real estate plum we are led to believe .
From an economic standpoint , the trade center --- subsidized since its inception by the NY Port Authority --- has never functioned , nor was it intended to function , unprotected in the rough - and - tumble real estate marketplace .
How could Silverstein Group have been ignorant of this ?
The towers required some $ 200 million in renovations and improvements , most of which related to removal and replacement of building materials declared to be health hazards in the years since the towers were built .
It was well - known by the city of New York that the WTC was an asbestos bombshell .
For years , the Port Authority treated the building like an aging dinosaur , attempting on several occasions to get permits to demolish the building for liability reasons , but being turned down due the known asbestos problem .
Further , it was well - known the only reason the building was still standing until 9/11 was because it was too costly to disassemble the twin towers floor by floor since the Port Authority was prohibited legally from demolishing the buildings .
The projected cost to disassemble the towers : $ 15 Billion .
Just the scaffolding for the operation was estimated at $ 2.4 Billion !
In other words , the Twin Towers were condemned structures .
How convenient that an unexpected " terrorist " attack demolished the buildings completely .
WTC Building 7 was a part of the WTC complex , and covered under the same insurance policy .
This 47 - story steel - framed structure , which was NOT struck by an aircraft , mysteriously collapsed 8 hours later that same day into its own footprint at freefall speed - exactly in the manner of the Twin Towers .
THE PLANE THAT WAS SHOT DOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA WAS DESIGNATED SPECIFICALLY TO TAKE OUT BUILDING 7 .
COULD IT BE ANY MORE OBVIOUS ?
ASK RUDY .
ASK DAVID ROCKEFELLER .
ASK GHW BUSH .

When you view any video of the plane striking the second WTC Tower , is n’t it astounding how huge the fireball is that results ?
How much jet fuel was that …really ?
Remember the big Boeing Tanker lease scandal that arose just prior to 9/11 ?
Dov Zakheim , called for " some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor " being necessary to foster the frame of mind needed for the American public to support a war in the Middle East that would politically and culturally reshape the region .
A respected and established voice in the intelligence community , his views were eagerly accepted , and Dov went from his position at Systems Planning Corporation to become the Comptroller of the Pentagon in May 2001 .
Perhaps not so coincidentally , it was an SPC subsidiary , TRIDATA CORPORATION , that oversaw the investigation after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 .
SPC , according to their official website , specializes in many areas of defense technology production and manufacture , including a system developed by their Radar Physics Group called the Flight Termination System , or FTS .
This is a system used to destroy target drones ( craft that would be fired on by test aircraft or weaponry ) in the event of malfunction or " misses " .
This highly sophisticated war - game technology allows the control of several ' drones ' from a remote location , on varying frequencies , and has a range of several hundred miles .
This technology can be used on many different types of aircraft , including large passenger jets .
According to the SPC website , a recent customer at that time was Eglin AFB , located in Florida .
Eglin is very near another Air Force base in Florida - MacDill AFB , where Dov Zakheim contracted to send at least 32 Boeing 767 aircraft , as part of the Boeing / Pentagon tanker lease agreement .
The Boeing lease deal involved the replacement of the aging KC - 135 tanker fleet with these smaller , more efficient Boeing 767s that were to be leased by Dov Zakheim 's group .
The planes were to be refitted with refueling equipment , including lines and nozzle assemblies .

Missing Trillions
Rumsfeld Buries Admission of Missing 2 + Trillion Dollars in 9/10/01 Press Conference On September 10 , 2001 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld held a press conference to disclose that over $ 2,000,000,000,000 in Pentagon funds could not be accounted for .
Rumsfeld stated : " According to some estimates we cannot track $ 2.3 trillion in transactions . "
Such a disclosure normally would have sparked a huge scandal .
However , the commencement of the attack on New York City and Washington in the morning would assure that the story remained buried .
To the trillions already missing from the coffers , an obedient Congress terrorized by anthrax attacks would add billions more in appropriations to fight the " War on Terror . "
The Comptroller of the Pentagon at the time of the attack was Dov Zakheim , who was appointed in May of 2001 .
Before becoming the Pentagon 's money - manager , he was an executive at System Planning Corporation , a defense contractor specializing in electronic warfare technologies including remote - controlled aircraft systems .
Zakheim is a member of the Project for a New American Century and participated in the creation of its 2000 position paper Rebuilding America 's Defenses which called for " a New Pearl Harbor . "

Wittenberg convincingly argued there was absolutely no possibility that Flight 77 could have " descended 7,000 feet in two minutes , all the while performing a steep 270 degree banked turn before crashing into the Pentagon 's first floor wall without touching the lawn . " …
" For a guy to just jump into the cockpit and fly like an ace is impossible - there is not one chance in a thousand , " said Wittenberg , recalling that when he made the jump from Boeing 727's to the highly sophisticated computerized characteristics of the 737's through 767's it took him considerable time to feel comfortable flying .

“ We are proud to have the support of Marx Ayres , a nationally recognized expert in building energy systems and earthquake damage to building nonstructural systems , in our search for the truth about the events of 9/11 . ” , said Mr. Gage .
“ He has signed our petition requesting a reinvestigation of those tragic events and he has now gone even further by providing his personal statement of support for a new investigation of 9/11 . ”
Mr. Ayres is a nationally recognized expert in building air conditioning design and analysis , energy conservation , thermal energy storage , commissioning of HVAC systems , and earthquake damage to building mechanical systems , with over 55 years of experience .
Co-founder of one of the largest building engineering firms in Los Angeles , Mr. Ayres has been in responsible charge of the design of hundreds of major building projects , including high rise offices , commercial centers , hospitals and laboratories , hotels and residential buildings , universities and colleges , schools , theaters and entertainment centers , jails and correctional facilities , TV and sound studios , governmental buildings and industrial facilities .
In his statement , Mr. Ayres wrote , “ I support the work of Dr. Steven Jones .
He has provided a scientific foundation for the collapse of the three World Trade Center ( WTC ) towers .
I read the FEMA September , 2002 report , prepared by the American Society of Civil Engineers , and initially accepted their theory of the collapse of WTC 1 and 2 .
As more information became available on the web , I was motivated to research the subject in a more rigorous manner .
I have carefully studied the Jones 2006 paper , “ Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Completely Collapse ? ” and concluded that it is a rational step - by - step study that meets the accepted standards for scientific building research .
His critical reviews of the FEMA , NIST , and 9/11 Commission reports are correct . ” ( Richard Gage , AIA ) .

2 other points : Cheney gave the orders of NORAD to stand down .
An executive directive passed 1 yr prior said moving forward all fighers must wait for the command of the pres , v-pres , or then sec of defense Rumsfeld in the event of a mainland attack .
Our # 1 air defense was out that day because cheney gave the order .
Previously , no order would have been required for military fighter to shoot down an attacking enemy aircraft .
It would have taken minutes to get in the air but during a 4 - 6 hour attack that DID NOT HAPPEN .
As many know a new executive order gives bush complete dictatorial powers without having to answer to congress in the event of another 9/11 attack .
So watch these dangerous lying treasonous mutherfckers because they are very desperate to write their version of history since congress and the corporate media who 's interests they serve are in their back pocket .

What is truly sad is the ability of the government and the media to portray anyone who questions the official story as a crackpot and discredit anything they have to say .
The debate over the events of 9/11 have never been allowed .
First it was , no comment until the results of our secret investigation ( coverup ) are complete .
Then we were told , here is what happened , question it and you hate America .
Something as simple as the video of the " airplane " hitting the Pentagon .
What do we get ?
A video showing everything BUT the actual airplane .
Any frame of video that may actually contain evidence of an aircraft are made a state secret and a threat to national security .
Why ?
How could this happen ?
Who made this happen ?
What makes this secret ?
Who gets to see or has seen this footage ?
Where is the reconstructed aircraft from the crash site ?
Why is the black box info top secret ( after claiming no black boxes were recovered ) ?
Show me two recovered jet engines of the proper type for that aircraft .
That can't possibly be classified information because you told us what the aircraft was .
Jet engines do n't vaporize at a crash site .
Show me a wing or tail section sheared off ( These can't penetrate multiple concrete walls .
These crimes were as poorly planned and executed as their criminal war .
The only skill they have shown has been in painting all who question or criticize as crazy , shrill and unpatriotic .

What you ignore is what ultimately undoes you .
By continuing to ignore the glaring inconsistencies in the 9/11 report , we are continuing the undoing of American democracy .
Do n't go to work this 9/11 .
Let them know we mean business !

big dan - C&L is a Hillary Clinton controlled blog .
since the clinton / bush regime have been allowing it to occur , their paid for blog sites tend to discourage dissenting voices concerning 9/11 .
You can bash bush / cheney etc. all you want but they are stuck in a faux left / right paradigm .
also foxnews is endorsing hillary , they are acting like they are not but they always say she it the one to beat and they quote the paid for polls on how she has double digit leads .
zee - standard purposeful disinfo dude or mind controlled drone wants all blogs to stay in one focus so that it will be easier to divide and conquer .
brad has never played the left right game and that is why i consider him the most credible .
anyway guys , we should be a little more concerned about their next attack , here are some pieces of news that may assist .
I just pieces some dots together in a humourous but dead serious way : http://forum.prisonplane...m/index.php?topic=5168.0

Muzgi :
My suggestion would be to start a fund for Cindy to replace Nancy the Bush Enabler asap .
Brad has my email , I 'll be the very first to contribute .
Frankly , I wish she was aiming for Pennsylavnia Ave , but I 'll settle for retirng Pelosi .
Ike Skelton needs desperately to go , too .
" Assholes " that , Ike . YOU MUST GO .
Work like hell to be certain Arnold can't work dirty tricks to interfere with the '08 vote in California , they are already geared up to attempt it .
Work like hell to be certain those dirty tricksters are unsuccessful placing bogus propositions stealing California 's Electoral college votes .
Work Like Hell .
Btw , those articles making today 's news about the E - B4 Airborne Command Center videotaped by CNN over D.C. on 9/11/01 ?
Same plane videotaped by CNN seconds after both planes impacted the Towers in NYC on 9/11/01 .
google it and see for yourselves .
If any here have some comments about how this plane could have been over both attack locations during the attacks , while the official bs story says " we had no planes in the area " , I 'm all ears to hear .
Tony ???
You have something you wish to add ?

Perry ,
Why do n't you put it in YOUR own words why you think WTC 7 " collapsed " without being hit .
Please explain the video , audio and taped testimony of EMT eyewitnesses who heard the countdown for " PULLING IT . " " .. 3,2,1.. " Just a " lucky guess " , P.L. ?
They knew to the second .
Please explain , without sending us off to read what others think , try articulating it for yourself .
I 'm all ears , Mr. Logan , all ears .

I 'm pleased that Brad Blog posted a thread about this ; this appears to be one of exceedingly few genuine left blogs out there that anyone 's heard of that is .
I 'm sure some of the smaller ones are real ( and some are fake as well , like Moxie Grrl and Educational Whisper are both small and fake ) but it 's rare to see a well - known left blog that is actually genuine and not a gatekeeper blog like Crooks & Liars or Daily Kos or Democratic Underground .
Which means when the truth about 9/11 becomes common knowledge , Brad Blog will be one of exceedingly few news outlets to retain any credibility whatsoever .
The gatekeepers will end up on the ash heap of history alongside the official 9/11 myth .

ESCATAWPA , Miss . ( AP ) 
A man trying to call a news station to complain about not getting a FEMA trailer after Hurricane Katrina accidentally dialed 911 and was charged with making methamphetamine after police arrived , authorities said .
Curtiss Randall Coleman was trying to get the number for Biloxi's WLOX - TV on Wednesday just before the 6 p.m. newscast , investigators said .
He misdialed when trying to reach directory information and called 911 instead of 411 .
When he hung up on the emergency dispatcher , the Jackson County Sheriff 's Department was sent to the home to see if anyone was in need of assistance .
Deputies said that when they arrived at Coleman 's house , no one answered the door .
Officers broke in and allegedly found a methamphetamine lab .
Coleman , 53 , and four others were arrested , including Coleman 's son , Christopher , 30 .
A fifth suspect remains at large .
" It was a calamity of errors on Mr. Coleman 's part , " said Sgt. Curtis Spears , commander of the Narcotics Task Force of Jackson County .
Along with the Colemans , narcotics agents also arrested Erin Paula Oliver , 35 , of Moss Point , and Leslie Renee McMahon , 27 , of Ocean Springs .
All four were charged with conspiracy to manufacture meth .
A person who answered the phone at the Jackson County jail declined to say whether Coleman and the others had attorneys .

In one of life ’s strange ironies , last week , the day after I put up a post about the appropriate level of analysis for IT project , I was given a project that has been staggering along for 18 months ( I shit you not ) all because of inappropriate levels of analysis being applied .
Now that this slow - moving train wreck has been handed off to me , I can see its doom was sealed almost from the get - go .
The initial two - page scope document for this project ( which is about to celebrate its second Christmas ) gives a few dot points about the business problems that need to be solved and then declares that this will be solved by updating some databases and developing a custom application .
This may not sound so serious to people who have n’t worked on IT projects but declaring what the solution will be before you even adequately describe what your requirements are is a recipe for unmitigated disaster .
This is known in the industry as the “ Ready , fire , aim ” approach except this is a little worse than usual in that someone shouted “ Fire ! ” 18 months ago and now it ’s my job to tell them that they have to take aim .
It was actually mildly entertaining to see the look in the manager ’s eyes as I told him all of the work done in the last 18 months was essentially in the wrong direction and I was going to have to start from the beginning .
He very quietly and slowly said “ That ’s a little disappointing , ” but he looked a hell of a lot like he was going to have a stroke .
But that is n’t my topic for today .
Part of the conversation I had with the previous Project Manager when this dog ’s breakfast was being handed over to me was “ Be careful when you ’re defining requirements because the business users on this project have a tendency to say everything is mandatory . ”
This is a common complaint from IT developers , they ’re told everything is mandatory but then they ’re starved of time , resources and budget to actually achieve these supposedly mandatory requirements .
It is certainly common for business users to insist “ everything is mandatory ” and if this happens it becomes the Business Analyst ’s job to define what ’s really mandatory and what falls under “ really , really important ” .
The first helpful advice I ’ll offer in this area is to define terminology .
The usual scale for importance of requirements I follow is :
Mandatory –
The project will fail if this requirement is n’t met .
You ’d be better off not starting the project if you ca n’t meet this requirement .
In cases of software procurement , not meeting this requirement would totally rule a particular software package out of contention .
– The project will fail if this requirement is n’t met .
You ’d be better off not starting the project if you ca n’t meet this requirement .
In cases of software procurement , not meeting this requirement would totally rule a particular software package out of contention .
High – A major factor in how successful a project will be .
This would deliver major benefits but is not absolutely essential .
– A major factor in how successful a project will be .
This would deliver major benefits but is not absolutely essential .
Medium – Nice to have .
Not having this feature would not have a major negative impact .
– Nice to have .
Not having this feature would not have a major negative impact .
Low – A bonus .
This requirement should not be a significant part of deciding whether or not the project goes forward .
The next big task is often dealing with someone from the business who still says all 200 requirements are mandatory .
In cases like this , really put them on the spot .
How are you dealing with this situation now ?
Why is it not viable to keep handling it the same way ?
What alternatives are there ?
What would the impact on the business be if this requirement was n’t met ?
If someone ca n’t quantify why something is mandatory then it probably is n’t .
Mind you , if they can quantify why it ’s mandatory , you probably have to go along with it , no matter how painful it seems .
And the really important thing to remember is mandatory is mandatory !
It ’s rarely a good idea to leave a mandatory requirement until the last minute .
Even if you think it will be easy to manage , it ’s better to be sure of this early in a project rather than later .
Nasty surprises are easier to manage when you have a bit of time up your sleeve .
I ’ll illustrate this with a couple of recent examples from my life outside of work .
Regular readers of this blog would have seen my recent venture into “ Agile comedy . ”
This was essentially treating a stand - up comedy competition the same way I would an IT project and going through multiple quick iterations to reach the end product .
( I did n’t win that competition by the way , the winner goes to air this week and I ’ll be very interested to see them . )
One of the mandatory requirements I ignored until pretty much the last minute was that the video file submitted had to me smaller than 5MB .
I thought this would be easy but it turned out not to be .
I eventually delivered on this requirement within the deadline but it resulted in quite a bit of unnecessary stress .
On the plus side , I now know I can punch my PC screen very hard without damaging it .
My other experience revolves around the holiday I ’m planning for January .
I had to book flights , accommodation and a vehicle , all of which I did quite methodically .
Now , I ’m going to New Zealand so another mandatory requirement is a valid passport .
I thought I had this under control BUT I DIDN ’T CHECK .
It is not a good idea to let mandatory requirements slide .
It turns out that my passport expired in September .
So added to my normal Christmas rush is the stress of trying to get a passport renewal through quickly at the busiest time of the year .
It should be all sorted this week but I caused myself mountains of unnecessary stress by ignoring an absolutely mandatory requirement .
So the moral of the story is , be sure of what requirements are really mandatory and identify the difference between important and mandatory .
But once you ’re sure of what ’s mandatory , you can carve this in stone : Mandatory is Mandatory !
The students in Mr. Smoot ’s science class in 1957 in the Lewis School in Birmingham , Ala. , might not have seen Sputnik or heard its beeping , but they felt its presence .
“ We stopped having throwaway science and started having real science , ” recalled Shirley Malcolm , one of the students .
“ Here I was , a black kid in a segregated school that was under - resourced — Sputnik kind of crossed the barrier .
All of a sudden everybody was talking about it , and science was above the fold in the newspaper , and my teachers went to institutes and really got us all engaged .
It was just a time of incredible intensity and attention to science . ”
For many , Sputnik was proof that American education , particularly in science , had fallen behind .
Scientists and engineers warned Congress that the cold war was being fought with slide rules , not rifles .
In response Congress passed the National Defense Education Act in 1958 , providing , among other things , college scholarships and other help for aspiring scientists , engineers and mathematicians .
Meanwhile , some of the nation ’s eminent scientists were collaborating on new ways to teach high school physics , biology and chemistry .
“ Those were heady times , ” recalled Gerald F .
Wheeler , who as a young high school physics teacher participated in workshops on one of these plans , the Physical Sciences Study Committee ’s curriculum for physics .
Its ideas were so fresh they were presented on mimeographed sheets rather than printed pages .
“ It was very high - energy networking , ” he said .
“ Science teachers trying to do a much better job teaching . ”
" Yes . . .
F---ING Yes !!! " said one blog entry on the Schlessinger site .
" I LOVE MY JOB , it takes everything reckless and deviant and heathenistic and just overall bad about me and hyper focuses these traits into my job of running around this horrid place doing nasty things to people that deserve it . . . and some that do n't . "
Now , however , ABC is taking a further look into information Mr. Debat provided .
Mr. Ross said ABC had dispatched an investigator to Pakistan to go over details of reports in which Mr. Debat provided information .
At the same time , The Associated Press reported last night that it also was investigating three news reports that relied on Mr. Debat for information .
The renewed scrutiny has been driven by revelations about Mr. Debat after a French news Web site , Rue 89 , reported this week that an interview supposedly with Senator Obama was entirely made up .
Mr. Debat , who could not be reached last night , sent an e-mail message to ABC yesterday saying the allegations against him “ are slanderous . ”
He told The Washington Post Wednesday that an intermediary had spoken with Mr. Obama .
But representatives for Mr. Obama denied that he spoke with anyone connected to Mr. Debat .
Subsequently , other figures whose interviews appeared under Mr. Debat ’s byline in the French magazine Politique Internationale have come forward to say they never spoke to him .
These included Mr. Clinton ; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ; Alan Greenspan , the former Federal Reserve chairman ; Bill Gates , the chairman of Microsoft ; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
After his departure from ABC News in June , Mr. Debat continued to work as a senior fellow for national security and terrorism at the Nixon Center in Washington until he resigned his post late Wednesday .
He was quoted as a knowledgeable source in an article in the The Sunday Times this month , saying that American military forces were planning attacks that would demolish “ the entire Iranian military . ”
He has also been quoted by many newspapers and news services .
Story Highlights • Security guard shoots gunman after attack on woman

• CNN writer witnesses man shoot woman near newsroom
Adjust font size :
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A man shot and killed a woman inside the CNN Center in Atlanta , Georgia , Tuesday afternoon before being shot by a security guard .
The gunman was dragging the woman by her hair minutes before shots were fired , said one witness , who tried to intervene and was told to get out of the way by the attacker .
The witness , who had gone to get help from a guard , then heard the gunfire immediately outside CNN. com 's newsroom at about 1:30 p.m .
John Helton , a CNN.com producer , had a direct view of the gunman through glass doors .
" I saw him coming down the escalator pulling her along , around the corner ; he ran into the plant and that 's when they started struggling , " he said .
( Read more witness accounts )
" She seemed to be trying to wrestle free of him , " he said .
Helton said the woman appeared to be shot at point - blank range .
" He looked like he had the gun right on top of her head and shot her . "
( Gallery : Scenes from the shooting )
After the shots , CNN.com writer Brad Lendon said , the gunman " looked around , his head turning in my direction .
I do n't know if he saw me , but at that moment the gravity of what I 'd witnessed hit me .
I turned away and tried to find the safest way I could out . "
( Watch Brad Lendon describe what he did next )
The gunman was then shot by Capt .
Odell Adams , who joined Turner Security in 1996 , according to a spokesperson for Turner , the parent company for CNN .
Preliminary reports indicate that the suspect was shot in the face , a law enforcement source said on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
Ambulances transported the gunman and the victim , 22 - year - old Clara Riddles , to Grady Memorial Hospital .
Riddles , who witnesses said appeared to be pregnant , died from her injuries .
The shooter was undergoing surgery and was in " severely critical condition , " the hospital said .
( Watch suspect at gunpoint , wounded woman on floor )
Riddles , who lived in the Atlanta suburb of College Park , worked for the Omni Hotel , according to Investigator Betty Honey of the Fulton County Medical Examiner 's Office .
The gunman has not been named , but Atlanta police called the shooting a " domestic situation , " and said the gunman was an ex-boyfriend of Riddles .
The CNN Center was particularly busy Tuesday , following Monday night 's NCAA championship game in the nearby Georgia Dome .
Omni spokesperson Michael Sullivan is refusing to comment on the incident .
One woman , who was visiting the CNN Center , said she saw security guards running with their guns drawn .
" The kids were pretty shaken up and it was pretty scary .
And it was n't until we came back in after the fact and looked up on the CNN screen that we had learned what had really happened , " she said .
The CNN.com newsroom was temporarily evacuated .
Some workers had already scrambled out of the building seeking cover after hearing shots .

" There 's something wrong with the door , " the Boss announces .
" Which door ? " the PFY asks , apparently oblivious to the fact that the Boss is standing outside the entrance to the computer room .
" THIS door . "
" What 's the matter with it ? "
" Cards do n't work on it . "
" Really ? " the PFY says , wandering over .
> SWIPE < > bip< > bip< > bip< > bip< > Clack !< > SLAM !< " No , seems to be fine ... "
" It does n't work with my card ! "
" Ah , so it 's more of a card problem than a door one .
It 's probably just that you 're not permitted access to the computer room . "
" Ridiculous !
Why would n't I have access to the computer room ? "
" Let 's rephrase that as why WOULD you have access to the computer room ? "
I ask , weighing into the conversation .
" Given that your IT ' expertise ' is about 15 years old and involved changing PABX batteries ? "
" I... " the Boss says , realising that at least ONE person at the company can read between the lines of his CV .
" And so you see there really is n't any real reason why you would need to have access ... " the PFY adds .
" Well I would LIKE access anyway ! "
" And I would like unbreakable Oracle , but you have to pick your battles ... "
" I 'll just get security to do it ! "
" The inline filter in the door control circuit that rejects certain updates ... "
" Why would you put a filter in ? ! "
" Because we 've had issues with people doing inappropriate things in the computer room . "
" What do you mean ? "
" Running , eating , drinking , " the PFY says reading from the ' unacceptable activities ' list . "
" I 'm hardly likely to do any of those things . "
" Not with no access . "
" I ... This is n't finished ! " he snaps storming out .
Three days later the Boss attacks on a new front by rolling on up accompanied by a weedy bloke struggling under the weight of a 1U rack - mount server .
" We need to install this , " the Boss says .
" ? "
" It 's your portal appliance , " the weedy guy responds .
" A portal appliance ? "
" A dedicated server which will act as the gateway to all your internal and external processing . "
" Oh , you mean like a single point of failure ! " the PFY gasps .
" No , this is state - of - the - art - a fault free turnkey solution . "
" Fair enough , hand it over then , " the PFY assents .
" No , I need to install it , " the geek says , looking to the Boss for affirmation .
" But it 's a turnkey device , " the PFY argues .
" It might have some startup problems the first time . "
" You said it was fault free ! "
" Initial configuration options ? " the geek suggests .
" Tell you what , do them here and we 'll install it later . "
...10 minutes later ...
" So I 'll just ... "
" ... hand it over and we 'll install it . "
" I 'll need access to the console if it fails ! "
" AND it 's a critical portal application so he 's going to need to have access at all hours - DAY AND NIGHT in case something happens when you 're not around , " the Boss adds .
" And I 'll need a pager , " the geek adds .
" Connected to your monitoring software . "
" Because ? "
" It ... might have a hardware problem ... as yet undiagnosed . "
Eventually I am talked around to giving the geek access to the server room , much to the PFY 's disgust .
" It was just a cover story so he can let the Boss into the machine room . "
" Of course it was , " I concur .
" And he 's not going to be able to do anything even if it does go down , just power the thing up again . "
" Uh - huh . "
" And if it does go down it 's going to take user visibility to our systems with it . "
" Indeed . "
" It 'll be a critical outage ! "
" Uh - huh . "
" And someone 's going to have to respond . "
" Yes , you 're right .
And who will that person be ? "
" Not me . "
" Or me .
No , it looks like every outage will be dealt with by our geeky new acquaintance . "
" Who could be in and out of the room all the time .
And you 're not worried ? "
" Nah , he 'll crack first , " I say .
> CLACK !< " Oh dear - it looks like the circuit breaker to the portal machine has tripped , " I add , closing the switchboard door .
One higher rated breaker later ...
> wiggle < > clunk < ... > wiggle < > clunk < " Oh dear - it looks like the power cables have vibrated loose from the portal machine ! " I gasp .
Two cable ties later ...
" And your next plan is ? " the PFY asks .
" A simple combination of the effects of the lunchtime curry and repeated Pings - of - Death . "
" Pings - of - Death ?
Nothing 's susceptible to that any more ! "
" Nessus says yes , " I say .
> tappity <
... Twenty Ping - of - Deaths , pages and geek visits later ...
" We 'll have to turn it off , " the geek whimpers .
" I ca n't keep coming in to reset it every minute or so . "
" We ca n't turn it off ! " the PFY responds .
" It 's the gateway to all our internal and external processing and we 're starting end - of - financial - year processing !!! "
" But I ca n't keep coming in ! " the geek whines .
" I need to go to ... "
> beep < > beep < > beep <
...
With the number of outages the head of IT was pretty much obliged to take a look at the situation for himself sooner or later - it was just coincidence that the PFY rang him to visit the exact moment that the effects of the curry , cold environment , and bowel pressure had the geek dispatching his lunchtime curry into a cardboard box within reach of the portal server 's reset button .
Suffice to say there 's a new entry in the unacceptable activities list and the inline filter is no longer necessary ...
Rest assured , C&L'ers :
If by August 2008 the Glorious Surge has not yet succeeded ( that 's only two and a half Friedmans away ! ) , President Bush and the pre-2006 Republican majority will break out their super - secret " Plan B " -- no , not that Plan B -- and save the day ( and Bush 's legacy ! ) .
Download Download
" Let 's give victory a chance and then in August of 2008 , if it 's not working then , indeed , this President and the Republican majority from the last Congress , we do have a plan B .
But we 're not gonna give it to the enemy ! "
Could this be the same " plan " Conrad Burns last year so selfishly concealed from Jon Tester ?
Unfortunately , Burns is no longer available and his Senate website is gone .
Do you suppose he left a contact number ?
His insecurity on this point reflects the trepidation that is consuming the music business .
Seemingly overnight , the entire industry is collapsing .
Sales figures on top - selling CDs are about 30 percent lower than they were a year ago , and the usual remedies are n't available .
Since radio is no longer a place to push a single , record companies have turned to television and movies .
" High School Musical , " which originated with a Disney Channel television show , was the top - selling album of 2006 , and not only has " American Idol , " with its 30 - million - plus audience , created best - selling singers like Kelly Clarkson and Chris Daughtry , but an appearance on the show can also boost sales .
When Jennifer Lopez performed on " American Idol , " it was considered worth noting that her album " Como Ama Una Mujer , " already out for four weeks , dipped only 7 percent rather than falling by the usual double digits .
More impressively , songs that are heard on popular shows like " Grey 's Anatomy " become instantly desirable .
When the Columbia artist Brandi Carlile 's song " The Story " was featured on the ABC show , it posted a 15 percent jump in sales and was downloaded 19,000 times in one week .
Before being heard on the show , the song had been available for nearly two months without any notable interest .
" Until very recently , " Rubin told me over lunch at Hugo's , a health - conscious restaurant in Hollywood , " there were a handful of channels in the music business that the gatekeepers controlled .
They were radio , Tower Records , MTV , certain mainstream press like Rolling Stone .
That 's how people found out about new things .
Every record company in the industry was built to work that model .
There was a time when if you had something that was n't so good , through muscle and lack of other choices , you could push that not very good product through those channels .
And that 's how the music business functioned for 50 years .
Well , the world has changed .
And the industry has not . "
Steve Barnett , who is 55 and was the sole head of Columbia until he agreed to split his role with Rubin , was president of Epic Records , also a division of Sony , until 2005 and was well aware of the seismic shifts in the business .
Barnett 's corner office on the 25th floor of the Sony building is like a miniversion of the Hard Rock Cafe — autographed guitars belonging to Jeff Beck , Korn and Angus Young from AC / DC rest in their stands , and the walls are covered with vintage posters from the celebrated New York rock venue the Fillmore East .
To the right of Barnett 's large desk , above the framed Johnny Cash portrait , is a sign that reads , " Your Faith Needs to Be Greater Than Your Fear . "
" I have always believed that , " Barnett told me in mid-August , " but it seems particularly relevant at the moment . "
Barnett , who is English , is a sharp counterpoint to Rubin .
He lives with his wife and two of their four sons in Connecticut .
He has neatly parted sandy brown hair , and on the day we met , he was dressed in a blue button - down shirt , tan slacks and Gucci loafers with dark socks .
Barnett is polite , careful , aware of his corporate status .
Yet he supported recruiting Rubin .
" My wife 's father is Dick Vermeil , the former coach of the St. Louis Rams , " Barnett explained .
" My sons would go to training camp , and when Marshall Faulk started playing for the team , they called me and said , ' Not only is this guy a great player , he makes everyone around him better . '
Of course , the Rams went on to win the Super Bowl .
I think Rick Rubin is our Marshall Faulk .
I knew he would change the culture here . "
By the time Barnett first approached Rubin about coming to Columbia , Rubin had already decided that he would have nothing more to do with Columbia Records .
This was because of the company 's handling of the Rubin - produced Neil Diamond record " 12 Songs " in 2005 .
Diamond was a hero of Rubin's , and he spent two years working on the album , persuading Diamond to record acoustically , something he had n't done since the '60s .
" The CD debuted at No. 4 , " Rubin told me at Hugo's , still sounding upset .
" It was the highest debut of Neil 's career , off to a great start .
But Columbia — it was some kind of corporate thing — had put spyware on the CD .
That kept people from copying it , but it also somehow recorded information about whoever bought the record .
The spyware became public knowledge , and people freaked out .
There were some lawsuits filed , and the CD was recalled by Columbia .
Literally pulled from stores .
We came out on a Tuesday , by the following week the CD was not available .
Columbia released it again in a month , but we never recovered .
Neil was furious , and I vowed never to make another album with Columbia . "
But when Barnett flew out to Los Angeles to discuss the job with Rubin , Rubin was intrigued .
" I felt like I could be a force for good , " he explained .
" In the past , I 've tried to protect artists from the label , and now my job would also be to protect the label from itself .
So many of the decisions at these companies are not about the music .
They are shortsighted and desperate .
For so long , the record industry had control .
But now that monopoly has ended , they do n't know what to do .
I thought it would be an interesting challenge . "
Mr Waveqche began living with Ms Volpes ( R ) when he was 15

Adelfa Volpes was admitted to hospital soon after she and her new husband , Reinaldo Waveqche , returned from their honeymoon in Brazil .
She died in a sanatorium in Santa Fe , the city where the couple were married .
Ms Volpes had rejected criticism over the age difference with the groom , who is the son of one of her best friends .
" I do n't want to resign myself to the idea that I lost her , " a disconsolate Mr Waveqche told EFE news agency .
The couple were married on 28 September in a civil service after several years of engagement , and later walked through a local church surrounded by reporters .
Their love is said to have blossomed when Mr Waveqche went to live with his future bride after his mother 's death , when he was 15 .
" The biggest problem we had to solve was the privacy problem , " Mr. Gilmour said .
Because the information used to determine if someone is an expert on a particular question stays on local computers , Tacit 's executives said Illumio would avoid potentially troubling privacy questions .
The Illumio software is installed on users ' PC's , where it is connected through a software interface to either Microsoft or Google 's desktop search programs that index local user content , including documents and electronic mail .
The anonymity offered by Illumio is a significant advantage over other social networking software services that place pressure on users to offer assistance .
The Illumio software uses a reverse auction model to restrict the answer to the best expert .
In a reverse auction , sellers compete for the right to provide goods or services .
For example , in response to the question , " Who knows John Smith ? " each Illumio local system would independently determine who had the best relationship in the network based on parameters such as who had recently exchanged the most e-mail with John Smith .
If the local system found a strong relationship , the local Illumio client software would pop up a request on that user 's screen asking whether the user wished to respond to the person asking the question .
Initially only the strongest candidates would be notified locally of the query .
If that user ignored the request , the reverse auction system would , in effect , lower the bar to ask the person with the next strongest relationship .
Then , if there were no responses , the bar would be again lowered until an expert responded .
It is possible that difficult questions would find no experts .
The system insures that experts remain anonymous until they agree to answer the query .
When a user answers , the connection is made either through the Illumio system , by e-mail or by other channels such as instant messaging or telephone .
In addition to the keywords that make up the question , a user is permitted to send an accompanying message that will help people determine whether they have relevant information to a particular question .
Tacit hopes to market the service by providing Web masters with icons it calls " hot spots . "
For example , a person running a digital photography or similar Web site could place a hot spot on its home page and then anybody who wanted to join an Illumio network on digital photography could do so by simply clicking on the link .

In Washington , the much - anticipated release of Halo 3 — dubbed the “ Harry Potter of video games ” — was celebrated , as most things are in this town , by a private party thrown by lobbyists .
In this case the lobby was the Entertainment Software Association , which , in conjunction with the liquor lobby ( sorry , the “ Distilled Spirits Council “ ) , hosted the event on the rooftop of its Northwest D.C. headquarters .
Mother Jones , however , is way too hip and truth - telling and outside - the - beltway to get invited to these types of insider events ( at least that ’s what we keep telling ourselves ) .
So , on Monday evening , I had to settle for lining up at a Hyattsville , Maryland Gamestop along with several dozen fellow Halo fanatics to await the game ’s 12:01 a.m. release .
Every generation of teenage boys has its nerd touchstones , and Halo is my generation ’s answer to comic books or Star Wars .
Children born in the early and mid-1980s were the first generation to spend their entire childhoods with the video game genre known as the “ first - person shooter , ” or FPS , the basic idea of which is to move through a series of rooms or areas killing things , usually accompanied by a ridiculous sci- fi plot .
( Instead of just watching Luke Skywalker kill Imperial storm troopers , you can pretend to be Luke Skywalker and off them yourself . )
In 1993 , id Software released Doom , taking the FPS to a new level and allowing users to game each other online .
Instead of pretending to be Luke Skywalker and dueling against computerized artificial intelligence , you could take on a small army of faceless nerds around the world .
Think of it as paintball , except without the exercise or the paint .
Soon , huge numbers of teenage boys ( and later , kids and adults of both sexes — the age of the average gamer is 33 ) were joyfully slaughtering each other ’s electronic alter egos .
Suddenly ( as previously non-gaming Americans are learning with the increasing popularity of Nintendo ’s Wii , Blizzard ’s World of Warcraft , and Linden Lab ’s Second Life ) , gaming became social .
The Halo series takes that friendly social competitiveness to its logical conclusion : hundreds of thousands of people meeting up online to kill each other in various gruesome ways .
Halo has been hugely successful : Halo 2 , the first game in the series to truly integrate online play , sold about 6.5 million copies .
By the middle of 2006 , the proud owners of those 6.5 million copies ( and their friends ) had played over 500 million separate games over Microsoft ’s Xbox Live service , which matches players according to skill , picks teams , and allows for you to play with friends or strangers .
This time around , a million copies were paid for prior to Halo 3 ’s release and the game made $ 170 million within its first 24 hours in stores .
That ’s more than any movie .
Ever .
Some analysts believe that Halo 3 is likely to eventually gross close to $ 1 billion .
But there is a significant problem with introducing a social element into games — especially violent ones — since doing so , by nature , also introduces many of society ’s problems .
Everyone ’s heard about people getting addicted to role - playing games .
One Nevada couple was recently slapped with a child neglect rap after becoming so engrossed with the online version of Dungeons & Dragons that they failed to care for their children .
As a recent Mother Jones Exhibit described , we even outsource our virtual work : over half a million Chinese gamers perform menial tasks within online worlds and sell their virtual rewards to Western players for real money .
But Halo has its own set of problems .
There ’s cheating , of course :
You can purchase an ( illegally ) modified Xbox or retool one yourself , which allows you to hack the game .
In the past , I ’ve seen players flying , automatically killing their opponents , and teleporting around game levels , among other things .
But those incidents are fairly infrequent , and some people are just so good at Halo that they can appear to be cheating when they ’re really not .
Remember , there are people who actually do this for a living .
Here ’s the bigger issue :
You actually can converse with your faceless , aliased Internet nemeses .
The Xbox comes with a microphone - earpiece headset that resembles those worn by telemarketers ( and makes you look like a huge nerd ) .
The headset is supposed to be used for communication and cooperation in team games .
But many Halo players have figured out it is also very useful for trash - talking your opponents .
And kids really do say the darndest things .
I ’ve found there are few things more disconcerting than being called a “ fucking faggot ” or a “ bitch nigger ” or a “ dirty Jew ” ( literally ) by someone who sounds like they ’re in elementary school — but may not be .
My colleague Bruce Falconer recounts being shot in the back of the head during a Halo game , only to hear his opponent say “ fag ” and run off .
And while it ’s not overtly bigoted , there ’s also the very common practice of electronic “ teabagging ” or “ corpse - humping , ” which the not - faint - of - heart can learn about here .
An old friend once told me that playing Halo online was an eye - opening experience : “ I always knew there were racists and anti-Semites and homophobes , ” he said , “ But I did n’t really know how many there were until I started playing Halo on Xbox Live . ”
People ’s true biases really come out in this virtual and violent world .
And there ’s no accountability online — no one knows who you are .
Although I ’ve always made it a practice to report racists and homophobes through Xbox Live ’s internal complaint procedure , almost every match in Halo 2 included someone who thought a little racism would liven up the game .
Microsoft surely is n’t the only game company that is dealing with this issue .
A now - famous essay called “ Bow , Nigger , ” published in the U.K. edition of PC Gamer , describes the author ’s experience with casual racism in a game called Jedi Knight 2 .
A popular YouTube video ( now offline ) documented racism in a game called Tom Clancy ’s Ghost Recon .
The phenomenon has not been lost on White power groups , which sometimes use online role - playing games for recruiting purposes .
The good news is that Microsoft seems to be taking steps in the latest version of Halo to address the rampant racism and bigotry .
Now , instead of freely spewing hate at all comers , you can only talk to your own team in most games , which discourages racist or anti-Semitic trash - talking .
Xbox Live ’s reporting system has also been souped up , and it ’s easier to avoid problem players if you did n’t like playing with them .
More importantly , you can now mute other players in - game with an easy click of a button .
That ’s the parallel freedom at the heart of free speech : you can say what you want , but I should n’t have to listen to you .
So congratulations to Microsoft — maybe they ’ll invite us to their next party now that I ’ve said something nice about them — for realizing that .
Now it ’s high time I go play some Halo 3 .
You can bet I ’ll be using that mute button .

When a German mugger spotted a blind beggar at a train station in Germany , he must have thought it would be the easiest mugging of his career .
The teenage mugger spotted the 33 - year - old beggar sitting outside a train station in the south - western town of Giessen and thought he would be easy prey , police said .
Intending to steal his cigarettes , the 17 - year - old yob threatened the blind man and then punched him in the face .
Unfortunately for the mugger , what he did n't know was that his would - be victim
was Michael Esser , a former world champion in judo for blind people .
Before he knew what was happening he had been flipped over and put in a stranglehold .
The blind martial artist then pinned him down until police arrived .
Judging by the copy ( “ Smoking is harmful to your breath ” ) , this is an anti-smoking campaign , not a pro-bestiality campaign .
We saw the same idea in Washington state ’s Ashtray Mouth work :
Tell smokers it ’s disgusting to kiss them , and they ’ll quit .
This time the message comes from the National Committee Against Tobacco in France .
A second ad , showing a man kissing a dog ( a good - looking dog , but still ) , is after the jump .

OS X
In a Macworld Expo keynote address full of surprises , one of the biggest was the news that “ iPhone runs OS X ” .
But what that means , precisely , is not yet entirely clear , and speculation has already led to a few common misconceptions .
It is clearly not the case that the iPhone is running Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger ( or 10.5 Leopard ) as we know it .
Minor differences between the Intel and PowerPC versions notwithstanding , 1 every Macintosh ships with pretty much the same version of Mac OS X .
If you ’re running 10.4 , your System folder contains pretty much the exact same software as everyone else ’s who is running 10.4 .
Clearly , just by looking at the UI , this is not so for the iPhone .
There is no menu bar .
There are no windows .
There is no mouse cursor .
These three things have been the defining fundamental elements of the Mac UI ever since the original Macintosh , and none are present in the iPhone UI .
It ’s also the case that , by the standards of the iPhone ’s 4 and 8 GB storage capacities , Mac OS X 10.4
Tiger is just way too big .
My / System / folder alone is a little over 2 GB .
And , as Apple vice president of iPod marketing Greg Joswiak told Macworld UK , the iPhone ’s operating system is stored in the device ’s flash memory .
Macworld ’s report says the iPhone ’s version of OS X weighs in at about 500 MB ( meaning there will be about 3.5 GB of free space on a 4 GB iPhone ) .
So , misconception # 1 : The iPhone Contains a Full Version of Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5 .
Wrong :
If the OS only weighs 500 MB , it is clearly a subset of the full installation .
This has led to misconception # 2 : The iPhone Is n’t Really Running OS X , and Claiming That It Does Is Just ‘ Reality Distortion Field ’ Marketing Bullshit .
Leading the way is this post from Slashdot , “ iPhone Not Running OS X ” , the gist of the argument of which is that ( a ) since the currently available Darwin distribution does n’t support ARM processors ; and ( b ) the Darwin open source license states that changes must be released publicly ; and ( c ) a Cingular spokesperson has ( supposedly ) stated that the iPhone OS will not be released publicly ; and so therefore the iPhone OS is n’t based on Darwin and ca n’t be OS X .
The problems with this chain of logic are manifold .
For one thing , Apple owns the copyright to Darwin , and it can do whatever it wants with its own modifications ; 2 everyone else is bound by the open source Darwin license , but Apple is n’t because they own it .
For another , Cingular almost certainly has no say in the matter .
Apple is no more likely to release the entire iPhone version of OS X than they are to release the entire Mac version of OS X ( which is to say : not likely at all ) .
But I see no reason why they might not release an updated version of Darwin that supports whatever processor is inside the iPhone ( which we still do n’t know for certain , but which I ’m still betting is some sort of ARM chip ) a few months after the first iPhones ship .
I ’ve been investigating this since shortly after the keynote , and everything I ’ve learned indicates that it is entirely fair and accurate for Apple to call the iPhone operating system “ OS X ” : the kernel is Mach ; 3 the low levels are Darwin ; the UI for the apps is Cocoa ’s AppKit .
The math looks like this :
Start with Mac OS X as we know it .
Subtract everything in Mac OS X that is needless or undesirable on the iPhone — drivers for hardware the iPhone does n’t have , frameworks and libraries for features that do n’t make sense on a small screen mobile device , all of the applications designed for the Mac UI .
Add the things that the iPhone needs but that Mac OS X as we know it lacks : multi - touch screen support , on - screen “ smart ” keyboard , cellular phone networking , drivers for the iPhone sensors ( proximity , light , accelerometer ) , apps written specifically for the iPhone UI .
In other words , the iPhone ’s version of OS X contains everything from Mac OS X that ’s applicable to a mobile phone , plus new bits specific to the phone .
It ’s a “ full ” version of OS X not because it contains everything from Mac OS X , but because it contains everything you ’d actually want from Mac OS X .
And so that Slashdot - style skepticism , where everything uttered by Steve Jobs during a keynote is considered marketing bullshit until proven otherwise , could n’t be more wrong in this case .
It ’s more accurate to call the iPhone ’s system software “ OS X ” from an engineering perspective than from a marketing one .
Mac nerds , and Cocoa programmers in particular , would look at the iPhone ’s system and agree , Holy crap , that really is Mac OS X .
But a typical non-technical Mac user might hear “ iPhone runs OS X ” and assume they ’re going to feel right at home ; that the UI and the apps look and behave just like the software they ’re used to , albeit on a smaller screen .
As stated before , a few minutes looking at Apple ’s demos shows that the UI is totally new , both for the system as a whole , and for each of the currently included apps .
Yes , the email client is called Mail , but it ’s not Mac OS X Mail .
Yes , Jobs called the browser “ Safari ” ( although on the iPhone screenshots it ’s just called “ Web ” ) , and it does use WebKit for rendering ( as does iPhone ’s Mail ) .
But there ’s no Finder .
No menu bar .
No windows , or close / minimize / zoom buttons .
Judged only by what appears on screen — which is how lay people judge an “ operating system ” — the iPhone neither looks nor acts like a Mac .
That ’s not a complaint .
You would n’t want to take a UI optimized for 20 - inch displays and squish it onto a 3.5 - inch screen ( nor vice - versa ; please , no more emails speculating that the iPhone UI is actually secretly the new Mac UI coming in Leopard ) .
Apple is calling the iPhone ’s system software “ OS X ” .
At least in writing , 4 Apple has always been scrupulous about calling the Mac ’s system “ Mac OS X ” .
It ’s hard to say what the difference is , exactly , until we know a lot more about what ’s inside the iPhone .
But here ’s what it looks like to me :
“ OS X ” is the operating system in the computer science sense : the kernel , the drivers , the FreeBSD stuff , and the frameworks and APIs .
“ Mac OS X ” is OS X for Macs , plus a bunch of bundled apps .
Macs are desktop and notebook computers ; the iPhone is not a Mac .
And although there ’s been much less speculation about it , I suspect this is also true of the Apple TV — that it too runs “ OS X ” , which is to say a subset of Mac OS X specific to the ( relatively limited ) list of features the Apple TV supports .
This distinction between “ OS X ” and “ Mac OS X ” is loose , but makes sense .
There is no brand for “ OS X Mobile ” or “ OS X TV ” because there does n’t need to be ; these derivatives of Mac OS X are n’t standalone products in the way that system software is for Microsoft .
OS X is technology ; Mac OS X is a product .
The version of OS X for iPhones is not itself a product ; only the iPhone as a whole , hardware and software combined , is a product .
i Phones will get iPod - style software updates , not Mac - style major new upgrade revisions to the operating system .
One other branding consideration , perhaps , is a desire by Apple not to confuse or scare away Windows users .
To some lifelong Windows users , “ Mac ” means “ the other side of the computing fence ” .
Saying that the iPhone runs “ Mac OS X ” might sound to some ears as though it ’s something that is n’t meant for use with a Windows PC.5
In the wake of the legal dispute with Cisco regarding the “ iPhone ” trademark , several readers emailed me to suggest that , since the phone is running OS X , the obvious solution would be for Apple to rename the product “ MacPhone ” — and that perhaps that ’s what they should have called it even if there were n’t any dispute regarding “ iPhone ” .
That misses the entire point of what Apple is trying to establish with both brands .
The renaming of their Intel - based hardware — PowerBooks , iBook , and Power Macs giving way to MacBook Pros , MacBooks , and Mac Pros — was done for one reason : to emphasize that Apple ’s computers are Macs , and that “ Mac ” is the name for Apple ’s computers .
On a technical level , yes , an iPhone does appear to be much more like a Mac than an iPod .
But on a marketing level , the iPhone is very much like an iPod , floating high above the fray of the 20 - year - old Mac-vs . - Windows rivalry .
'' The problem is not so much whether we have too much salt in our diet as it is the deterioration of the American diet , '' said Dr. David McCarron , a professor of medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland , who argues that salt makes little difference in blood pressure control when people eat balanced diets that emphasize fruits , vegetables and low - fat dairy products .
'' That 's really the issue . ''
Dr. Michael Alderman , a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx and past president of the American Society of Hypertension , said : '' I do n't believe there is any basis whatsoever for a public health recommendation for eating any particular sodium content diet .
A scientific problem ought to be solved by data .
And there is no data . ''
Actually , there are mountains of data on the relationship between salt and blood pressure , but most is so difficult to interpret that it is not at all uncommon for the same study to be cited in support of both pro-salt and anti-salt positions .
People need at least some salt -- no one argues with that .
But the minimum amount a person needs to survive and maintain a normal blood pressure is thought to be around 400 milligrams of sodium per day , far less than the 3,500 milligrams per day in the average American diet .
( Sodium units are generally used by convention in scientific discussions of salt intake , since only salt appears to influence blood pressure , while other sources of sodium , like bicarbonate of soda , do not . )
An Effect , But How Big ?
Salt affects blood pressure -- no one argues with that , either .
After all , blood is simply a lot of cells floating around in a salt water solution .
Eat a few extra tablespoons of salt and a cascade of water - retaining hormones dilute the extra salt in your blood back to the right concentration , raising blood volume and blood pressure a little until the extra salt is eliminated by the kidneys .
Cut back on salt , and you will probably be less thirsty , drink less water and your blood volume and pressure will fall a little .
Another set of salt - retaining hormones are then activated to make the kidneys retain all the salt , and things return to normal .
Normal blood pressure is considered around 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury .
The first number , or systolic , represents the pressure in the bloodstream during a heartbeat , and the second number , or diastolic , represents the pressure after a heartbeat .
This pretty much takes care of Rudy ’s GOP chances .
The right - wing Republican leaders , including like Pat Robertson , James Dobson and Wayne LaPierre from the NRA , will never , ever let Rudy lead their Republican party .
And Rudy may not like it , but that ’s who does control the Republican Party :
Rudolph W. Giuliani sharpened his liberal credentials before a conservative crowd in Houston today , as he worked to present a more consistent platform on the campaign trail .
At an appearance at Houston Baptist University , Mr. Giuliani said that he favors abortion rights , certain restrictions on gun ownership and gay rights — he is for civil unions , he said , although not for marriage between people of the same sex .
During last week ’s debate among Republicans vying for their party ’s 2008 presidential nomination , the former New York City mayor was criticized for his halting and apparently contradictory responses to questions about his views on abortion rights .
Critics have said that he is trying to run from a record that is much more liberal than the views of the Republican Party ’s core voters on the issue .
Every now and then , we are tempted to double - check that the Democrats actually won control of Congress last year .
It was particularly hard to tell this week .
Democratic leaders were cowed , once again , by propaganda from the White House and failed , once again , to modernize the law on electronic spying in a way that permits robust intelligence gathering on terrorists without undermining the Constitution .
The task before Congress was to review and improve an update to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , known as FISA , that was pushed through the Capitol just before the summer break .
That bill endorsed warrantless wiretapping and gutted other aspects of the 1978 law .
House Democrats drafted a measure that , while imperfect , was an improvement to the one passed this summer .
But before the House could vote , Republicans tied up the measure in bureaucratic knots and Democratic leaders pulled it .
Senate Democrats did even worse , accepting a Potemkin compromise that endorsed far too much of the bad summer law .
We were left wondering who is really in charge , when in a bipartisan press release announcing the agreement , the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee , Kit Bond , described the bill as “ a delicate arrangement of compromises ” that could not be changed in any way .
The committee ’s chairman , Jay Rockefeller , did n’t object .
The picture of Sen. Craig on FoxNews has NO IDENTIFICATION below it .

( CNN ) --
A gunman suspected of wounding a police officer shot and killed two people and wounded at least two others at a shopping center in Kansas City , Missouri , before being gunned down by police , authorities said Sunday .
" It appears that he came to the mall to shoot people , " said Sgt. Tony Sanders , a Kansas City police spokesman .
" Whether it was random or not we do not know . "
Police are also investigating any connection the man may have had to the death of an elderly woman whose body was found in her home a few miles away , police said .
( Watch a witness describe hearing shots and seeing people flee the mall )
Sanders said the man shot and killed two people in the parking lot of Ward Parkway Center , about nine miles south of downtown , about 3:30 p.m .
He continued into the mall , where witnesses said he fired several more shots with what appeared to be a sawed - off shotgun , but police later determined to be a rifle .
Shots near Starbucks
" I was in my truck and the gunman was two cars over from me , " shopper Queea Miller told CNN .
She said she saw the gunman shoot in the direction of a Starbucks coffee shop .
" Then , after he stopped , he re-loaded and started shooting again , " said Miller .
Miller said during the shootings , she and her 18 - year - old daughter leaned their seats all the way back .
" I got to praying .
You could hear the shots going off again , " said Miller .
Then police , their guns drawn , began " coming from everywhere , " she said .
Clothing store manager Lissa Young said " several rounds of gunfire " were followed by two customers who ran into the store and said shots had been fired .
She said she immediately locked the doors and ordered the customers to the back of the store , where they waited until police gave them the all - clear .
Sanders said police shot the gunman outside a Target department store .
Investigators have no clue as to his motive , Sanders said .
Officer shot ; then mall chaos
The mall shooting took place less than 20 minutes after a Kansas City police officer was shot and wounded on a nearby road -- and about an hour and a half after police found the body of a woman in her home about five miles from the mall .
Officers found the woman dead and her car missing at 1:49 p.m. , Police Capt .
Rich Lockhart said in a statement issued Sunday evening .
A police officer spotted the car on a nearby road at 3:11 p.m .
When the officer pulled the car over , the driver opened fire , hitting the officer in one arm .
The 44 - year - old officer , a 15 - year veteran , was treated and released Sunday afternoon , Lockhart said .
" He had his wherewithal enough to put out a suspect description and direction of travel and vehicle , " Sanders said .
" It is believed the dead man [ the mall shooter ] is the one who shot the officer on Bannister road .
His vehicle was found in the parking lot , " Lockhart said .
Barely 15 minutes after the officer was wounded , police received the first reports of the shooting at the shopping mall .
In addition to the wounded police officer , Sanders said at least two people turned up at nearby hospitals after being shot at the mall .
Investigators were combing through the mall Sunday evening to ensure the gunman had no accomplices , and Sanders called the building " a giant crime scene . "
" We have hundreds of witnesses who were inside the mall when he came in , " he said .
" It was a Sunday afternoon at a mall in Middle America , so you can imagine it was crowded . "
It can be especially disruptive when a co-worker continually shows up late to meetings , Mr. Avramidis said .
The discussion is interrupted and information must be repeated to the tardy newcomer , wasting everyone else ’s time .

Q. Can being late all the time hurt a career ?
A. Yes .
At a place like a manufacturing plant or a call center , it can be grounds for dismissal if it occurs often enough .
But it can damage a career even in jobs where schedules are more flexible .
Tardy people tend to think that they can make up for their lateness by working extra hours , Ms. DeLonzor said , “ but they can never overcome the fact that it makes a very bad impression . ”
Managers , she found in her research , “ are less likely to promote tardy employees . ”
Q . What can someone do to try to be more punctual ?
A. Lateness is a very difficult habit to overcome , Ms. DeLonzor said , even though it truly hurts the offending person ’s life .
Telling a late person to be on time is like telling a dieter , “ Do n’t eat so much , ” she said .
Here are some steps she recommends to become more punctual :
HAVE A STRATEGY

RELEARN HOW TO TELL TIME
Late people tend to underestimate the amount of time their activities take by 25 percent to 30 percent , she said .
Write down all your activities and clock how long they actually take .
NEVER PLAN TO BE ON TIME Instead , plan to be early .
Punctual people build in extra transit time because they know that unexpected delays can occur .
Many tardy people — in their naïve optimism — have never learned to do this .
WELCOME THE WAIT
Bring a magazine , a book or some language tapes so that you can entertain yourself and get something done while you wait .
Q . In some cases , should n’t a company just appreciate a tardy person ’s many other excellent qualities and accept the lateness ?
The former Black Panther Mumia Abu -Jamal has spent 25 years on death row in the United States - despite strong evidence that he is innocent .
In his first British interview , he talks to Laura Smith about life in solitary , how he has remained politically active , and why the Panthers are still relevant today
SCI Greene County Prison on the outskirts of Waynesburg , Pennsylvania , sits low in the rural landscape so that it 's easy from the restaurants and petrol stations on the main road to miss the barbed wire coiled in endless circles .
Inside , the plush leather chairs that squat on shiny floors make it feel more like a private hospital than a maximum security institution .
But the black men in prison jumpsuits cleaning the floor , eyes downcast , dispel any such illusions .
Signs spell out the rules : no hoods , no unauthorised persons , only $ 20 in cash allowed .
Death row - or at least the visiting area - is a curiously ordinary place .
A central waiting room where a guard watches the goings - on .
Institutional doors opening on to small boxes , each furnished with a table and chair .
But then , inside the visiting room , there is the shock of a grown man in an orange jumpsuit , his hands cuffed , the space small enough for him to reach out and touch both walls .
And between us a layer of thick , reinforced glass .
Mumia Abu - Jamal has lived at SCI Greene since January 1995 .
Convicted and sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder of a police officer in his home town , Philadelphia , he spends his days in solitary confinement , in a room he has described as smaller than most people 's bathroom .
When I arrive , he puts his fist to the glass in greeting .
He is a tall , broad man with dreadlocked hair , still dark , and a beard slightly greying at the edges .
He has lively eyes .
It is hard to know how to begin a conversation with Abu - Jamal , revered for his activism around the world as much as he is reviled as a cop killer by some in his home country .
He is careful about who he agrees to see and rarely talks to the mainstream media - this is the first time he has granted an interview to a British newspaper .
We start with the basics - the everyday restrictions of prison life .
Visits : one a week - though it is difficult for his family to make the 660 - mile , 11 - hour round - trip from Philadelphia .
Money : a stipend of less than $ 20 ( £ 10 ) per month .
Phone calls : three a week lasting 15 minutes each - but a quarter of an hour to Philadelphia costs $ 5.69 ( £ 2.77 ) .
This being Abu - Jamal , a campaigning journalist who has written five books about injustice while in prison , it is not long before we are on to the bigger questions : why SCI Greene , which takes most of its 1,700 inmates from Philadelphia , was built " the farthest you can be from Philly and still be in the state of Pennsylvania " .
" I believe it is intentional , " he says .
" I could count the times on my hand when I have seen this whole visiting area full . "
And why Global Tel Net , the firm that provides the prison phone calls , is allowed to charge so much of people who have so little .
His conclusion is characteristically pithy : " The poorest pay the most . "
Abu - Jamal has eight children , the eldest of whom is 38 , and several grandchildren .
How does he keep in touch ?
" Some grandchildren I have not seen .
That 's difficult .
You try to keep contact through the phone , you write .
I send cards that I draw and paint .
To let them know the old man still loves them . "
Abu - Jamal 's father William died when he was nine ; his mother Edith died in February 1990 - eight years after he was imprisoned .
He goes very quiet telling me this , and there does n't seem much point asking how it felt not to be able to sit with her at the end .
Abu - Jamal has been locked up since he was 27 .
He is now 53 .
The story of how he ended up here has been told often .
As a teenager he had been active in the Black Panther party but by 1981 , with most of the party 's leaders either dead or in jail , he had become a well - respected radio reporter and president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Association of Black Journalists .
Radio journalism was not well paid , however , and Abu - Jamal supplemented his income by driving a taxi at night .
In the early hours of December 9 1981 , he was out in his cab when he saw his brother , Billy Cook , being stopped by a police officer , Daniel Faulkner .
A struggle ensued , during which Cook says Faulkner assaulted him .
Abu - Jamal got out of his cab .
Minutes later , Faulkner had been shot dead and Abu - Jamal was slumped nearby with a bullet wound to the chest , his own gun not far away .
At his trial in 1982 it appeared an open and shut case .
A former Black Panther with a history of antipathy towards the police ( although no criminal record ) .
A white police officer dead .
A succession of eye - witnesses who testified that Abu - Jamal was the killer .
And the icing on the cake : a confession made by Abu - Jamal himself at the hospital where he was taken for treatment .
But some inconvenient facts were obscured : Abu - Jamal 's gun was never tested to see whether it had been fired ; his hands were never swabbed to establish whether he had fired it ; and his gun 's bullets were never solidly linked to those that killed Faulkner .
The crime scene was never secured .
Of the three witnesses , one has since admitted to lying under police pressure , another has disappeared amid evidence that she too was under duress , and the third initially told police that he had seen the killer run away , but changed his story .
Evidence from others who said they saw a third man running away was played down .
Evidence of Abu - Jamal 's confession was equally shaky .
Although two witnesses testified to hearing him shout , " I shot the motherfucker and I hope the motherfucker dies " , the doctors who treated him insist that his medical condition made such a thing impossible .
Neither of the two police officers who claimed to have heard the confession reported it until more than two months after the shooting - after Abu - Jamal had made allegations of being abused by police during his arrest .
On the contrary , one noted in his log at the time that " the negro male made no comment " in hospital .
The trial judge , Albert Sabo , was a former member of the powerful police union , the Fraternal Order of Police , known to favour prosecutors .
He overturned permission Abu - Jamal had obtained to represent himself , excluded him from much of his own trial , and presided over jury selection in which the majority of black candidates were removed .
A court stenographer overheard Sabo telling a colleague : " I 'm going to help them fry the nigger . "
There were other irregularities , so many that Amnesty International concluded in 2000 that the trial was " in violation of minimum international standards " , adding , " the interests of justice would best be served by the granting of a new trial to Mumia Abu - Jamal " .
In the 25 years since , Abu -Jamal has appealed against his conviction many times , and many times has had his pleas rejected .
He has had two dates set for his execution , only for them to be overturned by legal pressure .
He is now awaiting the outcome of his latest appeal ; this time by the second highest court in the US .
His lead lawyer , Robert R Bryan , describes it as " the first time in 25 years that Mumia has had a chance at a free and fair trial " .
Abu - Jamal is more circumspect .
" I have learned not to do predictions , " he says .
" It 's not helpful , psychologically .
I do n't sit and fret about things . "
Instead , he spends his days writing about prison life and social struggles around the world .
He takes reams of notes from books sent in by supporters , so that he can refer to them when they are taken away ( he is allowed only seven in his cell ) .
" I confess , I am a nerd , " he says , laughing .
He uses his weekly phone calls to record radio commentaries that are broadcast around the world .
Then there are the speeches he records - he spoke at the World Congress Against the Death Penalty this year and the Million Man March in 1995 - the cards he paints for his family , and his drawing .
He is currently working on his sixth book , Jailhouse Lawyers , about those prisoners who , like himself , help prepare legal cases with other inmates .
He uses a beaten - up typewriter ; he has never seen a computer .
Asked about the work of which he is proudest , he cites his 2004 book , We Want Freedom , a history of the Black Panther party .
Abu - Jamal spends 22 hours a day alone in his cell - except at weekends , when it 's 24 .
For two hours between 7 am and 9 am every weekday he has the option of going out into the yard - or " cage " , as he prefers to call it .
It is 60ft square and fenced on all sides , including overhead .
Because " air is precious " , he rarely refuses , but not everyone takes up the offer .
" People have different ways , " he says .
" I know some guys who play chess for hours and hours , shouting the moves between cells .
Some guys argue with other guys .
Some guys used to enjoy smut books , but they 've stopped those now .
A lot of guys do n't come out .
I think it 's depression .
You get tired of seeing the same old faces .
The role of television is the illusion of company , noise .
I call it the fifth wall and the second window : the window of illusion . "
Many of the younger prisoners call him " papa " or " old head " and it is clear that he is touched .
" When you are out in the yard , it 's dudes joshing , " he says .
" Guys being guys , playing ball .
You have this machismo . "
One of the things that seems to keep him going are these relationships with other guys in " the hole " .
Many of them have inspired me and taught me ... about how things are on the street now , how young people are talking and walking . "
I ask how prison has changed him .
" In ways I could not have imagined , " he says .
" It has made me immensely patient .
I was not before .
It has given me an introspection that I had n't had before , and even a kind of compassion I had n't had before . "
In Abu -Jamal 's company , it is easy to forget that you are inside prison walls .
As he talks , one is pulled into a world of urgent work that needs doing , of debates to be thrashed out , of injustices to be tackled .
With characteristic eloquence , he calls Hurricane Katrina " a rude awakening from an illusion " , watching television " a profoundly ignorising experience " and observes that much commercial hip - hop contains " no distinction , except in beat and tone , to a Chrysler advert " .
" If the message is , I am cool because I am rich , and if you get rich , you can be cool like me , that 's a pretty fucked - up message . "
On American politics , he is damning .
" You would think that a country that goes to war allegedly to spread democracy would practice it in its own country . "
Born Wesley Cook in the Philadelphia projects , he adopted the name Mumia as a 14 - year - old ( later adding Abu - Jamal - " father of Jamal " in Arabic - when his first son was born ) .
The following year , aged just 15 , he helped found the Philadelphia branch of the Black Panther party after being handed a copy of their newspaper in the street .
" I was like , whoah , " he says .
" It just thrilled me .
I was like , this is heaven .
This is great .
Everything .
It was the truth .
Uncut , unalloyed .
It was everything .
It fit me . "
He spent long days helping with party activities , which included free children 's breakfast programmes and the monitoring of police , whose corruption at that time has since become notorious ( at least a third of the officers involved in Abu - Jamal 's investigations have since been found to have engaged in corrupt activities , including the fabrication of evidence to frame suspects ) .
Mostly , as the party 's lieutenant of information , he wrote , gathering stories for The Black Panther , the party 's newsletter .
" It was great fun , " he remembers now .
" You worked six and seven days a week and 18 hours a day for no pay ...
When I tell young people that now they are like , what was that last part ?
Are you crazy , man ?
But because we were socialists we did n't want pay .
We wanted to serve our people , free our people , stop the homicide and make revolution .
We thought about the party morning , noon and night .
It was a very busy but fulfilling life for thousands of people across the country .
We were serving our people and what could be better than that ? "
Subject to relentless disruption by the FBI 's Counter Intelligence Programme , which targeted radical and progressive organisations , and riven by internal disagreements , the Black Panthers imploded in the early 1970s .
For Abu - Jamal it was a personal tragedy .
" Despair , " he says when asked how it felt .
" A profound despair . "
He is adamant that the party 's message is still relevant today .
" Millions of black people are more isolated in economic , social and political terms than they were 30 years ago , " he says .
" I remember a photograph of an elderly black woman ( after Katrina ) who had wrapped herself in the American flag and I remember looking at it and being so struck by it .
Maybe she was n't thinking visually , she was probably very cold and hungry , but I could n't help thinking , what does citizenship mean ?
Are you a citizen if in the wealthiest country on earth you are left to starve , to sink or swim , to drown at the time of the flood ? "
If Abu -Jamal 's latest appeal is successful he could be a granted a retrial or have the death penalty overturned .
If it is not , his execution could quickly follow .
He does not sound afraid .
" I spend my days preparing for life , not preparing for death , " he says .
" They have n't stopped me from doing what I want every day .
I believe in life , I believe in freedom , so my mind is not consumed with death .
It 's with love , life and those things .
In many ways , on many days , only my body is here , because I am thinking about what 's happening around the world . "
As we leave , people emerge from other visiting rooms into the central area .
There 's a family with teenage children ; a young mother whose little daughter has spent much of our interview peeking through the door - to Abu - Jamal 's delight ; a grandfather being pushed in a wheelchair .
A mother says to her children with a forced cheeriness : " That was a nice visit , was n't it ?
I 'm sure glad we came . "
We step outside into a perfect summer day .
All I can think of is my last view after saying goodbye to Abu - Jamal : a row of men , all black , standing behind glass .
Their hands cuffed , their faces smiling goodbye to their families , their voices shouting greetings to each other .
In a couple of minutes , each man will trek back to a cell no bigger than your bathroom , with no company but their own .
But for now , just for now , there is the sight of life .
And they 're drinking it in .
Lots of people , including for example my CEO , say that the hand - held mobile is going to be a crucial , maybe a dominant , way for people to experience the Net ; particularly on the other side of what we now call the digital divide .
Only there ’s an economic problem .
I do n’t know anyone who ’s really satisfied with the quality of the mobile
Net experience ; the iPhone seems to be pushing the edge of tolerable , as long as you ’re on WiFi .
But still , where ’s the rich menu of multi-modal multi-media location - sensitive always - on exquisitely - personalized applications that the hardware and the Net ought to deliver ?
Surely there ’s something more interesting than Blackberry - style mail ?
Here ’s one problem : fixed - rate data plans .
With those , once the telco has your money they really want you on the network as little as possible ; there ’s no incentive to make it run faster or have better apps or lure you into using it more .
Some of the network operators have this idea that the way to make money is to control the relationship with the customer and extract a piece of unit of payment that flows through a mobile device .
The conventional wisdom — and one I buy into — is that businesses ought to focus on their core competences .
For mobile network operators , those would be bandwidth and billing .
So , here ’s a recipe for blowing up the mobile - network business and making the world better and also a whole lot of money .
Discontinue all flat - rate mobile data plans .
Offer a - la - carte data at a price that seems obscenely , ridiculously , low .
Radically open up the network .
Let anyone connect anything to it .
Sell phones that make it really easy to download apps from anywhere and run them .
Build a developer ecosystem .
Make it effortless to get in .
Build a hot - new - apps social network ; maybe in alliance with one of the big existing social nets .
Do n’t ask developers for any money .
But sell the use of your billing system at a really attractive rate , so people can sign up for apps and have it billed to their phone plan .
Do it at a scale that an app can charge a dime a month and still make money on scale .
Duck and cover , because the explosion of creativity and new business models will cause some casualties .
Seems like a no - brainer to me .
The following are a quick ( random , off the top of various heads ) list of things that I think are anti-pitfalls in Python .
That is , because the language has these features , it is harder to make programming mistakes .
Thanks to Dougal , Anthony and Toby for running their eyes over this list , and for their suggestions .
1. Everything 's a reference to an object ( no magic line - noise )
Python does n't have a separate scalar / reference syntax !
Celebrate !
Dereferencing is one of the hardest concepts for a new programmer to learn , and I know from personal experience that some people gave up on the whole programming caper just because they did n't understand pointer arithmetic and dereferencing in C. Aside : perhaps it might be because it 's such a fundamental pitfall in other languages that people coming from them have such trouble coping with python 's " names for objects " approach .
How many times have we seen new Python programmers despairingly ask " how do I pass by reference " ?
Pitfall avoided : Many and various errors due to not getting the magic line - noise quite right or not fully understanding the concept of dereferencing .
2. Real polymorphism
( or rather , not that jumping - through - hoops , interface - tied , type - casting - up - the - wazoo anticipate - all - use - cases polymorphism that some languages force on users )
Everything 's an object and there 's no built - in type checking on arguments .
Interfaces generally evolve through consensus - if a function is written that accepts a file object argument to read data from , then any object that implements a read ( ) method will do as a substitute argument - a StringIO instance , the result of a urllib.urlopen ( ) call , a socket , etc .
Combine with built - in variable argument lists and keyword argument lists ( with default values ) for a really satisfying taste !
Pitfall avoided : Inflexibility due to not anticipating some new use of your code .
3. Sequence unpacking
I use it so much .
Mostly just automatically too when returning multiple values from a method / function .
And " a , b = b , a " does the right thing .
Pitfall avoided : Messy code .
4 . The call operator
Bound methods , functions , classes ... all use exactly the same interface and all are first - class objects .
Pitfalls avoided : Having to deal with ( and remember ) the different ways of calling different callable things .
Also , like # 2 you do n't have to worry about what kind of callable you might get if you accept one as a function argument .
5. Automatic memory management
W00t !
Also under this heading could be the complete inability of user input to mangle code and take over your system ( caveat : no use of exec / eval ) .
Pitfalls avoided : Memory usage going out of control .
Your system being compromised because you did n't bounds - check some string from the Real World .
6 . The print statement
A lot of other languages have a print statement or function but Python 's is particularly good at just dumping a bunch of information in human - readable form .
It just works .
This is mostly because many / most builtin objects have useful repr methods .
BTW , I think it 's a good thing that it adds spaces , even with a dangling comma .
If I want fine control over output , I 'll use sys.stdout.write ( ) .
Pitfall avoided : Inability to just have a gander at what 's going on .
7. Indentation for structure
Not only does this save typing , but it also means that code is far more readable than in some other languages .
Pitfalls avoided : Unreadable code .
Strange errors due to not using block delimeters when you should have used them .
8. Ubiquitous , unencumbering exception system
It 's available and used everywhere , and you do n't have to trap exceptions if you do n't want to .
Trapping exceptions can be as fine - grained as you like , and you can send an arbitrary object of information along with the exception .
Now that 's nice .
9. Introspection
From Dougal : you can poke into any object .
You can test whether objects have attributes , or whether they 're callable , or ...
Pitfall avoided : Like # 6 , you can get in there to understand what 's really going on in your own code .
10 . Feature - full , rock - solid , simple built - in types
It can be argued that a lot of problems are averted just by having the solid built - in string , tuple , list and dictionary types .
The potential problems in other languages being errors in implementing those types or using half - assed attempts at implementing them .
Pitfall avoided : Half - assed basic type ( re -) implementations .
11 . No namespace pollution ( unless you really want to )
Another from Dougal : Python does n't automatically pollute namespaces unless you specifically force it to with statements like " from foo import * " .
Pitfall avoided : Namespace pollution , and the strange side - effects that occur .
12 . The python shell ( interactive interpreter )
From Toby : " if for no other reason than that i do n't need a calculator any more ; ) " .
I definitely echo that sentiment , and more ...
The interactive interpreter prompt lets new and experienced Python users alike muck around with code to see what it does .
I could n't imagine developing regular expressions without the interactive shell :)
Pitfall avoided :
This is more a tool for avoiding a bunch of errors you might have run into without the ability to test ideas and code fragments out .
13 . PDB
Tomorrow marks the 50 - year anniversary of the publication of the Wolfenden report on homosexual offences and prostitution .
It emerged at a time of great sexual ignorance .
In the 1950s there were no manuals for the young , and we had to do our best with baffling encyclopaedia entries .
Our elders wanted to re-establish the imagined values of Britain 's lost empire .
They were full of warnings about VD and how Rome fell because of its tolerance of homosexuality .
So as well as the disastrous Suez campaign of 1956 , there was a tripling of prosecutions for homosexual offences after 1945 .
The police frequently obtained their convictions by offering not to charge a man in return for the names of his partners , until they had a whole " ring " to bring to court .
Suicides before these mass trials were common , and those found guilty usually received long prison sentences .
As a result queers , though as numerous as today , tried to be largely invisible , conducting furtive lives under the constant threat of blackmail , exposure , prison and disgrace .
But when the recently knighted John Gielgud was caught cottaging in London , and Lord Montagu was accused of assaulting boy scouts in Hampshire , homosexuality suddenly became visible .
Gielgud was fined a token £ 10 , but was , to the dismay of the authorities , cheered when he next appeared on stage .
The case against Montagu was dismissed when the police were shown to have altered his passport in their eagerness to get him .
Furious at this public disgrace , and probably encouraged by the home secretary , Sir David Maxwell Fyfe , the police obtained confessions from two young airmen in return for immunity from prosecution and arrested Montagu again , along with two others .
Their houses were searched without warrants .
When all three were sent to jail , the ordinary public showed what it thought of this vindictiveness by cheering Montagu and his friends and booing and spitting on the airmen .
At that time , according to Dr Alfred Kinsey , who had recently published his report on male sexuality , the West End of London had more street - walkers than Havana , and the government was wondering what to do .
A royal commission was proposed into prostitution , and liberals in the Home Office suggested that it should investigate homosexuality as well .
Maxwell Fyfe , who may have thought it an opportunity to tighten the law , took the idea to the cabinet , where the one well - known queer kept his mouth discreetly shut .
Churchill , near the end of his career , wanted to sweep the subject under the carpet by forbidding the reporting of details of homosexual cases .
This proved impracticable , but a Home Office committee did n't have to publish all its evidence like a royal commission .
So the Wolfenden committee came into being , under Jack Wolfenden , the vice - chancellor of Reading University .
His own son , though he probably did n't then know it , was gay .
The committee met for three years before deciding , with one dissenting opinion ( an adamant procurator fiscal ) , that homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence .
Beyond that it was scared to go : adulthood should remain at 21 and buggery should stay illegal .
Even this was far too shocking for a Conservative government , and it was 10 years before the law was changed under the Labour home secretary Roy Jenkins .
By then the very existence of the report had changed the climate of opinion .
Homosexuality was widely discussed and ignorance no longer possible .
The change , once made , seemed obviously right .
Though governments continued to be craven , later liberalisations have been accepted almost without comment .
Now young people are amazed that homosexuality was ever illegal at all .
For us older people , the transformation of life has been scarcely credible .
The producer of Consenting Adults ( my television play about Jack Wolfenden and his son Jeremy ) , born in 1956 , says he 's astonished we had to wait so long for civil partnerships to be legal .
I , who grew up when gayness seemed like a life sentence to secrecy and shame , am amazed it ever happened at all .
When my partner and I came out of the register office arm in arm into the busy street I wondered , as I 've wondered all my life , what people would think about us .
But no one even looked up .
And for that we can thank Jack Wolfenden , who - despite his distress at his son's sexuality - laid out the arguments for change in an objective and ultimately irresistible way .
Of course there is still prejudice - in the macho worlds of the City and football , and especially in schools .
With puberty coming earlier , gays are found out in their early teens .
Adolescent boys are conformist and bullying is a real problem .
But most of us can forget our difference and get on with our lives as ordinary people , not a frightened minority defined solely by our sexuality .
· Julian Mitchell is the author of the play Consenting Adults , which is broadcast on BBC4 at 9 pm on Wednesday .

For some , patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel .
For others , it means dissent against a government ’s abuse of the people ’s rights .
I have never met a politician in Washington or any American , for that matter , who chose to be called unpatriotic .
Nor have I met anyone who did not believe he wholeheartedly supported our troops , wherever they may be .
What I have heard all too frequently from various individuals are sharp accusations that , because their political opponents disagree with them on the need for foreign military entanglements , they were unpatriotic , un - American evildoers deserving contempt .
The original American patriots were those individuals brave enough to resist with force the oppressive power of King George .
I accept the definition of patriotism as that effort to resist oppressive state power .
The true patriot is motivated by a sense of responsibility and out of self - interest for himself , his family , and the future of his country to resist government abuse of power .
He rejects the notion that patriotism means obedience to the state .
Resistance need not be violent , but the civil disobedience that might be required involves confrontation with the state and invites possible imprisonment .
Peaceful , nonviolent revolutions against tyranny have been every bit as successful as those involving military confrontation .
Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , achieved great political successes by practicing nonviolence , and yet they suffered physically at the hands of the state .
But whether the resistance against government tyrants is nonviolent or physically violent , the effort to overthrow state oppression qualifies as true patriotism .
True patriotism today has gotten a bad name , at least from the government and the press .
Those who now challenge the unconstitutional methods of imposing an income tax on us , or force us to use a monetary system designed to serve the rich at the expense of the poor are routinely condemned .
These American patriots are sadly looked down upon by many .
They are never praised as champions of liberty as Gandhi and Martin Luther King have been .
Liberals , who withhold their taxes as a protest against war , are vilified as well , especially by conservatives .
Unquestioned loyalty to the state is especially demanded in times of war .
Lack of support for a war policy is said to be unpatriotic .
Arguments against a particular policy that endorses a war , once it is started , are always said to be endangering the troops in the field .
This , they blatantly claim , is unpatriotic , and all dissent must stop .
Yet , it is dissent from government policies that defines the true patriot and champion of liberty .
It is conveniently ignored that the only authentic way to best support the troops is to keep them out of dangerous undeclared no - win wars that are politically inspired .
Sending troops off to war for reasons that are not truly related to national security and , for that matter , may even damage our security , is hardly a way to patriotically support the troops .
Who are the true patriots , those who conform or those who protest against wars without purpose ?
How can it be said that blind support for a war , no matter how misdirected the policy , is the duty of a patriot ?
Randolph Bourne said that , " War is the health of the state . ”
With war , he argued , the state thrives .
Those who believe in the powerful state see war as an opportunity .
Those who mistrust the people and the market for solving problems have no trouble promoting a " war psychology ” to justify the expansive role of the state .
This includes the role the Federal Government plays in our lives , as well as in our economic transactions .
Certainly , the neoconservative belief that we have a moral obligation to spread American values worldwide through force justifies the conditions of war in order to rally support at home for the heavy hand of government .
It is through this policy , it should surprise no one , that our liberties are undermined .
The economy becomes overextended , and our involvement worldwide becomes prohibited .
Out of fear of being labeled unpatriotic , most of the citizens become compliant and accept the argument that some loss of liberty is required to fight the war in order to remain safe .
This is a bad trade - off , in my estimation , especially when done in the name of patriotism .
Loyalty to the state and to autocratic leaders is substituted for true patriotism ; that is , a willingness to challenge the state and defend the country , the people and the culture .
The more difficult the times , the stronger the admonition comes that the leaders be not criticized .
Because the crisis atmosphere of war supports the growth of the state , any problem invites an answer by declaring war , even on social and economic issues .
This elicits patriotism in support of various government solutions , while enhancing the power of the state .
Faith in government coercion and a lack of understanding of how free societies operate encourages big - government liberals and big - government conservatives to manufacture a war psychology to demand political loyalty for domestic policy just as is required in foreign affairs .
The long - term cost in dollars spent and liberties lost is neglected as immediate needs are emphasized .
It is for this reason that we have multiple perpetual wars going on simultaneously .
Thus , the war on drugs , the war against gun ownership , the war against poverty , the war against illiteracy , the war against terrorism , as well as our foreign military entanglements are endless .
All this effort promotes the growth of statism at the expense of liberty .
A government designed for a free society should do the opposite , prevent the growth of statism and preserve liberty .
Once a war of any sort is declared , the message is sent out not to object or you will be declared unpatriotic .
Yet , we must not forget that the true patriot is the one who protests in spite of the consequences .
Condemnation or ostracism or even imprisonment may result .
Nonviolent protesters of the Tax Code are frequently imprisoned , whether they are protesting the code ’s unconstitutionality or the war that the tax revenues are funding .
Resisters to the military draft or even to Selective Service registration are threatened and imprisoned for challenging this threat to liberty .
Statism depends on the idea that the government owns us and citizens must obey .
Confiscating the fruits of our labor through the income tax is crucial to the health of the state .
The draft , or even the mere existence of the Selective Service , emphasizes that we will march off to war at the state ’s pleasure .
A free society rejects all notions of involuntary servitude , whether by draft or the confiscation of the fruits of our labor through the personal income tax .
A more sophisticated and less well - known technique for enhancing the state is the manipulation and transfer of wealth through the fiat monetary system operated by the secretive Federal Reserve .
Protesters against this unconstitutional system of paper money are considered unpatriotic criminals and at times are imprisoned for their beliefs .
The fact that , according to the Constitution , only gold and silver are legal tender and paper money outlawed matters little .
The principle of patriotism is turned on its head .
Whether it ’s with regard to the defense of welfare spending at home , confiscatory income tax , or an immoral monetary system or support for a war fought under false pretense without a legal declaration , the defenders of liberty and the Constitution are portrayed as unpatriotic , while those who support these programs are seen as the patriots .
If there is a war going on , supporting the state ’s effort to win the war is expected at all costs , no dissent .
The real problem is that those who love the state too often advocate policies that lead to military action .
At home , they are quite willing to produce a crisis atmosphere and claim a war is needed to solve the problem .
Under these conditions , the people are more willing to bear the burden of paying for the war and to carelessly sacrifice liberties , which they are told is necessary .
The last 6 years have been quite beneficial to the health of the state , which comes at the expense of personal liberty .
Every enhanced unconstitutional power of the state can only be achieved at the expense of individual liberty .
Even though in every war in which we have been engaged civil liberties have suffered , some have been restored after the war ended , but never completely .
That has resulted in a steady erosion of our liberties over the past 200 years .
Our government was originally designed to protect our liberties , but it has now , instead , become the usurper of those liberties .
We currently live in the most difficult of times for guarding against an expanding central government with a steady erosion of our freedoms .
We are continually being reminded that 9/11 has changed everything .
Unfortunately , the policy that needed most to be changed , that is , our policy of foreign interventionism , has only been expanded .
There is no pretense any longer that a policy of humility in foreign affairs , without being the world ’s policemen and engaging in nation building , is worthy of consideration .
We now live in a post - 9/11 America where our government is going to make us safe no matter what it takes .
We are expected to grin and bear it and adjust to every loss of our liberties in the name of patriotism and security .
Though the majority of Americans initially welcomed the declared effort to make us safe , and we are willing to sacrifice for the cause , more and more Americans are now becoming concerned about civil liberties being needlessly and dangerously sacrificed .
The problem is that the Iraq war continues to drag on , and a real danger of it spreading exists .
There is no evidence that a truce will soon be signed in Iraq or in the war on terror or the war on drugs .
Victory is not even definable .
If Congress is incapable of declaring an official war , it is impossible to know when it will end .
We have been fully forewarned that the world conflict in which we are now engaged will last a long , long time .
The war mentality and the pervasive fear of an unidentified enemy allows for a steady erosion of our liberties , and , with this , our respect for self - reliance and confidence is lost .
Just think of the self - sacrifice and the humiliation we go through at the airport screening process on a routine basis .
Though there is no scientific evidence of any likelihood of liquids and gels being mixed on an airplane to make a bomb , billions of dollars are wasted throwing away toothpaste and hair spray , and searching old women in wheelchairs .
Our enemies say boo , and we jump , we panic , and then we punish ourselves .
We are worse than a child being afraid of the dark .
But in a way , the fear of indefinable terrorism is based on our inability to admit the truth about why there is a desire by a small number of angry radical Islamists to kill Americans .
It is certainly not because they are jealous of our wealth and freedoms .
We fail to realize that the extremists , willing to sacrifice their own lives to kill their enemies , do so out of a sense of weakness and desperation over real and perceived attacks on their way of life , their religion , their country , and their natural resources .
Without the conventional diplomatic or military means to retaliate against these attacks , and an unwillingness of their own government to address the issue , they resort to the desperation tactic of suicide terrorism .
Their anger toward their own governments , which they believe are coconspirators with the American Government , is equal to or greater than that directed toward us .
These errors in judgment in understanding the motive of the enemy and the constant fear that is generated have brought us to this crisis where our civil liberties and privacy are being steadily eroded in the name of preserving national security .
We may be the economic and the military giant of the world , but the effort to stop this war on our liberties here at home in the name of patriotism is being lost .
The erosion of our personal liberties started long before 9/11 , but 9/11 accelerated the process .
There are many things that motivate those who pursue this course , both well - intentioned and malevolent , but it would not happen if the people remained vigilant , understood the importance of individual rights , and were unpersuaded that a need for security justifies the sacrifice for liberty , even if it is just now and then .
The true patriot challenges the state when the state embarks on enhancing its power at the expense of the individual .
Without a better understanding and a greater determination to rein in the state , the rights of Americans that resulted from the revolutionary break from the British and the writing of the Constitution will disappear .
The record since September 11th is dismal .
Respect for liberty has rapidly deteriorated .
Many of the new laws passed after 9/11 had , in fact , been proposed long before that attack .
The political atmosphere after that attack simply made it more possible to pass such legislation .
The fear generated by 9/11 became an opportunity for those seeking to promote the power of the state domestically , just as it served to falsely justify the long - planned invasion of Iraq .
The war mentality was generated by the Iraq war in combination with the constant drumbeat of fear at home .
Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden , who is now likely residing in Pakistan , our supposed ally , are ignored , as our troops fight and die in Iraq and are made easier targets for the terrorists in their backyard .
While our leaders constantly use the mess we created to further justify the erosion of our constitutional rights here at home , we forget about our own borders and support the inexorable move toward global government , hardly a good plan for America .
The accelerated attacks on liberty started quickly after 9/11 .
Within weeks , the PATRIOT Act was overwhelmingly passed by Congress .
Though the final version was unavailable up to a few hours before the vote , no Member had sufficient time to study it .
Political fear of not doing something , even something harmful , drove the Members of Congress to not question the contents , and just voted for it .
A little less freedom for a little more perceived safety was considered a fair trade - off , and the majority of Americans applauded .
The PATRIOT Act , though , severely eroded the system of checks and balances by giving the government the power to spy on law - abiding citizens without judicial supervision .
The several provisions that undermine the liberties of all Americans include sneak - and - peek searches , a broadened and more vague definition of domestic terrorism , allowing the FBI access to library and bookstore records without search warrants or probable cause , easier FBI initiation of wiretaps and searches , as well as roving wiretaps , easier access to information on American citizens ’ use of the Internet , and easier access to e-mail and financial records of all American citizens .
The attack on privacy has not relented over the past 6 years .
The Military Commissions
Act is a particularly egregious piece of legislation and , if not repealed , will change America for the worse as the powers unconstitutionally granted to the executive branch are used and abused .
This act grants excessive authority to use secretive military commissions outside of places where active hostilities are going on .
The Military Commissions
Act permits torture , arbitrary detention of American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants at the full discretion of the President and without the right of habeas corpus , and warrantless searches by the NSA .
It also gives to the President the power to imprison individuals based on secret testimony .
Since 9/11 , Presidential signing statements designating portions of legislation that the President does not intend to follow , though not legal under the Constitution , have enormously multiplied .
Unconstitutional Executive Orders are numerous and mischievous and need to be curtailed .
Extraordinary rendition to secret prisons around the world have been widely engaged in , though obviously extralegal .
A growing concern in the post - 9/11 environment is the Federal Government ’s list of potential terrorists based on secret evidence .
Mistakes are made , and sometimes it is virtually impossible to get one ’s name removed even though the accused is totally innocent of any wrongdoing .
A national ID card is now in the process of being implemented .
It is called the REAL ID card , and it is tied to our Social Security numbers and our State driver ’s license .
If REAL ID is not stopped , it will become a national driver ’s license ID for all Americans .
We will be required to carry our papers .
Some of the least - noticed and least - discussed changes in the law were the changes made to the Insurrection Act of 1807 and to posse comitatus by the Defense Authorization Act of 2007 .
These changes pose a threat to the survival of our Republic by giving the President the power to declare martial law for as little reason as to restore public order .
The 1807 act severely restricted the President in his use of the military within the United States borders , and the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 strengthened these restrictions with strict oversight by Congress .
The new law allows the President to circumvent the restrictions of both laws .
The Insurrection Act has now become the " Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order Act . ”
This is hardly a title that suggests that the authors cared about or understood the nature of a constitutional Republic .
Now , martial law can be declared not just for insurrection , but also for natural disasters , public health reasons , terrorist attacks or incidents , or for the vague reason called " other conditions . ”
The President can call up the National Guard without congressional approval or the Governors ’ approval , and even send these State Guard troops into other States .
The American Republic is in remnant status .
The stage is set for our country eventually devolving into a military dictatorship , and few seem to care .
These precedent - setting changes in the law are extremely dangerous and will change American jurisprudence forever if not revised .
The beneficial results of our revolt against the King ’s abuses are about to be eliminated , and few Members of Congress and few Americans are aware of the seriousness of the situation .
Complacency and fear drive our legislation without any serious objection by our elected leaders .
Sadly , though , those few who do object to this self - evident trend away from personal liberty and empire - building overseas are portrayed as unpatriotic and uncaring .
Though welfare and socialism always fails , opponents of them are said to lack compassion .
Though opposition to totally unnecessary war should be the only moral position , the rhetoric is twisted to claim that patriots who oppose the war are not supporting the troops .
The cliché " Support the Troops ” is incessantly used as a substitute for the unacceptable notion of supporting the policy , no matter how flawed it may be .
Unsound policy can never help the troops .
Keeping the troops out of harm ’s way and out of wars unrelated to our national security is the only real way of protecting the troops .
With this understanding , just who can claim the title of " patriot ” ?
Before the war in the Middle East spreads and becomes a world conflict for which we will be held responsible , or the liberties of all Americans become so suppressed we can no longer resist , much has to be done .
Time is short , but our course of action should be clear .
Resistance to illegal and unconstitutional usurpation of our rights is required .
Each of us must choose which course of action we should take : education , conventional political action , or even peaceful civil disobedience to bring about necessary changes .
But let it not be said that we did nothing .
Let not those who love the power of the welfare / warfare state label the dissenters of authoritarianism as unpatriotic or uncaring .
Patriotism is more closely linked to dissent than it is to conformity and a blind desire for safety and security .
Understanding the magnificent rewards of a free society makes us unbashful in its promotion , fully realizing that maximum wealth is created and the greatest chance for peace comes from a society respectful of individual liberty .
This weekend I took a big step in upping the ante for JavaScript as a Language .
At some point last Friday evening I started coding and did n’t stop until sometime mid-Monday .
The result is a good - enough browser / DOM environment , written in JavaScript , that runs on top of Rhino ; capable of running jQuery , Prototype , and MochiKit ( at the very least ) .
The implications of this are phenomenal , and I ’m not the only one who ’s interested in it what this could mean for server - side JS development .
More on that in a minute , but first here ’s some sample results from running jQuery :
jQuery
$ java - jar build / js.jar Rhino 1.6 release 6 2007 06 28 js > load ( ' build/runtest/env.js ' ) ; js > window.location = ' test/index.html' ; test/index.html js > load ( ' dist/jquery.js ' ) ; //
Add pretty printing to jQuery objects : js > jQuery.fn.toString = DOMNodeList.prototype.toString ; js > $ ( ' span ' ) .remove ( ) ; [ < span#å°åŒ—Taibei > , < span#å°åŒ — > , < span#utf8class1 > , < span#utf8class2 > , < span#foo:bar > , < span#test.foo [ 5 ] bar > ] //
Yes - UTF - 8 is support in DOM documents ! js > $ ( ' span ' ) [ ] js > $ ( ' div ' ) .
append ( '< span >< b> hello !</b> world </ span >' ) ; [ < div#main > , < div#foo > ] js > $ ( ' span ' ) [ < span > , < span > ] js > $ ( ' span ' ) .
text ( ) hello !
worldhello !
world
On a whim , I then plugged in Prototype and MochiKit , both of which appeared to work OK ( I have n’t done any significant testing with them – so there ’s probably gaps ) .
Here ’s some sample results :
Prototype
$ java - jar build / js.jar Rhino 1.6 release 6 2007 06 28 js > load ( ' build/runtest/env.js ' ) ; js > window.location = ' test/index.html' ; test/index.html js > load ( ' prototype.js ' ) ; js > $ $ ( ' div p ' ) < p#firstp > , < p#ap > , < p#sndp > , < p#en > , < p#sap > ,< p#first > js> Object.toJSON ( {foo :' bar ' , baz : true} ) ; {' baz ' : true , ' foo ' : ' bar '} js > var fn = ( function ( name , msg ) { print ( name + ' ' + msg ) ; }).curry ( ' John ' ) ; js> fn( ' hello ! ' ) ;
John hello !
MochiKit
$ java - jar build / js.jar Rhino 1.6 release 6 2007 06 28 js > load ( ' build/runtest/env.js ' ) ; js > window.location = ' test/index.html' ; test/index.html js > load ( ' Mochikit.js ' ) ; js > $ $ ( 'div ' ) < div#main > , < div#foo > js > document.body.innerHTML
= '' ; js > document.body.appendChild( P( ' test ' , A ( {href : ' http://google.com/'}, ' link ' ) ) ) ; js > document.body.innerHTML
< p>test < a href= '
http://google.com/'>link</a></p> js > $ $ ( 'a ' ) < a >
I just want to emphasize that these are un-modified copies of jQuery , Prototype , and MochiKit – all running perfectly in this un-natural environment .
When I came up with this idea for an environment , I was mulling over a couple ideas : Namely , better ways of automating tests and ways to bring JS - style DOM / HTML interaction to the server - side .
Having a way to bring this popular idiom to established problem sets seemed like a lot of fun .
In short , the following ( at the very least ) can all get a big dose of JavaScript :
Automated Testing
Screen Scraping
Web Application Development
Now , if you think I ’m crazy , I ’d like to show you a couple quick examples :
Automated Testing
$ java - jar build / js.jar Rhino 1.6 release 6 2007 06 28 js > load ( ' build/runtest/env.js ' ) ; js > window.location = ' test/index.html' ; test/index.html js > load ( ' dist/jquery.js ' ) ; js > load ( ' build/runtest/testrunner.js ' ) ; js > load ( 'src/jquery/coreTest.js ' ) ; PASS ( 1 ) [ core ] Array.push ( ) PASS ( 2 ) [ core ] Function.apply ( ) PASS ( 3 ) [ core ] getElementById PASS ( 4 ) [ core ] getElementsByTagName PASS ( 5 ) [ core ] RegExp PASS ( 6 ) [ core ] jQuery ...
Oh yes , that ’s right – the full jQuery test suite is now automated and capable of running in Rhino ( passing all tests ) .
jQuery served as my initial testbed for development , making sure that I was getting all of my code right .
So if you import a copy of jQuery into this environment , it should work “ just fine ” .
By the way , you can try out the automated test suite by getting a copy of trunk / jquery out of SVN , then running make runtest – the results are just awesome .
Screen Scraping
This is one part that works pretty well right now – with the huge caveat that it only works on well - formed XML documents ( oops ! ) .
I ’ll be integrating an HTML parser into the code base so that we can make this functionality a little more resilient .
In the meantime , here ’s an example of the sort of scraping that you can do currently :
load ( " env.js " ) ; window.location = " http://alistapart.com/ " ; window.onload = function ( ) { load ( " dist/jquery.js " ) ; print ( " Newest A List Apart Posts : " ) ; $ ( " h4.title " ) .each ( function ( ) { print ( " - " + this .textContent ) ; } ) ; } ;
And here ’s another one that writes the results out to a file :
load ( " env.js " ) ; window.location = " http://alistapart.com/ " ; window.onload = function ( ) { load ( " dist/jquery.js " ) ; var str = " Newest A List Apart Posts :
" ; $ ( " h4.title " ) .each ( function ( ) { str += " - " + this .textContent + "
" ; } ) ; var out = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; out.open ( " PUT " , " file:/tmp/alist.txt " ) ; out. send ( str ) ; } ;
Oh yeah , I went there – I made PUT and DELETE requests to local files perform the expected actions .
I think the result is hilarious .
Web Application Development
This is still a work in progress , but some of the initial ideas are already at play here in this environment .
When I have some time I plan on making a JavaScript - based web app framework out of this – which should be pretty cool .
Here ’s some psuedo - code for how I think it could work :
window.onload = function ( ) { print ( " Content - type : text / html
" ) ; if ( location . href == " / " ) show_home ( ) ; print ( document.innerHTML ) ; } ; function show_home ( ) { document.load ( " index.html " ) ; document.getElementById(" time " ) .innerHTML = ( new Date ( ) ) .
toString ( ) ; }
Download !
Check out the code – there ’s still huuuge gaps of functionality missing – I only implemented the bare minimum to get this environment working ( and passing the jQuery test suite ) .
So your mileage may vary .
Download : http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery/build/runtest/env.js ( Formatted )
NOTE ( February 2009 ) :
The above code is quite out of date .
If you ’re interested in using it in your project I recommend that you visit the following Google group and download the code from the current working fork :
How to Use
To start with , you ’ll need to have , at least , Rhino 1.6R6 .
You can download it from Mozilla FTP .
Now download the env.js script and put it in the same directory as the Rhino js.jar .
In order to use it from the command - line , you ’ll wanna do something like this :
$ java - jar js.jar js > load ( ' env.js ' ) ; js > window.location = ' some.html ' ; some.html js > //
Your code here !
It ’s important that you do window.location = “ some file ” before loading any DOM - dependent code ( as the ‘ document ’ object does n’t exist before the location request ) .
A full list of Rhino - shell - specific commands can be found in the Rhino Shell docs .
If you want to write executable scripts , the contents will look something like this :
load ( ' env.js ' ) ; window.location = ' some.html ' ; window.onload = function ( ) { //
Your code here } ;
Which can then run like so : java - jar js.jar myscript.js .
Feedback is very much welcome – I ’ve only thought of a couple use - cases thus far , but I ’m sure that the surface is just being scratched .
Mrs Turnbull has vowed to carry on gardening in the village
June Turnbull , 79 , of Urchfront near Devizes , has nurtured the blooms on the plot for six years .
But now she is being told to obey health and safety rules after being spotted by a county council official .
Mrs Turnbull said : " I was very angry , I mean it seems so petty bothering with what I do here .
There 's just no point . "
Peter Hanson , divisional highways manager at Wiltshire County Council , said : " We are always happy to work with individuals and organisations that are willing to help improve the appearance of local roads through improvements such as flower beds .
I love doing it .
I want to make it as pretty as I possibly can
June Turnbull
" However , to ensure this type of work is done safely they need to seek permission from us to enable us to check there are no local safety issues , such as underground wires or pipes .
" We also require that people undertaking this type of work follow the same safety procedures as our own staff to ensure they are not put at risk . "
Urchfont Parish Council has recently applied for a licence and has had a meeting with the county council .
The flower bed MsTurnbull works in is public land
" We need to get a licence from the Highways Authority to enable work on this bed to be done , people must wear a fluorescent jacket , have warning signs and have two people working there , " Peter Newell , chairman of Urchfont Parish Council , told BBC News .
A defiant Mrs Turnbull said it was " health and safety gone mad " and has vowed to continue gardening despite the warning that she would be banned .
She insisted : " I love doing it .
I want to make it as pretty as I possibly can .
I will continue working on the flower bed . "
Karl Rove , interchangeably known as “ Boy Genius ” or “ Turd Blossom , ” has left the White House .
The press conference announcing his decision to resign has been given front - page treatment by most major media outlets , but the fact of the matter is the buzz surrounding Rove ’s departure is much ado about nothing , especially in terms of coming to grips with the remaining 16 months of the worst presidency in the history of the United States .
Rove is a domestic political marauder , the personification of a conservative movement which lacks a moral compass and has a complete disregard for facts .
The master of exploiting mainstream America ’s predilection for news - as - entertainment , under which the likes of Rupert Murdoch can manufacture headlines out of thin air , Rove helped turn “ fair and balanced ” into a national joke which everyone laughs at but few actually comprehend .
Rove served as the maestro of a political - smear orchestra composed of such intellectually challenged muckrakers as Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter , manipulating the NASCAR / professional wrestling crowd ’s addiction to seedy gossip in an effort to maintain the all - important 51 percent majority needed to win elections .
Perhaps if the Democratic Party had possessed a semblance of organization and cohesion ( not to mention a post - Clinton message that could be sold to a majority of America ) , then Rove would be but a footnote in history , known simply as the man who helped the worst governor in the history of Texas get elected .
Even the self - destructive campaign run by Al Gore in 2000 , in which he distanced himself from a sitting president who , despite all of his faults , would have defeated Bush in a landslide if the Constitution permitted a third term , was enough to deny Rove his beloved 51 percent — it was Gore , not Bush , who won the majority of votes in that contest .
It took a Republican governor of Florida , backed by a compliant Supreme Court , to put George W. Bush into the White House , not any genius on the part of Rove .
“ Bush ’s Brain ” may claim that it was his careful manipulation of fiction over fact that carried the 2004 election , in which the term “ Swift - boating ” became synonymous with political character assassination , but it was the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and the war in Iraq which sank the Democratic Party and its candidate for president , John Kerry .
It is very difficult to unseat a president in a time of war , especially when so many Democrats voted in favor of the concept , first by buying into every post - 9/11 policy put forward by the Bush administration ( find me one Democrat who actually read the Patriot Act in its entirety before it was voted into law ) and second by rubber - stamping the lies that led to Bush ’s decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 .
Remember , it was Kerry ’s inarticulate defense of his decision to vote in favor of granting war powers to the president that sank his election hopes , not his Vietnam War record .
Certainly , Karl Rove played a significant behind - the - scenes role in supporting Bush ’s war policies .
The perjury trial of “ Scooter ” Libby forced the collective of deaf , dumb and blind pseudo - journalists who populate what is known as the mainstream media in America to recognize how pathetically duplicitous and petty the Bush administration could get when it came to defending the policies propping up the so - called Global War on Terror and the awful tragedy of Iraq .
Rove ’s fingerprints were all over the decision by Vice President Dick Cheney to leak CIA officer Valerie Plame ’s name to the media in an effort to thwart the truth - telling of her husband , former Ambassador Joe Wilson .
But that is about as deep as Rove ’s involvement in the two issues that will define the presidency of George W. Bush gets .
While Rove might be the “ genius ” behind the kind of winner - takes - all dirty politics that won the Republicans a majority in Texas ( and brought down the likes of Tom “ The Hammer ” DeLay ) , he was way out of his depth when it came to the reality of national security policy .
Unlike unsubstantiated rumors of wrongdoing which can stain a political opponent ’s record for the brief moment needed to gain political advantage , regardless of what the actual truth is , the never - ending flow of dead American service members from a war based on a foundation of lies cannot be overlooked indefinitely , even by the most subservient of media outlets .
Try as Rove and his political operatives might , one cannot forever suppress the images of flag - draped caskets , row upon row of white grave markers sprouting up in cemeteries across America , or the thousands of wounded veterans left to rot in hospitals , forgotten by an administration that , with few exceptions , never knew war and used the military as an electioneering prop .
Eventually , those patriotic Americans who were fooled into believing there was actually some coherent planning behind the global conflict Bush had dispatched their youths to fight and die in were bound to get wise .
Rove never had the depth needed to navigate such serious waters .
Being the Brain of the most vapid , intellectually shallow president ever creates an apt epitaph for Rove ’s tenure at the White House .
The Bush administration has never won accolades for its substance .
Its best frontman , Colin Powell , self - destructed in front of the U.N. Security Council in February 2003 .
Powell ’s nemesis , Donald Rumsfeld , followed suit shortly thereafter , unable to coherently explain where Saddam Hussein had hidden all those WMD we went to war for , and ultimately telling the average foot soldier to pound sand when it came to the lack of adequate equipment needed to fight and survive in occupied Iraq .
Bush ’s singular appeal has been the impression of steadfastness in the eye of the storm , even if the storm is for the most part self - created .
For this we must look not to “ Bush ’s Brain , ” but instead peer deep into the dark recesses of the White House , where we can glimpse the awful “ soul ” of the president — Dick Cheney .
The vice president is the single greatest threat to American and international security in the world today .
Not Osama Bin Laden .
Not the ghost of Saddam Hussein .
Not Ahmadinejad or Kim Jung Il .
Not al - Qaida , the Taliban , or Jose Padilla himself .
Not even George W. Bush can lay claim to this title .
It is Dick Cheney ’s alone .
Operating in a never - never land of constitutional ambiguity which exists between the office of the president and the Congress of the United States , Cheney ’s office has made its impact felt on the policies of the United States of America as had no vice president ’s office before him .
Granted unprecedented oversight over national security and foreign policy by executive order in early 2001 , many months prior to the terror attacks of 9/11 , Cheney has single - handedly steered America away from being a nation among nations ( albeit superior ) , operating ( roughly ) in accordance with the rule of law , and toward its present manifestation as the new Rome , a decadent imperial power bent on global domination whatever the cost .
The absolute worst of the rot that has infected America because of the policies and actions of the Bush administration has originated from the office of the vice president .
The nonsensical response to the terror attacks of 9/11 , seeking a “ global war ” versus defending the rule of law at home and abroad , taking the lead in spreading the lies that got us involved in Iraq , legitimizing torture as a tool of American jurisprudence , advocating for warrantless wiretappings of U.S. - based communications ( regardless of what the Fourth Amendment says against illegal search and seizure ) , and pushing for an expansion of America ’s global conflict into Iran — all can be traced back to the person of Cheney as the point of origin .
America today is very much engaged in a life - or - death struggle against the forces of evil .
The enemy resides not abroad , however , but at home , vested in the highest offices of the land .
Neither Osama Bin Laden nor Saddam Hussein threatened the life blood of the United States — the Constitution — to the extent that Cheney has .
Not Hitler , Stalin , Mao or Ho Chi Minh .
Not since the American Civil War has there been a constitutional crisis of the magnitude that exists today , threatening to rip the very fabric of American society apart at the seams , courtesy of Dick Cheney .
That Congress today remains relatively mute on this crisis is one of the great mysteries of our time .
Perhaps the vagaries of national politics can be blamed .
The Democratic majority in Congress appears to have ceded its leadership role to unelected presidential candidates who seem solely empowered to comment on current events , domestic or foreign , and who , out of fear of any misstep which could hurt their chances to seize the White House as their own , refuse to actually take a substantive stand against the policies of the Bush administration .
In an effort that is curiously Rovian in the quest for electoral victory , the Democratic candidates ( with a few notable exceptions ) have been less than bold in their opposition to the heinous policies that are currently in place concerning Iraq , Iran , the war on terror , torture and constitutional violations — unless you count empty rhetoric .
In many ways , the leading Democrats , both those running for office and those currently holding office , are a far greater insult to American values than the conservative standard - bearers for the policies of Cheney .
No one of substance takes seriously the manic ranting of the Hannity / Limbaugh / Coulter triad .
These Democrats , on the other hand , have mastered the art of compromise to the point that they stand for nothing at all — this at a time in American history when the policies of the administration , derived from the dark abyss of Bush ’s soul , Cheney , provide the most concrete example of what we as Americans should be standing against .
The Democrats need to stand for something .
Cheney has provided the sort of political ammunition that would enable them to fight , and win , a constitutional battle over the heart of America , the kind of defining struggle which I believe the vast majority of Americans would rally around .
Unless the Democrats start separating themselves from the policies of the Bush administration , and take an active role in outing and suppressing the true evil that is Dick Cheney , all they will achieve in the coming years is a change in the titular political orientation of America , without the kind of deep - seated break from the failures and crimes of the past six - plus years that have taken our nation , and the world , right up to the edge of chaos .
“ Bush ’s Brain ” may be gone , but his “ Soul ” lives on .
It is high time all of America put Dick Cheney fully in the spotlight of collective accountability , purging our nation of this scourge which has harmed us in so many ways .
If there is any case for impeachment to be made against any member of the Bush administration today , it can be made against a vice president who has shamed our nation , destroyed our moral standing and broken our laws .

Payne ’s journey into class consciousness began more than 30 years ago , when she met Frank , the man who would become her husband .
Ruby was raised in a middle - class Mennonite family in Ohio , while Frank grew up in extreme poverty in Goshen , Ind .
As Ruby began to spend time in Frank ’s impoverished neighborhood , she realized that she did n’t understand the first thing about the lives of the people who lived there — and they did n’t get her , either .
Frank ’s friends were appalled that Ruby did n’t know how to defend herself in a fight ; Ruby was stunned that her neighbors would regularly get paid on Friday and , after a weekend of carousing , be broke by Monday .
As Payne studied her new surroundings , she came to appreciate more subtle nuances of class division .
She realized that her husband ’s family ’s poverty was what she would later come to call “ situational ” : they had been middle class until Frank ’s father died when Frank was 6 , and only then had they slipped down to the economy ’s bottom rung .
Most of their neighbors , by contrast , were in “ generational poverty , ” meaning their families had been poor for as long as anyone could remember .
Each group , she discovered , had its own distinct set of beliefs and customs .
Payne ’s next lesson came when her husband took a job on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade .
He was n’t rich , but he was now spending his work life with men who were , which meant that Ruby was expected to socialize with their wives .
She did n’t fit in with the rich any better than she had fit in with the poor .
More miscommunications and social awkwardness ensued , generating more fodder for Payne ’s growing understanding of class difference .
Payne was n’t quite sure what to do with this new knowledge .
As her career in education developed , from teacher to principal to administrator , she found that her understanding of class came in handy .
Because of her exposure to her husband ’s family and neighbors , it seemed , she was better able to communicate with poor students than most other middle - class teachers .
Her colleagues began to ask her for help and advice on dealing with their most troubling students , and Payne worked up an informal set of strategies and tips that she would pass along .
Then in 1993 , after moving to Texas , Payne read a book that had a profound effect on her : “ Creating Money , ” a New Age - infused guide to “ the spiritual laws of money . ”
It ’s an odd book , ostensibly dictated to the authors by two “ spirit guides ” named Orin and DaBen .
But Payne was inspired .
“ The book said , Make a list of what you want in your life and ask the universe to bring it to you , ” she told me .
“ So I did .
I wrote : ‘ I want a life without financial constraints .
I want a life without institutional constraints .
And I want to make a difference with children . ’
And it happened ! ”
Payne began to give talks on class for small groups of teachers , and they were a hit .
Word spread .
Soon she was addressing audiences all across the Texas school district where she worked .
Over spring break in 1995 , she banged out a manuscript based on her ideas and quickly published it herself .
This was “ A Framework for Understanding Poverty , ” which , she says , has gone on to sell more than a million copies .
As Payne ’s following grew , she quit her job and became a full - time speaker , author and trainer .

She now owns and runs her own business , called aha !
Process , Inc. ; it has more than 50 trainers on contract and accrues millions of dollars in annual revenues .
Ruby Payne has become a small industry : her company offers training sessions , workshops , DVDs , audiotapes , T - shirts , autographed Ruby Payne coffee mugs and lots and lots of books : a book about the hidden rules of class in the workplace , a workbook to help people in poverty learn the rules to pull themselves out , a Spanish translation of “ A Framework for Understanding Poverty . ”
In “ What Every Church Member Should Know About Poverty , ” which Payne wrote with Bill Ehlig , a minister in Baytown , Tex. , she not only urges middle - class and wealthy churches to welcome poor parishioners in the door but she also lays out the extra steps they need to take to make the newcomers feel at home .
In “ Crossing the Tracks for Love , ” Payne takes on romance , offering advice for those who enter into a relationship with a person from another class .
It ’s not easy , Payne cautions : everything from disciplining children to interior decoration is a potential flashpoint for a class - based quarrel .
So she provides tips :
“ If you ’re from middle class and marry or otherwise move into poverty , understand the need of your spouse / partner to protect you , ” she writes .
“ You are his / her possession .
Try to see the positives in this . ”
Fortune Magazine published an article in which they describe how Microsoft claims that free software , such as Linux , violates 235 of its patents .
Some key snippets ( emphasis mine ) :
Microsoft is pulling no punches :
It wants royalties .
If the company gets its way , free software wo n’t be free anymore .
… Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith and licensing chief Horacio Gutierrez sat down with Fortune recently to map out their strategy for getting FOSS users to pay royalties .
Revealing the precise figure for the first time , they state that FOSS infringes on no fewer than 235 Microsoft patents . …
In the meantime , with Microsoft seemingly barred from striking pacts with distributors , only one avenue appears open to it : paying more friendly visits to its Fortune 500 customers , seeking direct licenses .
If push comes to shove , would Microsoft sue its customers for royalties , the way the record industry has ?
“ That ’s not a bridge we ’ve crossed , ” says CEO Ballmer , “ and not a bridge I want to cross today on the phone with you . ”
The article points out that Microsoft does n’t make any specific patent claims .
They simply break the number down into categories .
But he does break down the total number allegedly violated - 235 - into categories .
He says that the Linux kernel - the deepest layer of the free operating system , which interacts most directly with the computer hardware - violates 42 Microsoft patents .
The Linux graphical user interfaces - essentially , the way design elements like menus and toolbars are set up - run afoul of another 65 , he claims .
The Open Office suite of programs , which is analogous to Microsoft Office , infringes 45 more .
E-mail programs infringe 15 , while other assorted FOSS programs allegedly transgress 68 .
I understand that Microsoft is a business and has a duty to its shareholders and the right to protect its patents .
But the question I ask here is whether this is a good idea ?
Is this really a good strategy to meet its fiduciary duty ?
Will this keep its shareholders , customers , and developers happy ?
At the moment , I do n’t think this is a wise move .
I ’m not a patent expert so there is no point in me arguing on the validity of their patent claims , so I wo n’t .
I will try to reserve judgment concerning the areas I am not well informed about .
Instead , I want to focus on the negative perception of such a move for Microsoft and the potential effects of that .
On the face of it , given the recent pact between Novell and Microsoft , this seems like a transparent attempt to scare other Linux distributors into forming their own pacts with Microsoft .
This perception of bullying certainly does n’t help Microsoft ’s image , which had been on the mend in the last few years .
Not only that , but by executing such a move , Microsoft will find it hard to avoid the charge of hypocrisy by its critics considering how Microsoft itself has been the victim of patent trolling in various lawsuits such as the EOLAS case and the more recent Vertical Computer Systems lawsuit over .
NET .
Given the recent Supreme Court rulings around patent trolling , this announcement seems especially poorly timed .
Microsoft appears to be trying to have it both ways , fighting against silly patents on the one hand while threatening enforcement of patents with the other .
Again , I do not know that Microsoft is engaging in hypocrisy or patent trolling .
I am merely focused on the perception of their actions .
I ca n’t claim that Microsoft is patent trolling because I do n’t know whether these patent claims are legitimate .
And that ’s part of the problem .
Nobody knows yet .
By not addressing specifics , Microsoft is not opening its patents to challenge .
So while they might not be patent trolling in this case , they certainly are ( whether intentionally or not ) creating an environment of fear , uncertainty , and doubt for the ecosystems that have grown around these open source projects .
This at a time when Microsoft seemed to really be warming to Open Source .
At the Mix07 conference , I really got the sense that developers and program managers at Microsoft are really starting to embrace the Open Source Software and how it fits into the Microsoft ecosystem .
This may be indicative of a disconnect within the Microsoft ranks .
It seems that the new wave of Microsoft employees , especially many of their developers and Program managers , see Open Source as a way to enhance and generate value around the Microsoft .NET development platform .
Meanwhile , it appears that the old wave of Microsoft executives and its legal department cannot look beyond the potential threat that OSS might be to Microsoft and smell opportunity .
This points to another potential negative effect of this strategy - potential developer discontent within and outside the company .
Microsoft ’s recent attempt to stifle Office 2007 ribbon look alikes pushed Mike Gunderloy from the ranks of being a relative proponent of Microsoft to deciding to completely leave the Microsoft universe .
Could this announcement have a similar effect on other developers and hurt Microsoft ’s ongoing competition with Google in retaining the best and the brightest ?
It remains to be seen .
As I said in a recent interview , I firmly believe that the .NET platform is a fantastic environment for developing open source software .
I also believe that these myriad of open source projects built with .NET benefits Microsoft immensely .
So this recent news about Microsoft ’s Patent fight just leaves me scratching my head , not because I do n’t think they have the right to defend their patents , but because I wonder if it ’s really the smart thing to do at this time .
In any case , at the very least , I hope they do n’t use the RIAA as a model of strategic brilliance and start suing their own customers .
Now that , I can unilaterally claim , would be a bad move .
What are your thoughts on this ?
Am I off base and uninformed , or do I make a good case here ?
NEARLY 1.9 m people were arrested in America for drug offences in 2006 — over three times the number detained in 1980 .
Around one in eight arrests is now drug related .
But what they achieve in the “ war on drugs ” is unclear , according to a report by The Sentencing Project , an advocacy group .
Fewer people take drugs : 14 % of people reported using them monthly in 1979 , but only 8 % in 2005 .
But arrests are increasingly for more trivial crimes : in 2006 only 17.5 % of arrests were made for the sale or manufacture of drugs , whereas some 39 % were for the possession of marijuana .

What is Table - Driven and Data - Driven Programming ?
Data / Table - Driven programming is the technique of factoring repetitious programming constructs into data and a transformation pattern .
This new data is often referred to by purists as meta - data when used in this fashion .
Data Driven and Table - Driven Programming Examples Data - Driven Programming is a style that has existed for as long as programming .
Programmers use data - driven techniques all the time without giving much thought to it .
Here is a very simple example .
Let 's say you wish to write a function that will return the tax for a particular item given the geographic state and price .
Your function may look something like this in PHP /** Naive approach **/ function returntax ( $ usstate , $ price ) { $ result = 0 ; switch ( strtoupper ( $usstate ) ) { case ' MA ' : $ result = 0.05 * $ price ; break ; case ' NJ ' : $ result = 0.07 * $ price ; break ; case ....// ad nauseum } return $ result ; } Data - Driven Programming is a style that has existed for as long as programming .
Programmers use data - driven techniques all the time without giving much thought to it .
Here is a very simple example .
Let 's say you wish to write a function that will return the tax for a particular item given the geographic state and price .
Your function may look something like this in PHP
If you look at this closely , you would observe the pattern of a*b where a is some function of state and b is the price .
If you were to take the data - driven approach , then you would write the function as /** Data - Driven **/ function returntax ( $ usstate , $ price ) { $ result = 0 ; $ aryStateTax = array ( ' MA'= >0.05 , ' NJ'= > 0.07 , ... ) ; if ( array_key_exists ( strtoupper ( $usstate ) , $ aryStateTax ) ) { $ result = $ aryStateTax [ strtoupper ( $usstate ) ] * $ price ; } return $ result ; } /** Table - Driven - if we want to put the power of logic in hands of users who can edit the state table **/ function returntax ( $ usstate , $ price ) { global $ db ; $ result = 0 ; $rs = $ db -> Execute ( 'SELECT tax FROM lustates WHERE state =' .
$ db ->qstr( strtoupper ( $usstate ) ) ) ; if ( ! $rs -> EOF ) { $ result = $ rs -> fields ( ' tax ' ) * $ price ; } $ rs -> Close ( ) ; return $ result ; } /** Data - Driven **//** Table -Driven - if we want to put the power of logic in hands of users who can edit the state table **/
The above is a fairly trivial example of Table / Data Driven programming .
In the next couple of sections , I shall demonstrate more powerful constructs of the general approach .
Using Data to Generate SQL
One neat trick is that of using data to generate code .
For example say you wanted to write a cross - tab query and you did n't want to hand - code it as you often have to in most databases .
Cross Tab Query
Suppose you wanted to create a cross tab query .
In databases without native support for such constructs , you would often do something like the below ( NOTE : example below is SQL Server syntax ) .
-- Naive repetitive painful way SELECT proj_id , SUM ( CASE WHEN proj_fund = ' Fund A ' THEN amt ELSE NULL END ) As [ totFund A ] , SUM ( CASE WHEN proj_fund = ' Fund B ' THEN amt ELSE NULL END ) As [ tot Fund B ] , ... ad nauseum , SUM ( amt )
As totalcost FROM projectfunding GROUP BY proj_id
Now if you were to pay attention to the repetitious pattern in the above , you may realize you can more quickly and more flexibly rewrite the above like the below by querying a fund list .
-- Using SQL to generate SQL - Table Driven DECLARE @sql varchar ( 3000 ) SELECT @sql = ' SELECT proj_id , ' SELECT @sql = @sql + ' SUM ( CASE WHEN proj_fund = ''' + fu_name + ''' THEN amt ELSE NULL END )
As [ tot ' + fu_name + '] , ' FROM lufunds where fund_category = ' Federal ' ORDER BY fu_name SELECT @sql = @sql + ' , SUM ( amt ) As totalcost FROM projectfunding GROUP BY proj_id ' EXEC ( @sql )
Suppose you wanted to create a cross tab query .
In databases without native support for such constructs , you would often do something like the below ( NOTE : example below is SQL Server syntax ) .
Now if you were to pay attention to the repetitious pattern in the above , you may realize you can more quickly and more flexibly rewrite the above like the below by querying a fund list .
The above approach has several benefits over the first .
One it makes our code a bit shorter thus possibly easier to read and our query dynamically changes with the records in lufunds .
We can sort our columns with ease without having to touch the code and the naming of the columns is guaranteed to be consistent with the convention we choose .
This means a general user can change the definition of the query without touching the code .
Here is a similar example using a PostgreSQL custom SUM aggregate for text and generate_series functions - that generates sql and ASP .
NET markup for a monthly crosstab report .
On the other hand , it is a bit harder to read for a novice programmer and is more prone to run-time breakage should something silly be put in the fund lookup table .
A Rudimentary Code Generator
Another class of problems where data - driven programming comes in handy is in generation of business rule code , formulas and just general code - generation .
For scripted languages such as PHP which has eval interpreter syntax `` ( for PHP ) or Javascript where you often generate this code on the fly , this approach comes in immensely handy because it allows you to codify the logic in a generic pseudo - code way and then apply certain transformation patterns to translate your logic into the programming environments needed .
For example you may want your logic to work on 3 tiers - the client - side , the server - side middle - tier , and your core database tier .
On the client - side you need something like Javascript for validation or to create highly portable pricing calculators
On the server side ( should your javascript validation fail ) or should you need to make this logic available to other apps you need something like PHP , VB , Python etc ,
on the database side you need SQL for your triggers or to update batch sets of data .
On top of that , what if the rules are constantly changing and you have a financial analyst or engineer writing these rules who is intimately versed in financial and / or engineering models but not in general programming ?
How do you make your code dynamic such that it changes with the rules and such that your rules are understandable and editable by a financial analyst or other Non-Programmer ?
How do you write the rules and have it translate to all areas where it is needed without having to tweak each side when you need the logic to change ?
One approach is to write the core of your logic as data ( pseudo - logic that can not stand on its own ) that is stored and written in such a fashion that it is easy for the rule maker or analyst to understand , can be passed thru a black box function or set of functions that will translate it into executable code for the environments you need it in , and can be self - documenting .
Creating such a format and creating the black - box functions is tricky for an all - purpose situation , but if your set of rules uses a very limited vocabulary ( a mini domain language ) - it is much more doable .
A high level view of your system would look something like this .
Data A + VBTransformPattern -> VB
Code with logical meaning C
+ -> VB
Code with logical meaning C Data A + JSTransformPattern ->
Javascript
Code with logical meaning C
+ -> Javascript Code with logical meaning C Data A + SQLTransformPattern -> SQL with logical meaning C
+ -> SQL with logical meaning C Data A + EnglishTransformPattern ->
Self - documenting report to CFO with logical meaning C Where Data A is the logic written in your mini domain language that fits in the place holders in your transformation patterns .
Data , Logic and Function - What 's the difference ?
It is interesting to note that some languages do not make much of a distinction between data and function and allow passing of pointers to functions just as easily as passing other data .
In fact if you look at the underlying architecture of many languages say C++ , VB , and several other OO languages , these are founded on what are called VTABLEs even though this subtlety is hidden from its regular use .
VTABLES are nothing more than tables that basically hold pointers to functions .
Languages like Smalltalk allow one to pass anonymous blocks of code in data structures and apply them to other data structures .
So we see that data can change data by some sort of activation function and control logic itself can be stored and changed .
We see that some of the most powerful constructs in programming treat functions , logic , and pseudo - logic as data .
So then if logic and functions are data are they a special class of data - meta -data ?
Perhaps it is the wrong question to ask .
The more important questions to answer I think deal with what we are trying to optimize for our particular situation - speed , flexibility , brevity and clarity .
The items we care about most will dictate how we partition our logic into the various buckets .
Highly productive programmers are keenly aware of their desired results and trade - offs and are experts at finding just the right balance of rigid code and data to arrive at that end .
This gives rise to a wide spectrum of uses such as simple lookup driven flow to more advanced uses like self - replicating machines that morph based on data environment changes .

Clinton regains double digit lead in Gallup poll
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) has regained a double - digit lead over Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) in a new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll two weeks after the survey found the rivals more or less tied .
Among the Republican field , Fred Thompson -- who has n't even announced his intent to run -- has passed onetime leader Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
According to USA Today , Thompson " is costing Giuliani most : A third of Thompson 's supporters say they would otherwise back the former mayor . "
" The Democratic contest generally has been stable , though a USA TODAY Poll taken June 1 - 3 had shown Obama 1 percentage point ahead of Clinton , 30 % - 29 % .
In the new survey , Clinton leads Obama 33 % - 21 % if former vice president Al Gore â who has neither entered the race nor ruled it out â is included among the candidates . "
" She leads by 39 % - 26 % if Gore is n't included .
Former North Carolina senator John Edwards is then third at 13 % . "
The new poll includes 334 Democrats and 182 independents who lean Democratic .
Penn says including independents contributes to a survey 's volatility because those voters are less committed to a candidate as well as less likely to vote in party primaries .

Homeopathic medicine was the creation of a single person , Samuel Hahnemann , who graduated from a German medical school in 1779 and practiced the " healing arts " until 1843 , first in Germany and then in Paris .
The theoretical underpinning of Hahnemann 's new approach to health and vitality is that a healthy human being is inhabited by an integrated spirit or vital force .
In Hahnemann 's words , " The vital force that animates the healthy body , rules with unbounded sway , and retains all the parts of the organism in admirable , harmonious , vital operation . . . so that our indwelling , reason - gifted mind can freely employ this living , healthy instrument for the higher purpose of our existence . "
Diseases and ailments ( other than those inflicted by physical blows to the body ) are supposedly not caused by material substances .
Rather , as Hahnemann wrote , " when a person falls ill , it is only this spiritual vital force , everywhere present in his organism , that is primarily deranged by another dynamic influence hostile to his life . "
So how does a patient overcome disease ?
By consuming a positive spiritual medicine that " occupies precisely the seat hitherto occupied by the derangement . "
In other words , the demonic element of the vital spirit must be replaced by the angelic element of the natural homeopathic remedy .
Early in his career , Hahnemann was rightly disturbed by many European medical practices -- including bloodletting with leeches , poison - induced vomiting , and acid - induced skin blisters -- that made patients sicker than they were before treatment .
In 1790 , he came across a manuscript ( while plying his second trade as a translator of Latin into German ) from a Peru - based missionary describing the remarkable malaria - curing ability of powder from the bark of Cinchona ( a species of South American evergreen tree ) .
Others had attributed the cure simply to the caustic taste of the bark , but Hahnemann realized that more caustic substances did not elicit similar cures , and so this simple explanation was false .
Curiosity drove him to do what other physician - scientists of his day did -- self - experimentation on the consequences of ingesting Cinchona powder .
After several days , Hahnemann had the epiphany of his life when he became ill with fever - like symptoms similar to those caused by malaria .
Through the similarity in symptoms evoked by a single disease and its curative agent -- which are not nearly as similar as he imagined -- Hahnemann came to the conclusion that cures to every kind of human disease could be obtained from substances that elicited the same set of symptoms in otherwise healthy people .
This assertion , which he called the " Law of Similars , " with the adage " likes are cured by likes , " became the empirical basis for practicing his newly invented homeopathic ( literally similar - suffering ) system of medicine .
Homeopathy was presented in contrast to what Hahnemann referred to as allopathic treatment with medicines that produced effects opposite to the disease they were meant to cure .
Over the next 20 years , Hahnemann traveled far and wide with his students and family members to evaluate the effects of ingesting plant and animal - derived substances from as many sources as he could find .
When a substance produced sensations similar to the symptoms of any known disease , it was added to his list of homeopathic medicines .
However , as a good physician , Hahnemann did n't want to make people sicker than they were already , so he diluted a drop of the symptom - causing substance over and over again into alcohol or water with vigorous shaking and rubbing at each stage .
( For insoluble substances , dilutions were made into powdered sugar . )
Through this process , he claimed , medicines became more potent or " highly dynamized . "
In 1810 , Hahnemann published the first edition of his masterpiece , Organon der Heilkunst ( Organon of Medicine ) , which elaborated the philosophy of homeopathy and the arguments for its validity in 271 aphorisms ( the number changed in each subsequent edition ) .
The sixth and last edition , written in 1842 but not published until 1921 , is still the basic text and defining source for homeopathic practitioners worldwide today .
Since disease is spiritual , not material , a cure is best effected when the medicine contains no interference -- no material substance -- from the original curative agent .
The greater the dilution , the stronger the medicinal spirit becomes .
A dilution of 10100 ( equal to the digit one followed by 100 zeros ) is spiritually potent , but a dilution of 10400 ( a number equal to all the particles in at least 10200 universes as big as our own ) is even more potent .
Hahnemann was adamant that material medicines could n't cure disease , but he accepted mesmerizers as a valid homeopathic alternative .
Mesmerizers were " strong - willed , well - intentioned " people with an overabundance of vital force , some of which could be donated to a sick person whose own vital force was deficient .
However , to maintain their abilities , mesmerizers had to avoid sexual intercourse and masturbation so that " all the fine vital spirits that would otherwise be employed in the production of the semen , are ready to be communicated to others . "
Why was Hahnemann so confident in his understanding of health and disease ?
First , he argued , no visible agent can be seen in association with malaria , syphilis , or smallpox , so their causes must be spiritual .
( Within a century , Pasteur 's germ theory of infection would invalidate this claim . )
Second , when a bar of iron is rubbed repeatedly in the same direction with a metal file , it can gain more and more " magnetic power , " without any change in its mass .
" In the same way , " Hahnemann wrote , " shaking a medicinal substance develops the medicinal powers hidden within . . . "
( Within a century , physicists would explain magnet formation in terms of aligning atomic axes inside a metal . )
Third , no material substance had been identified that was responsible for the malaria - curing properties in Cinchona bark .
( In 1820 , during his lifetime , quinine was discovered as the active chemical inside the bark .
He never acknowledged this finding . )
Hahnemann had no use for scientific method or theory .
He belittled scientifically - oriented physicians in writing , " How the vital force causes the organism to . . . produce disease , it would be of no practical utility to the physician to know , and will forever remain concealed from him .
. . "
His faith in the truth of his " law " likes are cured by likes was so great and absolute , he saw no need to test the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies on actual sick people .
Homeopathic remedies are still subjected to " provings , " ( their term ) only by determining whether they cause disease - like sensations in a healthy person when used at full strength , not by determining whether they actually have any curative effects in diluted form on an unhealthy person .
Meanwhile , so - called allopathic medicines that produce effects opposite to the disease -- like aspirin's relief of pain -- are rejected because they are not in harmony with the body 's vital spirit .
Homeopathy is particularly appealing to Church - rejecting post - Christian Westerners who embrace a spiritual sense of nature that is under attack from capitalistic agriculture and paternalistic medicine .
The post - Christian worldview is particularly widespread in France and Germany where pharmacies typically give homeopathic remedies as much shelf space as real medicines .
One of my best friends , a long time ago , told me that the key to food portion sizes was this : " Eat from small plates , drink from taller glasses . "
It 's a piece of advice I had forgotten , especially after moving to the U.S. where portion sizes seem to have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous .
But in a book I 'm currently reading called " Mindless Eating " this advice about container sizes is validated by Dr. Brian Wansink , Ph.D , a man who clearly knows his stuff .
And optical illusions are at the root of it all .
( See also : The Psychology of Salaries : Do You Want to Know How Much Your Coworkers Make ? )
I think back to my childhood , to one of the first really cool tricks I was shown by a teacher .
A physics teacher actually , but it could have been a math teacher or a chemist .
Anyway , the illusion is shown below , crudely illustrated by myself .
Take a look at Lincoln 's Stovepipe hat .
Is it longer than it is wide ?
As you already know this is an optical illusion , then you already know the answer is a trick .
The width and the height are identical .
Now , replace that top hat with two glasses , one a tall thin glass and one short and fat .
Here we have the issue of serving sizes when it comes to anything from juice to alcohol .
Even seasoned bar staff have way more trouble pouring an accurate drink into a short glass than they do a tall one .
Usually , they pour more into the short , fat glass .
And this is a big problem when trying to pour yourself one serving of orange juice , milk or anything else .
If you use the short glass you are always going to overpour , leading to larger portions , weight gain and , of course , less time between grocery trips .
Now consider the next optical illusion .
Which white circle is larger ?
The left or the right ?
Once again , it 's all just a matter of perception .
The circles are in fact identical in size .
BUT , they look different due to their surroundings .
The circle on the right is dwarfed by the large black circles , the one on the left overpowers them .
This , when applied to food and plate sizes , is perhaps the most important change you can make to you home life .
Serve your food on beautiful large plates and you will naturally serve yourself more of everything .
Our animal brain wants to fill the plate , and we were always told to finish what was on our plates as children .
But on a smaller plate , less food will fill it .
Here 's a quick example .
Both food portions are identical in size .
In studies Dr. Wansink performed , people ate what was in front of them and if it looked like more , they felt more full .
In fact , one study involved a burger that was simply flattened out and placed inside a larger bun .
Because it looked like a larger burger , the people in the study felt more satisfied .
Now , if you are using the larger plates at home , chances are you 're over - serving yourself on a nightly basis .
That again means more calories per meal and more food to buy more often .
It 's not good for you , it 's certainly not good for your wallet .
And it can all be avoided by simply getting smaller plates ( which to be honest are harder to find , but worth the effort .
Dinner plates have significantly increased in size since the 1950's , no doubt to accommodate our growing demand for more food ) .
There 's an old saying in cuisine ... " the first bite is with the eye . "
I believe this to be true on many levels , and not just one of taste perception .
If we see a bigger meal , we 'll feel more full .
If we see a big plate with a small amount of food , we 're already thinking " hmmm , that 's not going to be enough . "
It 's also worth noting that these days , time plays a big factor in our eating habits .
Like the French , we all need to slow down and enjoy our food .
Take longer , smaller mouthfuls .
And above all , we need to let our bodies tell us when we are full , not signals like an empty plate or glass .
As a Wise Bread reader , you 're already smart about where you shop for your food .
You also need to be smart about how you eat it .
Smaller portions are better for your waistline and your wallet .
Do n't get fooled by optical illusions .
You can find a copy of Dr. Wansink 's excellent book at Amazon ( grab the paperback , it 's cheaper . )
I have n't even scratched the surface of the stories he tells about our mindless eating habits .
An eye - opening read and well worth your time .

Was 1970s Tokyo so crowded , its apartments so small , that they were forced to seek privacy in public parks at night ?
And what about those peeping toms ?
Are the couples as oblivious as they seem to the gawkers trespassing on their nocturnal intimacy ?
If the social phenomena captured in these photographs seem distinctly linked to Japanese culture , Mr. Yoshiyuki ’s images of voyeurs reverberate well beyond it .
Viewing his pictures means that you too are looking at activities not meant to be seen .
We line up right behind the photographer , surreptitiously watching the peeping toms who are secretly watching the couples .
Voyeurism is us .
The series , titled “ The Park , ” is on view at Yossi Milo Gallery in Chelsea , the first time the photographs have been exhibited since 1979 , when they were introduced at Komai Gallery in Tokyo .
For that show the pictures were blown up to life size , the gallery lights were turned off , and each visitor was given a flashlight .
Mr. Yoshiyuki wanted to reconstruct the darkness of the park .
“ I wanted people to look at the bodies an inch at a time , ” he has said .
The oversize prints were destroyed after the show , and the series was published in 1980 as a book , one now difficult to find .
Last year Mr. Yoshiyuki made new editions of the prints in several sizes , which have brought renewed interest in his work .
Since April images from the series have been acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York , the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago , the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art .

The Wall Street Journal says Kevin Hassett has discovered the Laffer curve , but I think these data might say something else .
Here 's the picture from the editorial where they are making their usual plea for more tax cuts :
The blue line is supposed to be the Laffer curve , but this is far from compelling .
Since it looks like all that 's been done here is to draw a line through an outlier , Norway ( an outlier that in other contexts we are told to ignore because it is an outlier , e.g. see below ) , and since this is clearly not the best fitting line to these data , here 's another possibility :
I have n't actually run the regression , but it looks clear to me that revenues rise with tax rates , and the fit also looks better than in the first graph .
Toss out Norway , and the fit looks even better ( and to quote The Economist blog on this point , " Throwing out Norway ... " ) .
I know how much supply - siders want to find a Laffer curve , they 've become frustrated going this long without success .
But if they really think one exists they 'll need to keep looking because they have n't found it yet .

Did Banning Lead Lower Crime ?
The major news media ( see for instance here and here ) have been reporting recently on the hypothesis that banning lead from gasoline caused a reduction in crime .
This follows a similar article in the Washington Post a few months ago , which I blogged about at the time .
Since a lot of people have written to us lately asking for comment about the lead / crime connection , I ’m going to go ahead and reprint here what I wrote back in July :
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Over the weekend , the Washington Post published an article suggesting that much of the decline in crime in the 1990s may have been due to the reduction of childhood lead exposure after the removal of lead from gasoline and house paint .
This is an intriguing hypothesis .
There is evidence on an individual level that high exposure to lead is harmful to both IQ and the ability to delay gratification , two traits that could enhance the attractiveness of crime .
There is also some suggestive time - series evidence of a relationship : the rise and fall in lead exposure at the national level match the rise and fall in crime .
Still , although both Post reporter Shankar Vendantam and the cited economist , Rick Nevin ( whom I ’d never heard of ) , appear quite convinced by the time - series data , I am not .
When you have a variable like crime that goes up for a long time then goes down for a long time , it is easy to find other variables that share that pattern and appear to have a causal impact , even though the relationship is completely spurious .
About seven years ago , Michael Greenstone and I tried to look into this same issue using airborne lead measures at the local level , as well as other approaches .
We ultimately gave up without finding anything .
That largely soured me on the lead / crime link .
Recently , however , Jessica Wolpaw Reyes at Amherst has put together what appears to me to be the most persuasive evidence to date in favor of a relationship between lead and crime .
Rather than looking at a national time - series , she tries to exploit differences in the rates at which lead was removed from gasoline across states .
I have n’t read her paper with the care that a referee would at an academic journal ; but , at least superficially , what she is doing looks pretty sensible .
She finds that lead has big effects ( and , for what it ’s worth , she also confirms that , when controlling for lead , the link between abortion and crime is as strong or stronger as in our initial study , which did not control for lead . )
Roger Masters , a professor at Dartmouth , has also been doing interesting research on this subject , although I am also not very familiar with his work .
It will be very interesting to see how this research agenda plays out .
If it can be shown here and in other areas that environmental factors have powerful and long - lasting impacts on human behavior , it may dramatically change the way we think about public policy .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Young U.S. non-Orthodox
Jews are becoming increasingly lukewarm if not alienated in their support for Israel in a trend that is not likely to be reversed , according to a study released on Thursday .
Blending into U.S. society , including marriage to non-Jews and a tendency to look on Judaism more in religious terms than ethnic ones , is part of what ’s happening , the study found .
“ For our parent ’s generation , the question that mattered was , how do we regard Israel ?
For Generation Y ( born after 1976 ) the question is indeed , why should we regard Israel ? ” said Roger Bennett , a vice president of The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies , which sponsored the study .
“ Until people recognize that a healthy and animated dialogue about Israel is the first step to a meaningful connection , the ‘ Israel debate ’ that takes place in America is liable to become moot well before Israel celebrates its 100th birthday , ” he added .
U.S. support backed by a vocal and politically powerful Jewish lobby has been a key feature of the Jewish state ’s success since its founding in 1948 , an event that is widely backed by U.S. Jews and non-Jews .
But the study found that “ feelings of attachment may well be changing as warmth gives way to indifference , and indifference gives way even to downright alienation . ”
The study found only 48 percent of U.S. Jews under age 35 believe that Israel ’s destruction would be a personal tragedy for them , compared to 77 percent of those 65 and older .
In addition , only 54 percent of those under the age of 35 are “ comfortable with the idea of a Jewish State ” as opposed to 81 percent of those 65 and older .
It did find higher levels of support among U.S. Jews , regardless of age , who had visited Israel .
VARIOUS AFFILIATIONS
There are perhaps 6 million Jews in the United States , only about a third of them affiliated with a congregation .
Of those who do attend a synagogue , perhaps 40 percent are classified as liberal Reform , 32 percent middle - ground Conservative and 8 percent Orthodox , according to surveys .
The findings were based on a representative sample of 1,704 non-Orthodox Jews in 2006 and 2007 contacted in writing .
Its error margin was plus or minus three percentage points .
The authors said they excluded Orthodox Jews because they tend to be overwhelmingly supportive of Israel .
In general U.S. Jews “ have increasingly adopted the American idea of what it means to be Jewish -- primarily a religious identity , ” Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College , co-author of the study , said in an interview .
“ The decline in attachment is widespread .
It does n’t depend on how you measure it , ” Cohen added , with the disengagement no different among political liberals or conservatives .
Cohen also said inter-marriage with other faiths had a strong impact with “ younger Jews being much more likely to be married to non-Jews . ”
The trend is part of a long - term historic slide not likely to be reversed since “ people do not seem to significantly grow in their attachment to Israel as they age , ” the study said .
Steven Bayme , director of contemporary Jewish life for the American Jewish Committee , a major pro-Israel lobbying group , said “ assimilation is the biggest problem ” with declining support among U.S. Jews , but he said it is not new .
“ People growing up where there always has been an Israel ” are more detached , he said .
But the study breaks new ground , he added , in finding that politics do not underpin declining support -- that it is not as many assume a response to Israel ’s handling of the peace process or problems with religious pluralism in the country .
Bayme also said that even though Orthodox Jews were not included in the study , the segment represents “ strong signs of Jewish renewal ” -- children involved in the Hebrew faith in numbers far disproportionate to those of non-Orthodox families and who in the future will help counter the effects of assimilation outside their ranks , he said .
