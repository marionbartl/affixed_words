Over the last year – especially during the 2008 Presidential Elections – I ’ve gotten weary of analyzing , normalizing , and aggregating disparate opinion polls in order to derive some semblance of accurate numbers .
Fortunately none of us has to do that anymore on a regular basis .
Pollster.com , by The National Journal , actually aggregates the results of all the major polls and surveys and presents them in a combined view that includes composite results and individual poll results .
I ’ve decided to – in the wake of the recent flurry of articles about President Obama ’s historical low approval rating – to start with that .
Below is the aggregated national approval rating for President Obama .
It ’s an embedded flash application and so should reflect the most current polls and ratings at any given time .
President Obama ’s Overall Approval Rating
President Obama ’s Aggregated Overall Approval Rating
To provide a better break - down of the support for - and approval of President Obama I ’ve also included three ( 3 ) separate limited polls : one showing Democrat approval of President Obama , one showing Republican approval of President Obama , and one showing Independent approval of President Obama .
President Obama ’s Approval Rating Among Democrats
President Obama ’s Aggregated Approval Rating Among Democrats
President Obama ’s Approval Rating Among Republicans
President Obama ’s Aggregated Approval Rating Among Republicans
President Obama ’s Approval Rating Among Independents
President Obama ’s Aggregated Approval Rating Among Independents
I hope everyone finds these aggregated poll results of President Obama ’s approval rating useful .
I believe that they show a better picture of the real situation than any one poll would do .

The internet regulator has approved plans to allow non-Latin - script web addresses , in a move that is set to transform the online world .
The board of Icann voted at its annual meeting in Seoul to allow domain names in Arabic , Chinese and other scripts .
More than half of the 1.6 billion people who use the internet speak languages with non-Latin scripts .
It is being described as the biggest change to the way the internet works since it was created 40 years ago .
The first Internationalised Domain Names ( IDNs ) could be in use next year .
Plans for IDNs were first approved at a meeting in June 2008 , but testing of the system has been going on for two years .
Technical upheaval
The move paves the way for the internet 's Domain Name System ( DNS ) to be changed so it can recognise and translate non-Latin characters .
The DNS acts like a phonebook , turning easily understood domain names into strings of computer - readable numbers , known as Internet Protocol ( IP ) addresses .
This change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread
Rod Beckstrom
President of Icann
A truly world wide web at last Read your comments The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) said the " fantastically complicated technical feature " allowing IDNs would represent the " biggest change " to the coding that underlies the internet since it was invented four decades ago .
BBC technology correspondent Mark Gregory says in the early days of the internet , language posed no problem , as most web - surfers spoke English and those that did not usually wrote in languages based on the Latin alphabet .
But this is no longer true , adds our correspondent .
Icann said it would accept the first applications for IDNs by 16 November , with the first up and running by " mid-2010 " .
It is likely the majority of early non-Latin net addresses to be approved will be in Chinese and Arabic script , followed by Russian .
Some countries , such as China and Thailand , have already introduced workarounds that allow computer users to enter web addresses in their own language .
However , these were not internationally approved and do not work on all computers .
Autonomy
Our correspondent says the point of the Icann vote was to create a universal internet address code that will work in any language and every place so all the world 's computers can connect with each other .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There is a danger that the internet - a tool for culture , information - sharing and dialog on a non-national level , may become irreversibly fragmented Stefanos Likkas , Athens , Greece " Of the 1.6 billion internet users today worldwide , more than half use languages that have scripts that are not Latin - based , " said Icann president and CEO Rod Beckstrom earlier this week .
" So this change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread . "
Icann , set up by the US government , was founded in 1998 to oversee the development of the net .
Last month , after years of criticism , the US government eased its control over the non-profit body .
It signed a new agreement that gave Icann autonomy for the first time .
The agreement came into effect on 1 October and puts it under the scrutiny of the global " internet community " .

The following is the letter I wrote on Wednesday to Comcast 's customer service , in addition to the CEO and other important executives .
Comcast customer service & concerned executives , I have recently been considering switching my home Internet service
to Comcast from [ other provider ] .
At the present time I feel that [ other provider 's ] prices are outrageously high , and am positive Comcast would be able to provide service of equal or greater quality at a much cheaper price .
Given that we have television and landline phone service in our house it only makes sense to consider Comcast ’s " triple play " option of bundling services for an even greater discount .
However , it has come to my attention that you are now playing politics with your cable service .
Fox News channel , featured much lower than MSNBC on the channel number lineup , is continuing to be part of Comcast ’s " Digital Starter Package " while MSNBC has been relegated to the " Digital Classic Lineup , " meaning that customers will be required to pay an extra $ 17 / month ( $ 204 / year ) to have a balanced choice of news programs .
In light of these developments I am choosing not to switch to Comcast service for any of our needs .
If you should decide to offer MSNBC in the same basic cable package that Fox News is a part of , please contact me so that I can again consider switching to Comcast .
Until that time , I would rather pay higher prices knowing that I am not supporting such a blatantly biased programming decision .
Regards , [ anima ]
In filling out the appropriate form on their customer service page , I mentioned where it was that I lived ( which is not Jacksonville , FL ) .
However , the initial diarist had mentioned Jacksonville , and I 'm guessing Comcast got the what for from customers specifically about this choice regarding their Jacksonville market .
Last night I got the following message .
Thank you for the email .
First and foremost , I wanted to let you know
that today we restored access to MSNBC for all of our digital cable
customers in the Jacksonville , Florida area .
Please know that this week 's disruption was not at all targeted at MSNBC - it was due to some changes to our digital channel security system .
This system ensures customers receive the channels that are part of the
video package to which they subscribe .
This issue was isolated to the
Jacksonville area , and we have no reason to believe that Comcast
customers in any other areas experienced any interruptions of MSNBC .
Also , moving forward , we will be notifying customers that MSNBC will
become part of the Digital Starter service in the Jacksonville area .
Digital Starter is our most widely available level of digital service .
Customers who have our full basic video service can contact us to
receive Digital Starter , which is priced the same as our full basic
video service and includes one digital set - top box at no additional
cost .
Thank you again for bringing this issue to our attention .
Sincerely ,
[ name withheld ]
Looks like the complaints worked .
I just do n't buy their explanation of " changes to our digital channel security system . "
Exactly how would that relate to offering one channel at no extra cost while offering a competitive channel at an extra $ 200 ?
Anyway , I 'm glad it worked .
UPDATE : fixed title , and typo in intro , per comments below .
UPDATE 2 : Given that this worked , and given the myriad comments below about MSNBC being " ghettoized " in other Comcast areas and on dish networks , it seems only appropriate that these efforts be extended to other providers and other geographic areas .
I 'm planning on following up with Comcast about their offerings in other areas , and to let them know that my comment was not specific to Jacksonville - I was talking about what they provide in all markets .
UPDATE 3 : I 've been speaking with a higher - up in Comcast 's customer service dept .
via email , and that person claims the following :
As there area transitions to digital , all channels currently part of ' expanded basic ' ( channels 30 - 100 ) will be part of the Digital Starter package .
Today the 2 packages are the same price and the first full feature box is free .
So they can easily receive the channel now by obtaining a box .
This was said explicitly in regard to Atlanta and New Hampshire , two areas mentioned in comments below and areas I mentioned in emails because I have family members there .
Anybody from those areas know of the veracity of these comments ?
Is this person being truthful ?

The Kansas City Chiefs have cut RB Larry Johnson , one day after he sat out a loss to the Jaguars on a team - imposed suspension .
The move comes two weeks after Johnson belittled coach Todd Haley in a series of Twitter posts and used gay slurs with reporters in the team 's locker room .
A two - time Pro Bowler , Johnson was second on the team 's all - time rushing list with 6,090 yards .
A group of fans had petitioned the team last week not to allow Johnson to gain the 75 yards he needed break the team 's rushing record .
The Chiefs suspended Johnson for detrimental conduct two weeks ago , then worked out a settlement in which he'd miss only one game check .
Johnson drew criticism from gay - advocacy group GLAAD after his use of a gay slur .
He later apologized .
He has had a rocky relationship with the team , and requested the team part ways with him last season , before GM Scott Pioli and head coach Todd Haley came aboard .
The report into the possible effects of the toxic waste was kept secret A scientific report into the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast by oil trading company Trafigura has been released to the public .
The report concerns illnesses suffered by thousands of Abidjan locals .
It suggests their likely cause was the release of potentially lethal gas after chemicals were dumped .
The company insists the report was only a draft .
It says it was a list of possible outcomes rather than a study based on the specifics of the case .
Trafigura is a privately owned Dutch firm with offices in London , Amsterdam and Geneva .
It attempted to stop the British newspaper the Guardian publishing the scientific report with a five - week legal battle .
On Friday , it abandoned its injunction after some of the report 's contents were leaked on blogs and social networking sites .
Severe burns
The now - published report reveals that one month after waste from the ship Probo Koala was dumped at 15 sites around the Ivorian city of Abidjan , the company responsible was told about a series of dangerous potential side effects of the waste .
Among the side effects listed death as well as severe burns to the skin and lungs , vomiting and diarrhoea .
The report also makes clear that such dumping would be illegal in the European Union .
Scientific consultant John Minton was commissioned by Trafigura to produce the confidential study into the events of August 2006 in Abidjan , after thousands of people with burns , diarrhoea and breathing difficulties presented at local hospitals .
The subsequent report was kept secret , and was not made available to the 31,000 Abidjan residents who last month reached a settlement with Trafigura .
Trafigura , however , insists that the Minton report was only a draft , and was an analysis of possible outcomes of waste dumping , rather than a study of exactly what happened in Abidjan .
The report 's author has subsequently said that it did not reference specific underlying evidence .
Trafigura denies that anyone died as a result of the dumping and claims that people only suffered flu - like symptoms .
Lawyers for the company say it never sought to attack free speech .

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor 's nomination process was so controlled that the White House even approved her clothes , she told Yalies when she appeared at her 30th Yale Law School reunion on Saturday .
Sotomayor described her grueling nomination process privately when she spoke to 1,800 alumni , students and faculty , the New Haven Register reports .
State Sen . Ed Meyer attended the event and said Sotomayor became teary at times , but kept the crowd laughing .
The Yale Law School grad talked about shopping for clothes to wear to her acceptance ceremony , but government officials took over the fashion decisions .
They told her to bring five suits and then recommended which one she should wear , Meyer said .
The whole vetting process was intrusive , she said , according to the Yale Daily News .
The FBI even investigated a parking ticket she had received two years earlier .
New Haven is not only home to Sotomayor 's alma mater , it is also home to one of the most controversial issues to come up during the justice 's nomination process .
Sotomayor was on a three - judge appellate panel that took the city 's side in a now - famous reverse discrimination suit that several New Haven firefighters filed .
Sotomayor 's panel took the city 's side that too few minorities scored high and it would therefore be open to discrimination lawsuits .
The U.S. Supreme Court , however , reversed the appellate court 's ruling over the summer .
In addition to the Law School event , Sotomayor , the first Latina on the Supreme Court , also attended a luncheon , reception and the reunion dinner with about 50 guests .
She was escorted by the United States Supreme Court Police and requested that no members of the media attend the conversation with alumni , students and faculty , the Register reports .

Fortunately I have never lost my wallet .
I ’m guessing it would be a huge bummer .
I have freaked myself out a few times by somehow putting my wallet in the wrong back pocket .
It does n’t seem wrong until I sit down and my butt comes to the slow realization that things are amiss .
In everything from computer processor chips to car engines to electric powerplants , the need to get rid of excess heat creates a major source of inefficiency .
But new research points the way to a technology that might make it possible to harvest much of that wasted heat and turn it into usable electricity .
That kind of waste - energy harvesting might , for example , lead to cellphones with double the talk time , laptop computers that can operate twice as long before needing to be plugged in , or power plants that put out more electricity for a given amount of fuel , says Peter Hagelstein , co-author of a paper on the new concept appearing in November in the Journal of Applied Physics .
Hagelstein , an associate professor of electrical engineering at MIT , says existing solid - state devices to convert heat into electricity are not very efficient .
The new research , carried out with graduate student Dennis
Wu as part of his doctoral thesis , aimed to find how close realistic technology could come to achieving the theoretical limits for the efficiency of such conversion .
Theory says that such energy conversion can never exceed a specific value called the Carnot Limit , based on a 19th - century formula for determining the maximum efficiency that any device can achieve in converting heat into work .
But current commercial thermoelectric devices only achieve about one - tenth of that limit , Hagelstein says .
In experiments involving a different new technology , thermal diodes , Hagelstein worked with Yan Kucherov , now a consultant for the Naval Research Laboratory , and coworkers to demonstrate efficiency as high as 40 percent of the Carnot Limit .
Moreover , the calculations show that this new kind of system could ultimately reach as much as 90 percent of that ceiling .
Hagelstein ,
Wu and others started from scratch rather than trying to improve the performance of existing devices .
They carried out their analysis using a very simple system in which power was generated by a single quantum - dot device -- a type of semiconductor in which the electrons and holes , which carry the electrical charges in the device , are very tightly confined in all three dimensions .
By controlling all aspects of the device , they hoped to better understand how to design the ideal thermal - to - electric converter .
Hagelstein says that with present systems it 's possible to efficiently convert heat into electricity , but with very little power .
It 's also possible to get plenty of electrical power -- what is known as high - throughput power -- from a less efficient , and therefore larger and more expensive system .
" It 's a tradeoff .
You either get high efficiency or high throughput , " says Hagelstein .
But the team found that using their new system , it would be possible to get both at once , he says .
advertisement
A key to the improved throughput was reducing the separation between the hot surface and the conversion device .
A recent paper by MIT professor Gang Chen reported on an analysis showing that heat transfer could take place between very closely spaced surfaces at a rate that is orders of magnitude higher than predicted by theory .
The new report takes that finding a step further , showing how the heat can not only be transferred , but converted into electricity so that it can be harnessed .
A company called MTPV Corp. ( for Micron - gap Thermal Photo - Voltaics ) , founded by Robert DiMatteo SM ' 96 , MBA ' 06 , is already working on the development of " a new technology closely related to the work described in this paper , " Hagelstein says .
DiMatteo says he hopes eventually to commercialize Hagelstein 's new idea .
In the meantime , he says the technology now being developed by his company , which he expects to have on the market next year , could produce a tenfold improvement in throughput power over existing photovoltaic devices , while the further advance described in this new paper could make an additional tenfold or greater improvement possible .
The work described in this paper " is potentially a major finding , " he says .
DiMatteo says that worldwide , about 60 percent of all the energy produced by burning fuels or generated in powerplants is wasted , mostly as excess heat , and that this technology could " make it possible to reclaim a significant fraction of that wasted energy . "
When this work began around 2002 , Hagelstein says , such devices " clearly could not be built .
We started this as purely a theoretical exercise . "
But developments since then have brought it much closer to reality .
While it may take a few years for the necessary technology for building affordable quantum - dot devices to reach commercialization , Hagelstein says , " there 's no reason , in principle , you could n't get another order of magnitude or more " improvement in throughput power , as well as an improvement in efficiency .
" There 's a gold mine in waste heat , if you could convert it , " he says .
The first applications are likely to be in high - value systems such as computer chips , he says , but ultimately it could be useful in a wide variety of applications , including cars , planes and boats .
" A lot of heat is generated to go places , and a lot is lost .
If you could recover that , your transportation technology is going to work better . "
The population explosion in poor countries will contribute little to climate change and is a dangerous distraction from the main problem of over - consumption in rich nations , a study has found .
It challenges claims by leading environmentalists , including Sir David Attenborough and Jonathon Porritt , that strict birth control is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The study concludes that spending billions of pounds of aid on contraception in the developing world will not benefit the climate because poor countries have such low emissions .
It says that Britain and other Western countries should instead focus on reducing consumption of goods , services and energy among their own populations .
David Satterthwaite , of the International Institute for Environment and Development , a think - tank based in London , analysed changes in population and greenhouse gas emissions for all countries between 1980 and 2005 .
He found that sub-Saharan Africa had 18.5 per cent of the world ’s population growth and only 2.4 per cent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions .
The United States had 3.4 per cent of the world ’s population growth but 12.6 per cent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions .
China ’s one - child rule had resulted in a sharp decline in population growth but its CO2 emissions had risen very rapidly — 44.5 per cent of the growth in global emissions — largely because of the increasing number of Chinese enjoying Western levels of consumption .
Dr Satterthwaite , whose study is published in the peer - reviewed journal Environment and Urbanization , said : “ A child born into a very poor African household who during their life never escapes from poverty contributes very little to climate change , especially if they die young , as many do .
A child born into a wealthy household in North America or Europe and who enjoys a full life and a high - consumption lifestyle contributes far more — thousands or even tens of thousands of times more .
” The world ’s population has risen from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6.8 billion .
It is growing by 75 million a year and is almost certain to exceed 9 billion by 2050 .
Nine of the ten countries with the highest predicted growth rates up to 2050 are in Africa .
Uganda ’s population is expected to treble from 33 million to 91 million .
The populations of developed countries , including Japan and Russia , are expected to decline over the same period .
A separate study by the Princeton Environmental Institute found that the world ’s richest half billion people accounted for 7 per cent of the world ’s population but 50 per cent of emissions .
The difference in emissions levels between a rich Westerner and a poor African was illustrated in a study this month by the New Economics Foundation .
It found that by 7 pm on January 4 , a typical person in Britain would have generated the same amount of carbon emissions that someone in Tanzania would be responsible for in the whole year .
A US citizen would reach the same point by 4 am on January 2 . Last month the Optimum Population Trust called for population restraint policies to be adopted by every world state to combat climate change .
The call was endorsed by Sir David Attenborough , James Lovelock and Jonathon Porritt .

Advertisement Dozens of people are reported to have been arrested across Iran after violent confrontations between security forces and anti-government demonstrators .
In the capital Tehran , police and militiamen used batons and teargas , and witnesses said there had been gunfire .
The protests , led by Iranian students , were over the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and suppression of academic freedom .
It appears to be the most widespread unrest in Iran for months .
Foreign journalists were banned from reporting on the rallies , and the Iranian authorities closed down mobile phone networks and severely restricted internet access .
After the election the chants were only about people getting their votes back , but now it is more about the system and leaders themselves
Opposition chants invert old slogans
In pictures : Iran protests Amateur video captures protests
The BBC's Jon Leyne says the main objective of the opposition was to keep their movement alive .
He adds that the government and Mr Ahmadinejad must feel deeply frustrated , as they still have not silenced the protests , six months after claiming victory in the presidential election .
The disputed election led to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , with thousands arrested and dozens killed .
The government then banned protests , so its opponents began using officially sanctioned demonstrations to turn out in big numbers and publicise their message .
Supreme leader berated Monday 's violence came during Iran 's annual commemoration of the killings of three students during anti-American protests in 1953 .

At one university , students tore down a poster of Mr Ahmadinejad and trampled on it .
Elsewhere , in a highly unusual move , they chanted against the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Police and members of the government 's Basji militia tried to contain the protest within the universities .
At the gates of Tehran university and several other universities , there were angry clashes .
As in previous protests , opposition supporters , some wearing green scarves and masks , chanted " Death to the Dictator " .
Green is the colour adopted by the reformist movement in recent months .
Iran 's Irna state news agency said : " Some rioters who aimed at exploiting the special ceremonies to mark Student Day gathered in the streets surrounding Tehran University and clashed with law enforcement forces . "
As protests were reported , Iranian state TV was broadcasting a round - table discussion about how loyal students are to the system .
OFFICIAL EVENTS USED FOR OPPOSITION PROTESTS President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sworn in , 5 August Quds ( Jerusalem ) Day , 18 September US embassy seizure anniversary , 4 November Students Day , 7 December Dozens of people have been given jail terms and as many as five people have been sentenced to death following the post-election demonstrations .
At the weekend , more than 20 people were arrested at a regular protest by a group of women that includes mothers whose sons and daughters were killed in post-election violence .
Some of the women were later released .
On Sunday , former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , who emerged as a leader for reformist opponents to the regime , said the protest movement was still alive .
In a statement posted on his website , he warned that authorities were " fighting with shadows in the streets " .

Players have to hit pop-up bankers with a mallet
An arcade game that allows people to vent their anger at bankers has proved so popular the owner keeps having to replace worn out mallets .
Inventor Tim Hunkin introduced " Whack a Banker " , which is based on the older " Whack a Mole " game , at his arcade on Southwold pier in Suffolk .
Instead of players hitting pop-up moles with a mallet , within a set time , the target is pop -up bald figures .
Mr Hunkin said the game was " proving very popular " .
" I keep having to replace worn - out mallets , " he said .
" The bankers are bald and all look the same because that 's how I think people see bankers , as faceless . "
Players , who are promised a " truly rewarding banking experience " , pay 40 p to hit as many bankers as they can in 30 seconds .
When a customer wins a voice says : " You win .
We retire .
Thank you very much to the taxpayer for paying our pensions . "
Review by TV Columnist Kevin McDonough
“ OK , I groaned a little when I got the press material for “ JFK : 3 Shots That Changed America “ .
I thought I had seen every scrap of footage related to the Kennedy assassination far too many times already .
Boy was I wrong .
“ JFK ” presents a remarkable parade of clips of home movies , raw news footage , police dispatches and local Dallas coverage — much of it never before aired .
And it does so in chronological order and entirely without narration .
The lack of voiceover gives the stream of footage incredible power .
Nobody ’s telling you what happened or how you ’re supposed to interpret it , and this frees the viewer to re-experience a moment of local chaos , national trauma and a time when the fledgling medium of TV news was just figuring itself out .
While presented in a minute - by - minute fashion , the clips arrive weird , raw and jumbled .
The documentary often seems like a video version of an archaeological dig , with the editors trying to make sense of so many broken shards of pottery .
We also learn from a number of clips that , contrary to TV legend , Walter Cronkite did not break the news of the president ’s death , but that it dribbled out from various sources , with the tentative nature of a horrible rumor nobody wanted to believe .
Again , take this from a jaded Kennedy buff , confirmed history nut and professional media junkie : “ JFK ” is hypnotic , powerful , spellbinding stuff . ”
Just hours before his death , John F. Kennedy appeared before a crowd in Fort Worth , Texas in what would be his final speech , delivering one last homage to American freedom .
This poignant moment is part of a vast historical record of sights and sounds captured on camera during those catastrophic days .
The Zapruder film is only the beginning ; much more archival material of the events surrounding the assassination exists .
This two - part special uses unique , rarely seen and heard footage to document the Kennedy assassination and the nearly 50 years of speculation and controversy that changed America .
This material comes from a range of sources including eyewitness home movies , Dallas police dispatch radio recordings , and raw news footage .
Part 1 is a shocking , unflinching look at the assassination of the President and the days that followed .
The second part of the special documenting the JFK assassination examines the aftermath , and the enduring controversies that emerged as succeeding generations of Americans struggled to comprehend the sudden murder of an unforgettable leader .
There are some clips available on youtube to view scenes from Part One .
This just in : the American Humanist Association is launching a new " national " ad campaign similar to its controversial ads in Washington , D.C. , last year , where the group is based .
The ads will appear in transit systems in five cities : Washington , New York , Chicago , Los Angeles and San Francisco .
Featuring pictures of smiling people wearing Santa hats , the ads seems to be again intended to stir up publicity with their provocative message : " No God ? ... No Problem ! "
Just in time for Christmas shopping season :
The first ads will appear in Washington by this weekend , in 200 buses , 50 train cars and on the sides or backs of 20 buses .
Starting in December , they 'll also appear on buses in the other four cities .
" We 're hoping this campaign will build awareness about the humanist movement and our ethical life philosophy -- particularly among the ' nones ' : the rapidly growing percentage of people who claim no religion , " said Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the American Humanist Association , in the news release .
" Humanists have always understood that striving to make the world a better place is one of humanity 's most important responsibilities , " Speckhardt said .
" Religion does not have a monopoly on morality -- millions of people are good without believing in God . "
Speckhardt adds that many people " feel uncomfortable talking openly about their personal beliefs because of prejudice against them -- they fear they 'll be rejected by their family , their friends and their community , and in some cases , they even fear retaliation for their beliefs .
But the American Humanist Association provides an accepting community for non-theists to turn to for support and ways to get involved . "
Negative reactions to past ads have included Cincinnati billboard that had to be relocated after the owner of the billboard property said he received threats , and another in Moscow , Idaho , that was vandalized twice in a three - week period , the group says .
What do you think of the American Humanist Association 's attempts to , er , evangelize its non-theistic message in a Christmas - time advertising blitz ?

One Year Anniversary of $ 700 Billion Bailout
On anniversary , critics see failure .
Others say history will show it worked .
Oct. 3 , 2009 --
On the evening of Thursday , Sept. 18 , 2008 , in the midst of the financial meltdown , Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , along with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox , traveled to Capitol Hill to meet with Congressional leaders in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's conference room .
The goal was to get Congress to grant the government the authority to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to save the financial system from collapse .
Bernanke explained to lawmakers what type of situation they would be facing if they did not act .
" You could see a 20 percent decline in the stock market , unemployment at nine to 10 percent , the failure of GM , certainly , and other large corporate failures , " Bernanke told lawmakers , according to James Stewart in the Sept. 21 , 2009 issue of " The New Yorker . "
" It would be very bad . "
Congress acted .
On Oct. 3 , the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was enacted .
But since Bernanke 's comments on that Thursday evening last September , have developments supported his argument that the government needed to act ?
As of Sept. 18 this year , the stock market had declined 13 percent , the unemployment rate had risen to 9.7 percent , GM and Chrysler both filed for bankruptcy , and large companies such as AIG and Merrill Lynch had been taken over or propped up by government funds .
Supporters say the program pulled the financial system back from the brink of disaster .
The stock market has rebounded , banks are making profits again .
Disaster , they say , has been averted .
Detractors counter by arguing that the program only rewarded Wall Street , the same people blamed for causing the mess in the first place .
It has not , they say , helped Main Street , as unemployment has risen to a 26 - year high and foreclosures have continued to climb .
Meanwhile , the bailout morphed into a much bigger program , with money for insurance companies and automakers .
According to watchdog Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the program , it is " highly unlikely " that taxpayers will ever get paid back their full investment .
Failure ! ...
No , Success !
On its one - year anniversary , it is still very much up for debate if the controversial program has succeeded or failed .
" This has been a failed program , " said Sen . Mike Johanns , R - Neb. , at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Sept. 24 .
However , the Obama administration -- as well as some members of Congress -- argue otherwise .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has argued that , along with other emergency government efforts , the TARP brought the financial system back from the brink of collapse .
Asked at an Oct. 1 event at the Newseum in Washington just how close the financial system came to going under last fall , Geithner replied , " It came very close . "
" You can't prove what would have happened in the absence of the overwhelming force that we brought to stabilize the system , but I would say a broad range of institutions , strong and weak , and a broad range of people , close and distant , really thought we were at the edge of the abyss , " Geithner said .
" And I share that judgment . "
" I think we did the right thing , " Senate Banking Chairman Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , said at the Sept. 24 hearing , " and I think history will prove that to be the case . "
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel in January contributed $ 2,000 from his House PAC account to Rep. Parker Griffith ( Ala. ) , who is leaving the Democratic Party to become a Republican .
Before he started working in the Obama administration , Emanuel on Jan. 2 transferred the funds from his " Our Common Values " political action committee to the Alabama lawmaker , according to CQ Money Line .

A White House aide said it is unclear at this point if Emanuel will ask Griffith to return the money .
Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( Md. ) , who heads the House Democrats ' campaign arm , called on Tuesday for Griffith to return money he has received from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) .
Five years ago , the DCCC asked Rep. Rodney Alexander ( La. ) to refund money after he switched parties to become a Republican .
Alexander subsequently complied with the request under the threat of a lawsuit .
President Obama speaks proudly of his childhood in Hawaii , so we wonder what the state 's voters think of his support for a bill that would redistribute its wealth based on race .
That 's what would happen under the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act , which Congress is trying to sneak through in its final days this year .
Sponsored by Senator Daniel Akaka , the bill would transfer a percentage of public - owned lands to a native Hawaiian government within the state of Hawaii .
The legislation would collect some 400,000 ...
When historians update the history of the United States , ponder when we lost our way and punted the mantle of global supremacy to China , they 'll conclude this past decade was the turning point .
From 2000 to 2009 , voters made a series of terrible political choices .
As a result , for many Americans the US ceased being a land of opportunity and the light of freedom dimmed .
2000 - America chooses mediocrity : The decade opened with a divisive election where George W. Bush - an unsuccessful business executive - defeated Al Gore - a wooden but seasoned political servant - in an election decided by the Electoral College and the US Supreme Court .
2001 - America is traumatized : Bush ran on a platform of lower taxes and less government ; he was n't interested in or adept at governing .
As a result , Bush failed to pay attention to early warnings and , on September 11th , terrorists attacked .
The US went to war and the Bush Administration claimed near dictatorial power .
2002 - America gets angry :
When our forces failed to apprehend those responsible for the attacks , the White House launched a propaganda campaign to convince Americans that Iraq 's Saddam Hussein was the guilty party .
Voters bought into this deception and , in the mid-term elections , supported Republicans as the war Party , resulting in GOP control of Congress .
2003 - America gets even : The Bush Administration spin machine persuaded Americans that Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks and constituted an imminent threat .
On March 20th , US forces invaded Iraq and , on May 1st , President Bush declared , " mission accomplished . "
2004 - America gets bamboozled :
White House propaganda convinced a slim majority of Americans the US was winning the Iraq war and George Bush was a competent President .
Bush defeated John Kerry in the Presidential election .
2005 - America wakes up :
As it became apparent the US occupation of Iraq had fomented a civil war , Bush 's approval ratings fell below 50 percent and continued to deteriorate for the rest of his term .
In August , the Bush 's handling of Hurricane Katrina branded him a failed President .
2006 - Democrats rebound : As Bush 's approval ratings sank , so did those of the Republican - dominated Congress .
In the mid-term elections , Democrats retook control of Congress .
This ended the destructive Bush legislative agenda , but could not undo the harm cause by Administration appointments and edicts .
2007 - The economy tanks : Throughout the first years of the decade , America had a negative savings rate as families borrowed against their home equity to maintain their lifestyle .
Faith that housing prices would increase indefinitely led to gross Wall Street speculation .
In 2007 the housing bubble burst , resulting in the collapse of the financial system .
2008 - America chooses hope :
As the year progressed there were increasing signs of financial panic .
Meanwhile , the country was enthralled by the Presidential contest , eventually won by Barack Obama , an African - American .
2009 - America is depressed : Before Obama was inaugurated , it was clear the US was in the grips of a severe recession .
As unemployment rose and business activity declined , the mood of the US soured .
Divisive Republican political tactics impeded Obama 's legislative agenda , particularly healthcare reform .
2000 - 2009 was defined by dreadful political decisions and missed opportunities .
America stagnated because of poor leadership and negative public sentiment .
In 2000 , responding to the Republican claim that " government is the problem , " Americans elected an incompetent President .
After 9/11 , the Bush Administration made a series of horrendous decisions that mired the US in Afghanistan and Iraq and ensured that billions continued to be spent on defense .
Meanwhile , as the Federal government and the deficit grew , America 's domestic difficulties were ignored .
Middle - class families saw their quality of life deteriorate , along with their savings and home - equity .
When Americans chose Bush , they bought into his self - centered conservative ideology : " what 's in it for me ? "
Greed became a virtue .
Citizens looked away while the rich and powerful looted America .
This " damn the common good " sentiment reached its nadir with Wall Street 's promotion of the housing bubble .
After 9/11 America was at war , however President Bush did not call for common sacrifice .
Instead of asking Americans to pay higher taxes , Bush suggested they " go shopping . "
His conservative ideology promoted the notion that government is a " free lunch , " that citizens should n't have to pay for essential services .
In the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary , the Republican Party preached that government is the problem .
Rather than blame the current financial crisis on greedy bankers and ravenous Wall Street CEOs , the GOP blamed Federal regulators .
Conservatives dogmatically argued that , left alone , the market will fix whatever ails America .
Steeled in this nonsensical ideology , Republicans became the Party of No , choosing to be part of the problem rather than contribute to the solution .
Using the Senate cloture rule , Republicans blocked meaningful legislation affecting healthcare , energy , global climate change , jobs , and Wall Street reform .
George Santayana famously wrote , " Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
At the end of a tragically lost decade , many Americans have n't learned anything and seemed poised to repeat the same mistakes .
WASHINGTON  Top executives at Blackwater Worldwide authorized secret payments of about $ 1 million to Iraqi officials that were intended to silence their criticism and buy their support after a September 2007 episode in which Blackwater security guards fatally shot 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad , according to former company officials .
Blackwater approved the cash payments in December 2007 , the officials said , as protests over the deadly shootings in Nisour Square stoked long - simmering anger inside Iraq about reckless practices by the security company ’s employees .
American and Iraqi investigators had already concluded that the shootings were unjustified , top Iraqi officials were calling for Blackwater ’s ouster from the country , and company officials feared that Blackwater might be refused an operating license it would need to retain its contracts with the State Department and private clients , worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
Four former executives said in interviews that Gary Jackson , who was then Blackwater ’s president , had approved the bribes and that the money was sent from Amman , Jordan , where the company maintains an operations hub , to a top manager in Iraq .
The executives , though , said they did not know whether the cash was delivered to Iraqi officials or the identities of the potential recipients .
Blackwater ’s strategy of buying off the government officials , which would have been illegal under American law , created a deep rift inside the company , according to the former executives .
They said that Cofer Black , who was then the company ’s vice chairman and a former top C.I.A. and State Department official , learned of the plan from another Blackwater manager while he was in Baghdad discussing compensation for families of the shooting victims with United States Embassy officials .
The Queen ’s football season has lasted as long as it possibly could have .
The Gaels left on Tuesday for Quebec City .
On Saturday they ’ll play the University of Calgary Dinos in the Vanier Cup at PEPS Stadium — the home field of the Laval Rouge - et - Or .
The Gaels ’ 33 -30 Mitchell Bowl victory last weekend at Richardson Stadium robbed the heavily - favoured Rouge - et - Or from playing in the 2009 Vanier Cup .
Fifth - year wide receiver Scott Valberg said the Gaels wo n’t settle for the honour of competing .
“ We ca n’t rest on the fact that we just won a Bowl game , ” he said .
“ We want the whole thing . ”
The Gaels play away from home tomorrow for the first time in three games and the first time in the 2009 playoffs .
Valberg said the excitement surrounding the Vanier Cup wo n’t affect his team ’s concentration .
“ The maturity level of our team is going to show this week , ” he said .
“ There ’s a lot of guys that know how important it is to stay focused on why we ’re there .
I do n’t think many of the guys are going to get carried away with the media and the other distractions . ”
Tomorrow will be head coach Pat Sheahan ’s third Vanier Cup competition as a coach .
He ’s been to the show twice before , once as the offensive coordinator of the McGill Redmen in 1987 and again in 1998 at the helm of the Concordia Stingers .
He said the coaching staff ’s main objective this week was to minimize the distractions .
“ It ’s very much a management challenge , ” he said .
“ Organization is the key .
We ’ve got to get there and have three really good days concentrated days of practice .
It ’ll be nothing but football and watching film . ”
Saturday ’s game will be the second time in history and the first in more than 20 years that the Gaels and the Dinos have met .
The last time was in the 1983 Vanier Cup in Toronto , when the Dinos won 31 - 21 .
“ It ’s the national championship game , so you know you ’ll be playing against a quality opponent , ” Sheahan said .
“ There ’s no question that getting there is 90 per cent of the battle .
Now it ’s just a football game .
I do n’t want to say ‘ just ’ in the sense that it wo n’t be a challenge .
It will . ”
The Dinos beat the Saint Mary ’s Univeristy Huskies 38 - 14 last weekend in the Uteck Bowl .
Veteran quarterback Erik Glavic transferred to Calgary from St. Mary ’s at the beginning of winter term last year .
Glavic won the Hec Creighton Award for most outstanding player in the CIS after his 2007 season that saw the Huskies lose to the University of Manitoba in the Vanier Cup .
He ’s the the Canada West nominee for the award this year .
Glavic passed for 2,185 yards this season with the Dinos , about 400 yards shy of Gaels quarterback Danny Brannagan .
The Dinos ’ rushing offence is ranked first nationally , averaging 283.4 yards per game .
Defensive lineman Osie Ukwuoma said he ’s confident the Gaels defence will answer the challenge .
“ They have weapons all over the field , ” he said .
“ They pose some challenges .
But they ’re definitely beatable . ”
If you ca n’t make it to Quebec City tomorrow , catch the Vanier Cup on TSN or CFRC .
Kickoff is at noon .
CHARIKAR , Afghanistan 
As Americans , including President Obama ’s top advisers , tensely debate whether to send more American troops to Afghanistan , Afghans themselves are having a similar discussion and voicing serious doubts .
In bazaars and university corridors across the country , eight years of war have left people exhausted and impatient .
They are increasingly skeptical that the Taliban can be defeated .
Nearly everyone agrees that the Afghan government must negotiate with the insurgents .
If more American forces do arrive , many here say , they should come to train Afghans to take over the fight , so the foreigners can leave .
“ What have the Americans done in eight years ? ” asked Abdullah Wasay , 60 , a pharmacist in Charikar , a market town about 25 miles north of Kabul , expressing a view typical of many here .
“ Americans are saying that with their planes they can see an egg 18 kilometers away , so why ca n’t they see the Taliban ? ”
Such sentiments were repeated in conversation after conversation with more than 30 Afghans in Kabul and nearby rural areas and with local officials in outlying provinces .
The comments point to the difficulties that American and Afghan officials face if they choose to add more foreign troops .
What ’s a good way to keep from getting lonely in this high holy season of togetherness ?
Stay away from lonely people .
It ’s brutal but true , and it ’s the cutting - edge finding of researchers whose mission it is to discover the causes of loneliness so that we can combat it with full force .
Think this is just a scholarly version of a “ Dr. Phil ” episode ?
Think again .
The lead researcher on this project -- with UC San Diego ’s James H. Fowler and Harvard ’s Nicholas A. Christakis -- is University of Chicago neuroscientist John T. Cacioppo , who last year co-wrote a groundbreaking book arguing that far from being a personal issue , mass loneliness threatens our public health .
This new study , published in the latest issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , seeks to map the geography of loneliness .
Who feels it ?
And what is the connection of these Eleanor Rigbys to the rest of us ?
Advertisement
What the authors find is that , like a virus , loneliness is contagious .
People become lonely because of who they know as much as who they do n’t know .
It makes sense , really .
When people are lonely , they tend to be less trusting and even irritable toward others .
This type of behavior can easily make those on the receiving end feel a sense of isolation and loneliness themselves .
In other words , lonely people pass on their loneliness .
Before alienated people check into a cave , they alienate others , thereby continuing the chain .
As the researchers put it , this means that loneliness is “ both a cause and consequence of becoming disconnected . ”
Just as bad news travels faster than good news , the authors find that the spread of loneliness is “ more powerful than the spread of non-loneliness . ”
In fact , loneliness is so pernicious , it stands to reason that people would go to great lengths to curb its spread .
In his book , “ Loneliness : Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection , ” Cacioppo argued that loneliness , like fear , is a useful emotion .
Ideally , it ought to cause people to seek comfort and safety in other humans , ultimately solidifying necessary social bonds rather than destroying them .
In this study , however , the authors suggest that in some cases , like rhesus monkeys that drive off or eliminate once - isolated monkeys that have been reintroduced to the colony , humans may also shun isolated members of their own species .
They speculate that this collective rejection may serve to protect “ the structural integrity of social networks ” necessary to society .
Why is the contagion of loneliness and the shunning response important news ?
For starters , because we know Americans are already lonelier than they have ever been .
Studies show that we move in smaller social circles and have fewer confidants than we used to .
Add to this the probability of loneliness contagion and you get a snowball effect .
And there ’s more .
Because the rest of us shun the lonely , we ’ve got a prescription for deep divides and levels of isolation that could threaten the cohesion required for any society to function .
Advertisement
The spread of individual loneliness has mass social consequences , and among them are insidious effects on democratic values .
We ’re all aware that associations and affiliations -- which socialize us into democratic life -- are at the heart of democracy .
The more lonely , divided and isolated we become , the less we participate and associate .
The fewer people who participate actively in democracy , the more everyone is at the mercy of the loudmouthed extremists and demagogues who do engage .
We should think of loneliness , then , not just as a sad condition haunting some of us but as a seed of political disunity .
Not only does growing social isolation undermine the social contract , it leaves the public grasping for new ways to connect .
Indeed , as society becomes more atomized , the electorate might very well become more susceptible to calls for dangerous forms of solidarity -- be they national , religious , ethnic or partisan .
Research already suggests that social isolation leaves individuals more willing to embrace the abstract certainties of rigid ideologies .
To counteract the threat inherent in the spread of loneliness , Cacioppo and his colleagues advocate for more targeted social interventions .
They do n’t spell out what they mean , but I expect their next publications to outline just exactly how they ’d go about repairing all those fraying social networks .
For the time being , maybe it ’s enough to know that turning your back on all the lonely people may prevent you from catching the isolation bug , but it wo n’t protect you -- along with the rest of society -- in the long run .
So do the right thing this Christmas : Rise above your instinct and do n’t shun them at all .

The Anatomy of a Modern GPL Violation
I 've been thinking the last few weeks about the evolution of the GPL violation .
After ten years of being involved with GPL enforcement , it seems like a good time to think about how things have changed .
Roughly , the typical GPL violation tracks almost directly the adoption and spread of Free Software .
When I started finding GPL violations , it was in a day when Big Iron Unix was still king ( although it was only a few years away from collapse ) , and the GNU tools were just becoming state of the art .
Indeed , as a sysadmin , I typically took a proprietary Unix system , and built a /usr / local / filled with the GNU tools , because I hated POSIX tools that did n't have all the GNU extensions .
At the time , many vendors were discovering the same frustrations I was as a sysadmin .
Thus , the typical violation in those days was a third - party vendor incorporating some GNU tools into their products , for use on some Big Iron Unix .
This was the age of the violating backup product ; we saw frequently backup products that violated the GPL on GNU tar in those days .
As times changed , and computers got truly smaller , the embedded Unix - like system was born .
GNU / Linux and ( more commonly ) BusyBox / Linux were the perfect solutions for this space .
What was once a joke on comp.os.linux.advocacy in the 1990s began to turn into a reality : it was actually nearly possible for Linux to run on your toaster .
The first class of embedded devices that were BusyBox / Linux - based were the wireless routers .
Throughout the 2000s , the typical violation was always some wireless router .
I still occasionally see those types of products violating the GPL , but I think the near - constant enforcement done by Erik Andersen , FSF , and Harald Welte throughout the 2000's has led the wireless router violation to become the exception rather than the rule .
That enforcement also led to the birth of community - focused development of the OpenWRT and DD - WRT , that all started from that first enforcement that we ( Erik , Harald and FSF ( where I was at the time ) ) all did together in 2002 to ensure the WRT54G source release .
In 2009 , there 's a general purpose computer in almost every electronics product .
Putting a computer with 8MB RAM and a reasonable processor in a device is now a common default .
Well , BusyBox / Linux was always the perfect operating system for that type of computer !
So , when you walk through the aisles of the big electronics vendors today , it 's pretty likely that many of the devices you see are BusyBox / Linux ones .
Some people think that a company can just get away with ignoring the GPL and the requirements of copyleft .
Perhaps if a company has five customers total , and none of them ask for source , your violation may never be discovered .
But , if you produce a mass market product based on BusyBox / Linux , some smart software developer is going to eventually buy one .
They are going to get curious , and when they poke , they 'll see what you put in there .
And , that developer 's next email is going to be to me to tell me all about that device .
In my ten years of enforcement experience , I find that a company 's odds of “ getting away ” with a GPL violation are incredibly low .
The user community eventually notices and either publicly shames the company ( not my preferred enforcement method ) , or they contact someone like me to pursue enforcement privately and encourage the company in a friendly way to join the FLOSS community rather than work against it .
I absolutely love that so many companies have adopted BusyBox / Linux as their default platform for many new products .
Since circa 1994 when I first saw the “ can my toaster run Linux ? ” joke , I 've dreamed of time when it would be impossible to buy a mass - market electronics product without finding FLOSS inside .
I 'm delighted we 've nearly reached that era during my lifetime .
However , such innovation is made possible by the commons created by the GPL .
I have dedicated a large portion of my adult life to GPL enforcement precisely because I believe deeply in the value of that commons .
As I find violator after violator , I look forward to welcoming them to our community in a friendly way , and ask them to respect the commons that gave them so much , and give their code back to the community that got them started .

( This post started out life as a comment to Robert Brook ’s Not Everything Is a Game post . )
I remember when I stopped beating my wife .
I used to beat her regularly without ever wondering why .
Without really considering how it made her feel , the effect on our relationship or the effect it had on me .
Beating her was just something I did .
I did n’t take any particular joy in it .
I was n’t experiencing huge emotional relief after she was beaten – I did n’t feel smug , self - satisfied or powerful .
Deep down I knew that beating someone when it ’s not a fair fight is no kind of victory .
I can come up with various excuses as to why it happened .
People used to beat me – they did fairly regularly .
That ’s no excuse – but I found myself beaten so many times that I just became numb .
The pain and humiliation that a child feels when defeated is almost too much to bear .
So I removed it .
Next time I was beaten I simply sighed and moved on .
I can remember the first time I beat someone .
After a disastrous inter-school Chess competition – yes , I was that kid – I tried out for the Scrabble team .
I beat everyone .
Every single one of them .
I know I felt a flush of pride .
A sense of worth and of power .
This is what winning feels like .
It felt good .
Great in fact .
I did n’t like it .
I saw in the face of my opponent the crushed spirit that I had known for too long .
I realised that the price of victory is failure .
I could n’t stand the heavy responsibility of causing that much pain and anguish in another …
But I carried on anyway .
I learned to quash the shame of victory just as I had quashed the shame of defeat .
Success was marginally preferable to failure , so I competed only when there was a fairly decent chance of winning .
I used to beat my wife at computer games , board games , and quizzes .
I thought that ’s what I was expected to do .
Play my hardest .
Play for victory .
Crush my opponent .
Damn the consequences .
But winning never felt good .
It never made me happy .
Any short lived joy came at the expense of my partner ’s unhappiness .
Command And Conquer changed all that .
For the first time , we could play collaboratively .
We would team up to defeat an opponent – working together against an emotionless enemy .
An aggressor who did n’t mind when we beat him mercilessly .
From then on , the majority of games we ’ve played have been collaborative .
The Lego Star Wars , Batman & Indiana Jones games are perfect examples .
Not only can you play together – it ’s actively encouraged .
Victory only comes through teamwork .
Not one leader instructing a team – but players working collectively .
Where games are single player – we ’ve found ways to work together .
On Zelda , I take charge of the fine co-ordinated jumping puzzles and my wife does the rest .
We sit together and solve the logic puzzles , plan where to go next , strategise our next move .
Do we sometimes argue ?
Do we fight over who messed up ?
Do we moan about who snatched defeat from the jaws of victory ?
Of course we do !
But we ’re not fighting each other – we ’re fighting for each other .
My only regret is that there are n’t more collaborative games .
Lego , Boom Bloxx , Rock Band – what else ?
Too many games pit you against your friends .
Why would I want to beat my friends ?
I like my friends – I do n’t want to defeat them .
I love my wife and do n’t want to beat her .
Playing together is much more fun than playing against one another .
Interventions have taken place in nine poorly performing authorities Children 's services in nine local authority areas , including Haringey where Baby Peter was killed , have been rated as " poor " in a report by Ofsted .
The inspectorate 's annual ratings of 152 English authorities show 10 provide " excellent " services and 93 " good " .
The other 40 authorities are deemed to be adequate on services including child protection , childcare , schools , social care , learning and skills .
Ministers said interventions had taken place at authorities rated as poor .
The number of underperforming children 's services has increased from the eight identified last year .
' Raised expectations '
As well as Haringey , in north London , the others rated as poor are Birmingham , Cornwall , Doncaster , Essex , Leeds , Rotherham , Warrington and Wokingham .
Blackburn with Darwen , Camden , City of London , Kensington and Chelsea , Kingston - upon - Thames , Lewisham , Richmond - upon - Thames , Tower Hamlets , Wandsworth and York are all rated as excellent .
Chief inspector Christine Gilbert said Ofsted had increased its expectations for what local authorities should deliver .
" We are considering a wider range of services and outcomes for children and young people , and in that sense we are being more demanding , " she said .
It is right that the bar has been raised , and we will continue to take action until all children 's services are being delivered to an acceptable level
Children 's Minister Dawn Primarolo
" We are also using more first - hand inspection evidence , gathered by a range of highly knowledgeable and experienced inspectors looking at services and settings , from schools and childcare , to services for vulnerable children , and those for young people in colleges and sixth forms . "
Ofsted also makes the point that services can vary within the overall ratings , so " excellent " does not mean universally so - nor does performing poorly .
Children 's Minister Dawn Primarolo said the report showed the picture was generally positive but there was no room for complacency .
" It is right that the bar has been raised , and we will continue to take action until all children 's services are being delivered to an acceptable level , " she said .

More from Today programme " That 's why we have already intervened in every one of the nine local authorities identified as performing poorly . "
Ofsted 's findings are published a day after an independent report said doctors at a clinic that failed to spot Baby Peter Connelly had a broken back , two days before he died in 2007 , had been under an " excessive workload " .
Peter was known to social services in Haringey .
Birmingham City Council said it was disappointed that Ofsted had not shifted from the " inadequate " judgement initially delivered last year on its ability to safeguard children .
' Simplistic approach ' Birmingham 's cabinet member for children , young people and families , Cllr Les Lawrence , said : " We believe this is unfair .
" We have not had a full inspection in 2009 and this fails to take account of the tremendous strides we have made in the last year .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It seems to be more a product of Ofsted 's new way of assessing services than a balanced reflection of the successes and challenges we face in Birmingham . "
The president of the Association of Directors of Children 's Services , Kim Bromley - Derry , said inspection and regulation provided an opportunity for the public to scrutinise the services that they received and hold people to account .
But his members had experienced duplicated fieldwork and a lack of communication between inspectorates .
" The approach to grading children 's services has been simplistic , " he said .

CITY NATIONAL BANCSHARES CORPORATION
Certificate of Designation Establishing the Series and Fixing the Powers , Designations , Preferences and Relative , Participating , Optional and Other Special Rights , and the Qualifications , Limitations and Restrictions , of the
6 % Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock , Series E
There is hereby established a new series of the preferred stock (  Preferred Stock ) of City National Bancshares Corporation , a New Jersey corporation ( Corporation ) , to which the following powers , designations , preferences and relative , participating , optional and other special rights , and the qualifications , limitations or restrictions , of the shares of such new series of preferred stock shall apply :
1. Designation ; Rank and Number .
The series ( this  Series ) of shares of Preferred Stock shall be designated as  6 % Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock , Series E ( the  Series E Preferred Stock ) , and each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall have a liquidation preference of $ 50,000 per share plus $ 3,000 for the most recently completed Dividend Period to the extent that a dividend was declared ( or is otherwise payable pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof ) for such Dividend Period but has not been paid as of the date of liquidation , without interest ( Liquidation Value ) .
The Series E Preferred Stock shall rank prior to common stock of all classes ( collectively ,  Common Stock ) of the Corporation and to all other classes and series of equity securities of the Corporation now or hereafter authorized , issued or outstanding ( the Common Stock and such other classes and series of equity securities of the Corporation are collectively referred to herein as the  Junior Stock ) , other than any class or series of equity securities of the Corporation expressly designated as ranking on a parity with ( the  Parity Stock ) or senior to ( the  Senior Stock ) the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation , winding up or dissolution of the Corporation .
The Series E Preferred Stock shall be on a parity with all other Series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation , except Senior Stock .
The Series E Preferred Stock shall be junior to the creditors of the Corporation , including its depositors .
The Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to the creation of Senior Stock , Parity Stock and Junior Stock to the extent not expressly prohibited by the Charter of the Corporation .
The number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be 200 which number may be increased or decreased from time to time by a vote of not less than a majority of the members of the Board of Directors then in office , provided that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the
6
number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of any outstanding options , rights or warrants , if any , to purchase shares of Series E Preferred Stock , or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into shares of Series E Preferred Stock .
2. Dividends .
( a) Payment of Dividends .
Holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive , if , when and as declared by the Board of Directors , out of funds legally available therefor , noncumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 6 % of the $ 50,000 liquidation preference per share ( $ 3,000 per share per annum ) , and no more .
Such noncumulative cash dividends shall be payable , if declared , annually on February 28 , in each year , or if such day is not a business day , on the next business day ( each such date , a  Dividend Payment Date ) .
The first Dividend Payment Date shall be February 28 , 2005 , to the extent a dividend is declared ( or is otherwise payable pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof ) for the Initial Dividend Period ( defined below ) .
Each declared dividend shall be payable to holders of record of the Series E Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock books of the Corporation at the close of business on such record date , not more than forty - five ( 45 ) calendar days nor less than ten ( 10 ) calendar days preceding the Dividend Payment Date therefor , as determined by the Board of Directors ( each such date , a  Record Date ) .
Annual dividend periods ( each a  Dividend Period ) shall commence on and include the first day , and shall end on and include the last day , of the calendar year that immediately precedes the calendar year in which the corresponding Dividend Payment Date occurs ; provided , however , that the first Dividend Period ( the  Initial Dividend Period ) shall commence on and include the first day upon which a share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be issued and shall end on and include December 31 , 2004 .
The amount of dividends payable on each share of the Series E Preferred Stock for each full Dividend Period during which such share is outstanding shall be $ 3,000 .
The amount of dividends payable for the Initial Dividend Period and for any Dividend Period which , as to a share of Series E Preferred Stock ( determined by reference to the issuance date and the redemption or retirement date thereof ) , is less than a full year shall be computed on the basis of a 360 - day year composed of twelve ( 12 ) thirty ( 30 ) day months and the actual number of days elapsed in the Initial Dividend Period or such Dividend Period .
Holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any interest , or any sum of money in lieu of interest , in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Stock declared by the Board of Directors which may be unpaid .
Any dividend payment made on the Series E Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest declared but unpaid cash dividend with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock .
( b) Dividends Noncumulative .
The right of holders of Series E Preferred Stock to receive dividends is noncumulative .
Accordingly , if the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend payable in respect of any Dividend Period , except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in Sections 4 and 5 hereof with respect to declared but unpaid dividends , holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive a dividend in respect of such Dividend Period , and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay a dividend in respect of
7
such Dividend Period , whether or not ( i ) funds are available for the payment of a dividend , or ( ii ) dividends are declared payable in respect of any future Dividend Period .
( c) Priority as to Dividends .
No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any Parity Stock or Junior Stock for any Dividend Period unless full dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid ( or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment ) on the Series E Preferred Stock for the current Dividend Period .
When dividends are not paid in full ( or declared and a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart ) for any Dividend Period on the Series E Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock , dividends declared on the Series E Preferred Stock and Parity Stock shall only be declared pro rata based upon the respective amounts that would have been paid on the Series E Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock had dividends been declared in full .
In addition to the foregoing restriction , the Corporation shall not declare , pay or set apart funds for any dividends or other distributions ( other than in Common Stock or other Junior Stock ) with respect to any Common Stock or other Junior Stock of the Corporation or repurchase , redeem or otherwise acquire , or set apart funds for repurchase , redemption or other acquisition of , any Common Stock or other Junior Stock through a sinking fund or otherwise , unless and until the Corporation has declared a cash dividend on the Series E Preferred Stock for the current Dividend Period , and sufficient funds have been paid over to the dividend disbursing agent for the Corporation for the payment of such cash dividend for such current Dividend Period .
No dividend shall be paid or set aside for holders of Series E Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period unless full dividends have been paid or set aside for the holders of each class or series of equity securities of the Corporation , if any , ranking prior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends for such Dividend Period .
( d) Definition of  Dividend .
Any reference to dividends  or distributions  in this Section 2 shall not be deemed to include any distribution made in connection with any voluntary or involuntary dissolution , liquidation or winding up of the Corporation .
3. Optional Conversion
The holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows ( the  Conversion Rights  ) :
( a) Right to Convert .
Each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be convertible , at the option of the holder thereof , at any time and from time to time , into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $ 50,000 by the Conversion Price ( as defined below ) in effect at the time of conversion .
The price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of Series E Preferred Stock without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof ( the  Conversion Price ) shall initially be $ 150.15 .
Such initial Conversion Price for which shares of Series E Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 3 .
8
In the event of a liquidation of the Corporation , the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the first full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock .
( b) Fractional Shares .
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock .
In lieu of fractional shares , the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective Conversion Price .
( c) Mechanics of Conversion .
( i) In order to convert shares of Series E Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock , the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series E Preferred Stock at the office of the Corporation , together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares represented by such certificate or certificates .
Such notice shall state such holders name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued .
If required by the Corporation , certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer , in form satisfactory to the Corporation , duly executed by the registered holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing .
The date of receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent or the Corporation shall be the conversion date ( Conversion Date ) .
The Corporation shall , as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date , issue and deliver at such office to such holder , or to his nominees , a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled , together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share .
( ii ) The Corporation shall at all times during which the Series E Preferred Stock shall be outstanding , reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock , for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock , such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series E Preferred Stock .
Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock , the Corporation will take any corporation action which may , in the opinion of its counsel , be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price .
( iii ) Upon any such conversion , no adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made for any declared and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion and the holder , by converting , waives his / her right to such declared but unpaid dividends .
( iv ) All shares of Series E Preferred Stock , which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided , shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares , including the rights , if any , to receive dividends ,
9
notices and to vote ( if any ) , shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date , except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor .
Any shares of Series E Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued , and the Corporation may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the number of shares of authorized Series E Preferred Stock accordingly .
( v) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 , as amended , the conversion may , at the option of any holder tendering Series E Preferred Stock for conversion , be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering , in which event the person (s ) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Series E Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities .
( d) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations .
If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of Series E Preferred Stock is first issued ( the  Original Issue Date ) effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock , the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased .
If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common stock , the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased .
Any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective .
( e) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions .
In the event the Corporation at any time , or from time to time after the Original Issue Date , shall make or issue a dividend or other distribution on or with respect to the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock , then in each such event the Conversion Price shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance by multiplying the Conversion Price by a fraction :
the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance , and
the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution .
( f) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions .
In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue a dividend or other distribution on or with respect to the Common Stock payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock , then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon , the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received had their Series E Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had thereafter , during the
10
period from the date of such event to and including the Conversion Date , retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period given application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock .
prior to such reorganization , reclassification , or change , all subject to further adjustment as provided herein .
forth in this Section 3 ( including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price ) shall thereafter be applicable , as nearly as reasonably may be , in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock .
( i) No Impairment .
The Corporation will not , by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization , transfer of assets , consolidation , merger , dissolution , issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action , avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation , but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 3 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock against impairment .
4. Redemption

If redemption is being affected by the Corporation , on and after the redemption date , dividends shall cease to accrue on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock called for redemption , and they shall be deemed to cease to be outstanding , provided that the redemption price ( including any declared but unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption ) has been duly paid or provided for .
If redemption is being effected by an entity other than the Corporation , on and as of the redemption date such entity shall be deemed to own the shares being redeemed for all purposes hereof provided that the redemption price ( including the amount of any de but unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption ) has been duly paid or provided for .
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , no shares of the Series E Preferred Stock may be redeemed unless such redemption has received the prior consent of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve ) , to the extent the Series E Preferred Stock is treated as Tier I capital for regulatory capital purposes , or such consent is otherwise required by applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve .
( b) Change of Control / Significant Public Offering .
In addition to the redemption provisions of subsection ( a ) above and not in lieu of or in substitution therefor , in the event of a Change of Control or a Significant Public Offering , the Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemable at the option of the Corporation or its successor or any acquiring or resulting entity with respect to the Corporation ( including by any parent or subsidiary of the Corporation , any such successor , or any such acquiring or resulting entity ) , as applicable , in whole but not in part .
Redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection ( b ) shall be effected by notice as provided in subsection ( c ) of this Section 4 , by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation or its successor or any acquiring or resulting entity with respect to the Corporation ( including by any parent or subsidiary of the Corporation , any such successor , or any such acquiring or resulting entity ) , as applicable , at the liquidation value per share in cash , plus , in each case , an amount in cash equal to all declared and unpaid dividends .
 Change of Control means ( a ) a sale of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation ( other than a reorganization transaction in which such properties and assets are transferred to a subsidiary of the Corporation ) , ( b ) a reorganization , merger , consolidation or other transaction or transactions ( whether or not the Corporation is a party thereto and specifically including , without limitation , open market purchases of securities ) as a result of which any person or entity or group of persons and / or entities becomes the beneficial owner 

Notice of any redemption , setting forth ( i ) the date and place fixed for said redemption , and ( ii ) the redemption price , shall be mailed , postage prepaid , at least thirty ( 30 ) days , but not more than sixty ( 60 ) days , prior to said redemption date to each holder of record of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed at his or her address as the same shall appear on the stock books of the Corporation .
If less than all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock owned by such holder are then to be redeemed , such notice shall specify the number of shares thereof that are to be redeemed and the numbers of the certificates representing such shares .
Notice of any redemption shall be given by first class mail , postage prepaid .
Neither failure to mail such notice , nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof , to any particular holder shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders .
Any notice which was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the holder receives such notice .
If such notice of redemption shall have been so mailed , and if , on or before the redemption date specified in such notice , all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation ( or other entity as provided in subsection ( a ) or ( b ) of this Section 4 ) separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the account of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed ( so as to be and continue to be available therefor ) , then , on and after said redemption date , notwithstanding that any certificate for shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation or transfer , the shares of Series E Preferred Stock ( A ) so called for redemption by the Corporation shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall forthwith cease and terminate , or ( B ) so called for redemption by an entity other than the Corporation shall be deemed owned for all purposes hereof by such entity , except in each case for the right of the holders thereof to receive , out of the funds so set aside in trust , the amount payable on redemption thereof , but without interest , upon surrender ( and endorsement or assignment for transfer , if required by the Corporation or such other entity ) of their certificates .
In the event that holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock that shall have been redeemed shall not within two ( 2 ) years ( or any longer period if required by law ) after the redemption date claim any amount deposited in trust with a Corporation or trust company for the
13
redemption of such shares , such Corporation or trust company shall , upon demand and if permitted by applicable law , pay over to the Corporation ( or other entity that redeemed the shares ) any such unclaimed amount so deposited with it , and shall thereupon be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof , and thereafter the holders of such shares shall , subject to applicable escheat laws , look only to the Corporation ( or other entity that redeemed the shares ) for payment of the redemption price thereof , but without interest from the date of redemption .
( d) Status of Shares Redeemed .
Shares of Series E Preferred Stock redeemed , purchased or otherwise acquired for value by the Corporation shall , after such acquisition , have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued by the Corporation at any time as shares of any series of Preferred Stock other than as shares of Series E Preferred Stock .

If the amounts available for distribution in respect of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any outstanding Parity Stock are not sufficient to satisfy the full liquidation rights of all of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock , then the holders of such outstanding shares shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled .
After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which they are entitled , holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any liquidating distribution of assets by the Corporation .

CITY NATIONAL BANCSHARES CORPORATION

Name : Edward R. Wright
Title : Senior Vice President and CFO Date : February 3 , 2005
With 2009 nearing its end , we take a look at the most - pirated movie titles across various categories .
Aside from the usual suspects such as Star Trek and Transformers , the list also includes a few surprising entries , and some notable absentees .
2009 has been a record breaking year at the box office , with more than $ 10 billion in ticket sales in the US and Canada alone .
This , despite increasing piracy rates on the Internet .
The uncontested winner on BitTorrent this year is Star Trek , with well over 10 million downloads , many more than The Dark Knight got last year .
The download statistics clearly show that BitTorrent use is still on the up , even though the relative increase is not as pronounced as in previous years .
As we look over the rest of the top 10 , we see that there are quite a few differences between popularity at the box office and on BitTorrent .
Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs and 2012 are ranked 2nd and 4th based on their worldwide grosses but did n’t make it into the top 10 list of most swapped movies .
On the contrary , RocknRolla is the third most pirated movie on BitTorrent this year , but with a minuscule worldwide revenue of $ 25 million it was ranked just 168th at the box office in 2008 when the movie came out .
Part of the success of RocknRolla is that it was released by the infamous uploader aXXo whose releases are always guaranteed to have at least a few million downloads .
The data for this list is collected by TorrentFreak from several sources , including reports from all the large BitTorrent trackers .
All release formats , including cammed versions are counted .
Afterward , the data is carefully checked and possible inaccuracies are systematically corrected .

ARNE DUNCAN , the secretary of education , recently called for sweeping changes to the way we select and train teachers .
He ’s right .
If we really want good schools , we need to create a critical mass of great teachers .
And if we want smart , passionate people to become these great educators , we have to attract them with excellent programs and train them properly in the substance and practice of teaching .
Our best universities have , paradoxically , typically looked down their noses at education , as if it were intellectually inferior .
The result is that the strongest students are often in colleges that have no interest in education , while the most inspiring professors are n’t working with students who want to teach .
This means that comparatively weaker students in less intellectually rigorous programs are the ones preparing to become teachers .
So the first step is to get the best colleges to throw themselves into the fray .
If education was a good enough topic for Plato , John Dewey and William James , it should be good enough for 21st - century college professors .
These new teacher programs should be selective , requiring a 3.5 undergraduate grade point average and an intensive application process .
But they should also be free of charge , and admission should include a stipend for the first three years of teaching in a public school .

Internal investigations into the conduct of several House members have been exposed in an extraordinary , Internet - era breach of security involving the secretive process by which Congress polices lawmaker ethics .
Revelations of the mostly preliminary inquiries by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct — also known as the Ethics committee — shook the chamber as lawmakers were immersed in a series of scheduled votes Thursday .

The panel announced that it was probing two California Democrats — Reps. Maxine Waters and Laura Richardson — even as its embarrassed leaders took pains to explain that several other lawmakers also identified in the leaked confidential committee memo may have committed no wrongdoing .
The committee said it was investigating whether Waters used her influence to help a bank in which her husband owned stock , and whether the couple benefited as a result .
Separately , the panel is looking into whether Richardson failed to disclose required information on her financial disclosure forms and received special treatment from a lender .
In the midst of a busy legislative day , ethics chairwoman Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D - Calif. , went to the House floor to announce that a confidential weekly report of the committee from July had leaked out in a case of “ cyber - hacking . ”
A committee statement said that its security was breached through “ peer to peer file sharing software ” by a junior employee who was working from home .
The staff member was fired .
The July report contains a summary of the committee ’s work at the time , but Lofgren said no inferences should be made about anyone whose name is mentioned .

Men 's shinny groups and players in the competitive Greater Toronto Hockey League will be moved out of city arenas or pushed to different time slots to accommodate the growing number of girls in the game .
" They need to accept that they are less of a priority for public arenas than girls , and I do n't think anyone can quarrel with that , " Mayor David Miller , a former midnight shinny player , said Wednesday .
" Adult men and the Greater Toronto Hockey League ... have to take a back seat to girls , that 's our ( equity ) policy . "
Miller 's comments followed Wednesday 's Star story about the Toronto Leaside Girls Hockey Association 's threat to launch a human - rights complaint over what the 900 - member league alleges is the city 's failure to enforce its equity policy at publicly owned city arenas .
The league , which sent Miller a letter Oct. 30 , claims municipal facilities shut girls out of prime - time ice and , in some cases , rent it to adult men .
Greater Toronto Hockey League president John Gardner called Miller 's stand on pushing boys off public ice " hypocritical " because the expanding girls ' game has already squeezed boys ' permit times .
" If you 've got to get what you want by taking away from other kids , I do n't see what that accomplishes , " Gardner said , " and any politician who subscribes to that ought to be ashamed of themselves . "
His league 's 40,000 players will use municipal ice for close to 30 per cent of games this season – down from 40 per cent in recent years .
Gardner said forcing league players into private arenas , where rates can top $ 300 an hour , will drive up the price of the game for families .
But skating on expensive private ice is at the core of Toronto Leaside 's argument .
Ron Baker , president of the girls ' hockey association , said his non -profit league has spent more than $ 1 million over the past five years at private arenas , largely because city - owned facilities in players ' neighbourhoods regularly refuse to give the association ice permits that Baker says it is entitled to .
Regardless of gender , priority at city rinks is supposed to be given to youth recreational hockey ( house leagues ) , then to youth competitive hockey and then to adult players .
Miller warned arenas run at arm 's - length from the city by autonomous boards of management – in particular , North Toronto Memorial , Larry Grossman Forest Hill Memorial and Leaside Memorial Community Gardens – that he will intervene if requests for ice time from female hockey groups continue to be ignored or restricted .
" The lack of action by the arena boards is completely unacceptable , " Miller said .
He noted Ted Reeve Arena has made a serious effort to open ice for Toronto Leaside and other girls - only programs .
The mayor said if boards refuse to ensure equal access to ice time , he 'll summon board chairs to his office for an accountability meeting .
And if that does n't produce change , " I 'll move a motion at council to direct the boards and our ( city councillor ) representatives on the boards to act . "
The mayor added he was disappointed with councillors on the boards of arenas that are not actively welcoming girls .
Councillor Karen Stintz ( Ward 16 , Eglinton - Lawrence ) sits on the Larry Grossman and North Toronto boards , but said in an email Tuesday that the arenas and the Leaside league are working together " to ensure equitable ice allocation " in the future .
What 's crowding the icy landscape is the rapidly emerging army of female hockey players trying to squeeze into facilities long dominated by adult men , competitive boys and figure skating clubs .
In Ontario , there were 37,827 registered female hockey players last season – more than double the 16,049 in the Ontario Women 's Hockey Association in the 1997 - 98 season .
And fighting to get on local rinks is not unique to the GTA , said association president Fran Rider .
" It 's a universal issue , it 's absolutely everywhere , " said Rider , who noted women have had to push hard for access in Oakville , Cornwall and Durham .
Rider estimated there are about 14,000 association house - league and competitive players in the GTA .
Gardner , of the Greater Toronto league , said the root of this hockey battlefield is the city 's failure to keep up with the game 's demand .

" ( Politicians ) are letting the girls and boys fight each other , rather than the girls and the boys uniting to go after the problem where it really exists , which is at city hall for insufficient facilities , " he said .
Miller agreed a lack of facilities " is a big part of the problem , no question about it . "
He said the planned four - pad arena in the port lands ( to be finished in March 2011 ) will alleviate some pressure .
The mayor also encouraged people to sign the Toronto Leaside league 's petition , which calls on council to enforce its equity policy at its Nov. 30 meeting .
When the FBI staged a terror raid on the New York home of 41 - year - old Elliot Madison , they were not looking for weapons of war , deadly chemicals or the keys to unlocking a nefarious terror plot .
Instead , they came looking for books , files , data , film and something called the “ instruments of crime . ”
According to officials , the search was instigated after Madison was found in a Pennsylvania hotel room on Sept. 24 , listening to police actions during Pittsburgh ’s G20 summit , then Tweeting to protesters seeking to avoid authorities .

Vic Walczak , legal director for the Pennsylvania ACLU , sees the FBI ’s action as pure “ intimidation , ” and part of a “ much bigger war on demonstrators ” in Pittsburgh .
He made the remarks during a Monday interview on CNN ’s Newsroom .
“ What you have here is folks who are charged with hindering apprehension of people who were engaging in criminal activities , ” he said .
“ The criminals identified in the warrant are protesters against the G20 .
Their crime ?
They were demonstrating in the street without a permit . ”
Madison , who has widely been described as an “ anarchist ” by media parroting FBI claims , is a social worker in New York who holds two masters degrees from the University of Wisconsin .
Walczak continued : “ The police said , ‘ Get out of here , ’ and apparently they did .
Somebody was trying to help them not go where the police are .
Instead of saying ‘ thank you , you ’re helping these folks disperse , ’ they now get charged with what is really a felony . ”

In other words : “ Be careful what you twit for , because your 140 characters could land you in the slammer , ” quipped Andrew Belonsky at Vallywag .
“ Though the FBI says so , it ’s not entirely clear from the complaint that Madison ’s tweets were actually illegal , ” noted Ars Technica .
“ Madison ’s lawyer told the New York Times on Saturday that he and a friend were merely ‘ part of a communications network among people protesting the G - 20 . ’
As implied through the Times piece , Madison ’s tweets merely directed protesters as to where the police were at any given time and to stay alert .
‘ There ’s absolutely nothing that he ’s done that should subject him to any criminal liability . ' ”
Eileen Clancy with I - Witness Video added : “ There are myriad examples of governments in other countries cracking down on activists who share information on the Internet .
After Moldova ’s short - lived ‘ Twitter revolution , ’ journalist Natalia Morar was charged with organizing an anti-Communist flashmob and spent three weeks under house arrest .
In Guatemala a man was charged with advising in a Tweet that people should take their money out of a corrupt government bank .
According to Hadi Ghaemi , who runs the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , many people have been arrested for Internet activity in Iran . ”

“ This is the first time we ’ve heard of charges like this against people who are using Twitter [ … ] ” said Walczak .
“ If this happened in Iran or China , where we know Twitter has been widespread because people in this country have been relying on it to find out what ’s going on .
If it was used there , we ’d be crying foul , we ’d be calling it a human rights violation .
And when the same thing happens in this country , all of the sudden it ’s a crime .
There ’s a real problem here . ”
Copies of the search warrant and Madison ’s lawyer ’s motion for return of seized property were posted to the Internet by the Electronic Frontiers Foundation , available here .

Cassini took a gorgeous shot of Titan casting its shadow on Saturn :
[ Click to embiggen ]
Wow !
A couple of cool things to note in this image ... one is that the shadow is fuzzy .
That 's because Titan has a thick atmosphere , so there is no sharp edge to the moon to cast a sharp shadow .
[ Update : A few folks have pointed out that I did n't consider the idea that the fuzziness may be due to the fact that the Sun is not a point source , and so it will cast a fuzzy shadow -- this same thing happens during solar and lunar eclipses on Earth .
I did some quick trigonometry , and I get that the fuzzy outer part of the eclipse shadow ( called the penumbra ) should be about 1000 km across or so , while the deep shadow ( the umbra ) is a little bit bigger than the size of Titan itself , or about 5200 km ( again , these are pretty rough numbers ) .
That jibes well with what we see in this image ( if you neglect the weird distortion of Titan 's shadow being stretched since it's projected on Saturn 's curved cloud tops ) , so I 'm now thinking that the shadow is not fuzzy due to Titan 's atmosphere at all -- it 's just the penumbra of this Titanic solar eclipse !
I stand corrected , and I thank my readers for pointing this out .
Very cool . ]
Another is that even though Titan 's orbit is almost exactly in the same plane as the rings , its shadow is really far south of the rings ' shadow .
That 's because spring has started in Saturn 's northern hemisphere , so the Sun is shining down on the planet from just north of the equator .
The rings are relatively close to the planet surface , so the shadow they cast is just south of the equator ( and narrow since the Sun is still shining nearly straight down the ring plane ) .
Titan orbits Saturn much farther out ( 1.2 million km from Saturn , very roughly 10 times farther out than the main rings on the average ) .
Over that distance , the angle of the moon 's shadow carries it farther south of the equator .
It 's a like a tall tree 's shadow being longer than a short tree 's shadow .
I 've said it before , but it bears repeating : we will get a vast amount of science out of Cassini data , and learn more about Saturn in a few years than we have in all the centuries of observations before we launched the probe .
But sometimes it 's just the pure beauty of the images that gets to me .

Interesting online debate at MIT featuring Lindzen , Emanuel and others .
Emanuel foams about the supposed “ premeditated and orchestrated distraction from important issues . ”

LEADING mental health advocate Ian Hickie has called for the Prime Minister to push for the drinking age to be raised to 19 to break the connection between school leaving and drinking .
The call comes as school leavers prepare for the annual binge - drinking ritual of schoolies , which Professor Hickie has criticised as ' ' ludicrous ' ' and '' a very dangerous activity ' ' .
He says the drinking age of 18 is unacceptable and cites the mounting evidence that the brains of young people even into their 20s are particularly susceptible to damage from alcohol abuse .
The call has won the backing of the chairman of the Australian National Council on Drugs , John Herron , who said the council would discuss the proposal at its next meeting later this month .
'' I think Ian 's suggestion of breaking the nexus between drinking and school leaving is a very valid one , '' Dr Herron said , adding he was speaking personally and not as chairman of the council .
The move was particularly needed given the unfolding evidence of the toxic effect alcohol had on teenagers ' brains .
Out - of - the - Body , Explained Away , But It Was So Real .....
Susan Blackmore Sunday November 8th , 1970 : Causes
I had been taking part in a séance , or rather a ouija board group , and as a consequence was very tired .
Three of us , Kevin , Vicki and myself , decided that we'd go up to her room two floors up and smoke some hash .
This we did and at first it just seemed like normal .
However after a few minutes , I began to get even more cut off from the others than usual and to experience very strange sensations .
These I thought were still just part of the drug experience .
The music appeared in some sense most akin to sight , but although having colours it was not a normal sight at all .
I had my eyes closed .
I moved from the chair I was sitting on to the floor and sat there cross -legged for the rest of the time .
1 . I began to move through tunnels in my mind , very brightly coloured and getting more and more real .
There began to be places , which appeared very , very clearly .
In more detail than if I had seen them real .
This kind of thing went on for about half an hour - 12:00 to 12:30 - and then the transition came .
2 . I was thinking how high I was , in the sense that on looking down my feet seemed a very long way away .
This I had experienced before but this time it was much more vivid .
Also the feeling of there being a white wall behind me and through the centre of me was much more pronounced than usual .
As I kept looking down , with my eyes shut most of the time but occasionally opening , I suddenly realized that I really was high up and looking down on my own body .
I think had it not been for the drug , I would have been worried at this , however it did n't worry me at all and I continued to look at myself with interest but still just enjoying the sensations .
I think at this point I was at about ceiling level and gently drifting about .
My eyes were shut and remained shut for most of the time .
If I had opened them the conflict would have been too great .
I seem to remember that I did open them at times , but that nothing I saw made any sense , so I shut them again .
I wanted to tell the others about what I was doing , but I was a little embarrassed about what they would think of me interrupting their conversation , which I could hear if I listened .
So I kept silent , or more or less so .
I kept looking around me and making slight exclamations and looking terribly excited .
I could see only the room and then the outside and the roofs , but I preferred to stay inside the room .
3 . At this point Vicki went out to make some coffee and Kevin said to me " Where are you ? "
I still did n't think it at all odd that I could be in one place and yet still in control of the body below and able to speak through it .
It was almost like watching a cinema screen and relating the picture to someone who could n't see it .
I told him where I was and from that time I kept on talking , almost continuously , for the next three hours .
The fact that I was talking to Kevin and that I was not alone gave me much more confidence and I was able to go on from there and see more .
At all times I was fully aware of what my body was doing , I was somehow quite able to conceive of being in the two places at once , or rather to be in one place but to still have the knowledge and perception of the body in another .
4 . Soon after I had begun talking I saw the cord .
I looked down from where I was and saw , apparently coming from where my tummy should be , a cord .
It was not really any colour , but closest to a slightly shiny grayish - white and it was bendy and slowly moving .
I had great fun with it because I decided to try and move it .
I reached out my hand but found two things .
Firstly , if I wanted a hand I could have one , or as many as I liked .
Secondly , it was n't necessary to have a hand , I could move the cord at will , and had great fun doing it too .
I was quite consciously talking all this time but very fast , as I wanted to say so much and tell them every thing I was doing .
I looked harder at the cord and the body and saw that the cord entered my physical body at the neck and there appeared to be no head on the body .
I seem to remember that it did n't look very much like a normal body but then I was n't really interested in it so I did n't look very carefully .
I was more conscious of what I was actually like .
At this time I was still more or less the shape of my body , or had n't yet discovered that I could be anything else .
I was made of the same kind of whitish moving stuff that the cord was made of , but a little more dense than the cord and , at this stage , more solid and constant in shape .
5 . I then found that I was moving , not really conscious of whether I was in control or not .
I moved up and out and saw below me all the roofs of Oxford .
I think I knew even then that they were n't the roofs that I should have seen were I really there , it seems now that they were merely a symbolic representation of how roofs in general should look , but to me they represented the roofs of St. Hilda's .
On looking down , I could , if I wanted , look through the roof and intervening floors to the room from which I had started , but as I gained confidence I became less reluctant to let go of that sight and move away .
6 . I became aware that I was moving away fairly fast but it was n't really clear where I was going , nor did I have any conscious control over it .
I did n't even take much notice of where I was going until I was suddenly aware that I was somewhere in the vicinity of the Mediterranean .
I am not sure how I knew this but it seemed quite obvious at the time .
I saw below me an island and I thought that it would be good to go and have a look at it .
As a consequence of this thought , I found myself closing in on it .
All this time I was aware of the music that my body could hear , and again it did n't at all seem odd to me that I could listen to it , nor did it seem at all difficult to concentrate on so much at once .
This could have been a result of the drug as it does seem to make it possible to see and hear so much more at one time than is usual .
As I approached the island I could see its shape , which was almost star shaped with very sharp points , but the shape seemed to be changing all the time and pulsating with the music .
I became even more excited and tried to tell the others what I was seeing as I got closer and closer .
It was at this point that I discovered what was to be of such importance later on - that I could change shape at will .
So far I had been aware that I could produce hands at will , but now I was able to lose my bodily shape altogether and become any shape I wanted .
I stretched out over the island and watched it changing shape .
Then from being a flat thin shape , I thought my way down in among the trees .
For the first time I got a little scared as I thought the cord might get tangled up and broken in the trees : however I soon found that it could pass among or through the trees with no difficulty whatever and that I would n't have to worry about it at all .
I was then again a little scared because it was all dark and , as I then described it , treacley , under the trees .
Feelings of pleasure and displeasure were very exaggerated and the feeling of being in that thick darkness was intense .
However as soon as I discovered that I could move up again at will , I lost the fear and was enjoying going into and out of trees .
Another impression I had of the island was that it had one hundred trees .
I was really excited by the funny idea of there being exactly that number and kept on talking about it .
7 . I made my first conscious decision to go somewhere else and left the island , but was still unable either to control where I was going or to even bother to try to go somewhere specific .
Soon , I saw that I was traveling over Europe .
Again I do n't really know how I could tell where it was , but I think in this case the outline from a long way up was very like a map .
I thought I went over Italy , Switzerland and then France .
There I saw all the people working very , very hard .
I was too far up really to see them at all , but I had a very distinct impression of lots of people working and I felt terribly sorry for them .
I kept saying " Do n't they realize they do n't have to work ? " but at the same time realizing myself that I would have to too , and that I was only being permitted to see that it was possible to live and move by thought alone .
8 . I moved over the sea and immediately wanted to go down to it .
I gradually got closer to the sea and to the land too .
I tried to get right down to the water and had the rather pleasant experience of being flat again and floating above the water being lifted and buffeted by the waves .
In this uncomfortable way I came into a beach and after some difficulty landed on to the sand and looked around .
Again I got a little scared because I was down below very high cliffs and I could n't see how to get out .
Of course as soon as I tried I found that I did n't have to climb the rocky cliffs but could just be at the top , with apparently no motion , that is with instantaneous movement , there being no time required for it .
I continuously kept trying to explain to Kevin and Vicki how I could do it and saying things like " I 'm going to go up that cliff , oh , but I do n't have to get up it , I can just be there " , " I 'm going to walk over there , oh , but I do n't even have to walk , I can go as fast as I like ! " etc .
There seemed to be two kinds of movement possible .
If I wanted to move to somewhere quite close and of which I had a good mental image , I could be there instantaneously , or in short hops .
For longer distances , especially those which I was not directing , I moved very high up but apparently normally , and the speed was more or less beyond my control .
9 . I was still very close to the ground and all the grass and plants were terribly clear , but I decided that I 'd try and get back to Oxford .
Whether this decision was prompted by fear , interest or a desire to get back into my body , I do n't know .
However I was soon back over Oxford and managed to get into the vicinity of the room .
My body 's eyes opened and Kevin said " Hello " and I replied " Hello . "
" So you 're really here . "
" Yes , I 'm really here .
Hello Vicki " and then " Goodbye . "
I had found during this brief return to my body that although I could easily see with my own eyes , what I did see did n't really make much sense .
I had been able to get to a good position in which the two visual fields corresponded for only short periods of time and it required a lot of effort .
10 .
So , having ascertained that my body was still accessible , I again left , and this time consciously decided that I 'd like to go to somewhere that I had in fact been to with my body , to see if it looked the same .
I chose New York for some reason , and very quickly found myself there .
All my movements were becoming more deliberate and much faster , even the unintentional movements were now much faster than at the start .
It was sunny in New York and I moved , as a large , almost ellipsoid shape over the buildings until I came to the top of 5th Avenue .
The thought of what was below me made me shoot down to street level , becoming much smaller .
After a short second looking at the cars and people , which I could n't see as clearly as I 'd have expected , I got really scared .
This was the first time I had been really afraid and it was some struggle before I was able to think my way up the buildings and emerge in space again .
Between the tall buildings I could move quite easily up and down .
If I looked down I would move up and vice - versa .
Thus movement at will was a combination of thinking myself hard into the right place and also looking in the right direction .
This was really only so for vertical movements .
For horizontal movements , as far as I can remember , I had to look in the same direction I wanted to go in .
11 . After New York I had no clear idea of where I wanted to go and I found myself heading , ever faster , for South America .
There I amused myself in the childish pastime of using the coastline as a giant slide .
The curly bit at the southern tip of the continent was the end of it and from there I shot round the bend and off up into the Atlantic .
This was tremendously exciting and I was laughing all the time and telling them all about it .
I wanted to do it again and went back and did .
Then I headed up towards England again , and got back to Oxford and the room my body was in .
12 . This time I could not get into the body at all , at least not in the usual sense , as I had almost done before .
I was only able to hang over it and this time what I could see from this position was very much clearer .
I think possibly the confidence I now had allowed me to see this strange scene without either becoming afraid , or not being able to comprehend it and so dropping back in .
I could see Vicki and Kevin very clearly , and after looking at the room for some time I got around to looking at myself .
What I saw was rather odd .
The body was now very clear but not much like me really .
It was brownish in colour , but I think I thought it was quite normal at the time .
I could very distinctly see the cord , which was now very much thicker , and more solid , but not proportionately to the way it had been before .
With interest I looked at my body and , with no apparent effort , this led to my going closer and closer to it .
This was , however , a very different feeling to that of coming back into the body .
This time I still was very detached from it even though I was so close , in distance , to it .
I looked carefully at the jagged edges around the neck , from where the head had apparently been removed and seemed to be like a fly landing gently on the edge .
From there it was no big step to move inside and soon I found myself in the curious position of being right inside my own body .
It was all varying shades of brown , a little greenish in some places and shaded almost like a drawing .
I slowly wandered around inside looking at the outside of the body , it appeared to have no contents whatever , to be just a hollow shell .
I went down one of the legs , balanced on the knee joint and then , as if under the influence of gravity , whizzed down the leg into the foot , like going down a slide .
I began to be terribly excited and made a lot of noise all this time .
The most exciting thing of all was being inside the foot .
There I could look into any one of the openings made by the toes and see light streaming in through the window - like toenails .
From one foot I scrambled up the leg and slid all the way down to the middle and up the other leg and down to the foot , all in one swoop .
13 . I think it was at this time that I made so much noise that Vicki very loudly had to tell me to be quiet .
Her urgent voice made the visual image of an elephant appear low down and to the left of my visual field .
It disturbed me somewhat and I had a short struggle with myself .
I do n't remember what I said or felt in detail , but soon I found myself again above my body a little above ceiling level I think , and talking to Vicki .
I told her to " Take that body away . "
I said " I know you do n't like that body , why do n't you send it away , take it down to its own room , I can't move it , you take it away . "
It was always that body and not " my body " or " me " .
I could almost see the dislike going across from Vicki 's body to mine as a sort of visible repelling force .
Needless to say she did not move it and I lost the will to stay there and try to persuade her to move it .
14 . I simply found myself getting bigger .
This was rather a pleasant feeling and I actively helped it along at some stages ,
As I got bigger I obviously had to incorporate many things in to the area of my body ( not physical body ! ) and the first things to go were Kevin and Vicki .
They became a part of my body , still separate entities but within the space occupied by " me . "
Then the whole of the room and the buildings and , as I got still bigger , I began to sink into the earth .
The part of me that was still above the earth felt quite as before but below I felt slightly cold and a strange sensation that I suppose felt like being in the same place as earth , that is being between closely packed particles but still a coherent entity .
I became larger than the whole earth quite quickly and had the wonderful experience of being able to look at the earth from being all round it .
That is , I could see all sides of it at once in spite of its being spherical .
This is obviously a little difficult to explain but it was just a question of my whole consciousness being around the earth and so able to see all parts of it with that consciousness .
I did n't stop there , I got bigger and bigger and incorporated the moon .
This was yet another strange experience , having the earth at my centre was not too hard to understand , but having an object in a position inside me that was not symmetrical was a little harder to comprehend , at least I do n't suppose it was then , but it is harder to form a picture of now .
From there I expanded through the planets of the whole solar system , I was n't particularly aware of where or which one they were .
Then came our whole galaxy and , as I was moving and expanding faster and faster , I had soon enveloped many other galaxies .
I cannot remember at all how many there were , or even what order of number , but there were very many .
With distance out their density decreased and towards the outside of the universe , as I presumed it to be , there were very few with large distances between them and so I went on expanding .
Finally I reached what I took to be the limit of the universe , however silly that sounds now !
It is rather hard to explain this edge .
It was as if I was traveling at the speed of light and could travel no faster and so was static in the sense of not accelerating .
But in spite of moving at that speed , I was getting no bigger , nor moving .
It seemed that nothing could possibly get outside of where I was .
If I reached out one of the " arms " that I had been able to create at will , it simply did not appear .
It felt there all right , but just could not be outside of that boundary .
The whole feeling of the situation was as if it were a sphere in four dimensions , time having somehow totally changed in concept .
It seemed to me to be a very sensible picture of the state of the universe and I was n't at all worried about the implications of a universe expanding at the speed of light and yet not getting any bigger .
15 . Kevin had become a little worried by this time and was talking to me and asked me if I could see anything beyond this end .
I tried to see if I could .
Obviously there could be nothing actually outside that boundary in spatial terms but I found I could look into a whole new field of reference .
I would like to call it another dimension , but it was more like a whole new set of dimensions , possibly being reached , as it were , by going along in one new dimension .
What I can describe now is not really a picture in three dimensions , but that is the only way in which I can describe it .
It was like two white and very shining cliffs above me with an opening between them which seemed to lead up to a kind of sky , but not the sort of sky that goes on forever , just sky .
It was a real struggle to get up those cliffs , like fighting against something intangible , almost like swimming against a current , always achieving a little and then slipping back and only just hanging on .
I got a very , very brief glimpse out of the top .
What I " saw " was again indescribable in three dimensional terms , but was like either hundreds of eyes , or one huge eye , staring at me from every direction at once .
Not that it seemed to take any notice of me , it was just a static seeing thing all around .
Then I slipped back , Kevin was talking to me all this time , trying to make me come back again and he began to succeed .
I genuinely wanted to come back and began trying .
16 . I had every confidence that I would in fact be able to come back to my body easily if I so desired , and indeed for a while it was quite easy , I had soon got back into normal orders of size and from there into the room , but there the struggle began .
I tried very hard to get down into my body but could n't get any nearer to it than about five or six feet above it .
The cord was there again .
I do n't know what had happened to it before , but I presume that as my body was within me I had no need for any other form of attachment .
Now , however , the cord was even in the way .
Kevin tried to tell me to coil it up so that I could get nearer but I scorned this idea .
I had to struggle to get some sense of time back .
I had a sense of a progression of events , but not of time being a necessary part of continuous movement and consequently I found I could not move properly .
I had to think my way down in very slow stages , thinking myself at each step into a new position with the cord just a little shorter each time and myself a little closer to the body .
After some time I finally achieved the first stage , I was no longer joined by a cord and separate , but was more or less with my body .
However all I had achieved was some sort of overlap with the body , I was not outside of it , but was still moving about , totally unstable and just maintaining contact by always overlapping at some point .
17 . I am not at all sure of the separate times taken by each stage , but this last part , of trying to get back , took about 3 / 4 hour until I could finally control my physical body again .
I still had the desire to get back , I think I realized the necessity of it , although I am not really sure if I had any better reason for coming back , it certainly was lonely outside and possibly I wanted to come back to people again .
I kept on trying and Kevin kept on encouraging me to come back in .
As I got nearer I was able to open my eyes and briefly saw what corresponded to what I was actually looking at , but that did n't last because , of course , I followed my thoughts , and as I looked at the ceiling I shot off up to the ceiling again and as I looked down at the floor I found myself sinking into the floor .
As the two images ceased to make sense together it was always the physical one which was forgone and only my real self saw .
I was still trying very hard , and at times came close to being inside my body , but even though I was getting there sometimes I always went away again , quickly , and it was getting no better .
Kevin took my hands and this did some good , until gradually I became a little more stable .
It all took so long though that at last I began to give up .
I had got terribly tired with all the effort and almost felt that I just wanted to float away again , but with Kevin talking to me and keeping my attention I managed to keep the desire to come back and went on struggling .
I got to the state where I was fairly well inside and although I was moving about a lot still , I could more or less see with my eyes alone .
I did still move a little towards where I looked but could control my position well enough to keep seeing with my eyes .
18 .
For the first time since I began , one of the hardest things to do was to understand that I was only in one place .
I told myself out loud , to try to realize that I was only in that one place and that Kevin and Vicki were separate .
That if I wanted to move anywhere I would have to make some effort and take the body with me .
To look at the corners was a great problem because I could not yet understand the three dimensions and a corner presented more problems to my mind than even trying to force myself to stay within a ceiling and a floor had done .
However , it was accomplished , and I finally felt almost at ease with the three - dimensional world and the earthly concept of time .
19 .
It was then that I could look at my own body with my own eyes .
What I saw was a little different from usual .
I could still see the substance of which I had been made before .
It was more or less in the right place but did not fit my body at all well .
On the other hand the same part of Kevin was exactly the same shape as his body and extended beyond it for about three inches all around .
He tried to persuade me to let go of his hand and I tried .
With our hands about an inch apart I could see the two etheric bodies joined and the greyish - white substance was flowing very rapidly between the two hands .
I could still see it joined when they were about three or even four inches apart but I did n't dare let go completely even then .
When I did finally let go I felt fairly safe but still very afraid that I would move on again .
As I moved away from Kevin and then back towards him I realized that I could feel , but not see another body .
This was about 18 inches to 2 feet away from him and around Vicki it was about one foot away .
I felt all around it with my hands , it seemed to me to feel very solid and it was a very strange sensation to put my hand through it , as I knew I could .
Finally I practiced walking about , and although I found it scaring at first , I soon gained confidence and was rapidly back to some kind of normality .
Kevin thought it might be dangerous for me to sleep and so he kept me awake for a few more hours .
At about 7 a.m. I did sleep a little , but found that I could n't get into proper sleep at all .
20 .
I had thought that I was back to normal by this time , but in fact it took another two days to do it .
During that time I was able to walk around quite all right and to appear reasonably normal to most people , even to go to tutorials , but at any time I found myself drifting up out of myself and I had little power of concentration , and was therefore unable to do any work .
I could also go inside Kevin 's body more or less at will .
At first it was hollow as my own had been but as time went on it got more solid .
First the heart appeared , then all internal organs and finally stringy muscles and I was no longer able to do it .
On Tuesday afternoon I found myself back to normal , quite able to sleep properly and to think normally .
Contributor 's Comments on the Experience
This experience changed my life and I have never forgotten it .
Reading my own account again , for the first time in many years , was strange .
Somehow the words fail to convey how completely real it all seemed at the time .
The description of the star - shaped island with one hundred trees sounds fanciful and hallucinatory .
Of course I believe it was a hallucination , but the whole long experience had a quality of unforgettable hyper-reality .
The visions and places were stable , clear , and vivid , and I could inspect them at leisure or move around them at will .
Unlike most drug - induced hallucinations these were not unstable and fleeting ; unlike dream images they did not dissolve rapidly into something else .
They seemed as real and solid as any perceived world .
Looking back there are a number of things I would like to comment on .
The context
In October 1970 I went up to Oxford to read Physiology and Psychology .
I joined many societies and , among them , the Oxford University Society for Psychical Research .
As it turned out this society had only one surviving member , Kevin , who contacted me and asked me to run it with him - which I did for the next three years - possibly more because I liked him than because of any deep prior interest in the subject .
In that first term we had frequent meetings , with lectures by psychics , training in reading Tarot cards , and long late - night ouija - board sessions - often in my college bedroom .
It was after one of these , about a month later , that the experience happened .
I wrote the account a few days afterwards while the memory was still fresh and clear .
Several people have asked whether I already knew about astral projection , and in particular about silver cords .
The answer is that I did .
By then I was becoming seriously interested in psychic phenomena and had begun some reading .
I had heard of astral projection and of some Theosophical ideas , although I did not read most of the classics of astral projection until many years later ( I keep a record of all the books I read ) .
So it is possible that I saw the cord because I knew that it was expected .
In a survey many years later I found that only a few percent of OB Ers see such a cord .
It is not known whether these people already knew about silver cords before their experience .
When I came to write Beyond the Body in 1980 - 1981 I learned much more about the subject .
I now believe that most features of the OBE are explicable in terms of changes in the model of self and perceptual viewpoint , but the silver cord remains unexplained .
My reaction at the time - 1
As I recall , the experience was quite out of the ordinary .
However , memory , especially over thirty years , can be unreliable .
People have asked me whether I may have exaggerated the memory to fit with my later theories , or elaborated it over time to make it seem more impressive .
From the account written afterwards I know that the details are reasonably accurate , but what about my own reaction and the emotional impact at the time ?
From this point of view my diary is interesting .
I have kept a diary every day since 1964 and have just now ( December 2000 ) reread the 1970 diary for the first time for many years ( probably since 1985 when I was writing The Adventures of a Parapsychologist and reread all my diaries ) .
Most day 's entries mention the lectures I went to , whom I had lunch with , rehearsals , society meetings and worrying about work .
November 8th begins " I have the most amazing thing to tell .
Really the most fantastic thing that ever happened in my life .
I went astral traveling .
I was thousands of miles away - not in my body at all . "
I described the intense seance during which " we had some very dubious contacts and got a little scared ! " , how Kevin , Vicki and I then went up to Vicki 's room , and how helpful Kevin was .
I commented that I wanted to write it all down properly as soon as I felt able ( which indeed I did ) .
There is no doubt that the experience affected me deeply at the time .
The effect of the drug
Many , many people have asked me whether the whole experience was a drug - induced hallucination .
Some have dismissed it as " not a real OBE " because I was smoking cannabis at the time .
I have two reactions to this , one academic and one personal .
Academically I can see no reason for dividing OBEs into ' real ' and ' drug- induced ' .
Many studies show overlap between naturally occurring and drug - induced experiences - whether mystical experiences , religious experiences , or OBEs and NDEs .
There may be differences , but there is no clean dividing line .
Also , if one were to reject all experiences during which people had taken drugs we would have to reject all the shamanic practices and ritual inductions of OBEs which are so important in the cultures that use them .
Personally I can say this .
My diary says " We 3 , Kevin , Vicki and I went up to her room to smoke .
I do n't think I really got high at all .
I started off seeing all these hallucinations .
They thought maybe I was tripping I think and after I do n't know how long I realised and Kevin realised that I was Astral traveling .
The white shining cord was there and I went all over the world , and out of the world . " ( terrible punctuation is in the original )
This could be interpreted in many ways , but it is interesting that I said I did not get high - in other words this was not an ordinary cannabis - smoking experience .
As far as I recall the starting point was like vivid hallucinations but then Kevin asked me " Where are you Sue ? " and everything changed - becoming absolutely clear and vivid and stable , and not like any drug - induced experience I had ever had .
Finally , I have had much experience with various drugs .
I must have smoked cannabis several thousand times in my life .
I have never had such an experience before or since .
I suspect that the drug helped me to relax and maybe prevented me from panicking and ending the experience .
Beyond that I suspect it had little relevance - but of course we shall never know .
My reaction at the time - 2
At the time I assumed that my astral body had left my physical body .
I felt wonderfully blessed to have had the experience , and interpreted it as evidence that the mind , or soul , or astral body can leave the physical and travel in some other world .
It also seemed to me to be evidence for the possibility of life after death .
However , even at the time I had some sceptical doubts .
I remember thinking that the star - shaped island with a hundred trees was more like an idea of an island than like a real island .
This led me to develop various theories about the nature of the astral world ( it was thought - created , consisted of ' thought forms ' and so on ) but not to go so far as to doubt the existence of the astral world altogether .
The next day I tried to check up on things I had seen and immediately discovered that some were wrong .
For example , I had ' seen ' old metal gutters on the roofs of the college when in the morning I realised that they were modern white plastic ones .
I had seemed to travel through rooms above Vicki 's room which were not in fact there , and had seen chimneys which did not exist .
This led me to all sorts of sceptical questioning , but more to elaborate my astral theories than to abandon them .
For many years I continued to think of my experience as an astral excursion .
The effect on my life
I do not believe I would ever have become a parapsychologist had I not had this experience .
Yes , I was interested in the paranormal before it happened , but parapsychology did not become an abiding passion until this night .
Afterwards I knew that there were other non-ordinary states of consciousness - other ways of being - that seemed somehow more real , more right , more direct than ordinary life .
This had two effects on me .
One I wanted to repeat the experience , and two I wanted to understand it .
As far as understanding is concerned I assumed , initially , that I had to understand the nature of the astral world and astral travel .
I knew that my lecturers at Oxford would not countenance such ideas and that science in general rejected them utterly .
I assumed that only parapsychology could help and therefore conceived an overwhelming desire to become a parapsychologist and to prove them all wrong .
The story of how I set about to do this , and how I ultimately changed my mind , is told in my autobiography In Search of the Light .
In 1980 I was invited , by the Society for Psychical Research , to write a book about OBEs ( Beyond the Body , Heineman 1982 ) .
I learned much more about the subject and developed my own naturalistic , rather than paranormal , theories about the OBE .
For many years after that I carried out further research , including surveys and experiments , on OBEs .
By then the term ' near - death experience ' had appeared in the literature and I worked on NDEs too , talking to many people who had experienced them .
I became convinced that nothing leaves the body - realistic , important and life - changing as these experiences can be .
As far as repeating the experience is concerned , I worked very hard for many years to induce it again and never succeeded .
Over the years I tried all of the main methods of OBE induction .
Some did not work at all for me , such as the Christos Technique , while others gave me some success .
Using Monroe 's method of inducing vibrations I was able to have brief OBEs but they were nothing like the experience reported here .
Many years later I practised ( and indeed still do ) staying aware while falling asleep .
This can lead to one remaining aware while entering the paralysis of REM sleep - a form of sleep paralysis .
In this state it is possible to imagine moving or floating and thus have an OBE .
Again my OBEs induced this way were very brief .
I have also taken many drugs .
Once or twice I have had brief OBEs when taking LSD , but not with other hallucinogens , amphetamine derivatives ( such as ecstasy ) or ever again with cannabis .
The most effective drug , which I have only had once , was ketamine .
Ketamine is an anaesthetic , not often used for adults because of the unpleasant hallucinations it can cause , but sometimes used for particular reasons with children and animals .
It is also used as a street drug but then is usually taken orally .
I was lucky enough to have a large dose of absolutely pure ketamine , injected under very positive and supportive conditions , with a companion who was especially keen to find out whether it could induce an OBE , as has often been claimed .
Ketamine paralyses the muscles while leaving consciousness more or less intact .
I had just the right dose to ensure that I was completely paralysed but still aware .
This is not very pleasant .
When I was sufficiently paralysed , so that I could not even move my eyes , I seemed to float off with no sense of where my body was .
My companion held up various numbers of fingers out of my line of sight and asked me to say how many I saw .
I did fairly well at this task but he did not record the results or ensure that I had absolutely no way of seeing them .
I then decided to try to visit my home in England and seemed to travel there and saw people cooking in my kitchen .
I recorded what I saw , but when I asked them later I learned that they had not been cooking there at the time .
In any case the experience was nothing like the spontaneous OBE described here .
In particular it did not have that amazing quality of realness and clarity .
Meditation
Many years later I began to realise that it was the clarity of awareness that I wished to find again , not the out - of - body experience itself .
I began learning meditation in about 1975 , but only intermittently .
In 1982 I went on my first Zen retreat , and in 1986 I began to practice mindfulness ( being in the present moment in daily life ) and took up regular daily meditation which I have continued to this day .
I have described some of this in In Search of the Light and in various articles .
Through this practice I have found that the confusion of ordinary awareness can be dropped , or let go , and clarity is simply there .
It is not something to be sought or obtained .
I no longer try to have more OBEs .

These last ten years may have seemed busy to you , but just be glad you 're not a comic book character :
Their decade has seen multiple alien invasions and reboots of reality .
Relive the biggest headlines of their decade with us .

Looking over a decade of superhero storylines , it 's easy to see two things :
The repetition of ideas , and the genre trying to come to grips with what 's happening in the real world ( and often failing badly ) ; just look at the increase of terrorist attacks post - 9/11 .
The headlines below - matched to publication date where possible - may not be exactly how the last ten years played out in the real world , but it 's possibly the way it happened in our collective subconscious .
Well , apart from restarting reality four times , of course .

“ I think it is a sign that progress is being made , that we are getting there , ” said Representative Steve Driehaus of Ohio , one of the Democrats who forced the House to adopt the stricter restrictions in its bill .
The hospitals ’ statement , he said , recognized the Senate ’s compromise as a meaningful step , making him “ optimistic ” that Democrats could find a bill that he and other abortion foes could support .
Other abortion opponents argue that liberals are overstating the hospital association ’s influence .
“ They do n’t carry the same sway , ” said Representative Bart Stupak , the Michigan Democrat who led the effort that resulted in the House bill ’s including a full ban on abortion coverage in any subsidized health insurance plan .
Mr. Stupak said he still had commitments from at least 10 Democrats who voted for the House bill and pledged to vote against the final legislation if it loosened the abortion restrictions  enough to keep the bill from being approved .
“ At the end of the day we are going to have something along the lines of my language , ” he said .
Abortion rights supporters said the signs of openness from Catholic groups were helping some Democratic abortion foes accept the Senate compromise .
“ We have known for quite some time that the Catholic hospitals and also the nuns are really breaking from these hard - line bishops and saying , ‘ This really is our goal : to get more people into health care coverage , ’ ” said Representative Diana DeGette , Democrat of Colorado .
The abortion rights faction of the House Democrats was initially dubious about the Senate bill ’s provision but has warmed up to it after reassurances from their Senate counterparts , Ms. DeGette said .
President Obama and Democratic Congressional leaders say they aim to follow 30 - year - old rules blocking the use of federal money for elective abortions , but lawmakers have fiercely disagreed over how to do so .
Like most Catholic groups , the Catholic Hospital Association has echoed the bishops ’ opposition to any federal financing of abortion in health care proposals .
But its officials also stood at the White House last spring to endorse Mr. Obama ’s plans as part of an administration deal with the hospital industry .
After the Catholic Hospital Association ’s endorsement of the proposed compromise , Catholic conservatives and some abortion opponents accused the group of selling out to the Democrats .
Antidepressant medications taken by roughly 7 % of American adults cause profound personality changes in many patients with depression , far beyond simply lifting the veil of sadness , a study has found .
Researchers saw strong drops in neuroticism and increases in extroversion in patients taking antidepressants , two of five traits thought to define personality and shape a person ’s day - to - day thoughts and behavior .
The findings are striking , researchers said , because psychologists have long thought that such fundamental traits are moorings of an adult ’s personality that shift very little over a lifetime .
The medications would seem to relieve depression by chemically altering brain processes that spawn negative thoughts rather than just alleviating symptoms associated with a depressed state , said Northwestern University psychologist Tony Z. Tang , the lead author of the study .
The findings , published in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health , could have significant implications for depression treatment , researchers not connected with the study said .

It is unclear how long - lasting the changes in personality are , the authors said .
But the study found that patients whose personalities shifted the most were less likely to relapse .
And they said that monitoring those altered traits could be a useful , early gauge of whether a medication is working and how probable a recurrence would be .
The findings are likely to rekindle debate on the impact and effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or SSRIs , on which Americans spent $ 9.6 billion last year alone .
SSRIs increase the availability of serotonin , a key brain chemical , low levels of which are linked to depression .
The trial involved 240 adults with moderate to severe depression .
Of those , 120 were given the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine ( Paxil ) for 16 weeks .
Another 60 received cognitive therapy but no medication for 16 weeks , and 60 others were given a placebo alone for eight weeks .
All subjects who reported improvements in their depression in response to psychotherapy or medication were followed for a year .

Patients who received paroxetine were more likely to have their symptoms ease than patients in the other two groups , and they showed more dramatic personality changes .
Those given placebo pills reported early improvements in their depressive symptoms almost as great as those reported by those on medication , but their underlying personalities “ did n’t budge , ” said Northwestern ’s Tang .
And their relief from depressive symptoms was briefer and more muted than the improvement of those on medication or cognitive therapy .
They were given the antidepressant if their condition failed to improve after eight weeks .
That finding “ pokes a hole ” in the charges of many critics that SSRIs are little more effective at treating depression than sugar pills , said UCLA psychiatrist Andrew Leuchter .
Still , several researchers not involved in the study cautioned that the findings might prompt greater use of medications for which U.S. physicians already write 164.2 million prescriptions a year .
For insurers and healthcare policymakers wary of the high cost of psychotherapy , the study might make the drugs look like a better value .

That would be a mistake , said University of Illinois psychologist Brent Roberts .
Not all depressed patients respond to SSRIs so favorably .
“ And it would be foolish to base policy on the findings of one study , ” he said .
Other studies will be necessary before the cost - effectiveness of different treatments can be established , Roberts added .
The personality changes in the study were striking , researchers said .
While adults typically become slightly less neurotic with age , it is a gradual change .
In the study , experimental subjects who responded to SSRI treatment changed roughly twice as much on the neuroticism scale as most adults do in a lifetime .
And they did so in eight weeks .
“ That is a dramatic change , ” said Robert McCrae , a leading researcher on personality , now retired .
“ If you were these patients or someone in their family , you ’d notice a difference . ”

The study also suggests a new measure to identify people at risk of developing depression and to predict who would benefit most from a particular medication or therapy .
Doctors could refer to a personality inventory that would measure a patient ’s “ big five ” traits -- neuroticism and extroversion , as well as agreeableness , conscientiousness and openness -- to test a patient ’s early response to a drug or psychotherapy .
Such a tool could improve the trial - and - error method of prescribing that is common in the treatment of depression , UCLA ’s Leuchter said .
To drive down the rate of relapse in depression , Tang said , psychiatrists should focus on helping patients achieve fundamental personality changes and not just recover from a current episode of depression .
Roughly half of those treated successfully for the disorder can be expected to suffer a recurrence in the following year .
“ They should be thinking how to prevent relapse -- not just about short - term recovery , which we ’re pretty good at -- as soon as the patient walks through their door , ” Tang said .

Opinion Scientists using a network of ground sensors emplaced in Antarctica say that NASA satellites have overestimated the amount of ice that is melting and running off into the ocean from the polar continent .
The new results come from the West Antarctic GPS Network ( WAGN ) , which uses 18 locator stations " bolted to bedrock outcrops " in the Western antarctic to discover " ground truth " regarding the phenomenon of " postglacial rebound " , where the bedrock lifts as the mile - thick ice sheet atop it diminishes .
Postglacial rebound is important , as NASA 's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) satellites estimate ice loss by measuring regional gravitational forces as they fly overhead .
Both ice loss and bedrock rebound contribute to GRACE grav-scan readings , and according to the WAGN measurements , rebound figures used to estimate ice loss have now been shown to be wrong .
" The take home message is that Antarctica is contributing to rising sea levels .
It is the rate that is unclear , " says Ian Dalziel , lead investigator for WAGN .
The WAGN boffins say they are sure that recent figures for ice loss calculated from GRACE readings have been overestimated , but they are not yet sure by how much .
However , they say that there is no dispute about the fact that ice is disappearing from the antarctic sheet - this process has been underway for 20,000 years , since the thickness peaked during the last " glacial maximum " .
" The published results are very important because they provide precise , ground - truth GPS observations of the actual rebound of the continent , " said Vladimir Papitashvili of the Antarctic Earth Sciences Program at the National Science Foundation , which supported the research .
The results are given in the paper Geodetic Measurements of Vertical Crustal Velocity in West Antarctica and the Implications for Ice Mass Balance , published here in the journal Geochemistry , Geophysics , Geosystems ( subscriber link ) .
There 's also some layman - level exposition from Texas uni here . ®
In this Sunday 's paper , we 've got a never - before - published story by Kurt Vonnegut .
" Look at the Birdie " is the title story of the collection to be released next week , two and a half years after his death .
" I 'm lucky , " Vonnegut told David L. Ulin in 1997 , " that I 'm free to do art , and presumably to keep my soul growing , by finding something else to do .
Participation in the arts -- drawing , dancing , and all that -- makes the soul grow .
That 's why you engage in it .
That 's how you grow a soul . "
When Vonnegut 's masterpiece " Slaughterhouse - Five " was published in 1969 , it was reviewed for the L.A. Times by Harlan Ellison .
Here 's his review :
Functional Programming Does n't Work ( and what to do about it )
Read suddenly and in isolation , this may be easy to misinterpret , so I suggest first reading some past articles which have led to this point :
After spending a long time in the functional programming world , and using Erlang as my go - to language for tricky problems , I 've finally concluded that purely functional programming is n't worth it .
It 's not a failure because of soft issues such as marketing , but because the further you go down the purely functional road the more mental overhead is involved in writing complex programs .
That sounds like a description of programming in general -- problems get much more difficult to solve as they increase in scope -- but it 's much lower - level and specific than that .
The kicker is that what 's often a tremendous puzzle in Erlang ( or Haskell ) turns into straightforward code in Python or Perl or even C .
Imagine you 've implemented a large program in a purely functional way .
All the data is properly threaded in and out of functions , and there are no truly destructive updates to speak of .
Now pick the two lowest - level and most isolated functions in the entire codebase .
They 're used all over the place , but are never called from the same modules .
Now make these dependent on each other : function A behaves differently depending on the number of times function B has been called and vice - versa .
In C , this is easy !
It can be done quickly and cleanly by adding some global variables .
In purely functional code , this is somewhere between a major rearchitecting of the data flow and hopeless .
A second example :
It 's a common compilation technique for C and other imperative languages to convert programs to single - assignment form .
That is , where variables are initialized and never changed .
It 's easy to mechanically convert a series of destructive updates into what 's essentially pure code .
Here 's a simple statement :
if ( a > 0 ) { a ++ ; }
In single - assignment form a new variable is introduced to avoid modifying an existing variable , and the result is rather Erlangy :
if ( a > 0 ) { a 1 = a + 1 ; } else { a 1 = a ; }
The latter is cleaner in that you know variables wo n't change .
They 're not variables at all , but names for values .
But writing the latter directly can be awkward .
Depending on where you are in the code , the current value of whatever " a " represents has different names .
Inserting a statement in the middle requires inventing new names for things , and you need to make sure you 're referencing the right version .
( There 's more room for error now : you do n't just say " a , " but the name of the value you want in the current chain of calculations . )
In both of these examples imperative code is actually an optimization of the functional code .
You could pass a global state in and out of every function in your program , but why not make that implicit ?
You could go through the pain of trying to write in single - assignment form directly , but as there 's a mechanical translation from one to the other , why not use the form that 's easier to write in ?
At this point I should make it clear : functional programming is useful and important .
Remember , it was developed as a way to make code easier to reason about and to avoid " spaghetti memory updates . "
The line between " imperative " and " functional " is blurry .
If a Haskell program contains a BASIC - like domain specific language which is also written in Haskell , is the overall program functional or imperative ?
Does it matter ?
For me , what has worked out is to go down the purely functional path as much as possible , but fall back on imperative techniques when too much code pressure has built up .
Some cases of this are well - known and accepted , such as random number generation ( where the seed is modified behind the scenes ) , and most any kind of I/O ( where the position in the file is managed for you ) .
Learning how to find similar pressure relief valves in your own code takes practice .
One bit of advice I can offer is that going for the obvious solution of moving core data structures from functional to imperative code may not be the best approach .
In the Pac - Man example from Purely Functional Retrogames , it 's completely doable to write that old game in a purely functional style .
The dependencies can be worked out ; the data flow is n't really that bad .
It still may be a messy endeavor , with lots of little bits of data to keep track of , and selectively moving parts out of the purely functional world will result in more manageable code .
Now the obvious target is either the state of Pac - Man himself or the ghosts , but those are part of the core data flow of the program .
Make those globally accessible and modifiable and all of a sudden a large part of the code has shifted from functional to imperative ... and that was n't the goal .
A better approach is to look for small , stateful , bits of data that get used in a variety of places , not just on the main data flow path .
A good candidate in this example is the current game time ( a.k.a. the number of elapsed frames ) .
There 's a clear precedent that time / date functions , such as Erlang 's now ( ) , cover up a bit of state , and that 's what makes them useful .
Another possibility is the score .
It 's a simple value that gets updated in a variety of situations .
Making it a true global counter removes a whole layer of data threading , and it 's simple : just have a function to add to the score counter and another function to retrieve the current value .
No reason to add extra complexity just to dodge having a single global variable , something that a C / Python / Lua / Ruby programmer would n't even blink at .

Well , the London Anarchist bookfair was good .
The new Black Flag ( no. 230 ) sold well – we had the best stall takings for ages .
So hopefully that will have an impact on our printing debts ( looks like we may not only pay off this run but also make a small dent in outstanding monies owned ! ) .
If anyone in the UK is interested in subscribing to Black Flag , it is £ 10 for 4 issues – but remember we come out bi-annually just now .
Our address is :
Black Flag
BM Hurricane
London
WC1N 3XX
United Kingdom
It can also be bought via AK Press UK and will shortly be in Freedom and Housmans Bookshops in London .
I know I ’m biased , but I still think it ’s the best anarcho - magazine in the English - speaking world .
At the very least , the best laid - out ( which is not my responsibility ) .
We are always looking for people to get involved – writing and distribution are always in need of people to chip in … issue 231 will not write itself nor will our printing debts disappear by themselves !
Our email is : blackflagmag@yahoo.co.uk
Managed to get a few interesting bits and pieces , not least a copy of the old pamphlet “ The Poverty of Statism ” ( pdf ) which has Fabbri ’s classic critique of Marxism ( the booklet also has two good Rocker articles ) .
Do yourself a favour , read it .
Unfortunately , I then came down with a nasty bug and so spent most of the next week recovering !
So not much done , which is annoying .
I did manage to go through the introduction to the Proudhon Reader and chop it down considerably ( although I ’ve not had any chance of actually making the cuts yet ! ) .
I ’ve also got most of the outstanding wish - list translations either done or being worked on ( and got an interesting 1849 letter to leading utopian socialist Pierre Leroux added to the contents ! ) .
I ’m going to have to go through what I have in order to bring it down to the word - limit AK Press have agreed … that could be hard as there is lots of good material translated now !
Hopefully the introduction will do the anthology justice .
Suffice to say , it aims to place Proudhon ’s ideas into the evolution of anarchism as a socio- economic theory and movement , showing the obvious links from him to the likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin .
In fact , the new material translated from the 1848 revolution really brings this out , with Bakunin essentially paraphrasing Proudhon ’s works on many key issues .
As did Marx .
As I note in the introduction , he eclipsed Proudhon thanks to two things inspired by the French anarchist .
The IWMA and the Paris Commune .
I ’ve noted before Marx ’s debt to Proudhon in terms of analyzing exploitation and with the Paris Commune Marx essentially appropriated key themes on social organization in The Civil War in France .
All that stuff which Marx praises the Communards for ( mandates , recalled , fusion of legislative and executive powers , federalism , etc. ) ?
All expounded by Proudhon in 1848 and afterward …
Not that the typical Marxist knows this , having read the likes of that numpty Hal Draper and Lenin ’s State and Revolution …
One thing I ’ve discovered is that a lot of research needs to be done on this period , particularly the 1848 revolution in France .
Hopefully the material I ’ve got translated for the anthology will provoke interest in this subject – particularly as it really does explain a lot about the evolution of anarchism .
As do the debates in the IWMA and the Commune .
As I was saying to Andrew Flood at the bookfair , I seem to be turning into an anarcho - historian !
Still , looks like I ’ll be attending a lot of union meetings soon as the management are seeking to impose cuts on us … yet more stuff to do !
Anyways , here is the chapter on Proudhon ’s legacy in the First International .
It should help indicate that the main debates within the organisation were between people inspired by Proudhon and reflected his ideas and , indeed , terminology .
The notion that it was “ Marxists ” against “ Proudhonists ” as regards “ collectivisation ” is misleading , as is the notion that the debate involved collective ownership as such .
Rather , it was about collective ownership of land .
All sides agreed on the need for public ownership of capital – and all the libertarians agreed on the necessity of abolishing wage labour !
In this , they followed Proudhon – and given that Proudhon proclaimed the land common for all , it is fair to say that the so - called collectivists were hardly alien to his legacy on this issue !
Until I blog again , be seeing you …
International Workingmen ’s Association
While the International Workingmen ’s Association ( IWMA ) is usually , these days , most associated with Marx .
In fact , it was created by British trade unionists and “ French mutualist workingmen , who in turn were direct followers of Pierre - Joseph Proudhon ” ( “ Contrary to stubborn legend , Karl Marx was not one of its actual founders ” ) .
[ 1 ]
The negotiations that lead to its founding in 1864 began in 1862 when the Proudhonists ( including Henri- Louis Tolain [ 2 ] and Eugene Varlin [ 3 ] ) visited the London International Exhibition . [ 4 ]
Marx simply , and fortuitously , turned up to the founding meeting in 1864 after being invited by some German socialist exiles .
Like Proudhon , his followers in the IWMA thought workers “ should be striving for the abolition of salaried labour and capitalist enterprise . ”
This was by means of co-operatives and their “ perspective was that of artisan labour . . .
The manager / employer ( patron ) was a superfluous element in the production process who was able to deny the worker just compensation for his labour merely by possessing the capital that paid for the workshop , tools , and materials . ” [ 5 ]
As G.D.H.
Cole puts it , the French Internationalists , including Varlin , were “ strongly hostile to centralisation .
They were federalists , intent on building up working - class organisations on a local basis and them federating the local federations .
The free France they looked forward was to be a country made up of locally autonomous communes , freely federated for common purposes which required action over larger areas . . .
In this sense they were Anarchists . ” [ 6 ]
Perhaps unsurprisingly , then , that in 1866 the International officially adopted the Red Flag as its symbol , so confirming Proudhon that “ the red flag represents the final revolution . . .
The red flag is the federal standard of humanity ! ” [ 7 ]
Given their role in setting up the organisation , the Proudhonists dominated the agenda in the first years of the International .
According to the standard , usually Marxist or Marxist - influenced , accounts of the International this initial domination by the Proudhonists was eclipsed by the rise of a collectivist current ( usually identified with Marxism ) .
This is not entirely true .
Yes , the Basel Congress of 1869 saw the apparent success of a collectivist motion which was opposed by Tolain and some of his fellow French Internationalists , but this was fundamentally a debate between followers of Proudhon on the specific issue of agricultural collectivisation rather than a rejection of “ Proudhonism ” as such .
As one historian notes :
“ The endorsement of collectivism by the International at the Basel Congress might appear to be a rejection of the French position on co-operatives .
Actually , it was not , for collectivism as it was defined by its proponents meant simply the end of private ownership of agricultural land .
Lumped together with this was usually the demand for common ownership of mines and railways . ” [ 8 ]
Thus it was “ not a debate over co-operative production in favour of some other model ” but rather its extension to agriculture .
After all , at the Geneva Congress of 1866 the Proudhonists “ persuaded the Congress to agree by unanimous vote that there was a higher goal -- the suppression of ‘ salaried status ’ – which . . . could be done only through co-operatives . ”
At the Lausanne Congress of 1867 , the Proudhonists around Tolain “ acknowledged the necessity of public ownership of canals , roads , and mines ” and there was “ unanimous accord ” on public ownership of “ the means of transportation and exchange of goods -- that is , roads , canals , and railways . ”
As seen , this was Proudhon ’s position as well .
The proponents of collectivisation at the Lausanne Congress wanted to “ extend Tolain ’s ideas to all property . ” [ 9 ]
While the resolution on collectivisation “ represents the final decisive defeat of the strict Proudhonist element which , centred in Paris , had dominated in France and had drawn the parameters of the debates at the International ’s congresses in the beginning , ” [ 10 ] this did not automatically mean the end of Proudhonian influences in the International .
After all , the main leader of the “ collectivist ” position was César De Paepe was a self - proclaimed Mutualist and follower of Proudhon .
As such , the debate was fundamentally one between followers of Proudhon , not between Proudhonists and Marxists , and the resolution was not inconsistent with Proudhon ’s ideas .
This can be seen from the fact that resolution itself was remarkably Proudhonian in nature , with the resolution on collective property urging the collectivisation of roads , canals , railways , mines , quarries , collieries and forests , to be “ ceded to ‘ workers ’ companies ’ which would guarantee the ‘ mutual rights ’ of workers and would sell their goods or services at cost . ”
The land would “ be turned over to ‘ agricultural companies ’ ( i.e. , agricultural workers ) with the same guarantees as those required of the ‘ workers ’ companies ’ ” [ 11 ]
De Paepe himself clarified the issue : “ Collective property would belong to society as a whole , but would be conceded to associations of workers .
The State would be no more than a federation of various groups of workers . ” [ 12 ]
Given that Proudhon had advocated such workers ’ companies to run publically owned industries as well as arguing the land was common property and transferred to communes , the resolution was not the rejection of Proudhon ’s ideas that many assume .
As Daniel Guérin suggested , “ in the congresses of the First International the libertarian idea of self - management prevailed over the statist concept . ” [ 13 ]
Moreover , at Basel Congress of 1869 “ Bakunin emerged as the main champion of collectivism . ” [ 14 ]
As Kropotkin suggested :
“ As to his economical conceptions , Bakunin described himself , in common with his Federalist comrades of the International ( César De Paepe , James Guillaume , Schwitzguébel ) , a ‘ collectivist anarchist ’ . . . to express a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes , while the ways of retribution of labour , communist or otherwise , would be settled by each group for itself . ” [ 15 ]
So while “ there was no division between the ‘ Bakuninist ’ and Marx ’s supporters over the necessity of collectivisation , ” [ 16 ] it should be stressed that the dispute centred wholly around the collectivisation of agricultural property ( after all , at the Brussels Congress De Paepe had “ reminded Tolain and other opponents of collective property that they were in favour of collectivising mines , railroads , and canals ” [ 17 ] ) .
That the IWMA resolved that land was to be managed by “ societies of agricultural workers ” [ 18 ] can be considered a logical fusion of Proudhon ’s arguments on land ownership and workers ’ associations .
As such , the rise of the collectivists in the IWMA does not represent a defeat for Proudhon ’s ideas . [ 19 ]
Rather , it reflected a development of those ideas produced by debates between socialists heavily influenced by the Frenchman ’s ideas .
This is obscured by the fact that Proudhon ’s ideas on the necessity of workers ’ associations are not well know .
So , once this is understood , it is easy to see that it was in the IWMA that Proudhon ’s mutualist ideas evolved into collectivist and then communist anarchism ( most famously associated with Bakunin and Kropotkin , respectively ) .
The main areas of change centred on means ( reform verses revolution ) and so the need for strikes , unions and other forms of collective working class direct action and organisation rather than the goal of a federated , associated , self - managed socialist society .
As G.D.H.
Cole perceptively writes , Varlin “ had at bottom a great deal more in common with Proudhon than with Marx ” and had a “ Syndicalist outlook . ” [ 20 ]
Like Bakunin , Varlin argued that unions have “ the enormous advantage of making people accustomed to group life and thus preparing them for a more extended social organisation .
They accustom people not only to get along with one another and to understand one another , but also to organise themselves , to discuss , and to reason from a collective perspective . ”
Again , like Bakunin , Varlin argued that unions also “ form the natural elements of the social edifice of the future ; it is they who can be easily transformed into producers associations ; it is they who can make the social ingredients and the organisation of production work . ” [ 21 ]
Thus , by 1868 “ a transition from mutualism to ‘ antistatist ’ or ‘ antiauthoritarian collectivism ’ had began . ” [ 22 ]
Such developments are to be expected .
Just as Proudhon developed and changed his ideas in the face of changing circumstances and working class self - activity , so working class people influenced by his ideas developed and changed what they took from Proudhon in the face of their own circumstances .
However , the core ideas of anti-statism and anti-capitalism , remained and so these changes must be viewed as a development of Proudhon ’s ideas rather than something completely new or alien to them .
Thus the revolutionary anarchism of Bakunin and Kropotkin which grew within the IWMA has distinct similarities to that of Proudhon ’s reformist kind , even if it disagrees on certain issues .
Needless to say , the IWMA did not become “ Marxist ” until the gerrymandered Hague Congress of 1872 approved the expulsion of Bakunin and imposed the necessity of “ political action ” ( i.e. , standing for elections to capture political power ) upon the organisation .
It promptly collapsed , although the libertarian sections ( such as Belgium , Spain and Italy ) successfully organised their own IWMA congresses until 1877 .

This shows how wrong Bernard H. Moss was to assert the standard Marxist version that the French Internationalists proposed “ an associationist strategy for socialism that was the very opposite of Proudhonism ” and that “ collectivist implications of this movement were drawn by French labour delegates ” were somehow at odds with Proudhon ’s ideas .
That “ the International repeatedly urged trade societies to set up associations as means of socialist transformation ” was something close to the heart of Proudhon , as was the fact that the French delegates “ gave their imprimatur to the collectivisation of industry within a federation of trades and workers ’ communes . ”

Either “ Avatar ” takes the weekend box office , or we ’re all in big trouble
Variety has gone behind a pay wall .
Jolly Carl DiOrio of The Hollywood Reporter is either taking a night off or filing later .
Still , this is one week when , if I may paraphrase Bob Dylan , I do n’t need a weatherman to tell me which way the wind ’s blowing .
As a science - fiction adventure sure - to - be blockbuster , James Cameron ‘s “ Avatar ” has pretty much everything going for : huge ballyhoo , much of its centered on its groundbreaking use on “ performance capture ” ( not mere motion capture ) and what everyone seems to be describing as a new and more immersive 3 - D , strong advance sales ( skewing male as of right now ) , and solid reviews .
Sure , it ’s actors are n’t precisely A - listers , but we all know what good stars are these days .
I ’m sure people will eventually remember that Sam Worthington , Zoe Saldana , and Sigourney Weaver were in there some place .
The latest from James Cameron at this point has racked up an 82 % “ fresh ” on the Tomatometer and a whopping 96 % from the usually harder to please “ top critics , ” with only Village Voice ‘s exacting J. Hoberman submitting a mildly negative review that is actually about as positive as a bad review can be .
Our own Jamey Codding is positive , but not quite ecstatic .
Ken Turan , a critic I respect but often disagree with for his rather schoolmarmish tastes — do n’t get him started on Tarantino — waxes poetic and compares the technical breakthroughs to “ The Jazz Singer . ”
I personally hope that is n’t quite the case .
3 - D is cool as an occasional treat , but I just do n’t see how it ’s necessary for every movie .
Of course , there were people who said that about sound movies too , but do n’t laugh too much because there are still people who thought they were right !
( Not me .
Being a word guy , I like talkies .
My fogeyosity has limits )
In any case , Roger Ebert might be summing things up nicely when he writes :
There is still at least one man in Hollywood who knows how to spend $ 250 million , or was it $ 300 million , wisely .
So , we know that “ Avatar ” will , baring apocalypse or a mass , blindness - inducing plague , win the weekend .
The real question is , by how much ?
Well , considering it ’s opening in 3,453 theaters and probably taking up nearly every higher priced regular size and Imax 3 - D screen in the country , I ’d say the sky is the limit for the moment .
Beyond that , I really do n’t have the kind of information to make these kind of assertions , but fortunately there is Daniel Frankel of The Wrap who says that the gurus have agreed the Fox film will do over $ 60 million at least and possibly as much as $ 90 or $ 100 million .
As for the long term prospects over the coming weeks and months for “ Avatar , ” as far as I can tell there ’s now reason to expect anything but some large degree of success .
The good reviews , I think , bode well for far stronger than average word - of - mouth for an effects - laden blockbuster .
Indeed , as word gets out of the film ’s love story , more females will likely want to check this one out .
Of course , as with Cameron ’s extremely female - friendly “ Titanic , ” a backlash of some sort is inevitable .
“ Titanic ” is probably the most hated widely beloved movie ever made , though that sure did n’t hurt its commercial or Oscar prospects .
I sort of suspect that wo n’t be the case here , but given the “ Dances with Wolves ” - style story and scenes that are being seen as referencing the more venal lowlights of the Bush Administration , some blowback and / or beneficial controversy from Sarah Palin ’s idea of “ real America ” may be in the cards .
Still , this is the movies and spectacle always trumps ideology .
According to Frankel , the really good news for James Cameron and company is that they have most of the nation ’s 3 - D screens to themselves until March .
He ’s a got a huge budget to recoup , but something tells me things will be just fine for Cameron .
There is another wide release this weekend and , with its appeal to adult women , “ Did You Hear About the Morgans ? ” should theoreticaly have some counter - programming hopes for Sony and Relativity Media .
However , I have a theory that movies with complete sentences for titles almost never do very well .
In fact , things do n’t appear to be too rosy for this marital comedy in which Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker are an unhappy married couple whose marriage is given a new lease on life when they wind up in witness protection .
Forecasters are not bullish and the film is expected , as per Daniel Frankel , to make only about $ 8 million .
The problem appears to be that people do n’t think it ’s funny .
My PH colleague Jason Zingale certainly does n’t seem to have found much to laugh about .
Perhaps aided by ever - lowering standards for rom-coms , the last film that teamed Hugh Grant and writer - director Marc Lawrence , the just kond of okay “ Music and Lyrics , ” did surprisingly well with RT ’s “ Cream of the Crop ” critics especially .
“ The Morgans ” however , have so far generated a pretty lousy Rotten Tomatoes rating of 11 % .
Michael Phillips of “ At the Movies ” and the Chicago Tribune has my favorite RT pull quote of the week :
It ’s not just the sound of crickets you hear watching this movie .
It ’s the sound of dead crickets .
I guess that ’s like the sound of one hand , not clapping .
“ Morgans ” appeals to an older audience that , while not likely directly swayed by reviews , is a bit more discriminating with their movie going dollar .
Let ’s just say that , things are looking very , very good right now for “ The Princess and the Frog ” to hit the # 2 spot this week .
There ’s some Oscar activity — to widely varying degrees — in limited release .
“ Precious , ” “ Up in the Air , ” “ The Road , ” and “ Me and Orson Welles ” are expanding to 1003 , 396 , 175 , and 134 screens respectively .
The first two films ’
Oscar hopes at this point seem a lot stronger than the latter ’s .
Rob Marshall ’s highly touted Fellini - via - Broadway musical adaptation , “ Nine ” will show up in three theaters while the country music drama “ Crazy Heart ” with Jeff Bridges — definitely the man to beat this year so far for the Best Actor Oscar — will play in four houses .
And , for aging romantics and the fogeyish - in - heart comes a historical romantic costume drama , “ The Young Victoria , ” opening in 44 theaters .
Oscar hopes are pinned on the lovely Emily Blunt in the title role .
On Friday , Microsoft issued a warning that as of December 11 , 2009 , customers using Microsoft Office 2003 have been unable to open or save Office 2003 documents protected with the Rights Management Service ( RMS ) .
On Saturday , the software giant released the following hotfixes for the issue : Office Client ( KB978551 ) , Word Viewer ( KB978558 ) , and Excel Viewer ( KB978557 ) .
Office 2003 SP3 is required , though Microsoft recommends that only users who are experiencing the problem install the updates .
If you do n't have the patch installed , when trying to open RMS documents using Office 2003 , the following error message pops up instead : " Unexpected error occurred .
Please try again later or contact your system administrator . "
The problem has just reared its head , over six years after the productivity suite was released , since a related Information Rights Management ( IRM ) certificate has only now expired .
Microsoft confirmed that Office 2003 products used in conjunction with RMS are all affected , including Word 2003 , Excel 2003 , PowerPoint 2003 , and Outlook 2003 .
The good news is that Office 2007 and Office 2010 Beta are not affected and neither are earlier versions of Office ( only 2003 and up support RMS ) .
The software giant posted the following message on the Office Sustained Engineering blog on Friday : " We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and we will provide customers a solution as soon as we can .
Any new updates and we will post the information here . "
On Saturday , the blog announced that " The issue of the inability to open Office 2003 documents protected with RMS has now been resolved with a hotfix . "
RMS is an information protection technology that works only with RMS - enabled applications to help safeguard digital information from unauthorized use .
It uses encryption and a form of selective functionality denial for limiting access to documents and the operations authorized users can perform on them .
RMS is often used to encrypt information stored in document formats and limit specific operations like printing , copying , editing , forwarding , and deleting .
Policies embedded in the documents then prevent the content from being decrypted except by specified groups of people , in certain environments , under certain conditions , and for certain periods of time .
In short , the technology is targeted at large businesses , so chances are if you have Office 2003 at home , you 're not using RMS and therefore need not worry .
While Microsoft has not disclosed how many users are experiencing this problem , it is clear that the bug is stopping authorized users from opening their own protected documents , which is a huge embarrassment to the software giant .
Thankfully , the company managed to get a fix out in under 48 hours .

Anti-psychotic drugs do not benefit many dementia patients Needless use of anti-psychotic drugs is widespread in dementia care and contributes to the death of many patients , an official review suggests .
About 180,000 patients a year are given the drugs in care homes , hospitals and their own homes to manage aggression .
But the expert review - commissioned by ministers - said the treatment was unnecessary in nearly 150,000 cases and was linked to 1,800 deaths .
The government in England has agreed to take steps to reduce use of the drugs .
These include : Improving access to other types of therapy , such as counselling
Better monitoring of prescribing practices
Guidance for families explaining what they can do if they are worried about drug use
Specialist training in dementia for health and social care staff
Appointment of a new national director for dementia to oversee the measures
The review - and the government pledge to take action - comes after long - running concerns about the use of anti-psychotic drugs .
Over the past 30 years , the NHS has increasingly turned to the treatment , which was originally aimed at people with schizophrenia , as it has struggled to cope with the rise in people with dementia .
' Different mindset '
There are currently 700,000 people in the UK with the condition , but this is expected to rise to one million in the next 10 years because of the ageing population .
The review , led by King 's College London expert Professor Sube Banerjee , accepted that for some people anti-psychotic drugs would be necessary .
But it said they should be used only for a maximum of three months and when the person represented a risk to themselves or others .
Professor Banerjee estimated that of the 180,000 people given the drugs each year , only 36,000 benefited .
He said health and social care services needed to develop a " different mindset " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He believes if the steps the government has agreed to are followed , anti-psychotic drug use could be reduced by two - thirds within three years .
Care services minister Phil Hope agreed action was needed .
" We know there are situations where anti-psychotic drug use is necessary - we 're not calling for a ban , but we do want to see a significant reduction in use . "
Neil Hunt , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Society , said the long - awaited review was a welcome recognition of the scale of the problem .
He added : " This goes beyond quality of care .
It is a fundamental rights issue .
" Our members tell us of enormous worry and distress over what is happening to their loved ones . "
The Royal College of GPs - in most cases the drugs are prescribed by family doctors - admitted the situation was " unacceptable " .
President Dr Steve Field said : " People deserve much better . "
While the review was commissioned by the government in England , ministers elsewhere in the UK have agreed to study the recommendations .

" The essential nature of the material world is not material ; the essential nature of the physical world is not physical ; the essential stuff of the universe is non-stuff . "
With these words , spiritual guru Dr Deepak Chopra explained the fundamental nature of the universe and argued that modern science has much to learn from the Vedic worldview and its associated mathematics .
Chopra was speaking at the Indian Astrology Conference , organised by the
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan at the Reeves Great Hall at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York on December 18 and 19 .
He was the chief guest .
Admitting that he lacked the wisdom some of those attending might have , given that his training was in endocrinology , Chopra spoke of how he had come to realise -- in spite of his medical training -- that Western medicine was straitjacketed by reductionism .
That , he said , was when he began to look into Vedanta .
" Western science is still frozen in an obsolete , Newtonian worldview that is based literally on superstition -- and we can call it the superstition of materialism -- which says you and I are physical entities of the physical universe , " he said .
He cited the origin of consciousness as one of two most important mysteries for science .
For the last 300 years , he said , scientists have believed that consciousness is a product of our brains .
But in fact , he said , the more the brain is studied , the more elusive consciousness becomes .
Describing the problem of perception , Chopra pointed at a red band on the edge of the banner for the conference , saying that nothing red was coming from the band to the viewer 's eyes ; it was just frequencies that the brain interpreted as red .
" Is the colour red there or in your consciousness , " Chopra asked , answering
the question himself , " This is a fundamental misunderstanding  that perception is in the brain .
It 's not in the brain ; perception is in consciousness .
All our thoughts are in consciousness , all our imagination is in consciousness , all our cognition is in consciousness .
Everything that we call reality is in consciousness .
Everything !
There 's nothing outside consciousness .
And no one can find this consciousness .
And the reason they can't find consciousness is because they are looking in the wrong place , " he said .
Chopra said that good scientists --- such as Amit Goswami , a retired theoretical nuclear physicist and member of The University of Oregon Institute for Theoretical Physics , and Hans - Peter Durr , a physicist , philosopher and the former vice executive director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics -- agreed that ' the universe is made up of subatomic vibrations that are going on and off at the speed of light . '
He said the real universe could be viewed through Jyotish ( astrology ) but not through the distorted lens of perception .
" Past , present and future are actually one phenomenon , one picture , one reality , one consciousness . "
Chopra said , adding that this explains simultaneity in the universe .
He said this held true for biological organisms , too :
The hundred trillion cells in the human body were more than the number of stars in the Milky Way and performed a hundred trillion activities every second .
" Every cell instantly knows what is happening in every other cell , in fact , in the whole universe , " Chopra said .
Others who spoke at the conference were Vedic astrologer Chakrapani Ullal , who gave a historical perspective of astrology in the East and West , astrologer Raj Kumar Sharma , palmist Rakesh Sharma and physician and author T I Radhakrishnan .
The event hosted some panel discussions , including those on the scientific basis for and the practical aspects of astrology .
A press release described Jyotish as an ancient system that is one of the six auxiliaries of the Vedas developed to explain the movements of planets , sub -planets etc on the universe at large .
Dr Uma Mysorekar , president of the Hindu Temple Society of North , was the guest of honour .
A " breathing chair " designed by Yu- Ying Wu , a graduate from the Department of Industrial Design at the Taiwan - based Tatung University , was submitted to the international " red dot design award " design competition and won the home furniture design concept award .
Wu is scheduled to receive the award next month in Singapore , according to the report by Taiwan - based United Daily News ( UDN ) .
The " breathing chair " is square when unoccupied
The " breathing chair " becomes an armchair
when a person sits on it .
The " breathing chair " looks like a piece of white , square tofu .
Wu said that the chair is made of high - density foam plastic that is 100 percent environmentally - friendly .
There is a " trick " behind the design of various sizes of holes in the chair – based on professional calculation of the spatial structure , the tofu - shaped chair , coated with three layers of foamed plastic , can " automatically adjust " according to the weight and posture of the person sitting on it .

Sepp Blatter has revealed his support for Thierry Henry in the wake of his controversial handball .
Fifa president not critical of striker over handball
Fifa president Sepp Blatter has revealed his support for Thierry Henry in the wake of the France striker 's controversial handball .
Henry set up the goal that secured victory for Les Bleus in their World Cup play - off against Republic of Ireland earlier this month .
The goal should have been disallowed after Henry used his hand to control the ball before crossing for William Gallas to head home .
Henry admitted after the game that it was handball but he has received fierce criticism for his actions and for not telling the referee immediately .
Blatter has now broken his silence over the incident , withnewspaper reporting that he phoned Henry following the match to offer his backing .
" ( Henry ) was honest by admitting that he did use his hand , but it was n't his responsibility to tell the referee , " the French newspaper quotes Blatter as saying .
" The referee should have taken the time to reflect rather than immediately awarding the goal . "

One of the biggest hindrances to the development of fuel cell technology is its cost .
In order to work properly , polymer electrolyte fuel cells require a catalyst .
So far , though , the most efficient catalyst for use with these fuel cells is platinum .
And , as you probably know , platinum is one of the most expensive materials out there .
The high cost of platinum is stunting the further development of fuel cells for use on a broader basis .
Help may be coming , however , in the form of niobium and titanium .
A Japanese company , Showa Denko , has developed a catalyst meant for polymer electrolyte fuel cells that use niobium and titanium as the main components , with the addition of carbon and nitrogen .
A catalyst made from the new blend could replace platinum catalysts in the fuel cells .
These new catalysts also have the advantage of not oxidizing , as platinum does in the air electrode .
And , of course , both niobium and titanium are less expensive than platinum .
Everything is n't set , however .
Catalysts based on niobium or titanium have not shown the same level of performance in fuel cells as platinum .
Nikkei Electronics Asia reports on the performance issues faced by Showa Denko :
" Platinum performance is still four or five times higher , " says a source at Showa Denko .
The firm joined the NEDO project in July 2008 , and says there is still considerable room for improvement .
For example , the catalyst particles are large at about 40nm , but they expect performance to rise with smaller particle sizes .
Even with some of the kinks to be worked out , though , this is still a step forward for fuel cell technology .
Being able to reduce the cost of fuel cells would enable the technology to be more widely adopted going forward .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. bailout watchdog has her eye on the “ pay czar ” charged with vetting the packages of some of Wall Street ’s top earners .
Congressional Oversight Panel for TARP Chairman Elizabeth Warren briefs reporters on the latest news of her agency , which oversees the government 's disbursement of billions of dollars to U.S. banks and the auto industry by the Troubled Assets Relief Program , at the Reuters Financial Regulation Summit in Washington April 27 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mike Theiler
Elizabeth Warren , head of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the government ’s financial bailout program , is intent on ensuring taxpayers get to see how their money may be adding zeroes to those paychecks .
Warren told Reuters she is pleased the government ’s pay czar , Kenneth Feinberg , is planning to publicly release his rulings on the contracts for the top 25 earners at firms that have received the biggest government bailouts .
But she wants more .
She said Feinberg has an obligation to detail how taxpayer dollars are being used to pay key workers at bailed out firms .
“ If , as he says , he wants the rulings to serve as a model , there needs to be full accountability for his decisions and a clear understanding of the metrics and goals he ’s using , ” she told Reuters on Friday .
Feinberg , during speaking engagements over the past couple weeks , has said he will avoid putting specific names next to dollars when revealing his decisions .
Feinberg has talked of the difficulty of giving the public enough information to judge the validity of his decisions , while protecting employees who do not want their neighbors knowing their salaries .
Warren said the former concern outweighs the latter but declined to say if names should be attached to specific amounts .
“ I think that when companies are asking for taxpayer help , the expectations of privacy change , ” she said .
“ They no longer operate in a world in which their pay decisions are relevant only to the shareholders of the company , ” she said .
Feinberg did not have an immediate response to a request for comment .
Warren , a Harvard law professor who has gained a reputation for grilling top policymakers while maintaining a sunny disposition , and her panel , have oversight responsibilities for Feinberg ’s activities as the pay czar .
Her staff met with Feinberg ’s staff in June and has recently been trying to arrange another briefing .
Feinberg is operating out of an office at the U.S. Treasury Department with a handful of Treasury employees , a few people from his private practice Feinberg Rozen , and a couple academic consultants .
He is not being paid a salary for his work as pay czar but is operating with a budget from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Feinberg is in the middle of a 60 - day window to approve or renegotiate the pay contracts for the highest earners at seven firms that have received large taxpayer bailouts , including Bank of America , Citigroup and American International Group .
The other firms are Chrysler , General Motors , GMAC and Chrysler Financial .
IN the Mumbai kindergarten my son went to , the children never had to clean up after themselves ; that was the servants ’ job .
So I really liked the school my son attended when we moved back to Brooklyn , where the teachers made the children tidy up at the end of the day .
“ Cleanup time , cleanup time ! ” my 6 - year - old sang , joyfully gathering his scraps .
It ’s a wonderful American tradition : you always clean up the mess you made .
This is the 25th anniversary of the Bhopal gas disaster , an epic mess that started one night when a pesticide plant owned by the American chemical giant Union Carbide leaked a cloud of poisonous gas .
Before the sun rose , almost 4,000 human beings capable of love and anguish sank to their knees and did not get up .
Half a million more fell ill , many with severely damaged lungs and eyes .
An additional 15,000 people have since died from the aftereffects , and 10 to 30 people are said to die every month from exposure to the hundreds of tons of toxic waste left over in the former factory .
But amazingly , the site still has not been cleaned up , because Dow Chemical , which since acquired Union Carbide , refuses to accept any responsibility .
The groundwater is contaminated ; children of the survivors suffer from genetic abnormalities ; and the victims have long since run out of their measly compensation and are begging on the streets .
I have traveled to Bhopal and seen the post - apocalyptic devastation , seen the sick , seen the factory .
Methyl isocyanate is a deadly chemical used to kill insects .
The night that 40 tons of it wafted out of the factory is , for the survivors , a fulcrum in time , marking the before and after in their lives .
They still talk about “ the gas ” as if it were an organism they know well  how it killed buffalo and pigs , but spared chickens ; how it traveled toward Jahangirabad and Hamidia Road , while ignoring other parts of the city ; how it clung to the wet earth in some places but hovered at waist level in others ; how it blackened all the leaves of a peepul tree ; how they could watch it move down the other side of the road , like a rain cloud seen from a sunny spot .
A Delaware deer survived being struck by a car with such an impact that it was , well , a deer caught in headlights , only to dodge a poacher ’s gunshots upon release .
Miraculously , the deer was uninjured in both incidents .
A driver struck the lucky buck at about 9 p.m. Saturday on Route 9 near Rodgers Manor , said police .
The deer became lodged in the front grill and the motorist drove the deer , still stuck inside the bumper , to New Castle Police headquarters .
Police and the Delaware SPCA tranquilized the creature and removed it from the front of the car .
Officers then brought the slumbering deer to the area of Quigly Farm and waited for it to wake up .
Once the deer was awake , police stood by on the dirt road making sure that the deer was alert enough to run into the woods safely .
Suddenly a white SUV pulled up to the shoulder of the road , and police heard gunshots “ whizzing ” past their vehicle .
Thinking the driver of the SUV was shooting at them , police pursued the vehicle and arrested the driver an hour later , said Lt. Adam Brams .
In the man ’s car they found two shotguns , 20 shotgun rounds and three spent rounds , all of which he illegally possessed .
The man also had night vision binoculars .
The 31 - year - old told police he was trying to shoot the just - released deer -- not the officers , said Brams .
Police arrested Victor L. Bryson of New Castle on charges of two counts reckless endangerment , two counts possession of a firearm by a person prohibited , possession of ammunition by a person prohibited and driving with a suspended license .
Bryson is being held at the Young Correctional Facility on $ 34,000 bond , pending preliminary hearing .
The deer is prancing around the woods unharmed , pending its next encounter with cars and poachers .

The Lakeview - Fort Oglethorpe High School football team took to the field for Friday night 's game with a show of solidarity , bursting through a banner held by the school 's cheerleaders as they always do , only this banner had no biblical verse on it .
The Warriors used to begin each home game by crashing through a gigantic banner bearing an inspirational quotation from the Bible , such as " In God I have put my trust .
I shall not be afraid . "
Staring shortly after Sept. 11 , 2001 to boost community spirit , it had become a popular tradition at this school tucked away in the Northwestern corner of Georgia .
That tradition was abruptly ended last week after the parent of one of the football players told the superintendent someone might file a lawsuit over it .
The superintendent agreed .
" It broke my heart to have to tell those girls that they could not display that message on the football field .
It was hard to be the bearer of bad news .
This is the law , and we will follow the law , " said Denia Reese , superintendent for Catoosa County public schools .
Religious banners on the fields may be banned , but in the stands , there were signs of support and , on some , messages of defiance .
Students brought hand - made stands bearing statements such as " You can take Him off the field , but you 'll never take Him out of our hearts , " while some students came to the game wearing body paint with religious themes .
The players themselves paused for a pre-game prayer on the sidelines .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that a pre-game prayer over the public address system at a high school in Texas was unconstitutional because it amounted to an endorsement of religion , a violation of the First Amendment which prohibits any law " respecting an establishment of religion . "
The school 's superintendent believes that because the banners were on the school 's field and held by the cheerleaders for the players to run through , it gave the impression the school was endorsing a religion .
The signs and messages from those in the stands are acceptable because they 're viewed as personal expressions of faith .
Mayor Says Kids Never Intended to Offend Anyone
Donna Jackson , the mother who filed the complaint , said she never complained about the signs , but was only looking out for the school district and the possibility that it or its personnel could be sued .
" I did call the superintendent to express concern that the cheerleaders ' sign be done in such a way that all involved were within the ever - changing and very confusing lines drawn by the federal courts about such things , " she said in a text statement .
" The students and the cheerleaders , the football players , we all -- as a student organization -- want to do it , " said Zack Lewis , a Lakeview - Fort Oglethorpe football player .
" Not just the teachers , but the students and the whole community . "
Students and faculty are n't the only ones disappointed by the school board 's decision .
Community members are also speaking out over the banners no longer being allowed at the high school football games .
On " Good Morning America Weekend , " Fort Oglethorpe Mayor Ronnie Cobb expressed his support for the students who brought the religious message into the stands Friday night .
" I applaud them , support them and the entire community and most of the nation now is behind them , " he said .
Rob Boston , of the group Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , counters , " These cheerleaders with their religious banners that quote from the Bible are definitely in violation of that long - standing rule .
My advice to them would be if you want to promote religious , do that at your church , not in your public school . "
Playing without their traditional banner , the Warriors ended up losing the game by a score of 34 to zero .
The game may have ended in disappointment for sports fans , but Mayor Cobb insists the community still came out on top .
" I would love to see in the future the possibility of banners coming back , " he said .
" I do n't want it to be offensive to anyone , and these kids do n't either .
It was n't their intent to start with .
It 's a show of solidarity of the community . "
People still do it for that sense of group approval :
SuÂ­iÂ­cide atÂ­tacksâ€ ” today most ofÂ­ten asÂ­soÂ­ciÂ­atÂ­ed with acts against AmerÂ­iÂ­cans or IsÂ­raelis by MusÂ­limsâ€ ” seem to be one asÂ­pect of a widÂ­er pheÂ­nomÂ­eÂ­non in which colÂ­lecÂ­tive reÂ­liÂ­gious ritÂ­uÂ­al fosÂ­ters a mindÂ­set known as paÂ­roÂ­chiÂ­al alÂ­truÂ­ism , acÂ­cordÂ­ing to psyÂ­cholÂ­oÂ­gists .

World Science
Рыжая мачеха с большой попой не раздеваясь дала в ана л
In the introduction to Last Chance – Preserving Life on Earth , author Larry J. Schweiger , the CEO of the National Wildlife Federation , comes right out and says that he ’s not trying to change minds with this book .
Instead , it ’s his hope that the book will motivate millions of people to transform their concerns over global warming into activism .
There are three sections to the book that can be summarized as follows .
First , the latest science says that disruptions due to climate change will be worse and happen faster than the best estimates of even a couple of years ago .
Second , there are a few global ecosystems that are more sensitive than even average , and there are people who do n’t want you to know that and who actively work to keep you ignorant of the facts .
And third , there are a few things we can do to help ourselves and the Earth .
People who are familiar with the state of climate science will not read much new in the first section of Last Chance .
It briefly recounts key moments in the history of climate science – the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and it ’s four Assessment Reports , the discovery of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) by Scripps Scientist Charles Keeling , the concern over climate “ tipping points . ”
As a result of global warming , Schweiger points out that we are likely facing an irrecoverable loss in Arctic sea ice , the potential for massive methane hydrate releases , and the loss of millions of acres of forests to insects like the pine beetle and to massive drought - induced forest fires .
Furthermore , Schweiger points out that the increasing global temperatures are causing massive losses in Greenland ice and , as a result , raising the global sea level .
And Schweiger supports all his claims with references to peer - reviewed papers , sections of the NASA , NOAA , and EPA websites , and media reports .
In recounting the devastation that has already happened , and thus is representative of what will likely happen in the future , Schweiger focuses on invasive species in Lake Erie and the political machinations that polar bear supporters have endured in the process of trying to get the bears listed as an Endangered Species .
And he calls out to the outdoorsmen in all of us with his descriptions of changes in the life cycles of horseshoe crab , sea turtles , and pronghorn antelope , all of which are seriously threatened by global warming .
But he does n’t stop there .
Schweiger fingers journalists and the mainstream news media as being complicit in the world ’s unwillingness to address global warming .
He believes that advertising dollars and short - term - profit hungry media companies are making editorial decisions about what stories to run based on perceptions of whether the ensuing controversy is worth the loss of advertising revenue .
In addition , Schweiger suggests that newsroom cuts to experienced journalists and expensive investigative reporters are coupling with a loss of “ public interest ” reporting to essentially dumb down media just as global warming is heating up to a level that calls out for experienced communicators .
Schweiger wraps up his book with a detailed call to action .
Support electric cars powered over a smart grid from renewable sources of electricity .
Make your homes and workplaces as energy efficient as possible .
And support those politicians who act on these issues with money and your vote .
Schweiger also condemns industrial farming as being destructive to the topsoil and recommends that people support local , small and mid-size farms that farm using sustainable agricultural practices that keep soil nutritious and alive .
And finally , he calls for the reader to educate themselves and those around them – family , friends , coworkers , media sources , even political representatives – about the real dangers of global warming .
Last Chance is n’t a catastrophe tale , even though Schweiger makes it clear that catastrophe will very likely be in our future if we do n’t address global warming .
Instead , it ’s a call to action for those readers who recognize how much global warming will change their lives and the lives of their descendants for many generations to come .
And Schweiger provides recommended action plans to ease implementing the various recommendations that he makes throughout Last Chance .
All in all , Last Chance is a good book for those readers who are already convinced of the seriousness of global warming , want to have their understanding reinforced , and who want to take more action but do n’t know how .
But it ’s not a book to convince anyone to do something they were n’t already inclined to do .
Afghan election farce ends , escalation to begin
By Bill Van Auken
3 November 2009
The two - and - a - half - month election drama in Afghanistan was brought to a close Monday with the incumbent president of the US - backed regime in Kabul , Hamid Karzai , being decreed the winner .
The Independent Election Commission , a body stacked with Karzai supporters , issued a decision giving him another five - year term and cancelling a runoff election set for November 7 .
The decision came a day after Karzai ’s chief rival and former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , pulled out of the second round vote .
Abdullah had demanded that the Karzai loyalists on the election commission , who were deeply implicated in massive fraud during the first vote on August 20 , be dismissed before the runoff .
Karzai refused .
An election watchdog panel formed by the United Nations found that one million ballots supposedly cast for Karzai — fully one third of his vote — were fraudulent .
Some 300,000 votes cast for Abdullah were also found to be illegitimate .
The end result of the recount was that Karzai ’s lead was shaved to just under an absolute majority , which under the Afghan constitution requires a runoff between the two top candidates .
In response , the US and its allies mounted a frenetic campaign to compel Karzai to accept the recount and acquiesce to a runoff with Abdullah .
Senator John Kerry , the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , spent three days badgering Karzai to accept the second round vote .
He was joined in Kabul by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , US special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke , and UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon all spoke by phone with Karzai , telling him that the runoff was essential to the “ legitimacy ” of the election and his regime itself .
Now , barely two weeks later , Washington and its allies are all insisting that the cancellation of the runoff is of no consequence and the selection of Karzai as the winner by his own handpicked election panel is perfectly legitimate .
President Barack Obama called Karzai to congratulate him .
Admitting that the election had been “ messy , ” Obama said he had told Karzai this was the “ time in which we begin to write a new chapter . ”
“ This does not , in our view , affect the legitimacy of the process , ” a senior administration official told the Washington Post Monday .
“ It does present an opportunity to shift to a new phase in Afghanistan . ”
The “ new chapter ” or “ new phase ” in Afghanistan is being prepared in the form of a major military escalation , in which tens of thousands of additional American troops will be deployed in an attempt to quell armed resistance to the US - led occupation that has grown and spread to 80 percent of the country .
The only purpose of the election was to lend “ legitimacy ” to this escalation of Washington ’s colonial - style war .
The illegitimate character of the vote , in terms of the Afghan people , was a foregone conclusion .
It was held under conditions of a military occupation by 100,000 US and other foreign troops to select the head of a government that is utterly dependent upon Washington ’s support for its survival .
Any candidate who opposed the occupation was barred from running .
The date for the vote — August 20 — was imposed upon the Karzai regime in violation of the Afghan constitution in order to allow time for the 21,000 US troops that Obama ordered into the country last March to begin arriving .
It came three months after Karzai ’s term had expired , calling into question the formal legality of his continuing to act as president .
As for the vote itself , the significance of the fraudulent ballots pales in comparison to the mass abstention by Afghan voters , 70 percent of whom stayed away from the polls .
The US administration was well aware that a runoff vote would attract even fewer voters , turning it into a confirmation of the illegitimacy of the entire process .
The runoff would have required the redeployment of occupation troops to provide security for a diminished pool of voters , undoubtedly entailing another spike in US casualties .
There is every reason to believe that the US and its allies never intended the runoff vote to take place .
Rather , forcing Karzai to accept the second round served as a means of taking the puppet president down a peg and forcing him into power - sharing negotiations with Abdullah .
The objective was and remains for Washington to assume even more direct control of the Afghan regime in preparation for its redoubled counterinsurgency campaign .
These negotiations continued into Saturday night , with Abullah ’s representatives demanding a share of the state spoils in the form of ministries and posts .
Karzai balked , however , insisting that he would go ahead with the runoff .
With the power - sharing gambit stalled , it appears that US officials intervened , pushing for Abdullah to withdraw from the race and demanding that the runoff itself be called off .
Now US officials are insisting that Karzai must gain “ legitimacy ” by reforming his regime and battling corruption .
Obama said he had stressed with Karzai that proof of his commitment to such efforts “ is not going to be in words , it ’s going to be in deeds . ”
The personification of the corruption that pervades the regime is the president ’s brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , the head of the provincial government in Kandahar , who has been charged with playing a central role in the country ’s booming drug trade .
As the New York Times revealed last week , he is also a key asset of the US Central Intelligence Agency , which has placed him on its payroll .
His services to the agency include organizing a local “ strike force ” used to assassinate suspected insurgents and providing CIA operatives with facilities in the province .
The US occupation has been the most corrupting force in Afghanistan .
It has rested on such figures as Karzai from the outset , strengthening the power of corrupt warlords implicated in the slaughter that took place in the country in the 1990s .
Narcotics trafficking has increased dramatically since the US invaded the country in 2001 .
Afghanistan ’s minister for combating narcotics , General Khodaidad Khodaidad , pointed out recently that the bulk of the drugs are passing through two provinces that are under the control of US and other NATO troops .
The New York Times Monday reported that administration officials had expressed “ disgust ” over the election fraud in Afghanistan .
“ How do you consider sending tens of thousands of additional American troops , they asked in meetings in the White House , to prop up an Afghan government regarded as illegitimate by many of its own people ? ”
No doubt , the same question is being asked by working people in the US , who will be forced to bear the cost of this escalation .
In reality , however , the Karzai regime is the creature of US policy in Afghanistan .
Karzai himself was hand - picked by Washington and installed as president only thanks to the 2001 invasion .
He won his first election in 2004 in a US - sponsored vote that was also characterized by massive fraud .
Tens of thousands of additional troops are going to be sent to Afghanistan not to prop up the puppet government in Kabul , nor to hunt down Al Qaeda .
The aim of the occupation is to pursue the strategic interests of US imperialism .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday that the decision on the increased troop deployment would be announced in “ the next few weeks , ” adding that he could n’t guarantee that it would take place before November 11 , when Obama embarks on a nine day tour of Asia .
Anthony Cordesman , a military strategy analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an adviser to Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , the US commander in Afghanistan , posted a column Monday on the CSIS web site advising Obama that he should speak frankly to the American people about the war ’s escalation .
Obama , he wrote , must explain that “ in the best case , it is unlikely that the insurgency and terrorist threat can be entirely defeated in Afghanistan and Pakistan within the next decade . ”
Cordesman continued : “ He must prepare the US and the world for the fact that the present level of US , allied , Afghan , and Pakistani casualties will almost certainly double and probably more than triple before something approaching victory is won . ”
He added that Obama “ must stop taking the easy route of focusing on international terrorism ” and tell the American people how wars being fought by US troops “ affect the broader challenges of regional instability to the west , north , and east . ”
In other words , the war in Afghanistan and its escalation are not aimed at eradicating Al Qaeda .
Rather , they are part of a projection of US military power into the strategic and energy - rich region of Central Asia , directed at countering the influence of Iran , Russia and China .
Obama , he wrote must warn that “ any form of victory in Afghanistan and Pakistan will be part of a much wider and longer struggle ” that will “ endure indefinitely into the future . ”
What is the meaning of this advice from the military adviser and strategist ?
One year after Obama ’s election as the candidate of “ change , ” swept into office thanks in large part due to the anti-war sentiments of broad layers of the American population , what is being prepared is a dramatic escalation in the killing and dying in Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of an unending and ever - widening war .
Wigan Athletic 's players are to refund fans ' tickets for Sunday 's humiliating 9 - 1 reverse at Tottenham .
Latics faithful to get their money back after capital horror show
Embarrassed
Wigan Athletic 's players are to refund fans ' tickets for Sunday 's humiliating 9 - 1 reverse at Tottenham .
A White Hart Lane horror show saw Roberto Martinez 's side endure the proverbial run-around in the capital .
Having had time to assess their performance in North London , Wigan 's players have come to the decision to refund their travelling supporters .
Captain Mario Melchiot accepts the level of their performance was unacceptable and hopes this gesture at least partially atones for such a heavy defeat .
"
We feel that as a group of players we badly let down our supporters yesterday , and this is a gesture we have to make and pay them back for their tremendous loyalty , " read a statement on the club's .
" There is not a lot else to say , just that as a group of professionals we were embarrassed by the way we performed , we feel it was below our standards and this is something we feel we owe to the fans .
" Now we have to draw a line under the game , focus completely on training this week and bounce back on Saturday .
" We are professionals , we will take it on the chin and move on but it 's important that we do not take our supporters for granted . "
Hollywood bad girl Lindsay Lohan 's first collection as artistic advisor for Emanuel Ungaro was a " disaster " , the founder of the French couture house said here , local press reported .
" Lindsay Lohan 's collaboration was a disaster , " the designer said during a meeting on Monday night with the public at the international film festival in Estoril , near Lisbon .
" I am furious but I can't do anything about it , " fumed the designer , who emphasised that he no longer had any contact with the house which bears his name since he left in 2005 .
The house now belongs to an American investment company .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lohan , 23 , whose drug habits and drink - driving conviction turned her into paparazzi fodder and wreaked havoc with her acting career , was named official muse to the prestigious house alongside Spanish designer Estrella Archs in September .
Their first catwalk collection together unveiled in Paris in October was panned by the international fashion press .
Ungaro said he regretted that the fashion house he started " is in the process of losing its soul . "
" That happens to a lot of designers .
We were the creators and patrons , responsible for the creation and destiny of our houses .
But when we gave up our houses , we gave up our souls . "
Ungaro has seen a merry - go - round of chief designers come and go since Emanuel Ungaro hung up his scissors .
Over the past six weeks , Barack Obama has suddenly been acting like the Energizer Bunny of foreign policy .
He has jetted off to Asia and back , accepted the Nobel Prize , dispatched new troops to Afghanistan — and just last week engaged in last - minute diplomacy on climate change in Copenhagen .
In all of these efforts , Obama enjoys one huge political advantage : The Republicans are in disarray .
On domestic issues such as health care or the estate tax , Republicans seem able to unite behind a common strategy ( “ Just say no ” ) .
But on foreign policy , there is no coherent Republican or conservative opposition .
Cheney seems to think he ’s Winston Churchill in the late 1930s — the voice in the wilderness , the scorned leader waiting for the nation to turn to him after it finally realizes how severely it is threatened .
Obama is having trouble moving from his rhetoric to concrete policy achievements .
But the Republicans are a step behind him , because they ca n’t yet figure out what to say .
The certainty of George W. Bush ’s “ Vulcans , ” his incoming foreign - policy team , has given way to confusion .
The Republicans are looking for a new vision .
Consider , for starters , the two contradictory Republican critiques of Obama ’s foreign policy .
At times over the past year , conservative critics have claimed that the new administration ’s policies really are n’t so different from the Bush administration as Obama ’s supporters would like to believe .
Look at the surge in Afghanistan , they say .
Look at Obama ’s acknowledgment , in the Nobel Prize speech , of the existence of evil in the world .
And then on other occasions , conservative critics try to portray Obama as an abrupt departure from the past and a proponent of sweeping change .
( A couple of months ago , columnist Charles Krauthammer alluded to Obama ’s “ radical reorientation of U.S. foreign policy . ” )
These conflicting Republican views of Obama add up to an incoherent message .
So where are Obama ’s Republican opponents headed on foreign policy ?
Over the past year , three different strands of thinking seem to be emerging .
Each one has its own historical model and its vision for the future .
Cheney Republicans .
Three decades ago , when Dick Cheney was an anonymous White House staffer , the Secret Service codename for him was “ Backseat . ”
No one would call Cheney that anymore .
The former vice president seems determined to exercise his First Amendment rights day after day to the point of ( our ) exhaustion .
He is the continuing , insistent defender of the Bush administration ’s policies on interrogation , on Guantanamo , on executive power .
This sets Cheney apart from most other leading Republicans , even hawkish ones ( recall that John McCain , the party ’s 2008 presidential nominee , disagreed strongly with the Bush administration for years on questions of torture and interrogation ) .
Cheney ’s historical model is pretty clear .
He seems to think he ’s Winston Churchill in the late 1930s — the voice in the wilderness , the scorned leader waiting for the nation to turn to him after it finally realizes how severely it is threatened .
Cheney stands ready to fight them on the beaches , whoever they are .
Let ’s hope it does n’t happen .
Muscle Republicans .
This group includes political leaders such as McCain and Newt Gingrich and columnists like Krauthammer and Robert Kagan — all of whom push for a strong national defense and an active , assertive American role overseas .
They generally accuse the Obama administration of believing in , and accepting , the idea that America is in decline .
The Muscle Republicans argue that the United States is stronger , both militarily and economically , than the liberals believe .
Their historical model comes from a different era : the period from 1977 to 1980 , when a new Democratic president , Jimmy Carter , was trying to reshape foreign policy after the Vietnam War .
Carter may have underestimated the America ’s continuing strengths and certainly misjudged the nation ’s mood , thus opening the way for Ronald Reagan ’s rise to power .
The Muscle Republicans would like to portray Obama as a new Jimmy Carter .
But this critique raises all sorts of questions , both political and intellectual .
To accuse your opponents of believing in decline raises the underlying question — well , is there any underlying reality to the idea of decline ?
Does America in fact have less leverage in dealing with other countries , at least in economic terms , than it had a decade ago , and how much does this matter ?
Politically , the Muscle Republicans are in a trap .
If the American economy improves substantially before the next presidential election , Obama is likely to win a second term .
But if the economy remains weak , and U.S. troops are still fighting in ( or have just returned home from ) Afghanistan , then it seems doubtful the American public will be attracted to the Muscle Republicans ’ message that we should be spending more money on more assertive missions overseas .
This is where the Carter - to - Reagan analogy breaks down :
At the time of the 1980 election , American troops had already been out of Vietnam for seven years .
In 2012 , U.S. forces will probably still be in Afghanistan , and Americans will likely be asking when the troops can come home .
It does n’t seem like a propitious time for the message of the Muscle Republicans .
Retrenchment Republicans .
One can detect another Republican critique from the opposite direction .
It shows up in different ways in the columns of George Will , or the work of the libertarian Cato Institute and of the libertarians ’ 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul .
The Retrenchment Republicans argue that the United States should withdraw from Afghanistan and that , more generally , America is overextended and over - committed throughout the world .
( A few days ago , in calling for withdrawal from Afghanistan , Paul said , “ We can not afford to maintain this empire . ” )
If there is a historical model here , it is probably Senator Robert Taft , the leader of the isolationist wing of the Republican Party who lost out to Dwight Eisenhower for the 1952 presidential nomination .
On some issues , such as Afghanistan , the Retrenchment Republicans sound like the left wing of the Democratic Party .
But of course , they disagree with the Democratic left on other foreign - policy issues , such as trade , and on virtually all domestic issues .
Right now , the Muscle Republicans are the dominant force among the party ’s elites .
Their voice is the one you hear from Washington ’s conservative - leaning think tanks ( other than Cato ) .
Their opinions are reflected day after day on The Wall Street Journal ’s op - ed page .
Yet the Retrenchment Republicans could well have strong populist appeal in the Republican primaries scarcely more than two years from now in a country weary of nearly a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Republican presidential candidates will have to decide which way to lean , toward muscular foreign policy or retrenchment .
The Republicans want to find a way to attack Obama — but , amid their uncertainty in the post - Bush era , they just do n’t yet know from which direction .

LOGAN --
A rocket launch in California drew cheers in Logan Monday morning as NASA launched a unique made - in - Utah instrument .
The Wide - Field Infrared Survey Explorer , known as WISE , will map the entire sky and hunt for unknown , and possibly threatening , objects .
WISE was designed and built at Utah State University 's Space Dynamics Laboratory .
• WISE will scan the entire sky in infrared light with a sensitivity hundreds of times greater than ever before , picking up the glow of hundreds of millions of objects and producing millions of images .
•
The mission will uncover objects never seen before , including the coolest stars , the universe 's most luminous galaxies and some of the darkest near - Earth asteroids and comets .
*- NASA * ** Did you know …**
Suppose a space rock that has Earth 's number on it is hurtling toward us and we can't see it .
This new instrument is designed to find things we can't see .
It could open our eyes to all sorts of new things in the Universe .
Infrared is a manifestation of an object 's heat , or even slight warmth .
So , the scope is kept cold in a container like this with frozen hydrogen .
" 440 Fahrenheit , below zero , " said calibration engineer Harri Latvakoski .
" Very cold . "
WISE is so sensitive to heat , it 's expected to discover incredibly dim , not very warm objects .
Computer simulations show it can spot a room - temperature baseball , or even a golf ball , at the distance of Los Angeles to New York .
Portions of the instrument were tested and calibrated in a giant chamber designed to simulate the conditions of space .
" We 're hopeful that we 'll identify asteroids that heretofore have not been seen , " Fackrell said .
That would be a potential service for all mankind , Fackrell pointed out .
" We all know that an asteroid was responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs , " he said .
Beyond that , there 's pure science .
The scope may discover dozens of star - like objects lurking invisibly , closer than the closest known star .
" Brown dwarves are wannabe stars , I guess , that have not quite achieved enough heat for the fusion to take place that creates a star , " Fackrell explained .
The Wide - Field Infrared Survey Explorer will perform for only ten months , until the frozen hydrogen thaws out .
By then WISE is expected to have a complete map of infrared sources throughout the entire sky .

Host Ellen DeGeneres performs at the 79th Annual Academy Awards in Hollywood , California , February 25 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Gary Hershorn
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Four of the world ’s biggest recording companies have sued the producers of “ The Ellen DeGeneres Show , ” accusing them of using songs without permission .
On the popular daytime program , which averages about 3 million viewers daily , newly named “ American Idol ” judge and show host DeGeneres dances to popular tunes selected by a deejay .
The program is produced and distributed by various divisions of Time Warner Inc .
While DeGeneres is not named specifically , the suit names her company , A Very Good Production .
The lawsuit , which seeks an unspecified amount of damages , said “ The Ellen DeGeneres Show ” has used more than 1,000 songs without permission .
In the lawsuit , which was filed on Wednesday in federal court in Nashville , Tennessee , the labels said that when they asked why licenses were not obtained for use of the songs , representatives for the show said they “ did not roll that way . ”
“ As sophisticated consumers of music , defendants knew fully well that , regardless of the way they rolled , under the Copyright Act ... they needed a license to use the sound recordings lawfully , ” the lawsuit stated .
The lawsuit was filed by Warner Music Group Corp , Sony Corp ’s Sony Music Entertainment , Vivendi SA ’s Universal Music Group , and EMI Group .
In a statement , Warner Bros said it had been working with the labels for “ many months ” to resolve the issue of how songs are used on the show , “ after years of a good working relationship between the parties . ”
“ It is unfortunate that the record labels have resorted to filing a suit over a straightforward business dispute which the show has always been prepared , and remains willing , to resolve on amicable and reasonable terms , ” Warner Bros said .
And frankly , there has n't been a good enough job done to get this positive message out .
But check out this report from Charlie Gibson on ABC News .
Dems would do well to start making this a part of the overall message on how the stimulus has actually helped Americans .
This is via the indespensible Steve Benen over at Washington Monthly
The transcript is below :
Charles Gibson , ABC News : The White House has been under scrutiny regarding the number of jobs created by the $ 727 billion economic stimulus program .
Reports from The Administration and Congress have provided only rough estimates .
So , we asked Chris Bury to see whether he could find evidence as to whether the program had paid off .
Chris Bury :
For these police cadets in Missouri , teachers in Virginia and construction workers in Pennsylvania , the stimulus means paychecks .
Bury :
What were you doing before this ?
John Barrett , Construction Worker : I was laid off , collecting unemployment , trying to survive .
Bury :
After eight months of scraping by , John Barrett is among the painters , carpenters and other tradesmen newly hired to fix up broken down public housing in Philadelphia .
Barrett :
It means a lot .
It means we can start living like we used to live .
Bury :
The jobs came only after the Philadelphia Housing Authority got a nice slice of that stimulus , $ 127 million .
Would you have these jobs without the stimulus money ?
Carl Greene , Executive Director , Philadelphia Housing Authority : Without the stimulus money , 3,000 less people would have the opportunity to work .
Bury :
On projects like this , the stimulus means more than just construction jobs .
Tens of millions of dollars in new federal spending are rippling across the region .
At first , the owner of this Pennsylvania window company had big doubts about the president 's plan .
Alan Levin , CEO , Northeast Building Products : I was definitely skeptical , wondering if we 're mortgaging our future .
Bury : Now , his firm is building the windows for that public housing and hiring another 100 workers .
and now ?
Levin : I 'm a believer .
I think everyone in this factory is a believer .
Bury : So is the St. Louis Police Force .
After budget cuts canceled this entire cadet class , stimulus money revived it -- $ 8.7 million to pay 50 salaries for three years .
Dan Isom , St. Louis Metro Police Chief :
This is the time to invest in police officers , not disinvest in them .
Bury :
Unlike those police officers , 275 teachers in Chesterfield , Virginia , are getting only one year 's salary after $ 20 million in stimulus spending here .
Smith , Chesterfield County Schools , Va. :
We 're going to save jobs , but we know it 's a one - time fix .
Bury :
But any jobs are better than none , say the stimulus believers and they see the benefits spreading beyond mere paychecks , to safer streets , stronger schools and better housing .

November 23 , 2009 – Venezuelanalysis.com – Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez called for the formation of a “ Fifth International ” of left parties and social movements to confront the challenge posed by the global crisis of capitalism .
The president made the announcement during an international conference of more than 50 left organisations from 31 countries held in Caracas over November 19 - 21 .
“ I assume responsibility before the world .
I think it is time to convene the Fifth International , and I dare to make the call , which I think is a necessity .
I dare to request that we create my proposal , ” Chavez said .
The head of state insisted that the conference of left parties should not be “ just one more meeting ” and he invited participating organisations to create a truly new project .
“ This socialist encounter should be of the genuine left , willing to fight against imperialism and capitalism ” , he said .
During his speech , Chavez briefly outlined the experiences of previous “ internationals ” , including the First International founded in 1864 by Karl Marx ; the Second International founded in 1889 , which collapsed in 1916 as various left parties and trade unions sided with their respective capitalist classes in the inter- imperialist conflict of the First World War that began in 1914 ; the Third International founded by Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin , which Chavez said “ degenerated ” under Stalinism and “ betrayed ” struggles for socialism around the world ; and the Fourth International founded by Leon Trotsky in 1938 , which suffered numerous splits and no longer exists , although some small groups claim to represent its political continuity .
Chavez said that a new international would have to function “ without impositions ” and would have to respect diversity .
Representatives from a number of major parties in Latin America voiced their support for the proposal , including the Movement Towards Socialism ( MAS ) of Bolivia , the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) of El Salvador , the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) of Nicaragua and Alianza Pais of Ecuador .
Representatives of smaller parties from Latin America and around the world also indicated their support for the idea , including the Proposal for an Alternative Society ( PAS ) of Chile , New Nation Alternative ( ANN ) of Guatemala , and Australia ’s Socialist Alliance , among others .
Sandinista leader Miguel D´Escoto said , “ Capitalism has brought the human species to the precipice of extinction … we have to take control of our own destiny . ”
“ There is no time to lose ” , D’Escoto added as he conveyed his support for the proposal of forming a fifth international .
“ We have to overcome the tendency of defeatism .
Many times I have noted a tendency of defeatism amongst comrades of the left in relation to the tasks we face ” , he continued .
Salvador Sánchez , from the FMLN , said , “ We are going to be important actors in the Fifth International .
We cannot continue waiting – all the forces of the left .
The aspiration of the peoples is to walk down a different path .
We must not hesitate in forming the Fifth International .
The people have pronounced themselves in favour of change and the parties of the left must be there with them . ”
Other organisations , including Portugal ’s Left Bloc , Germany ’s Die Linke and France ’s Partido Gauche expressed interest in the proposal but said they would consult with their various parties .
A representative of the Cuban Communist Party described the proposal as “ excellent ” , but as yet the party has made no formal statement .
Many communist parties , including those from Greece and Brazil , expressed strong opposition to the proposal .
The Venezuelan Communist Party said it was willing to discuss the proposal but expressed strong reservations .
The Alternative Democratic Pole ( PDA ) from Colombia expressed its willingness to work with other left parties , but said it would “ reserve ” its decision to participate in an international organisation of left parties .
Valter Pomar , a representative from the Workers Party of Brazil ( PT ) , said its priority is the Sao Paolo Forum – a forum of various Latin American left , socialist , communist , centre - left , labour , social democratic and nationalist parties launched by the PT in 1990 .
A resolution was passed at the conference to form a preparatory committee to convene a global conference of left parties in Caracas in April 2010 , to discuss the formation of a new international .
The resolution also allowed for other parties that remain undecided to discuss the proposal and incorporate themselves at a later date .
Chavez emphasised the importance of being inclusive and said the April conference had to go far beyond the parties and organisations that participated in last week ’s conference .
In particular , he said it was an error that there were no revolutionary organisations from the United States present .
The conference of left parties also passed a resolution titled the Caracas Commitment , “ to reaffirm our conviction to definitively build and win Socialism of the 21st Century ” in the face of “ the generalized crisis of the global capitalist system ” .
“ One of the epicentres of the global capitalist crisis is the economic sphere .
This highlights the limitations of unbridled free markets dominated by monopolies of private property ” , the resolution stated .
Also incorporated was a proposed amendment by the Australian delegation which read , “ In synthesis , the crisis of capitalism cannot be reduced to a simple financial crisis , it is a structural crisis of capital that combines the economic crisis , with an ecological crisis , a food crisis and an energy crisis , which together represent a mortal threat to humanity and nature .
In the face of this crisis , the movements and parties of the left see the defence of nature and the construction of an ecologically sustainable society as a fundamental axis of our struggle for a better world . ”
The Caracas Commitment expressed “ solidarity with the peoples of the world who have suffered and are suffering from imperialist aggression , especially the more than 50 years of the genocidal blockade against Cuba … the massacre of the Palestinian people , the illegal occupation of part of the territory of the Western Sahara , and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan , which today is expanding into Pakistan . ”
The conference of left parties also denounced the decision of the Mexican government to shut down the state - owned electricity company and fire 45,000 workers , as an attempt to “ intimidate ” the workers and as an “ offensive of imperialism ” to advance neoliberal privatisation in Central America .
In the framework of the Caracas Commitment , the left parties present agreed , among other things , to :
Organise a global week of mobilisation from December 12 - 17 in repudiation of the installation of US military bases in Colombia , Panama and around the world .
Campaign for an international trial against George Bush for crimes against humanity , as the person principally responsible for the genocide against the people of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Commemorate 100 years since the proposal by Clara Zetkin to celebrate International Women ’s Day on March 8 , through forums , mobilizations and other activities in their respective countries .
Organise global solidarity with the Bolivarian revolution in the face of permanent imperialist attacks .
Organise global solidarity with the people of Honduras who are resisting a US - backed military coup , to campaign for the restoration of the democratically elected president of Honduras , José Manuel Zelaya , and to organise a global vigil on the day of the elections in Honduras , “ with which they aim to legitimise the coup d´etat ” .
Demand an “ immediate and unconditional end to the criminal Yankee blockade ” of Cuba and for the “ immediate liberation ” of the Cuban Five , referring to the five anti-terrorist activists imprisoned in the United States .
Accompany the Haitian people in their struggle for the return of President Jean Bertrand Aristide , “ who was kidnapped and removed from his post as president of Haiti by North American imperialism ” .

It 's fighting words from Senator Stephen Conroy as he rebuts the " disingenuous " coverage of his Great Firewall of Australia .
You can't access RC - rated content in newsagencies , libraries , DVDs , cinemas or on TV , so why should it be allowed on the internet ?
asks Conroy .
In these times of bloggers , citizen journalism and the 24 - hour news cycle , quality journalism is under threat .
Nowhere is it more apparent than in Crikey .
Its coverage over the past week with regard to the government ’s announcement on ISP level filtering has been nothing short of disingenuous .
The government has been clear that mandatory filtering will only be implemented for RC - rated content .
This content is illegal to display , distribute , sell or make available for hire under existing Australian law .
RC - rated content is not available in newsagencies , it is not on the library shelves , you cannot watch it on a DVD or at the cinema and it is not shown on television .
Bernard Keane put forward his views in his article
Net filtering wo n’t work , so what is Conroy up to ?
Clearly , Keane does n’t think the government should try to limit exposure to RC - rated material online .
He is entitled to his opinion .
In arguing his position , however , he makes a number of errors that should be corrected .
Keane claims “ the trial saw up to 3.4 % of content wrongly blocked ” .
The trial showed that a defined list of URLs — which is how the mandatory component of filtering would be done — was achieved by all technologies tested with 100 % accuracy .
The figure he quotes of 3.4 % refers to the testing for the optional filtering of a wider range of content as decided by families .
The performance of the various technologies was tested against additional lists of content developed by Enex for innocuous and inappropriate content .
Many families may be prepared to accept some over - blocking to have a wider range of material blocked .
This is a choice for the family or individual .

Keane argues “ the trial … saw speed reductions of 30 - 40 % ” .
In fact one technology tested in the trial returned this result while the remaining technologies returned a figure of less than 10 % .
Enex has described a result of less than 10 % as negligible impact and Telstra has put it into real - time as one seventieth of a blink of an eye ” .
Enex explains in the report the filter that got the higher level of degradation used “ pass through ” technology and the content list was maintained overseas , which may explain the higher level .
The government will not mandate what technology an ISP should use and clearly it would make no sense for an ISP to choose the worst - performed product unless these issues could be overcome .
Keane argues the government ’s announcement is based on “ the big lie , that filtering works ” because it can be circumvented .
The government has never claimed that filtering cannot be circumvented and has continually explained that it is just one part of a range of measures designed to make the internet a safer place .
Yes people will use means other than the web to trade in child pornography and other vile material , and that is why the government has also committed $ 49 million for additional federal police officers to the Child Protection Unit and a further $ 11 million for prosecution .
Keane then attacks the existing classification laws , which is refreshing in that he is one of the few critics to acknowledge the internet is currently subject to censorship .
Keane is wrong though when he argues that “ www.childpr0n.com would be blocked under both [ the RC content list and the current ACMA blacklist ] , [ whilst ] trying to inform the terminally ill about options for euthanasia online would be blocked under one but not the other ” .
Such content is RC and would therefore be included on both the ACMA blacklist under the existing laws and the RC content list under the new scheme .
He argues “ how would you know whether you were blocked under mandatory filtering ” or under the current legislative framework ?
In the government ’s public consultation paper on approved transparency and accountability measures — one option put forward is the use of block pages which would notify the user that the material they are trying to access has been blocked because it has been deemed to be RC content .
It would only be blocked under existing laws if you were using a PC filter that filters the ACMA blacklist or some other form of self applied filtering .
I understand that people feel passionately about this issue but if you want to have a reasoned debate you need to have the facts straight .
Bernard Keane could start by looking at the FAQ on the department ’s website .
Then we had the case of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story with Stilgherrian ’s “ The swift takedown of stephenconroy.com.au . ”
Stilgherrian wrote about a fake Stephen Conroy website having the domain deleted by the industry self - regulatory body auDA where he asked , “ Did Senator Conroy or someone in his office pressure auDA for a quick result ? ”
Stilgherrian had the answer to this question but clearly he did n’t like the answer so he chose to ignore it .
He contacted my office at 7 am on Tuesday asking whether anyone from the office had asked auDA to take action on stephenconroy.com.au .
At 11.19 am he was provided with the following response : “ The Minister ’s office made no request and took no other action in relation to the domain stephenconroy.com.au ” and was referred to auDa regarding their policies .
Stilgherrian replied and made no reference to the response being close to deadline or being too late to pull the story to at least add the response .
( See the full exchange here . ) .
Despite including my office ’s response in the “ Corrections ” section the following day , the fact remains that , in having the answer that my office had made no request well before deadline , but still proceeding with an entire article based on the suggestion that I or my office had requested action , Stilgherrian is either calling me a liar or he has decided to deliberately ignore the response so that he can write the story he wants to write anyway .
But he did n’t stop there with making up the facts to suit his story .
He then drew a correlation to allegations run by Asher Moses in the Sydney Morning Herald when he said “ Conroy ’s policy advisor Belinda Dennett did try to silence one of Conroy ’s critics , network engineer Mark Newton . ”
At the time Asher Moses , a vocal critic of ISP filtering , made these allegations my office advised him that this simply did not happen and he had been misinformed .
That Moses ran the story with the allegation anyway seems to be enough of a “ fact ” for Stilgherrian to repeat whenever he feels it helps his story .
And then there was Colin Jacobs article Reporters without Borders : Do n’t Do it Rudd .
Interestingly Colin Jacobs , who has been spruiking his views on the government ’s position , blurring the lines , burying the facts and wilfully misleading the Australian public , makes the point that the international coverage is “ not a good look ” and that Australia is “ gaining a reputation as the Iran of the South Pacific ” .
The irony in this is that it is Colin Jacobs himself who has been out there whipping the media into a frenzy ; with his loose use of language and most extraordinary misrepresentations it is no wonder he has managed to get global attention .
The government has made it very clear that its policy will see online content that is RC - rated according to the National Classification Scheme criteria is the only content that will be blocked .
Jacobs argues that the government ’s policy will “ block access to inappropriate websites ” , the same language he criticised the government for using months ago as being unclear .
While much of the commentary has referred to the blocking of websites we should make it very clear that the RC content list will only include URLs .
URL ’s lead to specific pages on a website and only if those pages contain RC - rated content will they be added to the list .
Jacobs quotes the letter written by Reporters Without Borders to the Prime Minister that subjects such as “ abortion , anorexia , Aborigines and legislation on the sale of marijuana would risk being filtered as would media reports on these issues . ”
This is just misrepresentation designed to mislead the public .
The elements the National Classification Board looks at to assess these include sx , violence , matters of an abhorrent nature , instruction in crime and instruction in violence .
The only way these subject matters RWB have outlined would fall into the RC category would be if they included step - by - step instruction in self harm or were extremely violent .
It is hard to see how legislation or websites about Aborigines would be included .
Jacobs then demonstrates just how he has managed to get worldwide attention with his outrageous claim that I have “ attempt[ed ] [ to ] deflect criticism by implying filter opponents were all card - carrying members of the Child Pornorgaphy Apologists League ” .
I have never made this comment and I challenge Jacobs to provide evidence of such a quote .
It seems that if Jacobs makes the claim often enough , without pointing to any evidence , he will convince people — including the RWB .
If regulation or so called censorship of the internet has got Colin Jacobs so enraged with the government ’s recent announcement , where has he been for the past nine years where the internet in Australia has been regulated far more heavily .
The government ’s filtering policy applies only to the worst of the worst content hosted overseas which brings it into line with what has been going on in Australia for the past nine years without the outrage .
Let me repeat the government has been clear that mandatory filtering will only apply to RC - rated content .
This content is not available in newsagencies , on library shelves , at the cinema or on DVD and you certainly can’t watch it on TV .
Why should n’t Australian ISPs be required to block access to such content ?
I am happy to debate the merits of this policy and listen to the genuine concerns of Australians but let ’s ensure people have the facts and not build campaign based on disingenuous misrepresentations .
As recently as today I have read articles that claim mandatory filtering will include content that is rated X18 + .
I suggest people you are interested in the facts go to my department ’s website where they can read the FAQ’s www.dbcde.gov.au
I wish Crikey and all its readers a very merry Christmas .
CRIKEY ED : Just to be clear , Stilgherrian did forward the response from Conroy to Crikey but the addition was missed in the production process , the fault was ours , not Stilgherrian’s .
Conroy ’s office has now been informed of this .
Even as CNBC , which seems to be unaware it is now under new ownership and can stop selling GE stock all day , every day ( will Cramer be allowed to pump the worthless equities of competitor cable and satellite companies going forward ?
Inquiring minds want to know ) , could not stop praising the fabulous improvement in continuing claims which plummeted by a whopping 5,000 from 462 k to 457k , one number that everyone ignored , is the explosion in Emergency Unemployment Compensation - yes , the same name for insurance benefits as they roll beyond their standard expiration horizon , and which the Administration is set on extending to cover a period from now to infinity .
That number skyrocketed by 265,300 in one week to an all time record of 3,859,553 for the week ending November 14 , from 3,594,253 in the prior week .
The chart below does the collapse a little more justice .
In light of this massive divergence in jobless trends , an eager Kool Aid drinking world is expecting Goldman 's Jan Hatzius to provide a forecast ( with at least 10 significant digit precision ) ahead of tomorrow 's NFP number .

A gunman spent nearly 10 minutes on his knees praying with a cashier during a raid at an American payday loan firm .
CCTV showed the man brandishing a gun before falling to his knees , crying and talking about God .

Baby chimps are better at controlling their emotions than human babies of a comparable age , which could help to explain why some babies cry so much and are so inconsolable , a study has found .
Scientists investigating the facial expressions of young chimpanzees have found that baby chimps almost always cry for a reason , in contrast to some of the crying of human babies .
The researchers believe the finding may result from difference in brain development between the two species , with human babies being born with slightly less developed brains than chimps .

“ The 2006 and 2009 Israeli bombings on Gaza left a high concentration of toxic metals in soil , which can cause tumors , fertility problems , and serious effects on newborns , like deformities and genetic pathologies . ”
These are some of the key findings of a recent study by New Weapons Research Committee ( NWRC ) , an Italy - based group of academics , physicians and researchers specialized in elaborating risk assessment surveys on the effects of the newest “ non-conventional weapons and their mid-term effects on residents of areas afflicted by conflicts ” .
The metals found are mainly tungsten , mercury , molybdenum , cadmium and cobalt .
NWRC researchers investigated four craters : two of them formed during the Jul. 2006 bombings on Beit Hanoun and Jabalia Camp , and another two emerged as a consequence of the Jan. 2009 bombings on Gaza City suburb Tufah .
They analyzed “ the powder remaining inside a shell of the White Phosphorus bomb THS89D112-003 155 MM M825E11 exploded near the Al Wafa hospital in Jan. 2009 ” .
The scientists compared the levels of concentration of metals in the craters with those identified in a report on the presence of metals in the Gaza soil , based on samples collected from 170 locations in 2005 .
“ The analyses have shown anomalous concentrations of these metals inside the craters , indicating soil contamination , ” says NWRC .
“ This , given the precarious living conditions , especially in refugee camps , increases the risk of exposure to toxic substances , through the skin , through the lungs and through ingestion .
” Paola Manduca , professor of genetics and researcher at the University of Genoa , Italy , explained : “ Our study indicates an anomalous presence of toxic elements in the soil . ”
“ It is essential to intervene at once to limit the effects of the contamination on people , animals and cultivations ” , she stressed .
“ We need strategies to help contaminated people .
We hope that the research performed so far by the Goldstone Commission will not only analyze the abuses of human rights , but also focus on the long - term effects that the various types of weapons have on the environment and on population .
A rapid collection of data should be carried out . ” Israel experimenting new non-conventional arms
In a previous study released on Jan. 9 , during the Israeli three - week war on Gaza , which killed over 1,400 people and injured more than 5,000 , NWRC reported : “ Mounting evidence is emerging that Israel is experimenting new non-conventional weapons on civilian population in Gaza .
”
“ It is happening again what we saw in Lebanon two years ago , ” said Manduca .
There , “ Israel used white phosphorus , Dense Inert Metal Explosive ( DIME ) , thermo- baric bombs , cluster bombs and uranium ammunitions , and experimented new weapons .
Still today there are unexploded bombs and radioactivity on the ground , ” NWRC spokesperson reported .
Manduca added that the images of dead and wounded people , and testimonies by witnesses , “ show significant resemblance with those gathered and verified during the July - August war in 2006 in Lebanon ” .
Mads Gilbert , Norwegian doctor and member of a non- governmental organization Norwac , who worked at the Gaza 's largest hospital , Shifa , denounced also in January that “ many ( people ) arrive with amputations , with both legs crushed ” , and “ with wounds which I suspect are produced by Dime weapons ” .
“ The images arriving from Gaza seem to confirm these suppositions as well .
The burns suffered by some children in Gaza are very similar to those documented in 2006 by doctor Hibraim Faraj , a surgeon at the Hiram hospital in Tyre and by doctor Bachir Cham at the Hospital du Sur , Sidon , ” he said .
“ At the moment , ” Manduca commented , “ we have reports from doctors and informed witnesses that make us believe that new types of weapons are being tested today in Gaza , apart from those used in 2006 .
This makes it necessary for further technical and scientific researches to be undertaken . ” More evidenceIn the last two years , NWRC , together with Lebanese and Palestinian doctors , produced scientific data using techniques of histology , scansion electron microscopy and chemical analysis on bioptic samples from victims of the 2006 Israeli attacks .
The specialists collected “ clinical evidence and documentation that proves the use of thermo- baric bombs in open spaces , DIME and sub-lethal targeted weapons in 2006 in Lebanon , and DIME and sub-lethal targeted weapons in Gaza ” .
NWRC submitted in 2007 a related report to the UN Human Rights Council , and in 2008 to the International Citizens Tribunal on War Crimes in Lebanon and the Italian Parliament ’s committee on depleted uranium .
NWRC has also worked with international scientists who documented the use of uranium ammunitions in Lebanon .
Rain of fire , war crimes : Human Right WatchOnly weeks after , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) reported from Beit - ul - Moqaddas on “ Israel 's repeated firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas of Gaza during its recent military campaign was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes ” .
In fact , HRW released on March 25 its 71 - page report “ Rain of Fire : Israel 's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza ” , which provides witness accounts of the devastating effects that white phosphorus munitions had on civilians and civilian property in Gaza .
“ Human Rights Watch researchers in Gaza immediately after hostilities ended found spent shells , canister liners , and dozens of burnt felt wedges containing white phosphorus on city streets , apartment roofs , residential courtyards , and at a United Nations school , ” it informs .
The report also presents “ ballistics evidence , photographs , and satellite imagery , as well as documents from the Israeli military and government ” .
Militaries use white phosphorus primarily to obscure their operations on the ground by creating thick smoke .
It can also be used as an incendiary weapon , according to HRW .
“ In Gaza , the Israeli military did n't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops , ” said Fred Abrahams , senior emergencies researcher at HRW and co-author of the report .
White phosphorus on densely populated areas“ It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas , even when its troops were n't in the area and safer smoke shells were available .
As a result , civilians needlessly suffered and died .
” The report documents a pattern or policy of white phosphorus use that Human Rights Watch says must have required the approval of senior military officers .
“ On February 1 , HRW submitted detailed questions to the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) about its white phosphorus use in Gaza .
The IDF did not provide responses , citing an internal inquiry being conducted by the Southern Command .
” In the recent Gaza operations , it adds , “ Israeli forces frequently air - burst white phosphorus in 155 mm artillery shells in and near populated areas ” .
“ Each air - burst shell spreads 116 burning white phosphorus wedges in a radius extending up to 125 meters from the blast point .
” White phosphorus ignites and burns on contact with oxygen , and continues burning at up to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 816 degrees Celsius ) until nothing is left or the oxygen supply is cut .
When white phosphorus comes into contact with skin it creates intense and persistent burns , according to HRW .
Israel Defense Ministry knew The Human Rights Watch report concludes “ the IDF repeatedly exploded it unlawfully over populated neighborhoods , killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures , including a school , a market , a humanitarian aid warehouse , and a hospital ” .
“ Israel at first denied it was using white phosphorus in Gaza but , facing mounting evidence to the contrary , said that it was using all weapons in compliance with international law .
Later it announced an internal investigation into possible improper white phosphorus use .
” HRW stressed “ The IDF knew that white phosphorus poses life - threatening dangers to civilians ” .
A medical report prepared during the recent hostilities by the Israeli ministry of health said that white phosphorus “ can cause serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin , is inhaled or is swallowed ” , it reports .
“ Burns on less than 10 percent of the body can be fatal because of damage to the liver , kidneys , and heart , the ministry report says .
Infection is common and the body 's absorption of the chemical can cause serious damage to internal organs , as well as death .
” All of the white phosphorus shells that Human Rights Watch found were manufactured in the United States in 1989 by Thiokol Aerospace , which was running the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant at the time .
“ On January 4 , Reuters photographed IDF artillery units handling projectiles whose markings indicate that they were produced in the United States at the Pine Bluff Arsenal in September 1991 , ” the reports informs .
Deliberately or recklessly , but used To explain the high number of civilian casualties in Gaza , Israeli officials have repeatedly blamed Hamas for using civilians as “ human shields ” and for fighting from civilian sites .
In the cases documented in the report , Human Rights Watch found no evidence of Hamas using human shields in the vicinity at the time of the attacks .
In some areas Palestinian fighters appear to have been present , but this does not justify the indiscriminate use of white phosphorus in a populated area .
HRW said that for multiple reasons it concluded that the IDF had deliberately or recklessly used white phosphorus munitions in violation of the laws of war .
“ First , the repeated use of air - burst white phosphorus in populated areas until the last days of the operation reveals a pattern or policy of conduct rather than incidental or accidental usage .
Second , the IDF was well aware of the effects of white phosphorus and the dangers it poses to civilians .
Third , the IDF failed to use safer available alternatives for smokescreens .
” The laws of war obligate states to investigate impartially allegations of war crimes .
The evidence available demands that Israel investigate and prosecute as appropriate those who ordered or carried out unlawful attacks using white phosphorus munitions , Human Rights Watch said .
The United States government , which supplied Israel with its white phosphorus munitions , should also conduct an investigation to determine whether Israel used it in violation of the laws of war , Human Rights Watch concluded . ( Source : turkishweekly.net )
This tiny country on the Pacific coast has made a rich contribution to Central American cooking .
The cuisine of El Salvador is similar to that of its neighbors , with a strong reliance on indigenous foods like corn , beans , squash and tomatoes .
The influence of Mayan culture is quite strong , mixed in with contributions from the Spanish kitchen .
Pupusas and curtido may be the most well known Salvadoran dishes , but other tasty dishes include pavo salvadoreño , atol de elote , quesadilla and semita .
Salvadoran Cuisine : A Background
El Salvador , once known as Cuscatlán ( the land of beautiful jewels ) , is on the west coast of Central America , bordering Guatemala and Honduras .
Seven million people are squeezed into a country the size of Massachusetts , with an additional 3 million living abroad .
A tropical climate prevails in the coastal lowlands , while the highlands and plateaus of the interior enjoy cooler , drier weather .
The landscape is dotted with volcanos , and many rivers cut their way from the highlands to the Pacific shore .
Over the centuries , the native and European populations of El Salvador so thoroughly intermarried that today most Salvadorans are mestizo , or of mixed blood .
As in so much of the New World , this mixing of peoples also led to a melding of cuisines .
While several new ingredients were introduced by Europeans ( onions , cheese , beef ) , the mainstays of the Salvadoran diet are still corn and beans , as they have been for millenia .
The Mainstays : Corn and Beans
Corn is ground into masa for tortillas , pupusas , and tamales .
Pupusas , thick tortillas stuffed with cheese , beans , pork or other ingredients , are without doubt the most famous Salvadoran food .
The classic accompaniment is a cabbage salad called curtido .
Tamales are special occasion food , and in El Salvador they contain a wide variety of fillings including chicken , pork , black beans ( tamales pisques ) , yucca flowers ( tamales de flor de izote ) , and chipilín leaves ( ticucos ) .
They are made with fresh corn and left unstuffed for tamales de elote .
Tamales are usually seasoned with a variety of sauces or spice pastes ( recaudos ) , and in El Salvador , banana leaves encase tamales more often than corn husks .
They lend a deep tropical flavor to these steamed corncakes .
Beans are eaten with almost every meal and can be simmered whole or pureed and served as refritos .
The red bean ( frijol rojo ) is the most popular , but black beans are also common and are mixed with rice in a dish known as casamiento .
Fruits and Vegetables
A wide variety of fruits and vegetables find their way onto the Salvadoran table : potatoes , yuca ( cassava root ) , squashes , cabbage , carrots , onions , chipilín ( a leafy green ) , tomatoes , peppers , plantains , bananas , pineapple , coconut , mangos , guavas , nance ( a cherry - like fruit ) , and pacalla ( palm flowers ) .
Ground pumpkin seeds ( alguashte ) and sesame seeds thicken stews .
Meats , Poultry , Fish and Dairy
Pork and chicken are the most common meats and are used in tamales , soups and stews .
Chicharrónes ( crispy fried pork ) fill pupusas .
Beef is eaten on occasion and is commonly grilled ( carne asada ) or simmered with vegetables as in lomo entomatado .
Salvadorans make their own variety of spicy chorizo sausage .
Turkey ( pavo ) is popular at Christmastime and is roasted and served in the Salvadoran manner with a rich sauce and olives and capers .
Fish is most often breaded and fried .
Shrimp is used to make the ever popular ceviche .
Salvadorans make use of a variety of simple cheeses such as queso fresco , quesillo and duro blanco .
Salavadoran sour cream , or crema Salvadoreña , is particularly luscious , with a soft yellow hue , a rich texture and a subtle tang not unlike French crème fraiche .
Desserts and Beverages
Pastries hold a special place in the Salvadoran heart .
The semita is a coffeecake - like pastry often filled with a variety of jams and preserves .
Salvadoran quesadilla - unlike the Mexican snack with the same name - is a sweet poundcake flavored with parmesan cheese and sour cream .
Pastelitos are small baked turnovers filled with custard or fruit preserves .
Children find an easy sweet chewing on small pieces of sugarcane .
Many beverages in El Salvador are based on corn .
For atoles , cornflour is mixed with water or milk , sweetened and served hot or cold .
Atol shuco , made with purple corn , is particularly popular .
Chicha is a mildly alcoholic beverage made with fermented ground corn .
Café de maíz is made by brewing toasted corn kernels with hot water .
Other popular beverages are hot chocolate , coffee and fruit milkshakes called batidos .
The names of the favorite Salvadoran beers are Regia , Bahia and Pilsener .
Salvadoran Dining Habits
The typical Salvadoran eats a simple breakfast of refried beans , tortillas and a little cheese with coffee .
But breakfast can also be a quite substantial affair , adding eggs , plátanos fritos , a slice of ham and a large dollop of crema Salvadoreña .
Lunch is usually the largest meal of the day with tortillas , pupusas or rice , a vegetable , beans and maybe some pork or chicken .
A refreshing horchata , atole or other beverage helps to wash it down .
The evening meal is often again a simple affair of tortillas and beans .
Typical Salvadoran Dishes
You wo n’t understand what a travesty Ndamukong Suh not getting the Heisman is for two reasons .
The first reason is that you already know the award is a multi- layered slice of FAIL - flavored tiramisu based on the often incoherent reasoning of sportswriters we wager have not watched all of the candidates play more than three games combined each .
They ’ll choose based on the guy whose team is in the title game , and they ’ll pick Mark Ingram , a fine player who may not be the best running back on his team .
That ’s what Heisman voters do .
â† µ
The second reason is that Ndamukong Suh is , by himself , a defensive line , and an outstanding one at that ( via Double Extra Point : )
â†µ Alabama D - Line â†µ 98 Tkl , 23.5 TFL , 9.5 Sk , 20 QBH , 5 PBU , 0 Int , 1 FF , 3 Blk â†µ Florida D - Line â†µ 112 Tkl , 33 TFL , 14 Sk , 48 QBH , 5 PBU , 0 Int , 1 FF , 0 Blk â†µ Texas D - Line â†µ 116 Tkl , 25.5 TFL , 15.5 Sk , 10 QBH , 7 PBU , 0 Int , 2 FF , 0 Blk â†µ Ndamukong Suh â†µ 82 Tkl , 23 TFL , 12 Sk , 24 QBH , 10 PBU , 1 Int , 1 FF , 3 Blk â† µ
â†µâ† µ
He ’s been a defensive line all by himself , or more statistically put , two defensive tackles in the body of one .
Thus his ineligibility for the award : it goes to college football ’s most outstanding “ player , ” not “ players , ” and most Heisman voters probably can’t believe this is the work of just one man .
( And if I had n’t seen it with my own eyes , neither would I . )
The new document arms Democrats with an economical response to the contention of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
MIT analysis backs Obama health plan
A new analysis by a leading MIT economist provides new ammunition for Democrats as the Senate begins formally debating the historic health - reform bill being pushed by President Barack Obama .
The report concludes that under the Senate ’s health - reform bill , Americans buying individual coverage will pay less than they do for today 's typical individual market coverage , and would be protected from high out - of - pocket costs .

So Democrats will argue that under the Senate bill , Americans would pay less for more .
The new document arms Democrats with a response to the contention of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) that the bill would mean “ higher premiums , higher taxes , and massive cuts to Medicare . ”
The “ microsimulation ” analysis is by Jonathan Gruber , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Treasury Department official under President Bill Clinton .
Gruber used data from the Congressional Budget Office .
Gruber concludes that people purchasing individual insurance would save an annual $ 200 ( singles ) to $ 500 ( families ) in 2009 dollars .
And people with low incomes would receive premium tax credits that would reduce the price that they pay for health insurance by as much as $ 2,500 to $ 7,500 .
The report will be circulated to Capitol Hill this week .
Read the four - page report here .
Gruber ’s conclusion : “ [ F ] or those facing purchase in the non-group market , the … bill will deliver savings ranging from $ 200 for singles to $ 500 for families in today ’s dollars – even without subsidies .
The savings are much larger for lower income populations that receive premium credits .
“ This is in addition to the higher quality benefits that those in the exchange will receive , with actuarial values for low income populations well above what is typical in the non -group market today .
It is also in addition to all the other benefits that this legislation will deliver to those consumers – in particular the guarantee , unavailable in most states , that prices would not be raised or the policy revoked if they became ill . ”
Gruber was among the 23 Ph.D. economists who sent a letter to Obama on Nov. 17 endorsing his approach to health - care reform .

“ Tell Obama and his men to help us , ” pleaded Daniel M. Kobei , an Ogiek leader , who still seems almost stunned that the Ogiek may have to leave a forest they have battled for decades to conserve .
“ It ’s not that we ’re special , but this forest is our home . ”
Image Ogiek farmers near Nakuru , Kenya , are among those who could be evicted in the government 's avowed effort to conserve the forest .

No doubt the Mau Forest is crucial .
It is  or more accurately , used to be  a thick , staggeringly beautiful forest in western Kenya , capturing the rains and the mist and , in turn , feeding more than a dozen lakes and rivers across the region , even contributing to the flow of the Nile .
But in the past 15 years , because of ill - planned settlement schemes ( the government essentially handed out chunks of forest to cronies ) , 25 percent of the trees have been wiped out .
Much of the forest is now simply meadow .
The Ogiek say there are fewer antelope and bees .
They constantly use the Kiswahili word “ haribika , ” which means spoiled .
Scientists say the environmental destruction has led to flash floods , micro-climate change , soil erosion and dried up lakes .
The results were painfully obvious this summer when East Africa was hit by one of the worst droughts in years .
In Nairobi , Kenya ’s capital , the water taps went dry for weeks .
And because Kenya gets a lot of electricity from hydropower , the water shortage meant blackouts , which many Kenyans believe contributed to the recent spike in crime and unemployment .
Suddenly , the Kenyan government seemed to spring into action , commissioning hefty environmental reports and insisting on ejecting all settlers from the Mau Forest so that the government could plant millions of trees and get the country ’s water sources churning again .
But the sudden environmental altruism has bred suspicion as well .
Many Ogiek wonder if Kenyan politicians , notorious as among the world ’s most corrupt , are driven by another kind of green .
The remains of a Japanese mini-submarine that participated in the Dec. 7 , 1941 , attack on Pearl Harbor have been discovered , researchers are to report today , offering strong evidence that the sub fired its torpedoes at Battleship Row .
That could settle a long - standing argument among historians .
Five mini-subs were to participate in the strike , but four were scuttled , destroyed or run aground without being a factor in the attack .
The fate of the fifth has remained a mystery .
But a variety of new evidence suggests that the fifth fired its two 800 - pound torpedoes , most likely at the battleships West Virginia and Oklahoma , capsizing the latter .
A day later , researchers think , the mini-sub ’s crew scuttled it in nearby West Loch .
The loch was also the site of a 1944 disaster in which six tank landing ships preparing for the secret invasion of Saipan were destroyed in an ammunition explosion that killed 200 sailors and wounded hundreds more .
When the Navy scooped up the remains of the so - called LSTs and dumped them outside the harbor to protect the secrecy of the invasion , it apparently also dumped the mini-sub ’s remains , which were mingled with the damaged U.S. ships .
“ It ’s not often that a historian gets a chance to rewrite history , ” said marine historian and former Navy submariner Parks Stephenson , who pieced together the evidence for the television program “ Nova . ”
“ The capsizing of the Oklahoma is the second most iconic event of the attack .
If one submarine could get in in 1941 and hit a battleship , who knows what a midget sub could do today .
Iran and North Korea are both building them .
It ’s very worrying . ”
Stephenson and his colleagues have put together a convincing chain of circumstantial evidence , but it is just circumstantial , said Burl Burlingame , a journalist at the Honolulu Star - Bulletin and author of “ Advance Force : Pearl Harbor . ”
“ There is a good chance that this is the Pearl Harbor midget , but I do n’t think the case is closed on it , ” Burlingame said .
“ At this point , it is not hard evidence . ”
The two - man , 80 - foot - long sub in question does not have a name of its own .
Each of the five subs in the attack was carried by a conventional submarine and took its name from the mother boat .
It is thus called the I - 16 - tou -- tou being Japanese for boat .
Powered by a 600 - horsepower electric motor , the sub could reach underwater speeds of 19 knots , twice as fast as many of the U.S. subs of the day .
The three pieces of the sub were found during routine test dives between 1994 and 2001 by Terry Kerby , chief pilot of the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory ’s submersibles Pisces IV and Pisces V. But Kerby and others assumed they were a part of a war trophy that had been captured by allied forces at Guadalcanal or elsewhere , towed back to Hawaii and scuttled .
Stephenson got involved in 2007 because he was looking for the fifth Japanese mini-sub .
In 1941 , a crewman on the I - 16 had received a radio call from the I - 16 - tou at 10:41 p.m. on Dec. 8 reporting the success of its mission .
That indicated to Stephenson that the mini-sub had found a calm place in the harbor and hidden until the next night before surfacing and sending the call .
The crew members would have then scuttled the craft because they could not get it out of the harbor .
The West Loch would have been a good location to hide , but researchers could find no trace of the boat there .
A diver who had been looking for the mini-sub suggested that Stephenson talk to Kerby , who sent him pictures of his find .
“ As soon as I saw the bow section with the distinctive net cutter , I knew that we had found the fifth midget sub , ” Stephenson said .
The Japanese navy modified net cutters on the subs for specific missions , and the one on the wreck was identical to those on the other mini-subs .
No torpedoes were found on the wreck , and evidence suggests that they were not present when the boat was sunk .
A newly declassified photograph taken by a Japanese plane during the attack appeared to show a mini-sub firing a torpedo into Battleship Row .
A report to Congress in 1942 by Adm. Chester W. Nimitz describes an unexploded 800 - pound torpedo recovered after the battle .
That ’s twice the size carried by the torpedo bombers .
That torpedo was apparently a dud that missed the West Virginia .
But an examination of the remains of the Oklahoma shows that it apparently had underwater damage much larger than that associated with aerial torpedoes .
An underwater blast would have caused it to capsize , Stephenson said .
“ Otherwise it would have settled to the bottom upright , ” like the other sunken ships .
The 1944 disaster at West Loch occurred on May 21 as the Navy was preparing to invade the Mariana Islands in Operation Forager .
The Navy clamped a top - secret classification on the incident to keep it from the Japanese , and few records are now available .
What is known is that it was crucial to clear out the debris because the loch was by then the site of an ammunition dump .
Records from the salvage ship Valve showed that it was brought into the loch during the cleanup and its 250 - ton crane was used for an undisclosed reason .
Stephenson thinks it lifted the I - 16 - tou , but there are no records to confirm that .
The remains of the mini-sub were then dumped three miles south of Pearl Harbor along with those of the LSTs , to be found by Kerby 50 years later .
Bulkheads on the wreck are sealed , so researchers do n’t know whether the mini-sub crew was trapped .
But a map taken from one of the other mini-subs showed the location of a safe house in Pearl City , Hawaii , suggesting the crew might have scuttled the boat and escaped .
The “ Nova ” episode describing the search for the I - 16 - tou will air Jan. 5 .

The Strangford DUP MP , Iris Robinson , is quitting politics after admitting she is battling mental illness .
Mrs Robinson , the wife of NI First Minister Peter Robinson , said she was leaving because of an ongoing battle with severe depression .
" The stress and strain of public life comes at a cost and my health has suffered , " she said .
Mrs Robinson provoked outrage in the gay community last year when she said homosexuality was " an abomination " .
Earlier this year , she spent several months out of the public eye .
As well as a series of operations , she said she had been battling severe depression which she described as " a personality changing illness " .
Her decision to leave office followed talks with her husband over Christmas .
" As many people will be aware , I have recently tried to return to the full - time work of representing my constituents following my latest period of illness , " she said .
" Over the years , I have undergone a long series of operations and though I have never talked about it publicly , I have , against this background , also battled against serious bouts of depression , " she said .
" Only those who have faced similar challenges in life will know the ordeal faced by those who are profoundly depressed and the distress caused to those around them as they grapple with personality changing illness .
" One in four of the population struggle with mental illnesses at one level or another yet few talk about it openly .
When I am better able to do so , I want to say more about this period of my life . "
Mrs Robinson , 60 , a mother of three , has been an MP since 2001 .
Her husband has represented east Belfast since 1979 .
She will not contest the next Westminster election and is expected to hand over her Stormont seat to a party colleague .
' Abomination '
Iris Robinson is the former chairperson of the health committee at the Northern Ireland Assembly and provoked outrage within the gay community by claiming homosexuality was " an abomination " and that , with help , gay people could be " turned around " .
Those comments and her clashes with Health Minister Michael McGimpsey made her appear , at times , a controversial figure at Stormont .
However , a series of local politicians have expressed sympathy with the Strangford MP , paying tribute to her constituency work and hoping she will make a full recovery .
Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward said she was an extremely assiduous and dedicated MP .
" Iris ' decision to share with the public her reasons for standing down will also help many other people and their families who live with the challenge and problems of coping with depression , " he said .
Mrs Robinson 's fellow Strangford DUP assembly members paid tribute to her leadership , hard work and dedication .
Danny Kennedy , deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists , sent good wishes for Mrs Robinson 's recovery .
Alliance leader David Ford said the decision to leave must have been very difficult and wished her a full recovery .

Five women were paraded naked , beaten and forced to eat human excrement by villagers after being branded as witches in India 's Jharkhand state .
Local police said the victims were Muslim widows who had been labelled as witches by a local cleric .
The incident occurred on Sunday in a remote village in Deoghar district .
Correspondents say the abuse of women who are branded as witches is common , but rare footage of the incident has caused outrage across India .
Police went to Pattharghatia village after being informed about the incident by a group of villagers .
' Possessed '
They have lodged a case against 11 villagers , including six women .
Four people have been arrested in connection with the incident .
The victims were taken to a playground where hundreds had assembled to watch
Murari Lal Meena
Deputy police inspector general Armed police have since been deployed to the area .
" On Sunday morning the victims were taken to a playground where hundreds had assembled to watch the ghastly incident , " deputy inspector general of police Murari Lal Meena told the BBC .
" No one in the mob came forward to rescue the victims as they were being stripped and beaten up , " he said .
The victims are now under police protection .
Police say that people in Pattharghatia believe that certain women in their village are possessed by a " holy spirit " that can identify those who practise witchcraft .
" These women recently identified five women from the same village as being witches who practised witchcraft and brought miseries to the area , " a police official said .
Soon , an unruly mob broke into their huts , dragged them out and started beating them up .
Footage of the incident has been aired on television channels in India prompting outrage .
Hundreds of people , mostly women , have been killed in India because their neighbours thought they were witches .
Experts say superstitious beliefs are behind some of these attacks , but there are occasions when people - especially widows - are targeted for their land and property .

John Graham - Cumming reports that the Met Office has published the code for preparing the land surface records .
This is slightly odd .
What appears to have been released is the code for generating the CRUTEM land temperature index , which is actually prepared by CRU .
However this does tally with what we know about the data the Met Office released the other day .
This was , contrary to the impression given by the Met Office press release actually the corrected data which is used as input into the CRUTEM average and also the HADCRUT global temperature index .
It 's the latter index that most people are interested in .
If this is confusing you , I 've prepared a summary of my understanding of how it all fits together .
I 'm not promising this is correct
I 've made everything but the data and code released by the Met Office semitransparent .
As you can see , what we are looking at are intermediates in the preparation of the global temperature index .
While this is welcome , the guts of the changes are in the selection of the stations and in the correction of those stations for the plethora of problems with them - urban heat islands , changes in equipment , station moves , changes in observation time and so on .
So while there is a feel of increasing openness , in reality , the shutters are only open the barest crack and it 's still not possible to make out what 's going on inside .
Meanwhile , even this extremely limited attempt at openness is not all it seems to be .
John G- C has been looking at the code and running it against the data he has .
What he has found is that prior to 1855 there was no southern hemisphere data and that when you run the Met Office 's newly released code , this shows up as a gap in the graph of the average .
But there is no such gap in the actual CRUTEM index .
John 's conclusion is that what we 're looking at is not the actual code used in CRUTEM , but something written especially for public consumption .
In light of the scorn that many programmers have been pouring on the quality of the coding standards at CRU , this might suggest that the original code was just too awful to make available for public inspection .

OTTAWA –Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff says there will be " consequences " for the trouble that Denis Coderre , his former Quebec lieutenant , has caused the party this week .
" This is politics .
This is not personal , " Ignatieff told reporters .
" For every action , there are consequences .
I 'm very clear about that .
Mr. Coderre is very clear about that . "
Ignatieff would not say what form the punishment will take - ejection from caucus is the most severe punishment that the Liberal leader has available , but to do so with Coderre could invite the outspoken MP to make even more vocal condemnations of Ignatieff and his circle .
Coderre is due to appear on Tout le monde en parle , a hugely popular Quebec television show , on Sunday night - an appearance that will almost certainly stir up controversy because of his explosive exit from the party lieutenant 's post earlier this week .
When he walked off that job , claiming he no longer had the " moral authority " to serve as the chief MP in Quebec , he lashed out at the " Toronto advisers " around Ignatieff .
Coderre was annoyedhe was overruled in a dispute over where former justice minister Martin Cauchon would run in the next election .
On Sunday as well , the Liberal party 's Quebec wing will be gathering in Quebec City and Ignatieff is due to speak to the beleaguered troops .
The meeting is turning into a litmus test of Ignatieff 's grip on the party and a measure of Liberal fortunes in the province ahead of an election that could happen anytime .
The Liberal leader , who is putting forward a motion of non-confidence today in the Commons , says his party feels it has no option but to vote for Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's ouster from government .
Ignatieff says he 's met too many Canadians who are desperate for the government to do more in the faltering economy .
" How do I explain to these people that I keep letting this government go on ? " he said .
" That 's why , in my heart of hearts , after much reflection , we 've decided as a party that we can't continue to give the government confidence in the House of Commons . "
The non-confidence motion will probably fail to unseat Harper 's government , since the New Democrats plan to vote with the Conservatives .
Ignatieff would not be drawn into a discussion about the NDP 's decision , saying simply that was their choice .

Have you heard about this Jersey Shore ?
The internet is ablaze with quotes , commentary and controversy , initially about the reality show ’s portrayal of Italian - Americans ( check my last name , please ) , but this week the discussion has been all about the punch heard ’ round the world .
In a surprisingly respectful twist , MTV has decided not air the footage of Snooki getting hit in a bar next week .
But it might actually be a slimy move by the network because the damage is done .
Let ’s look back at what has happened up to this point :
A preview at the end of the second episode showed a brief and brutal clip of especially boisterous cast member Nicole “ Snooki ” Polizzi getting savagely punched in the face by a man at a bar .
As reported by the New York Post , the assaulter was a Queens gym teacher who has since been suspended .
The stunning clip made the rounds on the blogs and incited many a debate about violence , violence against women , violence on television , violence in bars , violence when drinking , and you get the idea .
Under scrutiny , MTV announced they would be showing a PSA during the episode in which the sucker punch occurs , set to air next week .
But after this week ’s episode ( the show ’s third ) , MTV showed the preview clip again , knowing full well the controversy the first airing caused , as noted at the end of this Gawker piece .
Now E !
Online is reporting exclusively that MTV will pull the footage of the actual assault from next week ’s episode after the clip went viral .
“ What happened to Snooki was a crime and obviously extremely disturbing , ” MTV said in a written statement .
“ After hearing from our viewers , further consulting with experts on the issue of violence , and seeing how the video footage has been taken out of context not to show the severity of this act or resulting consequences , MTV has decided not to air Snooki being physically punched in the face . ” ( via )
Here ’s the thing , though : Because of the barbaric nature of the clip , MTV had to know the sort of backlash they would be facing upon its airing , especially within the context of a show already proven to be a magnet for criticism .
This is n’t new ground for the network and it seems carefully orchestrated .
( Remember Irene and Stephen ’s Seattle Real World slap ? )
And so , knowing full well they could n’t in good conscience air video of the crime , MTV made sure to show the promo as many times as possible , fully understanding the viral nature of the web .
Now , people are forced to tune in to see the punch ’s aftermath and the network still gets to look respectable by not airing the reality show money shot .
If you have no television or a lot of self - control , you might not have seen the clip in question , but a .gif form of it has been practically inescapable on the web in the last week .
If you dare , it ’s on the next page .

As if Twitter were n’t already full of utterly bland , mindless codswallop , researchers from Hasselt University in Belgium are about to add the random , idiotic bleatings of a baby to the stream of nonsense .
Worse , the baby wo n’t even know it is broadcasting its brainless , repetitive activities to the world .
Twoddler is a modified Fisher Price activity center , the kind that toddlers have tweaked and poked for what seems like generations .
The difference is that this one has its activities monitored by a computer and the activities are translated into Tweets .
The example uses a baby called Yorin , and if he spends , say , a few minutes playing with a picture of his mother , this Tweet will be forced on the world : “ @mommy_yorin Yorin misses mommy and looks forward playing with her this evening ” .
Further , if he annoyingly bangs on the bell , over and over , for far too long , the computer will translate this to say “ Yorin is showing off his music skills with a new tune ” .
The Twoddler uses sensors hooked up to an Arduino circuit and sends the information via the wireless ZigBee protocol to a nearby computer .
This is where the signals are converted into human - readable ( or at least parent - readable ) “ words ” and sent off to the web using the Twitter API .
We imagine that these incessant , repetitive Tweets will swiftly become as annoying as the behavior which triggers them , negating the whole point of sending Yorin off to the day - care center .
There is one advantage to Twoddler over having an actual toddler in the room with you .
It may be a bit of a moral conundrum , but at least mom always has the option to un - follow her offspring .

Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says Iran will make its own higher enriched nuclear fuel , effectively rejecting a UN - backed exchange proposal that would have eased Western fears about Iran 's nuclear program .
A defiant Mr. Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday that Iran was tired of the continued sparring over a swap offer , in which it would ship out its own low - enriched uranium , purified to less than 5 percent , for the 20 - percent enriched fuel it needs .
" I declare that by the grace of God , the Iranian nation will produce 20 percent enriched uranium and anything it needs itself , " Ahmadinejad told thousands of people in the central city of Isfahan .
It was Iran 's latest volley in a nuclear back - and - forth with the UN nuclear watchdog agency and the five permanent UN Security Council members plus Germany .
Yet analysts cast doubt on Iran 's technical and industrial capacity to fulfill either that pledge , or the dramatic expansion of Iran 's nuclear enrichment effort announced last Sunday .
Iran is not known to have the technology to fabricate its own fuel rods .
France and Argentina are practically alone in being able to supply the specific fuel needed by Iran 's small reactor to continue producing medical isotopes in Tehran .
Iran censured last week
The US has led Western efforts for the deal , which would have seen Iran reduce the amount of material inside the country that could hypothetically be enriched to much higher levels of 90 percent necessary for a weapon .
Iran was censured last week in an overwhelming vote by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) over its belated declaration of a small , 3,000 - centrifuge facility hidden under a mountain near Qom .
Revealed in September , inspectors found it to be in an " advanced " stage of construction .
Iran calls the IAEA decision " illegal , " and in reaction on Sunday , Ahmadinejad 's cabinet approved 10 new industrial - sized enrichment facilities that would mean a 50 - fold increase in capacity to more than half a million spinning centrifuges – a goal that would take decades to achieve if actually pursued .
Ahmadinejad said those plans were " not a bluff , " during a televised speech on Tuesday .
Yet analysts say the rapid - fire claims of new programs in recent days belie a nuclear program that has had a rocky history of progress .
Instructive are the host of problems Iran has already faced in building its first large - scale enrichment facility at Natanz .
Designed for some 50,000 centrifuges , just 8,700 have been installed after nearly a decade .
" Iran would probably need to develop significantly stronger domestic capabilities if it were to come anywhere close to meeting this new goal , " says Michael Levi , a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who has followed Iran 's nuclear program for years .
" They are still significantly dependent on imports for their program , " says Mr. Levi , author of " On Nuclear Terrorism . "
" Iran has been casting its net wide for materials and equipment as its dependable suppliers have become more difficult to deal with … .
It 's gotten harder for them . "
Restrictions have tightened with three sets of UN Security Council sanctions , one set of US sanctions , and a host of other US - led bilateral , European , and Israeli efforts , which reports suggest include sabotage of some nuclear components coming from abroad .
In recent years , Iran has had to make design decisions " based less on choosing the optimal technical route , " such that the " ability to procure certain things overrode everything else , " notes Levi .
" There is a cat and mouse game … it 's a continuing fight . "
Monitoring Iran 's procurement network
That fight may have helped US and Western intelligence agencies determine that the facility near Qom , called Fordo and situated on a Revolutionary Guard military base , had a nuclear purpose .
Obama administration statements " strongly suggest to me that we have their procurement network , at least a part of it , pretty well penetrated , " because the arrival of certain material was the tipoff that it was a centrifuge facility , says a US government nonproliferation expert who asked not to be named .
" We know they 're out shopping , and we 're trying to stop that . "
This analyst notes that Iran has slowed installation of new centrifuges in recent months , and stated in late September that it would concentrate on more sophisticated and efficient centrifuges .
Iran has reacted strongly to the IAEA censure .
On Wednesday , Ahmadinejad said Western countries " once again showed that they are not committed to the law .
They make use of international bodies as tools . … the era of such childish games are over . "
The Iranian president had earlier singled out Russia , which is building Iran 's only nuclear power plant at Bushehr .
" Russia made a mistake , " Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday .
" It does not have an accurate analysis of today 's world situation . "
Reuters reported on Wednesday from Moscow that Russia would join any " consensus " on more sanctions against Iran , which US officials suggest will be a top priority in the New Year if no compromise deal is reached .
Though all decisions on nuclear and other key state issues in Iran are made by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khameini , the comments by Ahmadinejad appeared to make a compromise exchange deal less likely .
Given current limitations , it was not clear how Iran would boost its capabilities .
" Based on what the Iranians have demonstrated , it would be surprising if they were able to manufacture anywhere near the number of centrifuges they need " for the declared enrichment expansion , says the US government expert .
" Iran also does not have a large supply of indigenous uranium .
I do n't think they have enough even to fuel a Bushehr - sized reactor , let alone run that many centrifuges .
It 's ridiculous . "

As they relaxed in the dimly lighted lounge , awaiting the sold - out screening of “ Invictus , ” Stephen Galloway and his wife , Tina , were perusing the menu between sips of champagne .
A waiter had just brought a chilled $ 49 bottle of Schramsberg sparkling wine and was ready for their order .
Tina was contemplating the $ 14 plate of fried calamari with ginger and lemon , while Stephen had a hankering for the $ 19 New York strip steak sandwich .
The Galloways are hardly high rollers -- he ’s a property manager and she ’s a social worker .
Still , the Pasadena couple were more than willing to fork over $ 29 each for a movie ticket , on top of the bill for champagne and finger food .
“ We ’ve never experienced anything like this , ” Tina said of the Pasadena movie house , which opened this month .
Forget Milk Duds and popcorn .
Welcome to the movie theater industry ’s equivalent of the first - class tourist cabin : the luxury theater .
Betting that moviegoers will pay triple the average price of a U.S. movie ticket to be pampered like Hollywood moguls may seem odd at a time when the bargain mentality is gripping consumers .
But Australian theater operator Village Roadshow Ltd. believes it can rattle the U.S. industry by introducing its upscale Gold Class Cinemas , which have been a big hit Down Under .
“ Our secret agenda in America is : Not only are we going to make money , we ’ll make a lot of money .
. . .
This will shake up those exhibitors , and there are a lot of them , that have poor offerings , ” said Graham Burke , chief executive of Village Roadshow .
“ You go into some of these places and there ’s gum on the floors .
Gold Class is the opposite .
[ Customers ] get treated like royalty , like a king . ”
The Pasadena theater is the fourth U.S. outpost for Gold Class .
The chain expanded into the U.S. last year , opening two theaters in affluent suburbs of Chicago and one in Redmond , Wash . , the home of Microsoft Corp .
Through a $ 200 - million joint venture with Norman Lear ’s Act III Communications and other partners , Village Roadshow plans to open as many as 30 luxury theaters nationwide over the next five years .
Future locations include Austin , Texas , and Scottsdale , Ariz. , and possibly Santa Monica and Costa Mesa .
Although movie theaters have done a brisk business this year , some industry analysts wonder whether people will be willing to pay the premium ticket price on top of a pricey food and beverage tab , given the cutback in consumer spending .
“ With the current state of the economy , that ’s a long row to hoe , ” said Bruce Austin , a communications professor at Rochester Institute of Technology who has conducted research on movie audiences .
“ That seems like a lot of money to ask for a very narrow slice of the top end of the market . ”
But Gold Class executives are confident that even in a down economy , customers will pay up for silver - platter service .
Initial signs are encouraging , they say , noting that the newly opened Pasadena theater sold out eight of its first 11 nights .
“ People like going to restaurants like Spago , Osteria Mozza and Nobu , ” Burke said .
“ They ’re the people who go to Gold Class .
They ’re the same people who will buy a Mercedes - Benz and will fly first class because they get benefit and quality . ”
Recession notwithstanding , Gold Class is tapping into the growing luxury cinema niche , as theater operators look for new ways to draw upmarket homebound moviegoers -- or less - affluent customers looking to splurge on a special night out -- and capture some of the lucrative business that goes to restaurants and bars .
“ There ’s a whole range of food services and premium services being tried out , ” said Patrick Corcoran , director of media and research for the National Assn. of Theatre Owners .
“ Some of this is about getting back the adult moviegoers .
These are people who are generally better off than other segments of the population and they are used to getting catered to . ”
Some small theater operators , such as Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin , Texas , offer in - theater food and beverage services , as do some of the industry ’s largest theater companies .
Kansas City , Mo.- based AMC Entertainment Inc. , for example , has been testing casual and more upscale food and beverage services at theaters in Kansas City and Atlanta and plans to expand the offerings to as many as a dozen theaters in the next year .
At AMC ’s Cinema Suites , moviegoers can dine and order alcoholic drinks in plush , reclining seats with lots of legroom .
“ The demand for in - theater dining is there , ” AMC spokesman Justin Scott said .
Locally , Gold Class has some competition .
The Arclight cinemas in Hollywood and Sherman Oaks , the Bridge Cinema de Lux near Los Angeles International Airport and Muvico Theaters ’
Thousand Oaks 14 multiplex offer many of the same amenities , such as reserved seating , plush recliners and bar and lounge access .
Gold Class , however , says it ’s taking pampering to a higher level .
After checking in at the concierge desk , patrons descend an escalator and are greeted by a hostess in high heels and a black dress .
She seats them in a gray - and - beige lounge , where they can order a glass of wine ( from a list of 80 bottles ) and appetizers before their film begins .
The theaters , which have only 24 to 40 seats , feature giant suede recliners , each with an oval table and glowing buttons that summon a server to take an order for a chilled martini , a plate of charcuterie or a chicken piccata sandwich , among other choices .
Servers will also bring a fuzzy blanket or pillow .
Village Roadshow spent about $ 8 million refurbishing the Pasadena theater , located in the One Colorado shopping plaza in a site formerly occupied by Laemmle Theatres and AMC .
The remodel included installing a full - service kitchen , run by Chicago - based Levy Restaurants .
Most customers order tickets online and pay $ 22 if they join the Gold Class Cinemas club , which claims more than 2.5 million members in Australia and other countries .
Nonmembers pay $ 29 on weekends .
In a strategy to build a base of repeat customers , Gold Class sends notices to club members about upcoming films and special events , such as appearances by a celebrity chef or winemaker .
Members can book private screenings for birthdays , bridal showers and other events .
The theaters also will be marketed to corporate groups and celebrities , who can host private screenings .
Actor Andy Garcia and director Raymond De Felitta recently previewed their upcoming film “ City Island ” at the Pasadena theater .
So far , more than 10,000 Southern Californians have joined the club , and the theater has sold more than $ 100,000 in gift cards , said Tim Carroll , Village Roadshow ’s chief marketing officer .
“ What we want is to build a relationship with moviegoers that lasts for years , ” he said , “ not just one movie . ”

Facebook has announced it is now earning more money than it is spending and has signed up its 300 millionth member .
Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the fast - growing social network had become ' cash flow positive ' last quarter , meaning that it is now earning enough to cover operating costs .
" Earlier this year , we said we expected to be cash flow positive sometime in 2010 and I 'm pleased to share that we achieved this milestone last quarter , " Mr Zuckerberg said in a blog post .
" This is important to us because it sets Facebook up to be a strong independent service for the long - term . "
Facebook 's announcement is significant in that the Palo Alto , California company , unlike other Web giants such as Amazon , eBay , Google and Yahoo ! , had yet to prove how it would translate traffic growth into cash .
Mr Zuckerberg , who created Facebook with two Harvard University room mates five years ago , did not provide any financial details but the company is believed to pull in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from advertising .
The chief executive also announced that " as of today , Facebook now serves 300 million people across the world . "
Facebook signed up its 200 millionth user in April .
US software giant Microsoft bought a 1.6 per cent stake in Facebook in 2007 for $ US240 million ( $ 278 million ) , valuing the social network on paper at $ US15 billion .
A Russian Internet company invested $ US200 million in a nearly 2 per cent stake in Facebook in May in a deal that valued the social networking giant at $ US10 billion .

The human population currently thrives on a basic food source : grains .
Our current food paradigm requires that we have wheat for our breads , barley for our animals , rice for our tables , and soy for our animals and food additives .
Corn is another important food source , especially in the Americas .
All five of these food sources make up the bulk of the world`s diet at present .
To grow these crops using our modern , industrial methods requires a lot of resources .
It requires oil for the machinery and transportation , artificial fertilizers ( nitrogen , potassium , and phosphorous ) , and water .
All of these crops , cereal grains especially , require potassium ( commonly called " potash " ) to thrive , especially when farmed industrially .
Potash is literally mined out of the ground ( it is a mineral ) .
Between 2006 and 2008 , the price of potash went up by 500 % .
It 's still rising .
We`re running out of " easy " potash .
Water is another resource growing more scarce .
The planet is 2/3 water , but only 2 % of that is fresh water .
Most of that fresh water is polar ice , glaciers , and in the atmosphere .
What`s left is fresh water that we can utilize .
It cycles at a given rate .
Currently , we use 30 % more than there is in America and 50 % more than there is in China , and it gets little better as we circle the globe .
Most of the excess comes from aquifers , which are quickly drying up .
Oil has peaked , which leaves nitrogen .
Nitrogen we aren`t running out of , but we 're heavily over - using it .
Again , because of industrial farming .
Nitrogen is so cheaply acquired that farmers can dump it by the train load on their fields without concern .
The excess runs off into groundwater and eventually into rivers and the ocean .
At the mouth of the Mississippi River , where it dumps into the Gulf of Mexico , there is a huge " dead zone . "
It stretches from Louisiana to Houston , Texas and out into the Gulf nearly five miles from its source .
That dead zone is due to all of that nitrogen raging into and down the Mississippi and into the Gulf .
The nitrogen causes an explosion of algal growth , soaking it up .
That algae breathes the oxygen in the water , sucking it up at such a rate that anything else that requires oxygen ( basically everything living ) either dies or has to leave .
These dead zones are at the mouth of nearly every river in the world Many people are under the impression that we can just magically switch from our current , industrial methods of farming to organic and more sustainable methods whenever we need to .
This is not the case .
Even disregarding USDA Organic requirements , it takes several years ( close to a decade ) for a farm to move from synthetic fertilization to organic methods .
The soil requires time to recover .
So , we face a big decision as humans .
Do we continue as we are and eventually starve to death when the resources start to run out ?
Or do we change our ways and hope that in the next generation ( or less ) , we can reverse the trend and become sustainable ?
It`s not a question for governments ; it`s a question for people .
We all have to change , individually and in communities .
That change can`t come by government coercion .
It comes through personal life choices that you must make , your family must make , your neighbors , friends , and community must make .
It starts , however , with you .
Are you sustainable yet ?

Pep cut from same Arsene Wenger cloth
Josep Guardiola grabbed the headlines last season when he did the treble with Barcelona winning the Spanish League , Spanish cup and Champions League in his first season at the helm of the Catalan club .
Even more impressive was the fact that he was merely 39 .
Yet his first season was not a complete cake walk and after poor form and results the pressure was on , as the fans began to grow weary of the inexperienced former Barca player .
Enter Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger .
The French man flew Guardiola out to London to watch a game and to have a word and it seemingly did the job as Barca would go on to rule domestically and in Europe .
Wenger ’s help was not lost on the young Barca boss so in May as the plaudits were flooding in , Guardiola took time to phone Wenger and thank him for the advice that had a hand in him reversing his fortunes at the Nou Camp .
So now it comes as no surprise that Wenger has earmarked Guardiola to take over from him when he finally steps down .
Guardiola is well aware that the life expectancy of managers in Spain is not long , thus Guardiola has rejected offers to extend his contract past the initial 2 years he signed .
His predecessor Frank Rijkaard had his contract terminated despite Joan Laporte gushing that his achievements at the club ‘ have made history ’ as he won the league twice as well as the Champions League in his 5 years as boss .
Under Guardiola , Barcelona play football that make Arsenal look like Stoke .
Last season they scored a record number of goals in the league ( 105 ) , thumped Real Madrid 6 - 2 at the Bernabeau and played Manchester United off the pitch in the Champions League final .
So Arsenal fans will be more than welcoming of Guardiola , as they can rest assured that their brilliant style of football will not be compromised .
Guardiola also has experience of success in Champions League , something that for Arsenal ’s brilliance they are yet to taste which too could sweeten the deal .
Another significant factor in Guardiola ’s possible appointment is his connections with Barcelona and the influence this could have on captain Cesc Fabregas .
Constantly linked with a return back to Spain , the incentive of possibly playing under his boy hood hero could be enough to make Fabregas stay at the club he has called home since the age 16 .
There have been grumblings of frustration at Arsenal ’s lack of success in recent years but the majority of Arsenal fans are more than grateful for what Wenger has done for the club in his 12 year tenure so do n’t expect Wenger to just get the elbow in favour of Guardiola .
The fact that Guardiola will be a free agent next summer if he does not extend his contract with the Catalan giants simply means that Arsenal fans will have to wait that while longer before they see ‘ Pep ’ in the home dugout of the Emirates stadium .

WHAT TO DO - SUMMARY
The problem is caused because your computer is not launching the hard - drive when you turn it on .
There are several potential causes of this : - The motherboard startup settings ( BIOS ) are out of wack .
SOLUTION : Turn on the computer and press the F2 or F10 keys ( at the top of the keyboard ) as soon as you see anything on the monitor .
You should see a message on the screen telling you which F key to press to get into SETUP ( getting into toshiba satellite bios you need to keep holding the power button and the escape button until youve been aske to press F1 ) .
In setup , select the option to " Reset to Default Settings " , and then the option to " Save and exit " .
If that does not work , go back into the Setup screen , and look for " Boot devices " or " Boot sequence " -- it may be inside a screen called " Boot Settings " or " CMOS Settings " .
You may have to dig through sub-menus .
You want to make sure that LAN or Network is not in the boot device list ahead of HD or Hard Drive .
The boot order should be :
1. Floppy
2. CD
3. Hard Drive
4. anything else - The hard - drive has a mechanical problem , such as a loose connection , or incorrectly installed .
SOLUTION : Unplug and open the tower , remove the hard drive gently , making note of all connections .
If necessary , label each cable with a bit of masking tape before disconnecting .
Get the dust out of the tower , and reinstall the hard - drive securely .
If necessary , use a match or bit of cardboard to secure it -- be inventive , but GENTLE .
Make sure the cables and jumpers are firmly and correctly connected .
If this is a new or intermittent problem , you can assume the cables and jumpers are correct .
Other fixes from this page which may apply to you : - due to a disconnected keyboard cable ( forgot to plug it in after replacing the HDD ) , of all things .
- disable " Boot to LAN " or " Boot to network " in the BIOS boot sequence ( first solution above ) .
- Check for a RAID setting on your HDD in your bios , switch to IDE .
- the hard drive power cable was not connected - download and install new BIOS from your computer or motherboard manufacturer :
On a working computer , go to their website , and download the correct BIOS Update for your computer .
This may take some research .
Install the BIOS onto a floppy or USB drive according to their directions .
Put the floppy or USB stick into the sick computer , and turn it on ( you may need to set startup sequence so that the USB stick is recognized , see first solution above ) .
Your BIOS will get updated .
Remove the floppy or stick , and restart the computer .
- if you used the restore disks to reinstall Windows , and your drive is larger than 80 GB , it 's possible that the restore disks formatted the drive as a FAT32 system instead of NTFS .
FAT32 cannot handle a boot disk larger than 32GB - it becomes unstable .
SOLUTION : reformat the drive using the restore disks or a windows install disk as NTFS , not FAT .

First December Report From Afghanistan

Local man reports on troop morale in Afghanistan
Sunday , December 6 , 2009
( Bay News 9 ) --
For the past five years Winter Haven native and former Green Beret Michael Yon has been covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as an independent journalist .
A couple of days ago Bay News 9 spoke with him on a Skype connection to Afghanistan .
Yon has been reporting for years that the U.S. risked losing the war there .
" And frankly I thought he was ready to tap out .
I thought he might be ready to quit , and it 's clear some of the soldiers thought the same thing .
He really just spent some political capital , " Yon said .
" It took moral courage to do that . "
Yon says morale among British and U.S. troops had stayed pretty high , and now the troops there are really ready to take the fight to the enemy .
" Just in the past couple of days since I have gotten back , I have talked with quite a few , " he said .
" It 's clear they see this troop commitment is very important .
And it 's clear it 's bolstered their morale . "
Yon says the commitment of additional troops is a signal to Afghan tribes in troubled areas they should fight on the U.S. side .
" Because the people do have to make sensible choices on whose side they are going to pick .
They have to know , " Yon said .
" They have to think they are picking the side of the winner . "
Yon says the next 18 months will be a make or break time for the war .
He believes the American people and the U.S. allies will run out of patience with the war if they do n't believe victory is possible .

Hitler made a deal with Zionists and allowed them to take all their assets to Palestine .
As the first snow fell at the foot of the Italian Alps , the centre of Coccaglio presented an idyllic scene .
In front of its 18th - century church , the flakes came to rest on a magnificent Christmas tree , rising almost to the height of the Roman tower opposite .
But in this town of 8,000 inhabitants between Milan and Venice , the approach to Christianity 's most sacred festival has been marked in a very special way .
On orders from the local council , controlled by the conservative Northern League , police have been carrying out house - to - house searches for illegal immigrants in an action dubbed Operation White Christmas .
The operation is due to finish on December 25 .
Some 3,000 people have marched through the town in protest at the operation , which the Vatican called " sad and distressing " .
But it has been endorsed by Silvio Berlusconi 's government .
Visiting nearby Brescia , where he announced the opening of a detention camp for suspected illegal immigrants – a so - called centre for identification and expulsion – Berlusconi 's interior minister , Roberto Maroni , a leader of the League , complimented Coccaglio 's mayor .
" Operation White Christmas has been carried out in other towns with other names and without arousing the same kind of clamour , " he said .
" These are initiatives that serve to check and combat the phenomenon of illegal immigrants .
So there is no ' story ' and no racism . "
The migrant population has soared in Italy 's industrial heartland , making it fertile territory for the League , with its xenophobic rhetoric .
A League poster at the last general election showed three white sheep kicking out a black one .
Coccaglio's registered , non-Italian population rose from 177 to 1,562 in the 10 years to 2008 .
In Brescia , non-Italians outnumber natives in the centre , which is lined with halal butchers , African markets , Chinese bazaars and takeaway kebab shops .
Suspicions exploded into fury last month in the town nearest Coccaglio , when a Moroccan man was arrested on suspicion of attacking and raping a local woman .
Eyewitnesses said he risked being lynched as he was escorted from the carabinieri barracks .
Franco Claretti , Coccaglio's mayor , confirmed the police operation would end on Christmas Day but that was a coincidence and claimed the White Christmas tag was invented by a local newspaper headline - writer rather than his council .
" You will not find it in any council document " , he said .
" In Italy , council ordinances are valid for 60 days and this one was passed on October 27 . "
But critics of the operation were sceptical .
" They did not deny it at the outset , " said Umberto Gobbi , a radio station manager who organised the protest last month .
In his view , the Northern League is playing a game of provocation and subsequent denial , intended to keep tension high .
" Operation White Christmas forms part of a sort of competition to see who can be most provocative , " he said .
Claretti said he tried to set the record straight when he was first contacted by the national media , but the resulting report had a more explosive element : a comment attributed to one of his councillors that " for me , Christmas is not a festival of hospitality , but one of Christian tradition , of our identity " .
Again , Claretti said the councillor was misquoted and that what he really said was that hospitality had to be extended all year , not just at Christmas .
In his rectory on the outskirts of Brescia , Father Mario Toffari , head of the diocesan office for the pastoral care of immigrants , lifted his shoulders and opened his arms in a classic Italian gesture of scepticism .
" If that is the way it was , all they needed to do was take it back , " he said .
The League had repeatedly exploited Christian symbols for its own ends " and the symbols of Christianity ought not to be used against anyone " , said Toffari .
In Brescia , recently , as in several other towns , League members handed out crosses in the street to protest at a European court of human rights ruling that displaying crucifixes in Italian classrooms was a violation of religious freedom .
Elsewhere , the party has mounted campaigns for the erection of nativity scenes on council premises .
The operation in Coccaglio is the product of legislation promoted by the Berlusconi government giving mayors wider powers to flush out illegal immigrants .
Under Italian law , councils can withdraw the right of abode six months after the expiry of an immigrant 's residence permit if he or she cannot show an application has been submitted for renewal .
Claretti said the police were delivering letters telling immigrants whose permits had expired to prove they had applied to renew them .
But Toffari said the normal procedure was to post a letter inviting the recipient to go to the town hall .
Sending round the police was " like saying these people could be dangerous and need to be checked in a special way " .
Claretti said that dispatching registered letters would have cost his council € 3,000 it could ill afford .
" Besides , if there is a letter they just put it to one side ; if they see a police officer , they take it seriously .
As far as I 'm concerned , this is a gesture of politeness .
If someone has nothing to hide , he or she has nothing to fear . "
A lorry driver charged in connection with a suspected £ 5 m cocaine seizure is a religious convert who believed he was transporting Christian tracts , a court has heard .
Terence Bean ( 62 ) was among three men charged in connection with the largest ever recovery of the class A drugs made in Northern Ireland .
The cocaine was confiscated from a vehicle near the Boucher Road in south Belfast on Saturday .
Bean , who lives in Malaga but with an address at Sparrow Street , Oldham , was charged with being concerned in the supply of class A drugs , conspiracy to supply , possession and possession with intent to supply .
His co-accused Terence Telford ( 38 ) , from Wolfhill Road , Belfast , faces the same charges .
A third man , Michael Reeves ( 28 ) , of Carrick Hill , Belfast , is accused of conspiracy to supply cocaine .
All three were remanded in custody at Belfast Magistrates ’ Court .
A barrister for Bean told the court his client had worked as a lorry driver across Britain and Europe for the past 15 years .
Paul Bacon said the accused claimed to have undergone a religious conversion just over a year ago .
The court heard that at one stage Bean was approached by a Belgian man while sleeping by the side of the road in France .
According to the lawyer , he introduced himself as belonging to an organisation called the Brothers and Sisters of the Lord .
Bean agreed to a request to take religious tracts to Northern Ireland , the court was told .
Mr Bacon said further contact was made by another man claiming to represent the same religious group , with Bean given a parcel at a business park in Lancashire last Friday night .
He was allegedly told someone from the organisation would take the package from him when he got to Northern Ireland .
“ He makes the case he did n't know in any way , shape or form what was in that package , ” Mr Bacon said .
The court heard Telford described as a self - employed mechanic who runs his own vehicle recovery business .
Reeves ' solicitor Niall Murphy stressed that he strenuously denied the criminal allegations against him .
Mr Murphy described the evidence linking his client to the case as “ incredibly flimsy ” .
However , District Judge Fiona Bagnall remanded all three suspects in custody to appear again via video - link on January 18 .

In 1998 , Californians voted to pass Proposition 227 , the “ English for the Children Act , ” and dismantle the state ’s bilingual - education industry .
The results , according to California ’s education establishment , were not supposed to look like this : button - cute Hispanic pupils at a Santa Ana elementary school boasting about their English skills to a visitor .
Those same pupils cheerfully calling out to their principal on their way to lunch : “ Hi , Miss Champion ! ” A statewide increase in English proficiency among all Hispanic students .
Instead , warned legions of educrats , eliminating bilingual education in California would demoralize Hispanic students and widen the achievement gap .
Unless Hispanic children were taught in Spanish , the bilingual advocates moaned , they would be unable to learn English or to succeed in other academic subjects .
California ’s electorate has been proved right : Hispanic test scores on a range of subjects have risen since Prop. 227 became law .
But while the curtailment of California ’s bilingual - education industry has removed a significant barrier to Hispanic assimilation , the persistence of a Hispanic academic underclass suggests the need for further reform .
The counterintuitive linguistic claims behind bilingual education were always a fig leaf covering a political agenda .
The 1960s Chicano rights movement ( “ Chicano ” refers to Mexican - Americans ) asserted that the American tradition of assimilation was destroying not just Mexican - American identity but also Mexican - American students ’ capacity to learn .
Teaching these students in English rather than in Spanish hurt their self - esteem and pride in their culture , Chicano activists alleged : hence the high drop - out rates , poor academic performance , and gang involvement that characterized so many Mexican - American students in the Southwest .
Manuel Ramirez III , currently a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin , argued that bilingual education was necessary to ensure “ the academic survival of Chicano children and the political and economic strength of the Chicano community . ”
The role of American schools , according to this nascent ideology , became the preservation of the Spanish language and Mexican culture for Mexican - origin U.S. residents .
Novel linguistic theories arose to buttress this political platform .
Children could not learn a second language well unless they were already fully literate in their native tongue , the newly minted bilingual - ed proponents argued .
To teach English to a five - year - old who spoke Spanish at home , you had to instruct him in Spanish for several more years , until he had mastered Spanish grammar and spelling .
“ Young children are not language sponges , ” asserts McGill University psychology professor Fred Genesee , defying centuries of parental observation .
Even more surprisingly , the advocates suddenly discovered that the ability to learn a second language improved with age — news to every adult who has struggled through do - it - yourself language recordings .
Such ad hoc justifications rested on shaky scientific ground .
Psycholinguistics research supports what generations of immigrants experienced firsthand : the younger you are when you tackle a second language , the greater your chances of achieving full proficiency .
Children who learn a second language early in life may even process it in the same parts of the brain that process their first language , an advantage lost as they age .
Only one justification for bilingual education made possible sense .
The bilingual theorists maintained that children should be taught academic content — physics , say , or history — in their home language , lest they fall behind their peers in their knowledge of subject matter .
But this argument applied most forcefully where bilingual education has always been the rarest : in high school , where , one would hope , teachers use relatively sophisticated concepts .
In the earliest grades , however , where bilingual education has always been concentrated , academic content is predominantly learning a language — how to read and write B - A - T , for example .
Moreover , most Hispanic children who show up in American elementary school have subpar Spanish skills to begin with , so teaching them in Spanish does not provide a large advantage over English in conveying knowledge about language — or anything else .
The bilingual - education crusade also contained patent inequities that never seemed to trouble its advocates .
If teaching a nonnative speaker in his home tongue was such a boon — if it was , as many argued , a civil right — bilingual education should have been provided to every minority - language group , not just to Hispanics , who have been almost the exclusive beneficiaries of the practice .
If instructing non-English - speaking students in English was destructive , it would damage a school ’s sole Pashto speaker just as much as its Hispanic majority .
But minority rights , usually the proud battle cry of self - styled progressives , invariably crumpled before brute political power when it came to bilingual ed .
“ If it could benefit 82 percent of the kids , you do n’t have to offer it to everyone , ” says Robert Linquanti , a project director for the government - supported research organization WestEd .
Nor did bilingual - education proponents pause long before counterevidence .
In 1965 , just as the movement was getting under way in the United States , the Canadian province of Quebec decided that not enough Quebecois children were learning French .
It instituted the most efficient method for overcoming that deficit : immersion .
Young English - speaking students started spending their school days in all - French classes , emerging into English teaching only after having absorbed French .
By all accounts , the immersion schools have been successful .
And no wonder : the simple insight of immersion is that the more one practices a new language , the better one learns it .
Students at America ’s most prestigious language academy , the Middlebury Language Schools , pledge not to speak a word of English once the program begins , even if they are beginners in their target languages .
“ If you go back to speaking English , the English patterns will reassert themselves and interfere with acquisition of the new grammatical patterns , ” explains Middlebury vice president Michael Geisler .
McGill professor Genesee — who opposed Prop. 227 in 1998 , when he was directing the education school at the University of California at Davis — hates it when proponents of English immersion in America point to the success of French immersion in Quebec .
The English - speaking Quebecois do n’t risk losing English , Genesee says , since it remains the predominant Canadian tongue and is a “ high - prestige language . ”
Whereas if you start American Hispanics off in English , Genesee maintains , “ they wo n’t want to speak Spanish ” because it is a “ stigmatized , low - prestige language . ”
Genesee ’s argument exposes the enduring influence of Chicano political activism on academic bilingual theory .
Hispanic students do risk losing their home tongue when taught in the majority language .
Such linguistic oblivion has beset second - and third - generation immigrants throughout American history — not because of the relative status of their home languages but simply because of the power of language immersion and the magnetic force of the public culture .
But bilingual - ed proponents know that most Americans do n’t view preserving immigrants ’ home tongues as a school responsibility .
So they publicly promote bilingual education as a pedagogically superior way to teach Hispanics English and other academic subjects , even as they privately embrace the practice as a means for ensuring that Hispanic students preserve their Spanish .
The early Chicano activists sought the “ replacement of assimilationist ideals . . . with cultural pluralism , ” writes University of Houston history professor Guadalupe San Miguel , Jr. in his book Contested Policy .
Bilingual education was the activists ’ primary weapon in fighting assimilation because , as they rightly understood , English - language teaching is a powerful tool for encouraging assimilation .
In a country as diverse as the United States , fluency in the common tongue is an essential bond among citizens , and the experience of learning it alongside classmates of different ethnic origins reinforces the message that Americans share a common culture .
Bilingual - ed proponents often accuse immersion advocates of opposing multilingualism or wanting to stamp out Spanish .
This is nonsense .
But it is true that maintaining students ’ home language for the sake of strengthened ethnic identity is no part of a school ’s mandate .
Its primary language duty , rather , is to ensure that citizens can understand one another and participate in democracy .
Despite its conceptual contradictions , bilingual education spread inexorably through the federal and state education bureaucracies .
The National Education Association , undoubtedly whiffing a jobs bonanza for its unionized members , produced a report in 1966 arguing that teaching Hispanic children in English hurt their self - esteem and led to underachievement .
In 1968 , Congress passed the Bilingual Education Act , which provided federal funds for bilingual teaching .
When not enough school districts applied for the funds , advocacy groups sued , claiming that the districts were violating Hispanic children ’s civil rights .
The federal Department of Education agreed , issuing rules in 1975 that penalized schools for not establishing bilingual programs for their non-English - speaking students .
Though the Reagan administration cut back on several bilingual - education mandates from the Ford and Carter years , the federal bilingual bureaucracy remained firmly entrenched for decades .
In California , which contains the vast majority of the country ’s so - called English learners — students from homes where a language other than English is regularly spoken — the rise of the bilingual machine was swift and decisive .
The 1976 Chacon - Moscone Bilingual - Bicultural Education
Act declared that bilingual education was the right of every English learner .
Elementary schools had to provide native - language instruction if they enrolled a certain number of English learners ; bilingual education in the lower grades became the default mode for anyone with a Hispanic surname .
( Hispanics have always dominated the “ English learner ” category .
In California , they make up 85 percent of all English learners ; the next - largest language group — Vietnamese — constitutes just 2.4 percent . )
Even after Governor George Deukmejian refused to reauthorize the Chacon - Moscone bill in 1987 , the bilingual establishment in Sacramento continued to enforce the law ’s mandates .
The state ’s department of education sponsored numerous conferences and reports alleging that bilingual education was necessary for Hispanic success and showered an additional $ 5,000 a year on bilingual teachers .
Administrators and teachers in heavily Hispanic areas often saw themselves as part of the Chicano empowerment movement .
“ You were n’t worthwhile if you did n’t speak Spanish , ” recalls a Santa Ana teacher .
“ The attitude was : ‘ No one should teach our kids but native language speakers . ’ ”
Bilingual - education theory posits a carefully calibrated , multiyear transition from all - Spanish to all - English classes , with the proportion of each language changing every year .
An exacting realization of that theory with highly qualified teachers would likely not do irremediable harm — precisely because children are language sponges .
But the reality of bilingual education in California was very different .
Many low - skilled native Spanish speakers were lured into the education profession by the generous stipends available to bilingual teachers , but they did n’t speak English well enough to make the transition into English teaching .
English instruction , when it happened at all , was haphazard and unsystematic , recalls Jane Barboza , director of Student Support Services for the Green Dot Charter Schools .
“ It was left to the end of the day or to the playground .
You ’d sing ‘ Old MacDonald , ’ accompanied by a guitar , ” she says .
Jose Hernandez , the elementary education coordinator for District Six in the Los Angeles Unified School District , admits : “ We never implemented bilingual education with the idea of moving kids into English ; we were n’t great at delivering the dual - language aspect of it . ”
Such problems were not lost on parents .
In 1996 , a group of them in the Ninth Street Elementary School in downtown L.A. tried to remove their children from all - Spanish classes and place them in English immersion .
When their letters and petitions produced no response , 63 families , organized by poverty advocate Alice Callahan , pulled their children out of classes in protest .
The school was jeopardizing their children ’s futures by not teaching them English , these poor Central American garment workers maintained .
Case in point : after six years in Ninth Street ’s “ bilingual ” program , reported Jill Stewart in New Times LA , a fifth - grader wrote the following passage for his English class : “ I my parens per mi in dis shool en I so feol essayrin too old in the shool my border o reri can grier das mony putni gire and I sisairin aliro sceer . ”
( In fairness to bilingual education , whole - language theory should probably share the blame for that gibberish .
Whole language , then dominant in California schools , holds that children should not be instructed — and by no means corrected — in phonics , grammar , or spelling . )
The Ninth Street boycott caught the attention of Silicon Valley software entrepreneur Ron Unz .
Stunned to learn that schools were imprisoning children in Spanish classes against their parents ’ will , Unz , along with Santa Ana teacher Gloria Mata Tuchman , drafted a ballot initiative that mandated that all children be taught “ overwhelmingly ” in English and integrated into mainstream classes , following one year of specialized English instruction .
Waivers for bilingual education would be granted only on an individual basis , following a parental request and a school certification that the child had “ special . . . needs ” that made a bilingual setting more appropriate .
Unz could not refrain from an ironic jab at bilingual theory : “ All children in California public schools shall be taught English by being taught in English , ” announced the English for the Children Act .
The national bilingual - education establishment reacted with fury .
Unz was a nativist who wanted to eradicate Spanish and drive out immigrants , it charged .
Dismantling bilingual education would put “ generations at risk , ” as the title of a 1998 educrat conference convened by the University of California at Riverside proclaimed .
Joseph Jaramillo , staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , told the Los Angeles Times that the proposition “ would send many California schools into crisis because they would be stripped of the very tools necessary to bring children into the mainstream . ”
The establishment pointed to studies that showed that bilingual education produced better results than English immersion — and it still points to them whenever challenged .
But according to Russell Gersten , an expert in educational - research design , most evaluations in the bilingual - ed field are “ poorly constructed and utterly unpersuasive , consisting of makeshift , descriptive research open to multiple interpretations . ”
Manhattan Institute senior fellow Jay Greene conducted a meta-analysis of the extant studies in 1998 .
After winnowing out the vast majority on quality grounds , he found a slight edge to bilingual education in conveying academic content .
But the programs he reviewed were irrelevant to California ’s version of bilingual education , Greene says : “ Most were highly resource - intensive pilot programs from the 1960s that resembled French écoles or Jewish day schools .
They attracted high - quality teachers and were accountable for results . ”
Furthermore , most comparisons of bilingual and immersion methods have an inherent bias , since bilingual regimes exempt the lowest - performing English learners from taking tests in English until the teacher deems them ready , whereas immersion regimes test a far greater percentage of English learners .
The establishment marshaled President Bill Clinton and California ’s political elite from both parties against Prop. 227 .
Unions lined up in opposition .
The California Teachers Association contributed $ 2.1 million to defeat the initiative ; the American Federation of Labor also pitched in .
Jerrold Perenchio , chair of Spanish - language media conglomerate Univision , gave $ 1.5 million , perhaps out of a sincere belief that bilingual education was the best means of teaching his audience English .
All told , those opposed to 227 spent close to $ 5 million , while the pro-227 forces spent less than $ 1 million , most of it from Unz ’s own account .
The vote was n’t even close .
The initiative passed , 61 to 39 percent .
Though preelection polls showed 60 percent of Latinos supporting Prop. 227 , only 37 percent voted for it in the end .
Many may have been moved at the last minute by claims that the measure was anti-immigrant .
Lawsuits to invalidate or water down 227 began the day after the vote and have continued ever since .
Outside the courthouse , efforts to torpedo the initiative were hardly more subtle .
The Los Angeles County Office of Education ruled that teaching “ overwhelmingly in English ” meant teaching in English for 51 percent of the school day ; the Riverside and Vista school districts made that 60 percent .
Soliciting waivers from parents to put their children back into bilingual classes became so successful a crusade in some districts that the bilingual teaching load barely budged .
The bureaucratic resistance was n’t able to suppress the good news , however .
In Los Angeles , young Hispanic pupils placed in immersion were absorbing spoken English far more quickly than expected and were starting to read and write in English as well , their teachers told the Los Angeles Times .
The Oceanside school district , on the Pacific coast north of San Diego , became the emblem for the new English immersion .
Superintendent Kenneth Noonan , a former bilingual teacher himself and cofounder of the California Association of Bilingual Education , had opposed Prop. 227 , but once it passed , he determined that Oceanside would follow the law to the letter .
He applied the criteria for granting bilingual waivers strictly and ended up creating no Spanish - taught classes .
He then sat back with considerable trepidation and waited .
“ Trained bilingual teachers started calling me , ” he says .
“ ‘ You ’ve got to see what ’s happening down here , ’ they said .
I thought : ‘ I guess it ’s true , the sky has fallen . ’ ” But when Noonan visited their classrooms , he found that these new converts to immersion were “ glowing with a sense of success . ”
The first four months were difficult , Noonan recalls , but then the students took off .
Second - grade test scores in reading rose nearly 100 percent in two years — with the average student moving from California ’s 13th percentile to its 24th — after staying flat for years .
These accomplishments did n’t stop protesters from holding candlelight vigils outside the Oceanside school board ’s offices and from filing federal and state civil rights complaints challenging the district ’s strict waiver policies .
Those complaints were eventually rejected .
Oceanside and its inland neighbor , the Vista Unified School District , formed a natural experiment of sorts .
Advocates in Vista actively solicited waivers , and Vista officials granted them to everyone who asked , so that half the eligible students remained in bilingual education .
Oceanside ’s test - score increases from 1998 to 2000 were at least double those of Vista in nearly every grade , reported the New York Times , despite the districts ’ similar English - learner populations — low - income , largely agricultural Spanish speakers .
Critics dismissed Oceanside ’s test - score gains as nothing remarkable .
But today , the Vista Unified School District has shrunk its bilingual program to minimal proportions , and its coordinator of English - language development —
Matt Doyle , another former bilingual teacher — speaks like an immersion true believer : “ Almost all our students come at such an early age that it ’s the perfect opportunity to develop English . ”
Two broad observations about the aftermath of Prop. 227 are incontestable .
First : despite desperate efforts at stonewalling by bilingual diehards within school bureaucracies , the incidence of bilingual education in California has dropped precipitously — from enrolling 30 percent of the state ’s English learners to enrolling 4 percent .
( Bilingual proponents love to cite the “ low ” 30 percent figure as proof that the 1998 reform was unnecessary — but that figure includes all grades from kindergarten through 12th .
Bilingual ed was always concentrated heavily in the elementary grades and rare in high school ; in some districts , nearly all young Hispanic pupils were enrolled in it . )
Second : California ’s English learners have made steady progress on a range of tests since 1998 .
That progress is all the more impressive since school districts can no longer keep their lowest - performing English learners out of the testing process .
In 1998 , 29 percent of school districts submitted under half of their English learners to the statewide reading and writing test ; today , close to 100 percent of the state ’s English learners participate .
Despite this , the performance of English learners has improved significantly , from 10 percent scoring “ proficient ” or “ advanced ” ( the top two categories ) in 2003 to 20 percent in 2009 .
Similarly , on the English proficiency test given to nonnative speakers , the fraction of English learners scoring as “ early advanced ” or “ advanced ” ( the top two categories ) has increased from 25 percent in 2001 , when the test was first administered , to 39 percent this year .
If the critics of Prop. 227 have the burden of proof to substantiate their warnings of catastrophe , they clearly have n’t met it .
But the bilingual advocates have a number of ways — some valid , others specious — to dismiss or complicate the significance of these broad trends .
Drawing unassailable , detailed statistical conclusions about the consequences of 227 may be impossible , given a host of shortcomings in the data .
If you wanted to devise conditions that would make it impossible to resolve definitively the immersion - versus - bilingual - ed debate , California ’s school policies are what you would create .
The largest obstacle is California ’s failure to keep longitudinal information on students .
Thanks to pressure from teachers ’ unions , the state cannot track a cohort of students or a single student over time .
( Such a capacity would be necessary if California were to start awarding teachers merit pay , a bane of unions . )
From one year to the next , all data about a specific student — his test scores , say , or whether he was taught in English or Spanish — disappears .
Further , even if you could track students ’ progress , you would have to account for the fact that students who enrolled in bilingual education after 227 have tended to enter school with weaker language skills than immersion students .
This means that test scores that appear to show a clear advantage to immersion — in 2009 , for example , only 19 percent of bilingual - ed students scored “ advanced ” or “ early advanced ” on the English - proficiency test , compared with 43 percent of immersion students — can be dismissed by bilingual advocates as comparing apples with oranges .
Second , all the tests currently used to measure students ’ skills were implemented after 227 , and all have been changed or replaced at least once since they were first developed .
No test spans the pre- and post - 227 period .
Finally , after 227 , California and the federal government introduced educational and accountability reforms that changed how schools interacted with students .
California began measuring schools ’ performance through test results in 1999 and progressively developed more sophisticated means for holding schools accountable .
Soon thereafter , the state developed standards for what children should learn in each grade .
And it began shifting from whole - language ideology toward phonics instruction for teaching reading .
In 2002 , the federal No Child Left Behind act ( NCLB ) imposed even more stringent demands on schools , requiring that they improve the test scores of black and Hispanic students and English learners ; the result was an intense focus on English learners , accompanied by new programs and funding .
Bilingual proponents argue that English learners ’ rising test scores in the 2000s reflect these other developments , not the switch to English instruction .
One cannot defeat that claim statistically , since no control group exists not taught under the new federal and state standards .
But a key fact weakens the bilingual advocates ’ case : school districts have cut back on their waivered bilingual programs in order to meet their annual test - score targets .
In 2006 , for example , the Lennox School District , near the Los Angeles International Airport , announced that its persistent designation under NCLB as underperforming had prompted it to stop promiscuously handing out waivers for bilingual education .
To bilingual backers , among them the California Association of Bilingual Education , this change of policy — repeated elsewhere throughout Southern California — illustrated how destructive NCLB was .
But the schools may know something about the efficacy of bilingual education that the advocates do not .
This grassroots move to English immersion was a repudiation of the claim that the best way to teach nonnative speakers English skills is to teach them in Spanish .
The schools that have abandoned bilingual education have not regretted it .
Every school that has done so in Los Angeles ’s District 6 has improved its rating on California ’s 800 - point Academic Performance Index at least 150 points , says district elementary coordinator Hernandez .
The bilingual industry also argues that Prop. 227 has failed in its mission because the gap between English learners and native English speakers on statewide reading and math tests has n’t closed .
“ The 227 advocates were n’t saying : ‘ Children are n’t learning English ’ ; they were saying : ‘ Look at their reading and math scores : they ’re failing , ’ ” asserts Shelly Spiegel - Coleman , director of Californians Together , the state ’s most powerful bilingual - education advocacy group .
But Spiegel - Coleman is engaging in revisionist history here .
Unz and others were clearly decrying Hispanic students ’ lack of English proficiency .
Moreover , the distinction between learning English and showing proficiency in reading and math is undoubtedly far subtler than most voters were making .
But the “ persistent test - score gap ” argument has a more fundamental flaw .
California defines English learners as students who are less than fluent in English and who occupy the bottom rungs of reading and math achievement .
To be reclassified out of English - learner status , a student must score well not just on the test of English proficiency but also on statewide reading and math tests .
As soon as a student becomes more capable academically , he leaves the English - learner pool and enters a new category : Reclassified Fluent English Proficient , or RFEP .
By fiat , then , the English - learner pool contains only the weakest students , whereas the native - speaker pool contains the entire range of students , from the highest achievers to the lowest .
Eliminating the gap between English learners and native speakers ( known as “ English only ” students ) is logically impossible .
A fairer test of how English learners are performing in relation to English - only speakers would combine English learners and RFEP students into one category and compare them with the English - only students .
Yet this the state does not do .
The test - score gap between English learners and English - only students is so large that even narrowing it significantly would take Herculean efforts .
In 2003 , recall , 10 percent of English learners scored “ proficient ” or above in a statewide reading and writing test .
By 2009 , 20 percent of them did , a 100 percent improvement .
During the same time , English - only students improved their performance on the same test only 32 percent , from 44 percent proficient or above to 58 .
The gap between the two groups nevertheless grew from 34 to 38 percentage points , because gains in the English - only category started from such a higher base level than those of the English learners .
Notwithstanding the complexities and inadequacies of the data and the persistence of the achievement gap , the steady advance of English learners on both English proficiency and academic tests vindicates Prop. 227 .
Had the near - elimination of bilingual education been the disaster that the bilingual advocates predicted , the state and federal accountability measures that they now tout as responsible for English learners ’ improvement could not have made up for the loss of bilingual instruction .
Prop. 227 changed the debate in California ; widespread bilingual education is no longer on the agenda .
To be sure , some die - hard districts are quietly trying to increase Spanish - language classes without attracting attention , but they are in the minority .
In public , the bilingual industry finds itself reduced to fighting rearguard actions , such as demanding NCLB tests in Spanish or separate textbooks ( in English ) for English learners .
Californians
Together does not even mention bilingual education in the statement of purpose posted on its website .
Asked if students should be back in Spanish classes , Spiegel - Coleman demurs : “ I ’m not suggesting that teaching them in Spanish would solve the problems . ”
And the transformation in the classroom has to be seen to be believed .
It is extraordinary , for example , to observe elementary school teachers in Santa Ana , once a bastion of bilingual education , talking to their young Hispanic students exclusively in English about the Great Wall of China .
It is just as extraordinary to see those students eagerly raising their hands to read English workbooks aloud in class .
The main sign that the students are not native English speakers is an occasional reminder about past - tense formation or the pronunciation of word endings , but plenty of English - only speakers in the state need such assistance , too .
Schools are not universally following the time frame set out in Prop. 227 : a year of separate instruction in English followed by integration with English - only students .
In some schools , English learners remain cloistered for a longer period .
But regardless of classroom composition , English learners are being taught “ overwhelmingly in English , ” which is the most important goal of 227 .
Self - esteem seems fine .
“ I did n’t know how to speak English in first grade , ” says a husky fourth - grade boy at Adams Elementary School in Santa Ana .
“ I just figured out at the end of the year and talked all English . ”
The boy ’s classmates , who are sitting next to him at a picnic table under a pepper tree for lunch , jostle to get in on the interview .
They are fluent in schoolyard insults .
“ He ’s a special ed ! ” one boy says of another .
“ I am not a special ed , you liar ! ” retorts the target .
The fifth - grade girls at a table nearby complain that the boys are lazy .
A slender girl has recently arrived from Mexico .
Her translator for that day , a tiny blue - eyed girl named Lily , drapes her arm lovingly around the new immigrant and will sit next to her in all their classes , explaining what the teacher is saying .
The pair and their fellow pupils amble back into the school after lunch , any signs of psychological distress well concealed .
No one reports unhappiness at speaking English in class ; on the contrary , they brag that it ’s easy .
Such students are clearly better off liberated from California ’s inept version of bilingual education .
But though test scores have risen , the educational situation for Hispanics remains troubling .
Bilingual ed has come and gone , but the conditions that provided the pretext for it —
Hispanics ’ low academic achievement , high drop - out rates , and gang involvement — live on .
The academic problems afflicting many so - called English learners do not necessarily result from speaking Spanish at home .
Students who were born here , who speak little or no Spanish , and who have been taught in English all their lives continue to be designated English learners in middle and high school because of poor test scores .
They sound fluent in English , yet may read at a second - grade level .
Their vocabulary is highly constricted .
As a result , the term “ English learner ” has taken on an unofficial new meaning : a student who knows English but whose academic skills are extremely low .
( Indeed , the state bureaucracy has started referring to some black students whose academic struggles resemble those of Hispanic English learners as “ standard English learners . ” )
A 2006 report by the National Literacy Panel concluded that the literacy problems of many officially designated English learners reflect “ underlying processing deficits , ” such as “ difficulties with phonological awareness and working memory , ” rather than language - minority status .
The math skills of long - term English learners are as shaky as their reading and writing abilities , also suggesting that their academic shortcomings stem from something other than hearing a second language at home .
It is easy to find such students in Southern California : at ease in spoken English but at sea in what the education profession calls “ academic English ” — the conventions of writing , logic , and argument .
A 17 - year - old with lustrous auburn hair hanging below his shoulders and several lip studs is performing skateboard tricks outside Locke High School in Watts .
Though his father ’s family is exclusively Spanish - speaking , he speaks with the intonations of a black rapper and avoids Spanish .
“ Spanish is hard , man ! ” he explains .
He failed ninth - grade English : “ I did n’t do the homework ; I ’m not a baby no more . ”
Manny , a ninth - grader in Santa Ana , remains designated an English learner even though he has never been taught in Spanish and was born in the United States .
He failed English last year , he says , “ because I would mess on some problem ; I did n’t do my work . ”
California schools could do far more to improve the performance of such students .
Progressive pedagogy continues to handicap their chances of academic mastery .
Though the California school system has , in theory , renounced whole - language ideology in favor of phonics instruction , long - term English learners ’ phonemic awareness remains weak , high school teachers say .
Grammar is not taught systematically or explicitly enough .
Separating students by ability levels is taboo , so English learners and RFEP students with academic potential stay tethered to the low performers .
This summer , I observed some excellent teaching in Southern California classrooms .
Santa Ana High School ’s Brian Lilly stands out for his enthusiastic presentation of the joys of grammar ( “ Do you see how useful prepositional phrases are , people ?
They add detail to sentences ” ) and for his carefully controlled colloquies with students ( the antithesis of progressive “ student - centered learning ” ) .
Yet in other classrooms , I saw mindless collaborative learning exercises and lethargic traditional instruction , with teachers mechanically copying phrases into their PowerPoint projectors or asking students to alphabetize vocabulary lists .
The culture that many Hispanic students bring to school , especially as they age , also hinders progress .
Many high school teachers have a sense of futility about assigning homework .
“ I give them silent reading time in class because they ’re not reading at home , ” a teacher at Los Angeles ’s Oscar De La Hoya Animo charter school tells me .
Some students who unself - consciously speak English in elementary school start using Spanish again in middle and high school .
Gangbangers use Spanish in class to issue threats in teacher - proof code ; other students take up Spanish again as an assertion of Hispanic identity .
Under pressure from the No Child Left Behind act , California school districts are ramping up this year for another costly assault on the English - learner test - score gap — sending specialists to work with middle school students , establishing separate academies for Hispanic males , and increasing outreach to parents .
Whether those efforts will achieve the act ’s goal of closing the achievement gap remains to be seen .
The fact remains , however , that the English for the Children Act has swept away a misguided drag on assimilation and routed a once - powerful educrat interest group .
The significant rise in English learners ’ test scores since 1998 demonstrates that bilingual education is not necessary for Hispanic progress .
Proposition 227 represents a triumph of common sense over one of the more counterintuitive pedagogical theories to emerge from the sixties ’ political agitation .

CHANGE is in the air .
A new communications technology threatens a dramatic upheaval in America 's newspaper industry , overturning the status quo and disrupting the business model that has served the industry for years .
This “ great revolution ” , warns one editor , will mean that some publications “ must submit to destiny , and go out of existence . ”
With many American papers declaring bankruptcy in the past few months , their readers and advertisers lured away by cheaper alternatives on the internet , this doom - laden prediction sounds familiar .
But it was in fact made in May 1845 , when the revolutionary technology of the day was not the internet — but the electric telegraph .
It was only a year earlier , in May 1844 , that Samuel Morse had connected Washington , DC , and Baltimore by wire and sent the first official message , in dots and dashes : “ WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT ” .
The second message sent down Morse 's line was of more practical value , however : “ HAVE YOU ANY NEWS ” .
( There was no question - mark in Morse 's original alphabet . )
As a network of wires spread across the country , referred to as “ the great highway of thought ” by one contemporary observer , it was obvious that this new technology was going to have a huge impact on the newspaper industry .
But would the telegraph be friend or foe ?
James Gordon Bennett , the editor of the New York Herald and author of the gloomy prediction of May 1845 , concluded that the telegraph would put many newspapers out of business .
“ In regard to the newspaper press , it will experience to a degree , that must in a vast number of cases be fatal , the effects of the new mode of circulating intelligence , ” he wrote .
He returned to his theme in another editorial in July .
“ All those papers which serve merely as vehicles of intelligence will be destroyed , ” he declared .
“ The scissors - and - paste journalism of the country will be annihilated . ”
The telegraph posed a threat to the newspapers ' hard - won control of the news , itself a relatively recent development .
In the early 1800s newspapers were astonishingly slow .
They received news by post , some as reports from correspondents but mostly by copying old stories from other newspapers as part of an exchange system .
The Weekly Herald , recalling the 1820s , noted that “ the newspapers of that day relied altogether upon their exchanges for news , and , of course , the intelligence which they gave the readers was meagre , stale and unsatisfactory . ”
Foreign news , if any , was usually several weeks old .
Some local papers even varied publication schedules to suit the editor 's social life .
The most avid collectors of news were businessmen , some of whom acted as correspondents to papers .
But merchants who passed on news in this way would already have made use of it , and they kept anything that was still commercially valuable to themselves .
Some merchants exchanged information with each other in special clubs , called newsrooms , in which items of interest ( the arrival of particular ships , say , or reports from abroad ) were recorded in shared books to be accessed by paying subscribers only .
Journalists would sometimes frequent such newsrooms to pick up stories .
But they rarely sought out news themselves .
Things began to change in the late 1820s as two New York papers , the Journal of Commerce and the Courier and Enquirer , began to compete for business readers .
Both started to use pony expresses to deliver news from other cities , and fast boats to meet incoming vessels and get foreign news a few hours early .
In the 1830s competition intensified with the establishment of the “ penny press ” papers , which were cheaper than the business ones and catered to a much wider audience .
Bennett , the founder of the New York Herald , agreed to pay one of his sources $ 500 for every hour by which he beat other papers in getting news from Europe .
Elaborate ruses involving fast boats , carrier pigeons , express trains and even semaphore systems meant that papers , not businessmen , started getting the news first .
Editors boasted about the timeliness of their news , and how they had beaten other papers to it .
When the Journal of Commerce arrived in Boston by mail , merchants would fight to see it : one eyewitness reported seeing “ crowds , in Topliff 's News - room in Boston , disagreeably elbowing each other around the file of the Journal of Commerce , on the arrival of the New York mail . ”
Newspapers were democratising information .
Bennett once declared that “ speculators should not have the advantage of earlier news than the public at large . ”
The telegraph , it seemed , would put an end to this productive rivalry .
Raw news and market information would now arrive first at the telegraph office ; papers , along with merchants and everyone else , would have to queue for it .
Telegraph firms would establish a new monopoly over news delivery , and would sell early access to the news to the highest bidder .
Papers would be unable to compete .
Circulation would decline and advertisers would flee .
The democratisation of news would be undone .
There was hope , however .
Bennett believed that a few papers which provided commentary and analysis ( including the Herald ) would survive .
“ The telegraph may not affect magazine literature , nor those newspapers that have some peculiar characteristic , ” he predicted .
But he warned that “ mere newspapers ” , which simply reported the news , were doomed .
He was not alone in this view .
The Alexandria Gazette opined that the telegraph would henceforth deliver the raw news , leaving newspapers to “ examining causes , tracing effects , enlightening the judgments , and directing the reflections of men . ”
It seemed that the only way to survive was to offer analysis and opinion , or to focus on events in a narrow field , too obscure to merit coverage by telegraphic news services .
A reshaping of the entire industry appeared to be imminent .
Not such bad news after all
The telegraph did indeed reshape the newspaper industry , but not in the way that Bennett and others had predicted .
For although telegraph wires could deliver news more rapidly than ever , they had a “ last mile ” problem : they could not disseminate news quickly to thousands of people .
Only printed newspapers could do that .
Far from putting papers out of business , the telegraph actually made them more attractive and increased their sales .
For the first time it became possible to read up - to - date business and political news within hours of its occurrence .
“ We live in a transition period of society , ” declared the New York Herald on May 7th 1846 .
“ In yesterday 's paper we published the intelligence of the proceedings of Congress of the preceding day , simultaneously with the newspapers which are published in Washington city itself — 220 miles distant . ”
For fast - moving stories , papers would print “ extra ” editions with updates sent by telegraph .
Predictions that newspapers would henceforth favour analysis and opinion over news also got things exactly backwards .
Instead , the balance tipped towards the latest news .
In 1851 Horace Greeley , the editor of the New York Tribune , told a British parliamentary committee that “ the quickest news is the one looked to . ”
Did that mean , he was asked , that “ the leading article has not then so much influence as it has in England ? ”
No , said Greeley .
“ The telegraphic dispatch is the great point . ”
When the first transatlantic telegraph link was established in 1858 , one of the first messages sent from America was “ PRAY GIVE US SOME NEWS FOR NEW YORK , THEY ARE MAD FOR NEWS . ”
The quicker the news could be delivered , and the more distant the events it described , the better .
“ To the press the electric telegraph is an invention of immense value , ” one journalist observed in 1868 .
“ It gives you the news before the circumstances have had time to alter .
The press is enabled to lay it fresh before the reader like a steak hot from the gridiron , instead of being cooled and rendered flavourless by a slow journey from a distant kitchen . ”
Predictions that papers would favour analysis and opinion over news were exactly backwards
But some felt the obsession with speed went too far ; there were concerns that the freshness of news , often from far away , was taking precedence over relevance .
The Alpena Echo , a small newspaper in Michigan , cut off its telegraph service because “ it could not tell why the telegraph company caused it to be sent a full account of a flood in Shanghai , a massacre in Calcutta , a sailor fight in Bombay , hard frosts in Siberia , a missionary banquet in Madagascar , the price of kangaroo leather from Borneo , and a lot of nice cheerful news from the Archipelagoes — and not a single line about the Muskegon fire . ”
Writing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1891 , W.J. Stillman , a journalist and critic , decried the effects of the telegraph on his profession .
“ America has in fact transformed journalism from what it once was , the periodical expression of the thought of the time , the opportune record of the questions and answers of contemporary life , into an agency for collecting , condensing and assimilating the trivialities of the entire human existence , ” he moaned .
“ The frantic haste with which we bolt everything we take , seconded by the eager wish of the journalist not to be a day behind his competitor , abolishes deliberation from judgment and sound digestion from our mental constitutions .
We have no time to go below surfaces , and as a general thing no disposition . ”
What of the fears that telegraph companies would establish a monopoly over news ?
These too proved to be unfounded : there were one or two attempts by telegraph companies to set up news services , but telegraph operators made pretty hopeless journalists , and stringing up wires and operating networks turned out to be a very different business from collecting news .
Instead , the newspapers themselves took control of delivering news over the wires , with the formation of the Associated Press .
It grew out of a scheme , established in 1846 , to share the costs of reporting on the Mexican war between several New York papers .
Those papers also agreed to co-operate in the gathering of news from approaching ships , in order to reduce their costs .
All this had the effect of reducing the degree of competition between newspapers .
At the same time , the delivery of news by telegraph , and the need for reports that could be shared and printed in any newspaper , whatever its political position , gave rise to a new writing style : brief , to the point and neutral in tone ( or what is now called “ telegraphic ” ) .
The high cost of sending telegrams , at least in the early days of the technology , led to starker , simpler prose .
The main points of a story were summarised , followed by layers of additional detail , in declining order of importance , in an “ inverted pyramid ” .
Whether wire reports were truly more neutral than the more partisan reporting of the pre-telegraphic era is still the subject of academic debate , but they did give the semblance of neutrality .
In the mid-19th century America 's papers were , in any case , shifting towards being less political , in order to appeal to more readers , rather than just those of a particular political persuasion .
This new , telegraphic writing style also influenced public speaking : short sound bites became popular because they were easier for stenographers to transcribe , and cheaper and quicker for reporters to transmit .
Horatio Seymour , the governor of New York and Democratic nominee for president in 1868 , was fond of saying that the art of reporting had killed the art of oratory .
“ And we have to agree that it has at least very much modified the style of public speaking , ” noted the New York Times in 1901 , in an article considering how journalism had changed in the previous century .
An end to speculation ?
Moreover , the advent of the telegraph did away with much of the speculation that had previously been a staple of American newspapers .
The transition was not always smooth .
President James
Polk 's declaration of war on Mexico , reported “ by Electric Telegraph ” , appeared on the front page of the New York Herald on May 12th 1846 , for example .
But on the next page was a letter from Washington , already overtaken by events , speculating about what the president might do .
In the edition of June 7th , a telegraphic report told of the American victory at Matamoros ; but in the same issue there were reports ruminating about the Americans ' difficult position in the battle .
The telegraph “ may help speculation in commercial affairs , but it will interfere very often with the speculations of the newspapers ” , observed the Public Ledger in 1858 .
“ This being brought into contact , daily , with facts , will upset a great many fancies , and give a pre-eminence of the factual over the imaginative . ”
Speculation about the course of the second opium war between Britain and China , based on reports several months old , was rendered obsolete overnight by the completion of the transatlantic cable , which had delivered the news that the war was over .
“ Some of the comments , compared with the actual facts , were found not to be so sagacious as they were supposed to be . ”
This would , said the Public Ledger , make journalism “ more cautious in its comments upon public events abroad ” .

Politicians also had to be watchful once their words were circulated by telegraph .
Offhand comments could not be disclaimed and they could no longer alter speeches for local consumption .
“ By the power of the telegraph … the public utterances of public men in the furthest sections of the Union are …subjected to the criticism of the great centres of population and political activity in all their details , ” noted the New York Times in September 1859 .
“ The telegraph gives the speaker in the furthest East or West an audience as wide as the Union .
He is talking to all America…immediately , and literally with the emphasis of lightning . ”
What lessons does the telegraph hold for newspapers now grappling with the internet ?
The telegraph was first seen as a threat to papers , but was then co-opted and turned to their advantage .
“ The telegraph helped contribute to the emergence of the modern newspaper , ” says Ford Risley , head of the journalism department at Penn State University .
“ People began to expect the latest news , and a newspaper could not succeed if it was not timely . ”
Today , papers are doing their best to co-opt the internet .
They have launched online editions , set up blogs and encouraged dialogue with readers .
Like the telegraph , the internet has changed the style of reporting and forced papers to be more timely and accurate , and politicians to be more consistent .
Again there is talk of news being commoditised and of the need to focus on analysis and opinion , or on a narrow subject area .
And again there are predictions of the death of the newspaper , with hand - wringing about the implications for democracy if fewer publications exist to challenge those in authority or expose wrongdoing .
The internet may kill newspapers ; but it is not clear if that matters .
The news business will survive
The internet may kill newspapers ; but it is not clear if that matters .
For society , what matters is that people should have access to news , not that it should be delivered through any particular medium ; and , for the consumer , the faster it travels , the better .
The telegraph hastened the speed at which news was disseminated .
So does the internet .
Those in the news business use the new technology at every stage of newsgathering and distribution .
A move to electronic distribution — through PCs , mobile phones and e-readers — has started .
It seems likely only to accelerate .
The trouble is that nobody knows how to make money in the new environment .
That raises questions about how much news will be gathered .
But there is no sign of falling demand for news , and technology has cut the cost of collecting and distributing it , so the supply is likely to increase .
The internet is shaking up the news business , as the telegraph did ; in the same way , mankind will be better informed about his fellow humans than before .
If paper editions die , then Bennett 's prediction that communications technology would be the death of newspapers will be belatedly proved right .
But that is not the same as the death of news .
In the summer of 2007 , a representative for Tiger Woods called an editor at Golf Digest with some awkward news .
Though the magazine was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to secure preferential access to Mr. Woods , the golfer had agreed to a rare , in - depth interview and cover shoot with another publication , Men 's Fitness .
Golf Digest editor Jerry Tarde acknowledged that he was " mystified " that Mr. Woods had agreed to this .
Under Golf Digest 's contract with Mr. Woods , the monthly , which ...
France was paying tribute tonight to one of its greatest intellectuals , the social anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss , who has died at the age of 100 .
The structuralist thinker , who devoted his five - decade career to the study of the human species around the world , is credited with having revolutionised the study of anthropology for the 20th century .
A statement from Paris 's School for the Advanced Studies of Social Sciences said Lévi-Strauss had passed away at the weekend .
He was less than a month from marking his 101st birthday .
Tonight tributes poured in from across France .
Foreign minister Bernard Kouchner said Lévi-Strauss stood out not only for his scholarly accomplishments but also for his " moral convictions " .
" [ He ] broke with an ethnocentric vision of history and humanity , " Kouchner said .
" At a time when we are trying to give meaning to globalisation , to build a fairer and more humane world , I would like Claude Lévi-Strauss 's universal echo to resonate more strongly . "
Hélène Carrère d'Encausse , perpetual secretary of the Académie Française , of which Lévi-Strauss was a member , praised his " extraordinary openness of spirit " .
" He was a thinker , a philosopher ...
We will not find another like him , " she told French radio .
Born into a wealthy French - Jewish family in Brussels in 1908 , Lévi-Strauss went on to become one of the most influential thinkers of his generation in Europe .
His structuralist method , in which he searched for the underlying patterns in outwardly diverse social rituals and mythology , led him to study the differences - and similarities - between western countries and American Indian and Amazonian tribes .
His career blossomed in the 1950s with the publication in 1955 of Tristes Tropiques , a book hailed by many as one of the greatest works of the century .
In it , he predicted the eventual demise of the human race .
His theories , espoused in a series of highly acclaimed publications including The Savage Mind and the four - part Mythologiques , led to him taking his place in the pantheon of France 's great 20th century thinkers .
He was cited by fellow thinkers Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida , locked horns with Jean - Paul Sartre over the existentialist 's notion of personal freedom , and was praised by Simone de Beauvoir for his then - radical interpretation of women 's role in human kinship .
In 1970 , Cambridge University anthropologist Edmund Leach described Lévi-Strauss as " the most distinguished exponent of this particular academic trade to be found anywhere outside the English - speaking world . "
Old - age led him to regard humanity with the ' serene pessimism ' which he characterised as his attitude to life .
Asked by French radio on his 100th birthday last year , he said he would have preferred to let the occasion pass by unmarked .
" Birthdays at this age have no longer have any raison d'être because there is no reason to celebrate a further step into physical and intellectual degeneration , " he said .
Perhaps in a reflection of this desire for a lack of show , Philippe Descola , who succeeds Lévi-Strauss at the head of the social anthropology laboratory at the prestigious Collège de France , said his funeral had already taken place in Burgundy , before his death had been made public .
For a company which has never built a four - cylinder uncompromising sports machine before , this first effort is incredible .
With its combination of breathtaking power , agile handling and incredible rider assistance technologies , BMW ’s S 1000 RR could well become the benchmark sportsbike against which all others are compared .
Where better to take a first ride of this monster than the glorious Portimao racetrack in Portugal , with a wet morning to test the amazing Race ABS and traction control systems , and a dry afternoon to open BMW 's sportiest bike ever up to its full 193 - horsepower motherlode - Cycle Torque 's Nigel Paterson reports from the world press launch .
The BMW S 1000 RR is , of course , the basis for the model Troy Corser and Ruben Xaus have been riding in the Superbike World Championship .
As such , some will dismiss the bike as a ‘ loser ’ because neither rider has been able to put the bike at the top of the podium , but unless you ’re considering building a bike to put on the grid next to Troy and Ruben , you ’d be crazy to do so ; after all , it took Yamaha over 20 years to win its first SWC title , but that has never stopped the R1 being an awesome supersport machine .
Rider Assistance Technology
BMW has long been in front of the pack in the use of technology to make riding safer and more accessible to a greater number of riders .
The most obvious example is anti-lock braking , which is either standard or an option on nearly all BMW ’s road bikes .
With the K 1300 S BMW introduced its Gearshift Assist , which most of us call a quickshift - no need to back off the throttle when changing up , just bang it through and the unit will back off the power just enough to swap cogs .
Also introduced with the K 1300 S was DTC ( Dynamic Traction Control ) .
This system monitors the relative speeds of each wheel and reduces power output when slip is detected – thus reducing the intensity and length of a throttle - induced slide .
While it ca n’t prevent all highside crashes , it ’ll prevent most of them .
For the S 1000 RR , BMW is taking these technologies a few steps further .
The DTC and ABS are a option which adds about AU$ 2,500 to the base price : so it ’s around AU$ 25,000 plus on road costs .
DTC offers four modes - Rain , Sport , Race and Slick .
Out of the crate the system does n’t offer slick - it ’s designed for slick tyres , after all - but it can be activated easily by your dealer ( and is essential if you want to pull big wheelies ) .
Modes are controlled by a button on the left handlebar , and can be changed on the move , too , and the system retains the mode you were in last when re-starting .
Here ’s what BMW says about each mode :
“ When riding on a wet surface with reduced grip , the Rain Mode automatically reduces maximum output to 110 kW ( 150 hp ) .
This mode also provides a particularly homogenous power and torque curve , with engine response and power build - up by the engine being extra-smooth and soft .
When riding on a dry surface the Sport Mode provides full engine output of 142 kW ( 193 hp ) in combination with even more spontaneous and direct response to the throttle .
This mode is intended above all for use on country roads .
The Race Mode has been developed specifically for racing the S 1000 RR on race tracks using street - legal supersports tyres .
Here again the rider benefits from the full power of the engine , with an even more direct and significantly more dynamic response at all speeds .
The Slick Mode is intended exclusively for racing on the track using slick tyres .
Like the Race Mode , this mode not only provides full engine power , but also ensures very direct engine response for racing or riding under race - like conditions .
Contrary to the Race Mode , the Slick Mode allows DTC Dynamic Traction Control to cut in permanently only from a side angle of 20 degrees .
This , in turn , allows the rider to wheelie for up to five seconds when leaning over to an angle of less than 20 degrees , ensuring optimum acceleration and pulling force when accelerating out of a bend . ”
At the launch we certainly had the chance to test the systems , but there ’s a lot to learn and anyone who thinks they can fully understand the implications of all these systems in a single day is kidding themselves , but with a wet track early in the day , we certainly were able to learn a lot about these new technologies .
Firstly , let me say I have never ridden so fast with so much confidence on a wet race track .
On a bike I ’ve never ridden , on a track I had n’t seen and with water all over the surface , I was grateful it was n’t still raining .
But I was having a ball , driving the latest Interact Metzeler tyres hard out of turns and letting the DTC tame down the power delivery .
The result was forward momentum which was shockingly quick for the conditions .
I ’ve always respected BMW ’s ABS systems for road use , and even on a big , heavy bike like the K 1300 S , it ’s OK on a track for ride days .
On the S 1000 RR though it ’s unobtrusive - there if you need it , transparent if you do n’t .
I squeezed the brake lever hard to try to activate the ABS without outbraking myself into a turn or crashing , but all that happened was the bike would slow down , not do anything untoward .
How does it all work ?
This is from BMW ’s press kit : “ Pulling the handbrake lever , the rider activates the double - disc brake at the front , while brake pressure on the rear - wheel brake remains at a low level .
Pressing the footbrake lever , the rider then activates the rear - wheel brake as well .
In the Race and Slick Modes , the rear - wheel lift - off detector does not intervene in the rider ’s braking action , allowing him to apply the brakes even harder whenever required , for example on slightly undulating surfaces and where the motorcycle has adequate grip .
In the Slick Mode the rider still has ABS on both wheels when pulling the handbrake lever alone .
Then , pressing down the footbrake , the particularly experienced rider is able to go into a brake drift without having to forego the benefits of front - wheel ABS .
In other words , ABS no longer cuts in on the rear wheel when pressing down the footbrake lever .
As soon as the rider pulls the handbrake lever , the pressure sensor integrated in the front - wheel control circuit switches on the brake light and the pump , the latter immediately delivering brake fluid through the open valve to the rear wheel circuit .
The pressure set in the rear wheel circuit is measured by a second pressure sensor and is controlled according to the distribution of brake power required and the brake force generated by the rider .
The third pressure sensor in the rear control circuit , finally , measures the brake pressure activated by the rider ‘s foot . ”
The brakes themselves are twin floating 320 mm steel discs gripped by massive radially - mounted Brembo calipers .
Serious stopping power , folks - so much early bite it really took me a while to get used to them .
The rear brake is a 220 mm disc with a single piston caliper– but as I did n’t like the position of the pedal , I did n’t use it much .
Pressure sensors , wheel speed sensors and a myriad of other technology is used to make all these systems work and during the launch they certainly did their job .
I would n’t buy an S 1000 RR without the Race ABS and DTC .
The power
The specifications sheet makes the S1000 sound almost conventional .
Four cylinders inline , DOHC , four titanium valves per cylinder , fuel injection , large bore and short stroke for high revs - this is the formula of the Japanese contenders since they started adopting injection over a decade ago .
But BMW did n’t copy , it innovated .
Intake velocity stacks alter the length of the intake manifold depending on engine rpm , boosting top - end power without crippling bottom end .
A very high compression ratio of 13:1 without problems has contributed to the high performance , but be sure to use premium fuel to get that top performance .
There are lightweight single - cam followers opening the valves which are in turn controlled by a cam driven via an intermediate gear to keep the top-end as light as possible for higher revs .
With a redline at 14,200rpm , BMW appears to have succeeded .
Air is feed into the machine between the headlights , through the frame to the the airbox .
This ram -air effect increases horsepower at high speed by pressurising the airbox and force - feeding air into the engine .
Butterfly valves in the exhaust system control back pressure and noise there ’s a pair of catalytic converters in the collector box near the stumpy muffler .
The net result is a claimed output of 193HP at 13,000rpm .
Go to the top of the class BMW .
There might be a lot of horses available , but they are tightly controlled ponies .
On a wet circuit - admittedly in Rain Mode , which cuts output to 150HP - there ’s usable power down low and a flexible midrange .
Combined with the Dynamic Traction Control and the Race ABS , the S 1000 RR is a very fast motorcycle when there ’s water where you ’d rather it was n’t .
As the track dried out I switched to Sport mode , and the boost in performance - especially at the top end - is immediately apparent .
The S1000 goes from being fast to being a rocketship , launching out of turns and eating up the undulating Portimao circuit .
With the dry track came more revs - it was nice to get out of the midrange and into the blistering top end .
At Portimao the entry to the straight is a long , long downhill righthander which dips down near it ’s entry - you ’ve already got the bike leaned over , hard on the power when you go over this hump , which makes the whole bike go light , making the tyres fight for traction .
And did I mention the entry is blind ?
The fast guys through here have large titanium you - know - whats , and I was n’t one of them , but by my own more modest abilities I was still going fast enough to know I was alive and would prefer to stay that way .
But the S 1000 RR underneath me did n’t care .
It just gripped and drove as hard as I would twist the throttle and by the time we ’d completed the turn , gone back uphill a little onto the straight and headed under the start - finish lights there was close to 250 registering on the big digital speedo .
This bike is seriously fast , in a straight line and around corners .
Transmission
Flicking through the gears on an S1000 is even more fun than it ought to be , thanks to the quickshifter , which is standard on Australian models but not overseas .
There ’s a six - speed ’box with a slipper clutch , all pretty standard form these days in the class .
I did n’t miss a shift during the launch : the quickshifter makes going up as easy as a flick of the boot , the slipper keeps the back end in line if you ’re ham - fisted with the lever under brakes .
Both features make getting around a track that little bit easier and will slice a little off your lap times .
Chassis & Suspension
The powerplant is hung from an alloy chassis .
The main structure of the frame is a pair of large beams joining the swingarm to the steering head .
They go almost vertical before bending once and making a straight line to the steering head .
The suspension is also good .
Made to BMW specifications by Sachs , the fat 46 mm forks , fully adjustable rear shock and awesome , massive , banana - shaped double - sided swingarm which rides in an eccentric mount so it ’s position can be adjusted .
To me , it ’s a beautiful thing .
I want to hang one in my office , so I can look at an example of elegant engineering every time I come to work .
Yes , I know that makes me sound like someone who indulges in too much self - pleasuring , but if I was n’t passionate about the bikes , I would n’t be writing this now …
BMW has learnt from others ’ mistakes - the suspension is clearly marked with numbers so you can see at a glance what the setting is .
No more counting clicks , and you can make some of the adjustments with the bike ’s key , to boot .
Oh , if all suspension was so easy to adjust …
I was disappointed to discover the rear shock ’s preload was n’t so easily adjusted - although BMW assured me there ’s a tool supplied with the bike which makes the job , well , less of a pain .
Personally I think the slight weight penalty paid for an hydraulic adjuster would be worth the few hundred grams , but then I ’m someone who does actually adjust their suspension .
Having said that , I did n’t play with the suspension settings during this launch , at least not enough to come to any conclusions .
With just a handful of track sessions available on a brand new bike on a track I ’d never seen before and the first two of those sessions being wet , I decided fairly early in the day that if the suspension felt OK , I would n’t mess with it much , leaving that sort of fine tuning to my local launch of the bike , which is slated for February .
It was and I did : the bike ’s suspension felt fine , and for someone of my ability - quick road rider , competent on a track , not a racer - it felt like a little tuning with the clickers and preload would make it excellent .
In the real world
The launch of the S 1000 RR did n’t include any riding away from the track , but I ’m willing to make a few predictions .
Firstly , this is typical Supersport , not typical BMW - the riding position , aggressive with low handlebars and high footpegs , wo n’t suit everyone .
The fairing , for all it ’s wind - tunnel developed penetration , will offer little weather protection .
And the compact nature of the S1000 will make it less than perfect for anyone tall - I am , and found the riding position on the track to be OK .
I reckon I ’d prefer a K 1300 S for most road use though .
As a ride day bike the S 1000 RR has gone to the top of my ‘ most desired ’ list .
The combination of high performance , useful technology and active safety make me want one for those high - speed road rides and track use .
What about racing , you ask ?
Not sure yet , is my answer right now .
It will be interesting to see if the optional DTC and Race ABS is permitted by the racing authorities in the Superstock class , and if so it will make this machine very competitive , especially in the wet .
On the other hand , it ’s a new bike from a manufacturer not known for its race bikes , so development could be difficult and frustrating : in that sense it could be a bit of a gamble .
From a value point of view the BMW is more expensive - but not excessively so - than the Japanese machines but cheaper than the higher - specced Italian sportsbikes .
As such , I think it will find a market .
BMW Australia had taken 100 deposits prior to the Sydney Motorcycle Show and is n’t likely to get more than 200 units for the whole year , so if you ’re keen you might have to make a decision fast .
It 's not clear what stock levels will be like worldwide .
Demonstration models should be in dealers during February for you to check out .

I grew up in small - town America , living and loving just about every athletic contest .
I watched , listened , played , read , illustrated ( horribly ) and daydreamed about most of them .
This includes the " Battle of the Network Stars " and " The Superstars " competition , which I took just as seriously as the Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup finals .
Gabe Kaplan was part of my childhood hero roster .
I did n't realize it during my youth , but I was , and still am , enraptured by the marrow of competition , as well as acts of striving , achieving , overcoming , bonding and celebrating .
It 's why my eyes get wet at the end of " The Natural " and " Searching For Bobby Fischer . "
Looking back , the NHL was , without question , the most theatrical of the athletic bunch .
The old arenas were like Sunday cathedrals with their emotive images of blood , sweat and tears accompanied by the intimidating sound track of a haunting organ .
Steve Babineau / NHLI / Getty Images
One image burned on Bucci 's brain : the mask of former Bruins goalie Gerry Cheevers .
In those basilicas of brawn , spirited players engaged in bare - knuckle fighting , and , holy smoke , there were mosh - pit free - for - alls !
One of the indelible images from my youth is witnessing a bench - clearing brawl at a minor league game involving the Johnstown Jets .
It was a field trip for my brother 's Cub Scouts group , and I rode behind the Webelo wake .
I vividly recall a player in the brawl who looked like he was about 62 years old , gray and balding , pinning down an opponent on the ice like he was Jack Palance subduing Billy Crystal .
All of these sticks and bones gave the game ferocity and a uniqueness that could n't be matched .
Football in the 1970s was tough , but these toothless hockey guys had blades on their feet and sticks in their hands .
And most did n't have helmets .
That included goaltender Andy Brown , who was the last goaltender to play in an NHL net without a goalie mask .
That happened when I was 8 , as I rode my bike around town with no helmet and was driven to school without the mandatory use of seat belts .
However , all of the other NHL goalies not named Andy Brown did wear facial protection and few sporting artifacts meant more to me as a child than the early NHL goalie mask .
It had an appeal and gravitational pull that was undeniable .
The creativity , campiness and organic look of early goalie masks helped usher the NHL game into its popular , punk - rock subculture that true fans still long for .
They gave NHL goalies an eerie and creepy look of mystery .
Eyes without a face .
The goalie mask remains the most unique piece of equipment in the history of team sports .
For a child , every NHL game was Halloween .
For an adult in the 1970s , perhaps an " Eyes Wide Shut " reaction .
The goalie mask truly made these men other people , other mysterious things .
To actually slip one on to play street or pickup pond hockey ?
Well , there was nothing cooler .
If players were as market savvy then as they are today , Gerry Cheevers could have sold a million " stitches " masks for $ 20 apiece in the United States and Canada .
He could have bought the Bruins , given himself a raise , bought Wayne " straight cash , homey " Cashman a new Plymouth Duster and never would have had to leave for the WHA .
Where else in professional sports have athletes been permitted to express so much individual personality and nonuniformity ?
Ironically , it was the NHL , where nearly every action of individuality is taught to be repressed for the benefit of the team .
Then again , these were goalies , viewed by some with the scorn and suspicion of an NFL kicker .
I guess the whole paint - my - mask - like - a - growling - tiger thing slipped through the " there is no ' I ' in team " cracks in the ice .
" They are goalies ... whatever . "
Today 's subtle and somewhat cookie - cutter goalie masks with their limited space do n't approach the mysteriousness and original art - room charm and appeal of those original face protectors .
But they do still give goalies a rare opportunity to personalize a piece of their equipment and reveal a bit of themselves .
So , we pay homage to 50 years of common sense , survival and an every - night - is - Halloween party on my hockey mask .
We take a look around the NHL at some of the paint jobs in today 's game , understanding it all started 50 years ago this past Sunday with the courage , quirkiness and ingenuity of hockey 's most revolutionary player , Jacques Plante .

Description :
North Williams street has become a new nexus of activity in North Portland .
With in the influx of restaurants , salons , a dessert place and a brewery , it was only a matter of time before a food cart opened .
And where it opened is important .
The space where Che Cafe is located is right next to a 1935 building where you have indoor seating .
The development , by the developer of Portland ’s most green building – The Heritage on NE MLK – is perfect for Portland ’s unpredictable weather .
Che Cafe is Ryan and Terri ’s dream .
Both love dogs , simple as that .
Why talk about dogs ?
Well , throughout the years , Ryan and Terri have had four amazing dogs – Nikai , a husky who was active and free spirited ; Che ’ , a large Princess Shepard who loved to lounge ; Riley , a senior Shepard mix who appeared to have “ doggy Alzheimers , ” but was happy and kind ; and then Sadie , a senior border collie mix who was very attached , loving and affectionate .
All of these dogs had an impact on Ryan and Terry and they want Che ’
Cafe to provide neighbors the same love and devotion those dogs showed them throughout the years .
I visited Che ’ Cafe with some fellow food cart enthusiasts .
We were all ready for the weekend and indulged in our personal weaknesses .
A couple of pulled pork sandwiches over here , a burger over there and even a black bean burger for the vegetarian of the group .
Each of the dishes came with crunchy fries and homemade ketchup .
I enjoyed the half pound Bubby Burger .
A monster of a burger , it came with crispy fried onions and cheddar cheese .
The burger is exactly what I was craving and it was cooked just right .
The seasoning was spot on – you could tell this was good ground beef mixed with spices and made into a patty by hand .
The crispy fried onions were an added bonus .
The added bonus to this cart is the building next door .
They offer up indoor seating for those wet and rainy days or even for those who do n’t want to take their food and go .
Inside the 1935 redeveloped building is a coffee cart and restrooms , along with a performance space called the Analog Lounge ( i.e. no cell phones or laptops . )
When you get over to North Williams and you see this bright red cart named Che ’
Cafe , stop on by , have some great American food and tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .

Google が 2009 年3 月に公開した、 クラウド・コンピューティング におけるデータセンタのデザインに関する入門書「 The Datacenter as a Computer 」 の読書会を実施しました。参加者は一ヶ月に渡り、各章を分担してプレゼンを行いました。ここでは各参加者の資料へのリンクをまとめるとともに、参加者の一人である私の感想を書かせていただきました。
テ キストは書籍として購入することも可能ですが、pdf としてフリーで公開されています 。

感想
来年邦訳が出るという話を聞きましたが、本当であるのならおそらく2010年の日本で最も重要なIT関係の本の一つになるでしょう。
非技術者でクラウドに興味のある人はその日本語訳を待つか、あるいは日経コンピュータの中田さんの講演資料を読めば十分だと思いますが、技術者はそんなもの待たずに原書で読むべきです。
この本を読めば 、Google の提唱する WSC が、現在のスタンドアロンサーバを並べたシステムと比べていかに優れているかわかりますし、他の各社が自社のエントリーサーバを並べてクラウドを名乗ったところで逆立ちしたって勝てるわけがないことを実感できます。
Google の採用している手法は実にシンプルです 。
「 数並べた方が性能出るよ→ならサーバ1台あたりにかかるコスト減らせば安くなるよ→だから全部数並べるのに最適化させて作ろうよ」
ここでいう「全部」というのは、データセンターそのものから冷却システム、電源システム、サーバ本体、運用監視ソフト、保守要因の作業ポリシー、ミドルウェア、などなど、現代のコンピュータシステムに関係しているであろう全てのものが対象です。
こんなやり方している会社は世界を見ても他に数社もないでしょう。日本では皆無です。
多分、今後10年はこのバズワードでない意味でのクラウドがシステム構築におけるトレンドになると思います。そして、この波に乗れずに淘汰されていく企業も数多く出てくるでしょう。
かつてパーソナルコンピュータをおもちゃと嘲笑った会社は淘汰され、Linux を信頼性も拡張性も何もない、取るに足らない
OS だと批判した UNIX ベンダはほとんどが撤退しています 。
おそらく同じことがクラウドでも起きるでしょう。まず「クラウドなんて信頼性が……」などと言って既存のシステム構築の手法にこだわり続ける人たちが真っ先に脱落し、次に「じゃあうちも」と便乗してそこらのサーバ並べるだけの似非クラウドを作っていく人たちが淘汰されていきます。
アプリケーションエンジニアもうかうかとしていられません。これからの時代はスケーラビリティが非常に重要になっていきます。今や日曜プログラマでさえ、GAE
を使えば強力なインフラの上にサービス立ち上げて全世界に公開できる時代です。簡単だけどスケーラビリティ皆無のアルゴリズムなんてもう使えません。単に「人がやっていた作業手順をそのままプログラムの上に乗せました」ということしかできない人は苦しくなっていくと思います。
コンピュータシステム全体が恐ろしい勢いで変わろうとしています。10年に1度じゃないかと思うようなこの波を体感するためにも、一人でも多くの人にこの本を読んでほしいです。
On 11 February 1981 , President Ronald Reagan wrote in his diary that " intelligence reports say Castro is very worried about me . . .
I 'm very worried that we can't come up with something to justify his worrying . "
Reagan 's concern has been the concern of all US presidents since Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959 , and set about establishing a communist state just 90 miles across the water from Miami .
In response to the emergence of Castro , the US sent the CIA in to Cuba and put in place a trade embargo .
So began one of the longest political stalemates of modern history .
It is remarkable today how little between the two countries has changed - as recent events remind us .
First , Juanita Castro , the estranged sister of Fidel and Raúl , revealed that she herself had been a CIA spy before fleeing to Mexico in 1964 .
Then , on 28 October , the UN General Assembly in New York took its 18th consecutive annual vote to highlight international opposition to the US embargo , a vote that Washington chose once again to ignore .
Some suspected that Juanita 's revelations may have been timed to influence the vote , because it was feared that President Obama 's promise to extend the hand of friendship to America 's old enemies might make him the first US president to change policy on Cuba .
For now , that seems unlikely .
But if Cuban relations with the US finally begin to thaw during the Obama presidency , Fidel Castro - if he lives to see it - will have overcome every US attempt to destroy him .
When Juanita defected in 1964 , she took 21 suitcases with her .
It is unlikely she would have had so many to take today .
Fifty years of sanctions have impoverished Cuba , a country that under the acting president , Raúl Castro , remains defiantly socialist 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall .
A half - century of Fidel Castro 's personal rule has left a profound mark .
It was in 1953 that Fidel Castro - a 26 - year - old lawyer from a landowning family - first came to the wider attention of the island his revolution would later engulf .
Stalin had just died and the first colour television sets were about to go on sale in the US .
On 26 July he masterminded an attack on the Moncada Barracks , one of the military installations of the dictator Fulgencio Batista , situated in Castro 's home town of Santiago de Cuba .
The attack failed , but Cubans were astounded by the audacity of what amounted to an attempted coup carried out by men with pea-shooter rifles and mock military uniforms .
Castro 's final speech to the court , before being sentenced to 15 years in prison for his part in the failed coup , was to become his working political platform : a programme of economic and social empowerment , threaded into the historical struggle of Cubans for independence from foreign powers .
With the speech worked up under the title of its ringing final line - " Condemn me , it does not matter , history will absolve me ! " - it is the sentiment as much as the substance of this document that has been the most consistent element of Castro 's political philosophy since he came to power in 1959 .
As peritonitis forced him to hand the presidency to his brother Raúl in February 2008 , Fidel Castro , who is 83 , is no longer his country 's official leader .
But little of substance is decided in Cuba without his being consulted and he remains the most controversial politician in postwar Latin America , the inspiration if not the figurehead for a new wave of leftist Latin leaders : Lula in Brazil , the Kirchners in Argentina , Tabaré Vázquez in Uruguay and Evo Morales in Bolivia .
Loathed by many but adored by many more , Castro has embodied more than any other George Bernard Shaw 's maxim that " the secret to success is to offend the greatest number of people " .
He has survived more than 600 assassination attempts
by the CIA to become the consummate world symbol of anti-capitalism .
“ President of the Council of State , President of the Council of Ministers , Commander - in - Chief of the Army and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba " - Castro 's full title at the height of his authority reveals the full sweep of his powers .
A modern version of the 19th - century caudillo , he has ruled his country " like a large family " , as one biographer generously puts it .
In reality , Cuba is a country that , like his own family , has endured painful splits on his behalf .
Castro has long attempted to keep his personal and political lives distinct .
He met his second wife , Dalia Soto del Valle , in 1961 , but Cubans have heard little of her since ; they live in a secured enclave outside Havana .
What Cubans have heard about , like the rest of the world , is the literacy campaign Castro was working on when he met her .
This campaign is perhaps Castro 's greatest single achievement , representing the very best that the Cuban Revolution could achieve : the revolt was always a social movement far broader than simply guerrilleros with beards and green fatigues .
This and other large - scale social programmes , such as urban reforms to boost home ownership in the cities , and land redistribution in the countryside , for a while made the Cuban Revolution , and Castro with it , the inspiration of the European and American left .
In 1960 , Allen Ginsberg welcomed Castro to New York in a springy - haired embrace .
The same year , Jean - Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir visited Cuba to witness the change .
" For the first time we were witnessing happiness that had been attained by violence , " they declared .
Such is the paradox of Castro , however , that just as his literacy campaign was being rolled out across the country , a film showing Cubans out on the town in Havana prompted the imposition of severe state censorship .
Castro's Words to the Intellectuals were delivered in the summer of 1961 in the auditorium of the national library , which was decked out more like a courtroom than a place of scholarship .
That day Castro set out a formula which has been used ever since to censor writers and intellectuals : " Within the revolution everything .
Without the revolution , nothing . "
The revolution continued to harden throughout the early 1960s , as a more stringent party line was established in workplaces and Committees for the Defence of the Revolution were set up to report on " unrevolutionary " behaviour .
As a result , many western intellectuals ( including Sartre and de Beauvoir ) rejected the Cuban Revolution .
Castro argued then , and has continued to do so , that they turned away because they did not understand the reality of Cuba or of Cubans , just as they did not understand Latin America in general .
Castro , by contrast , has always believed that he has an inimitable capacity for understanding his people .
For him , telling the Cuban intellectuals what to write was no different from teaching the peasants how to read : both were useful to the extent they served society .
The Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez , winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982 , has written of his friend Castro's " love of the word " as being one of his most noble characteristics .
But Márquez is nearer to the truth when he says that " one thing is certain : wherever he may be , however and with whomever , Fidel Castro is there to win " .
For Castro , words are weapons , " arrows stuck in the rough hide of reality " , as Susan Sontag put it .
And he is invariably careful to match his words with actions .
When , during a speech in 1960 , Castro revoked the Mutual Aid Treaty signed between Cuba and the US in 1952 , he literally tore up the treaty in front of a crowd .
A careful strategist as much as he is a performer , he did so safe in the knowledge that by then US - Cuban relations were broken beyond repair .
Castro went on to expropriate nearly all US - owned land and utilities in Cuba , precipitating the disastrous backlash overseen by John F Kennedy at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 , when more than 1,000 CIA - trained mercenary troops ( exiled Cubans ) were defeated by the Cuban army .
The Bay of Pigs debacle was also prompted by Kennedy 's fears that Cuba was becoming a communist state in America 's own backyard .
But it was not yet obvious - least of all to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev - that Castro would make his revolution along Soviet lines .
In fact , the great problem shaping the revolution in the early 1960s was that Cuba 's relations with the US were severed before Castro had the full support of the Soviet Union .
This became painfully clear to the Cubans in the resolution to the missile crisis of October 1962 when Khrushchev and Kennedy agreed on peace terms that Castro believed left Cuba 's independence compromised .
In the months that followed , Castro challenged Khrushchev in a way no other socialist leader would have done .
Over the following years his attempts to smuggle arms to myriad guerrilla movements in Latin America ( he even provided secret training camps for them in the Cuban countryside ) further antagonised the Soviets because of the way that it appeared - at the time of the Sino - Soviet split - to follow the approach of Chairman Mao more than Khrushchev .
It took the west even longer than Khrushchev to understand that Castro rejected Cuba 's position as a Soviet client state .
From the beginning of the revolution , he envisaged Cuba as an independent nation before it was a part of the communist fraternity .
His vision ( like that of Che Guevara ) was of a solidarity of the small , of alliances with other would - be revolutionary nations .
He exercised this directly with Algeria before the overthrow of that country 's leftist leader Ahmed Ben Bella in 1965 , and again in 1975 when he sent troops to the newly independent Angola , under the socialist MPLA , to help combat an invasion by the then apartheid South Africa .
Unlike most other revolutionary leaders , Castro has been able to adapt and reinvent himself to suit different circumstances .
He led his country through a kind of perestroika avant la lettre in the 1980s .
In 1995 , at the height of the economic troubles that befell Cuba after the break - up of the Soviet Union , he appeared at the UN General Assembly wearing a dark suit and tie rather than the military fatigues of the previous three decades .
It was the clearest possible statement that Cuba was now open to the world for business .
Yet Castro has never relinquished his commitment to revolutionary internationalism .
By the mid-1980s , he had begun exporting doctors and health professionals around the world , particularly to beleaguered countries such as Haiti , East Timor and black South Africa .
Today there are still more than 40,000 Cuban medical personnel working in different countries , more than the G8 countries combined provide .
The greatest number of them work in Venezuela , where , since 2005 , President Hugo Chávez has returned the favour by providing Cuba with oil .
The Castro - Chávez axis is undoubtedly Cuba 's most important international alliance .
Chávez allows Castro to keep the socialist flame alight in Cuba .
Since the fall of Soviet communism , Castro 's refusal to abide more fully by the rules of the international system has frustrated western leaders who have quietly hoped that Cuba would go the route of Vietnam and implement a form of soft socialism with markets .
Today , the global
financial crisis puts a different spin on Cuba 's commitment to a fully socialist economy : even the London - based New Economics Foundation recognises Cuba as an example of how to survive through the " triple - crunch " of credit , climate and energy crises .
The country is obviously no socialist utopia .
Through the long years since the revolution , the disaffected have attempted to escape across the Florida Straits to the US .
In 1980 , around 125,000 Cubans took to the waters from the Cuban port of Mariel , when , angered by Jimmy Carter 's attempt to encourage asylum - seekers at Havana 's embassies , Fidel opened the exit for five months , ensuring that anyone he did n't want around had every opportunity to use it .
So , Castro has survived because of his ruthlessness .
But perhaps the greater reason for his survival is the sheer adversity that Cuba has had to confront and Castro 's efforts to overcome it .
We all know about the damage that Hurricane Katrina inflicted on the southern United States in 2005 ; but the three storms that ripped through Cuba last summer caused an estimated $ 10bn of damage , yet have been largely forgotten by the wider world .
Castro has responded effectively to such disasters , in stark contrast to the way that George W Bush reacted to Hurricane Katrina , for example .
In addition , Cubans under Castro have rid their island of many infectious diseases , avoided the development of the slums that have blighted cities across mainland Latin America and - for all its flaws - have entrenched an active network of participatory organisations .
Seeking over the years to go even further than this , Castro has unleashed a veritable plague of schemes on his people .
Among his most ambitious projects were his plans , soon after coming to power , to drain the swamps of Ciénaga de Zapata on the southern coast and turn them into prime agricultural land .
In that instance , his careful investigation of the scheme afforded him an acute understanding of the area where the Bay of Pigs invasion took place , and was one reason for the subsequent Cuban victory there .
But perhaps Cuba 's most unlikely achievement has also grown out of another Castro obsession : a world - renowned biotechnology industry that has so far produced vaccines against Hepatitis B , meningitis and certain forms of cancer , and continues to work on developing an effective HIV vaccine .
These realities undermine a common misrepresentation of Castro 's rule as unchanging and absolute .
This is how he has long been portrayed by his supporters and enemies alike .
Cuban exiles in Miami concentrate on the cult of Castro 's personality , in the hope that 50 years of Cuban socialism will be erased at the same time as Fidel , while those defending the revolution from Havana like to portray the leaders and party members as the sole agents of change .
Little is said about how Castro 's grip on power has , at times , been under significant domestic pressure .
This was most spectacularly witnessed in 1994 , when he was forced to appear before crowds that had begun to riot in the poorest districts of Centro Habana .
But what is misunderstood , too , is just how popular Cuba 's variant of socialism is among ordinary Cubans .
If Fidel Castro is one of modern history 's great political survivors , it is an achievement that he must ultimately share with his people .
Because of him and the revolution , they enjoy substantial rights to health and education , a vibrant culture and remarkably solid communities .
But thanks also to Castro , they have been given very little room to breathe outside the officially sanctioned life .
As for Castro himself , the aged and ailing guerrilla fights on .
He has a new slogan , too : “ A better world is possible . "
Time will tell if the terms of that world are something that he , his brother Raúl and Barack Obama will be able to agree on .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Google is planning to foot the bill for WiFi at 47 of the nation 's airports for the rest of the year , beginning Tuesday .
With some travelers spending more time on the ground in airports than on planes during the busy flying season , now seemed an especially fitting time to offer up the perk , Google said .
The list includes the international airports in Miami and Orlando , which are among the world 's 30 busiest airports , as well as five others in Florida .
Travelers through smaller airports , such as Montana 's Billings and Bozeman , will also benefit .
" This is one of our holiday gifts to our users , and when you connect , we also hope you 'll take the opportunity to try some of the latest Google products , " the company said in a statement .
Upon signing in , users will be asked if they want to set Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) as their homepage or try the Google Chrome browser .
The company is also running a charity campaign to raise money for three nonprofit groups : Engineers without Borders , One Economy Corporation and Climate Savers Computing Initiative .
When Google WiFi users first log on , the landing page will offer them the option of donating to the organizations .
Google will match donations of up to $ 250,000 per airport .
Google has inked other free WiFi deals .
It already offers free wireless Internet to its hometown of Mountain View , Calif. , and last month it partnered with Virgin America to give the airline 's customers free access to Gogo 's Inflight Internet .
Both the airport WiFi deal and the Virgin America arrangement will end Jan. 15 , after the holiday rush subsides .
While Google 's move to offer free wireless in airports is an original twist , several companies are already running similar sponsorship campaigns on domestic flights .
E-commerce giant eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) said it will provide free WiFi through Gogo on more than 250 domestic Delta Airline flights during the busiest travel week of the year , over the Thanksgiving holiday .
From Nov. 24 -30 , flyers who log in will be taken to eBay 's holiday - themed homepage and invited to " complete your holiday shopping while still en-route to your Thanksgiving destination . "
Car maker Lexus wrapped up one week of complimentary Internet on American Airlines flights on Friday .
The promotion coincided with the introduction of the 2010 Lexus LS line .
The White House finds itself in a pickle :
How to extend the TARP bank bailout without so enraging voters that incumbent Dems get the heave - ho next year .
And here 's one creative solution on the table :
Use the rest of the TARP to reduce the national debt !
Does n't that sound good ?
Well , of course it does .
Except that it 's ridiculous spin .
The government borrowed money for the TARP .
Using what remains to " reduce the national debt " would simply mean giving our lenders ( some of ) their money back .
Meanwhile , however , other legislators are desperate NOT to return the TARP money to lenders but to use it for additional stimulus -- this time of the allegedly job - creating variety .
David Cho , Michael D. Shear and Lori Montgomery , WaPo :
The Obama administration is poised to extend the life of the highly unpopular $ 700 billion financial bailout and , to display a commitment to fiscal responsibility , is planning to use much of the leftover funds to reduce the national debt , government sources said .
Administration officials are grappling with how best to announce the extension of the Troubled Assets Relief Program at a time when the economy is struggling and the unemployment rate is at its highest point in 26 years .
The officials are hoping that by putting roughly $ 200 billion toward paying down the $ 12 trillion national debt , they could mitigate the political fallout , the sources said .
No final decision about the fate of the bailout has been made , and officials are keenly aware that their preferred course contains risks .

Camerasaboard NASA 's Cassini spacecraft have captured images of a mysterioushexagon - shaped cloud formation that is likely formed by the path of a jet streamflowing around the planet 's north pole .
The hexagon , which was discovered by the Voyager spacecraft in the early 1980s , encirclesSaturn with an estimated diameter wider than two Earths .
The associated jetstream likely whips along the hexagon at about 220 miles per hour ( 100 metersper second ) .
" Thelongevity of the hexagon makes this something special , given that weather onEarth lasts on the order of weeks , " said Kunio Sayanagi , a Cassini imagingteam associate at the California Institute of Technology .
" It 's a mysteryon par with the strange weather conditions that give rise to the long - lived Great Red Spot of Jupiter . "
The lastvisible - light images of the entire hexagon were captured by NASA 's Voyagerspacecraft nearly 30 years ago , the last time spring began on Saturn .
For thenext 15 years , the north pole was shrouded in darkness .
Cassini hasbeen orbiting Saturn since 2004 , and unlike Voyager it has a better angle forviewing the north pole and provides higher - resolution images .
But the longdarkness of Saturnian winter hid the hexagon from Cassini 's visible - lightcameras for years .
During this time , the craft 's infrared instruments were abledetect the shape using heat patterns , with the resulting images showing thehexagon is nearly stationary and extends deep into the atmosphere .
The imagesalso showed a hotspot and cyclone in the same region .
Just as thenorth pole emerged from winter in January , Cassini 's cameras went to work .
Imagingteam scientists stitched together 55 images to create a mosaic and a three - framemovie .
The scienceteam will search the images for clues about the causes of the hexagon , where itgets and expels its energy , and how it has stayed organized for so long .
Theywill pay close attention to the newly identified waves that radiate from thecorners of the hexagon where the jet takes its hardest turns , along with the multi-walledstructure that extends to the top of Saturn 's cloud layer in each of thehexagon 's six sides .
" Nowthat we can see undulations and circular features instead of blobs in thehexagon , we can start trying to solve some of the unanswered questions aboutone of the most bizarre things we 've ever seen in the solar system , " saidKevin Baines , an atmospheric scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" Solving these unanswered questions about the hexagonwill help us answer basic questions about weather that we 're still asking aboutour own planet . "

TACKLING climate change will cost consumers the earth .
Those who campaign for a green revolution are out to destroy our western lifestyles .
Such are the cries of opponents of emissions cuts , and their message has political clout : a number of surveys , including one by New Scientist in 2007 , have found that the enthusiasm of voters for policies to alleviate climate change falls off as the price tag increases .
However , a new modelling exercise conducted exclusively for this magazine suggests that these fears are largely unfounded .

Iran has been unsettled by recent deals to develop Iraq 's oil industry , which are likely to see its Arab neighbour emerge in its place as the world 's second biggest oil state .
Oil experts believe Iran is attempting to deter investment in Iraq 's oil industry by targeting fields that are to be auctioned to foreign oil companies .
" The incursion only goes to highlight the still very uncertain conditions on the ground in Iraq that have been impeding the recovery of the country 's oil sector , " said Harry Tchilinguirian , a London - based industry analyst .

What ’s the fastest way to get a task off your to - do list ?
Just delete it … or do n’t put it there in the first place .
When we read articles and books on productivity , getting things done , effectiveness , it ’s not because we want to be hyperefficient or as speedy as Gonzales .
It ’s because we ’d like to accomplish Something Amazing .
Which is a good thing .
But we must remember that : let ’s not try to be productive for the sake of being productive .
Let ’s focus on getting to done ( or better yet : just doing what we love ) .
And the best way to get there is to keep things as simple as possible .
What are the fewest number of steps required to get there ?
How can we remove busy work and distractions and wasteful meetings and needless tasks ?
Omit needless tasks .
Cross them off your list , or make it hard for them to get there in the first place .
Make every task that goes on your list past a test : is it truly necessary ?
Will I have felt great about doing it , when I ’m done ?
Because not doing it at all is often the best way to get things done .

Cerceris fumipennis wasp with its beetle prey .
This native wasp can determine in as little as 30 minutes if emerald ash borers are in the area .
(( Mike Bohne / U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service ) )
A centimetre - long wasp is poised to become a lead investigator of potential infestations by emerald ash borers , a beetle that is destroying swaths of trees across eastern North America .
Researchers at Ontario's University of Guelph say Cerceris fumipennis — a wasp native to the region — can determine in as little as half an hour after leaving its nest in search of prey whether the invasive beetles are in the area .
Traditional sleuthing involves peering into treetops where beetles congregate , or hanging sticky traps .
But both are costly and finding the beetles can take days , weeks , or even years if the infestation is in the very early stages .
Yet the earlier an infestation is discovered , the fewer trees have to be cut down or injected with expensive pesticides to stop the beetles ' spread .
Now some U.S. forest managers in New England and New York state are pressing this black - winged wasp into service , and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( CFIA ) is seriously considering following suit .
" This is a brand new program , " says Colleen Teerling , an entomologist with the Maine Forest Service , which started using Cerceris fumipennis this summer .
" A year and a half ago , nobody had even heard about this wasp in the U.S. "
While the emerald ash borer has yet to spread to Maine , officials there are monitoring its progress carefully .
Much is at stake .
The shiny green beetle has claimed more than 25 million trees in Ontario , Quebec and 12 American states since being discovered in the Windsor area in 2002 .
The beetles , which arrived from Asia in packing materials , kill ash trees by destroying the water - and nutrient - conducting tissues under the bark .
" This borer seems to stop at nothing , " says Mark Widrlechner , a horticulturist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
" And it seems the ash tree has no genetic resistance to this pest . "
Widrlechner heads a national program to collect ash seeds so they can be reintroduced once the devastation is over .
He has seen first - hand the beetles ' toll and worries about areas where ash trees represent up to 40 per cent of the forest canopy .
" If the ash disappears , what will fill the niche ?
Will it be one of the native trees or a non-native tree that could use the open niche to become invasive ? " he asks .
If that happens , he says it could change the whole ecosystem and threaten plants and animals that depend on ash - dominated forests .
The emerald ash borer has killed more than 25 million trees across eastern North America since its discovery near Windsor , Ont. , in 2002 .

Ash trees are also valued for their resilient wood — used in tool handles , flooring and baseball bats — and were planted along city streets in massive numbers to replace elm trees wiped out by Dutch elm disease about 40 years ago .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Forest Service estimates that if the current rate of infestation continues , it could cost the forestry industry between $ 20 and $ 60 billion US .
In addition , the cost of removing and replacing ash trees along urban streets could amount to $ 7 billion US over 25 years .
When University of Guelph entomologist Steve Marshall started looking into the issue several years ago , the extent of the threat was just becoming clear .
In 2006 , he recruited master 's student Philip Careless to see if the wasps could be used as an early warning system .
While they do n't kill beetles in sufficient numbers to control an infestation , Marshall suspected the wasps might just " provide a natural and very low - cost approach to monitoring for emerald ash borers . "
Marshall 's earlier research showed the wasp feeds on jewel beetles , including emerald ash borers .
But no one had ever tried to move wasp nests to areas at risk of beetle infestations to see whether they could be used as mobile surveillance units .
So Careless spent the past three summers working with the CFIA to perfect a technique for digging up earthen wasp nests at night , when the females remain inside , and driving them to areas with a high risk of beetle infestation .
' Stealing their groceries '
Careless , who has since graduated but continues to work with the CFIA on the project , found the wasps reoriented themselves the next morning and ventured out to find jewel beetles to bring back to feed their larvae .
By placing clear plastic cups over the nests ' entrance , Careless intercepted wasps returning with prey and found that emerald ash borers made up a significant proportion in infested areas .
" We were essentially stealing their groceries every time they came home .
I do n't know how they tolerated it , " says Careless .
" But we did drop the groceries back down the hole afterwards because we wanted the wasps to stick around their nests . "
Based on experiments over the summer of 2009 , Careless showed wasps detected more emerald ash borers and did it faster than the traditional system of sticky traps or human surveillance .
Using some fancy wasp math , Careless found he could also determine the extent of a given infestation .
On the basis of the speed of the fastest wasp observed — which he clocked at 33.4 metres per minute —
Careless was able to estimate how far a beetle infestation might have spread by calculating how long the wasp was gone from its nest .
For example , a wasp that took 57 minutes to forage travelled just over 1,900 metres to catch the beetle and return to its nest .
That meant that the beetle was caught within 950 metres of the nest .
By spreading nests at regular intervals , it then becomes possible to estimate the extent of infestation , even in its very early stages .
And that has forest managers hopeful that they may yet preserve North America 's ash trees .
" Early detection is probably one of the most critical things , " says Teerling .
Is it a “ Warmist Conspiracy , ” or a case of an e-mail being “ taken completely out of context ” ?
Regardless , the latest dust - up over the science of climate change appears unlikely to affect the dynamics of either a pending debate in the Senate or international climate negotiations in Copenhagen next month .
Conservative bloggers have seized on a series of e-mails between leading climate scientists , which were obtained by computer hackers and posted online last week , as evidence of a scientific conspiracy to push claims about human - caused global warming .
But advocates of action to curb global warming dismiss those claims , and political leaders and analysts say the Senate bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions will sink or swim based on economics , not science .
“ The scientists are going to fight about this for decades , ” said Robert Dillon , a spokesman for Sen.
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , one of several Senate Republicans who say they are open to some form of a climate bill .
“ We should be doing something to curb our emissions that would not harm the economy , and could in fact boost the economy , ” he said .
The British institution at the center of the debate confirmed Saturday that its server had been hacked and that it had contacted the police to pursue an investigation of what it believes was a criminal act .
The University of East Anglia said it could not confirm the authenticity of all the hacked data , including e-mails that have been published on the Internet , because of their sheer volume .
But it accused the hackers of using the material selectively and out of context to undermine the “ strong consensus ” that global warming exists , and declared that such misuse of information “ cannot be considered a genuine attempt to engage with this issue in a responsible way . ”
An e-mail by one of the university ’s professors , Phil Jones , has been singled out by skeptics as proof that scientists have deliberately misled the public on the issue .
In the 1999 e-mail , Jones wrote of using a “ trick ” to hide an apparent decline in recent global temperatures on a chart being prepared for use by a meteorological organization .
But in a statement posted on the university ’s website Saturday , Jones said that the e-mail had been “ taken completely out of context ” and that there had been no misrepresentation of data .
“ The word ‘ trick ’ was used here colloquially as in a clever thing to do .
It is ludicrous to suggest that it refers to anything untoward , ” Jones said .
Skeptics of man-made global warming disagreed , trumpeting the e-mails online .
“ The Death Blow to Climate Science , ” one website headlined .
Another hailed a “ Warmist Conspiracy . ”
Last week , the leading Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma , declared 2009 “ The Year of the Skeptic ” ; on Saturday , a spokesman for environment committee Republicans , Matt Dempsey , said the e-mails , if authentic , “ would have a profound impact on the debate ” over the climate bill .
Advocates of the bill disagreed .
“ The science is clearly on the side of those who are concerned the world is warming , ” said Joshua Freed , a senior advisor for clean energy at the think tank Third Way .
The e-mail controversy , said Josh Dorner , a spokesman for the pro-climate bill group Clean Energy Works , “ does absolutely nothing to change the fact that we are now closer than ever before to reaching binding international and domestic deals .
We have a path to success in the Senate and at Copenhagen and beyond . ”
A clear majority of senators appears to back some action to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
President Obama and congressional leaders have framed their support for the bill largely in terms of its potential to create “ clean energy ” jobs in the United States .

Spanish hunter who broke legs in fall into abandoned well shot himself after days of waiting in vain for rescue
Spaniards were today horrified by the death of a hunter from Mallorca who fell 18 metres down an abandoned country well and , after several days enduring the pain of his broken limbs and with no hope of rescue , turned his shotgun on himself .
The corpse of the municipal police officer and keen hunter , who was named as Antonio M , was eventually found after a colleague discovered his car nearby , according to Spanish newspapers .
A search of the area revealed an open , dry well with no wall around it that was hidden by thick vegetation .
Rescuers who went down the well near the town of Calvià said they found the body of the 49 - year - old man in a sitting position with a shotgun beside it .
Forensic scientists confirmed that the man had broken his legs in the fall and had sat at the bottom of the well for about three days .
They gave the cause of death as gunshot wounds and police said it was clear that he had killed himself , presumably after giving up hope of being found .
Police said no one would have heard his cries for help , even though the well was close to the Sol de Mallorca complex of holiday homes near the island 's El Mago beach .
It would have been impossible for him to clamber up the sheer - walled well with his broken limbs .
The open well was on former farmland that had been set aside for hunting .
Workers on the estate said it had been drilled some 60 years ago when the then owners sought water to irrigate the land .
No water had been found and the land was left to go wild .
Apparently no attempt was made to cover the well or to build a wall around it .
Authorities were expected to order the new owners of the land to cover it up .
The victim had let his home on the holiday island to go hunting on 24 November but , as he was on leave from his job , it had taken several days for people to notice that he was missing .
Rush is ticked because everybody told him to be afraid of swine flu , and now it turns out that as pandemics go , the current strain of swine flu is probably less like a category 3 hurricane , and more like a category 1 or tropical storm .
So what does Rush do ?
He blames the scientists :
We are the targets of lies , damn lies and science and scientists are rapidly becoming as trustworthy as politicians .
Actually , at first it was hard to say how dangerous H1N1 was going to be .
Lots of rapid - fire research had to be conducted ; the scientists were working their butts off to protect us , and to clarify the picture .
Sure , there was some exaggeration , especially from the press -- but what do you expect in such a situation of fear and uncertainty ?
But Rush does n't get the whole uncertainty thing ; he speaks , idiotically , of a " phony swine flu virus . "
Ask the people who died of swine flu whether it was phony .
The point , which scientists understand but which Rush apparently does not , is that whenever we have a new strain we need to be worried about it -- and even if we were relatively lucky with the current strain of swine flu , we are not always going to dodge the bullet .
That Rush uses swine flu to beat up on scientists in this way just shows how little he understands of science -- how difficult it is to conduct in real time with lives at stake , and how important it is to ensuring our public health and safety .

After elaborating so much about the client cert authentication through renegotiation with Microsoft IIS , I 'm beginning to believe that there is a potential security problem with that scheme , because it is susceptible to a MITM attack .
How serious the problem is depends on whether and how the client performs the server identification on the renegotiation TLS handshake .
The problem : when Microsoft IIS is configured to request a client certificate after having received the request , then it WILL perform an unauthenticated request !
Sending the reply back only to the authenticated client is a poor excuse for acting on an unauthenticated request .
Attack scenario : sess1 sess2 TLS client <---> rogue TLS server ( doing MITM ) <---> victim MS IIS
The roge TLS server waits for innocent clients to connect and offers to accept the same TLS client certs than the victim MS IIS server .
If a TLS client with a promising TLS client cert connects ( sess1 ) , then the rogue TLS server establishes an anonymous TLS connection ( sess2 ) with the victim MS IIS server and sends the request it wants performed ( URL with command parameters ) to the victim MS IIS server -- which replys with a Hello Request asking for a full TLS handshake of an entirely new and independent authenticated TLS session ( sess3 )
At this point , the rogue TLS server starts relaying the TLS handshake messages between the TLS client and the victim MS IIS , i.e. it forwards all handshake messages it receives over sess2 to the client over sess1 , and likewise forward all handshake messages it receives over sess1 to the victim MS IIS over sess2 .
The ChangeCipherSpec is the last Handshake message on each direction that is decrypted / encrypted under the original sess1 / sess2 settings , for all further communication , the rogue TLS server ( MITM ) will forward the incoming network data 1:1 to the other side ( because that is protected under keys known only to the TLS client and to the victim MS IIS .
The victim MS IIS server has no means to detect that it has been attacked .
Whether the TLS client cares about receiving a different TLS server cert in the renegotiation handshake and what it will do about it -- if anything , depends entirely on the application of the TLS client .
At the TLS level , everything looks just fine .
I 'm not sure that all clients will repeat the server authentication .
They can be expected to verify the server certificate before sending off their request .
Depending on the API architecture , they may not always realize or care that a renegotiation was performed while they were sitting on SSL_read ( ) waiting for the server reply .
And even if they decide to perform an additional server endpoint identification , they might be doing it after the renegotiate handshake has been successfully completed -- a point where the victim MS IIS has started performing the action requested in the anonymous request from the MITM .

A new study may help drinkers pick their poison .
In a head - to - head comparison , bourbon gave drinkers a more severe hangover than vodka , report Damaris Rohsenow of Brown University and colleagues in an upcoming issue of Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research .
But vodka drinkers are n't off the hook : Drinkers ’ sleep suffered equally with both drinks , as did their performance on tasks requiring attention and quick responses .
Understanding the lingering effects of alcohol after a night of heavy drinking is important for people who engage in safety - sensitive tasks , such as driving , while hung over Rohsenow says .
The researchers recruited 95 healthy young adults , ages 21 to 33 , and gave them caffeine - free cola mixed with bourbon , vodka or tonic water .
The drinking ended when participants ’ breath - alcohol concentrations hit an average of 0.11 , well over the legal intoxication limit .
Participants were then hooked up to sleep monitors , which record brain activity , and allowed to sleep it off .
At 7 a.m. the next day , the researchers roused the subjects from bed ( a wake - up that did not include coffee or aspirin ) and asked them to rate the severity of their hangovers .
Overall , bourbon drinkers reported feeling worse than vodka drinkers , rating higher on scales that measure the severity of hangover malaise , including headache , nausea , loss of appetite and thirst .
It should come as no surprise that alcohol drinkers said they felt much worse than those who had drunk only tonic water .
One reason for the different effects of vodka and bourbon , Rohsenow says , could be that bourbon contains 37 times more toxic compounds than vodka does , including nasty organic molecules such as acetone , acetaldehyde , tannins and furfural .
A good rule of thumb for liquors , she says , is that the clearer they are , the less of these substances they contain .
Both the bourbon drinkers and vodka drinkers slept poorly compared to the nondrinkers , the team found .
The next morning , when the participants performed cognitive tests that required attention and quick reaction times , the drinkers performed worse than the nondrinkers , but the type of alcohol had no effect on performance .
Both groups of drinkers were impaired equally .

December 2 , 2009 , Washington , DC - The Guatemalan army , under the direction of military ruler Efraín Ríos Montt , carried out a deliberate counterinsurgency campaign in the summer of 1982 aimed at massacring thousands of indigenous peasants , according to a comprehensive set of internal records presented as evidence to the Spanish National Court and posted today by the National Security Archive on its Web site .
The files on “ Operation Sofia ” detail official responsibility for what the 1999 UN - sponsored Historical Clarification Commission determined were “ acts of genocide against groups of Mayan people . ”
The National Security Archive ’s Kate Doyle presented the documentation as evidence in the international genocide case , which is under investigation by Judge Santiago Pedraz in Madrid .
Ms. Doyle testified today before Judge Pedraz on the authenticity of the documents , which were obtained from military intelligence sources in Guatemala .
Earlier this year , Defense Minister Gen. Abraham Valenzuela González claimed that the military could not locate the documents or turn them over to a judge in Guatemala , as ordered by the Guatemalan Constitutional Court in 2008 .
After months of analysis , which included evaluations of letterheads and signatures on the documents and comparisons to other available military records , Doyle said , “ we have determined that these records were created by military officials during the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt to plan and implement a ‘ scorched earth ’ policy on Mayan communities in El Quiché .
The documents record the military ’s genocidal assault against indigenous populations in Guatemala . ”
The Archive ’s Guatemala project has a long track record of obtaining and authenticating internal records on Guatemalan repression .
In 1999 , Ms. Doyle obtained a “ death squad diary ” — a logbook of kidnappings , secret detentions , torture , disappearances and executions between 1983 and 1985 kept by the feared “ Archivo , ” a secret intelligence unit controlled by President Oscar Humberto Mejía Víctores .
Although the military claimed the document was a fabrication , a team of experts led by Doyle was able to establish its authenticity .
The logbook has been accepted as official , authentic evidence by the Inter - American Human Rights Commission .
The appearance of the original “ Operation Sofía ” documents provides the first public glimpse into secret military files on the counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres of tens of thousands of unarmed Mayan civilians during the early 1980s , and displaced hundreds of thousands more as they fled the Army ’s attacks on their communities .
The records contain explicit references to the killing of unarmed men , women and children , the burning of homes , destruction of crops , slaughter of animals and indiscriminate aerial bombing of refugees trying to escape the violence .
Among the 359 pages of original planning documents , directives , telegrams , maps , and hand - written patrol reports is the initial order to launch the operation issued on July 8 , 1982 , by Army Chief of Staff Héctor Mario López Fuentes .
The records make clear that " Operation Sofía " was executed as part of the military strategy of Guatemala ’s de facto president , Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt , under the command and control of the country ’s senior military officers , including then Vice Minister of Defense Gen. Mejía Víctores .
Both men are defendants in the international genocide case in front of the Spanish Court .
In 1999 , the UN - sponsored Historical Clarification Commission concluded that the Guatemalan Army had committed “ massacres , human rights violations , and other atrocities ” against Mayan communities that “ illustrated a government policy of genocide . ”
Due to military stonewalling , which included refusing to turn over internal records , the Commission based its findings almost exclusively on testimony from witnesses and perpetrators , human rights reports , and data from exhumations .
The Commission also drew on declassified U.S. government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and provided by the National Security Archive .
The posting today includes an analysis by Kate Doyle of the Operation Sofia documents , as well as photographs from the Ixil region taken in 1982 by photojournalist and human rights advocate , Jean - Marie Simon .

AL - BIREH , West Bank ( Reuters ) -
The grandfather of a U.S. Army psychiatrist accused of shooting dead 13 people and wounding 30 others at a base in Texas said on Saturday he found it impossible to believe his grandson had committed the act .
Major Nidal Malik Hasan , the U.S. Army doctor identified by authorities as the suspect in a mass shooting at the U.S. Army post in Fort Hood , Texas , is seen in this undated handout photo from a pdf file of the U.S. Government Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences downloaded on November 6 , 2009 .
Investigators searched for the motive on Friday behind the mass shooting at a sprawling U.S. Army base in Texas , in which the Army psychiatrist trained to treat war wounded is suspected of killing 13 people .
REUTERS / Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences / Handout
“ He is a doctor and loves the U.S. ” Ismail Mustafa Hamad told Reuters in an interview at his home in the Palestinian town of al - Bireh .
“ America made him what he is . ”
U.S. - born Major Nidal Malik Hasan , 39 , a Muslim and the son of immigrant parents , was shot during the attack and is being held at a hospital in San Antonio , Texas .
“ Whether he became angry or something else , I do n’t know ...
What I do know is that it is impossible that he would do something like that , ” Hamad , 88 , said .
Hasan , who had spent years counseling wounded soldiers , many of whom had lost limbs fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , last visited him in the occupied West Bank some 10 years ago .
Hamad said he had since visited his grandson in the United States .
Hamad appeared to rule out a political motive .
“ He used to come to my house , to stay with me and entertain me .
He never took an interest in politics and he did n’t even like watching television , ” Hamad said .
WORST NIGHTMARE
Colonel John Rossi , a spokesman at the Fort Hood army base , the biggest military facility in the world , said Hasan was unconscious but in stable condition .
The gunman , with two guns including a semi-automatic weapon , opened fire apparently without warning at Fort Hood base , where troops were getting medical checkups before leaving for foreign deployments .
Hasan was transferred to Fort Hood in April and was to have been deployed to Afghanistan , where the U.S. military is fighting Taliban and al Qaeda .
Hasan ’s cousin , Nader Hasan , said in interviews that he had agitated not to be sent overseas .
“ We ’ve known over the last five years that was probably his worst nightmare , ” he said .
Nader Hasan also said his cousin had complained , as a Muslim , of harassment by fellow soldiers .
Hasan yelled “ Allahu Akbar ” -- Arabic for “ God is Greatest ” -- just before the shooting , Chuck Medley , Fort Hood ’s director of Emergency Services , told Reuters .
Another cousin , Mohammed Hasan from al - Bireh , said the shooting may have been motivated by what he said was the U.S. Army ’s refusal to allow him to leave the armed forces .
“ About a week before the incident , he hired a lawyer in order to leave the army , get married and live his life .
But they rejected his request , and asked him to go to Afghanistan .
“ This was the biggest shock for him .
So there is another reason why he did what he did , not just because of the harassment of the soldiers , there is another reason , ” Mohammed Hasan said .
Referring back to my post I wrote last week about the “ perfect storm ” the Obama Administration has created regarding medical marijuana , Colorado in many ways seems to be in the eye of this storm .
It seems that more and more people are starting to understand the insanity of declaring war on a substance which has never resulted in an overdose of any kind ( much less a deadly overdose ) .
In yesterday ’s election , voters in Breckenridge , CO passed a measure by 71 % which decriminalizes marijuana in amounts of an ounce or less for individuals 21 and over .
The Denver Post is having guest columnists who are staunchly pro-legalization write persuasive and articulate articles which could be mistaken for something you might read here at The Liberty Papers .
Here ’s an excerpt from an article written by Robert Cory Jr .
Today , not much about Colorado ’s economy moves .
The state is broke and releases prisoners because it cannot afford to keep them .
The governor slashes the higher education budget 40 percent .
People lose jobs , homes and financial security .
Our leaders face serious issues .
And what keeps some politicians up at night ?
That sneaking suspicion that some suffering cancer patients may gain limited pain relief through medical marijuana , coupled with that gnawing certainty that someone , somewhere , actually grew the plant for that patient , or even manufactured medical products such as these CBD Gummies specifically for those suffering from various pains .
But the government cannot repeal the laws of supply and demand , and cannot extinguish the spark of freedom in peoples ’ hearts .
Now , the marijuana distribution chain becomes legal .
Responsible entrepreneurs open shops to supply skyrocketing demand for marijuana strains like lemon crack .
These small businesses serve needy patients .
They pay taxes .
They hire employees .
They lease space .
They advertise .
And the drug war industrial complex ca n’t stand it .
The article only gets better from there .
I find it very encouraging that Colorado ’s newspaper of record would print this and that citizens are pushing back against big government , if only on this issue .
The issue of marijuana has been so hotly debated , but now it seems that people are seeing the benefits of it and hopefully in the near future things will be different for those who need it most .
People will be able to have thc delivery to them without the worry of being arrested or warned .

A bald hedgehog abandoned by his mother in a garden in Norfolk is being treated at a wildlife rescue centre in a bid to encourage his spikes to grow .
Baldrick , named after the character from the television programme Blackadder , was brought to Foxy Lodge wildlife rescue centre , Great Yarmouth .
He is now being cared for by Tonia and John Garner in the hope he can be eventually released into the wild .
Treatment includes antiseptic scrubs and baby oil massages .
Mr Garner told the BBC News website that Baldrick was spotted in a garden being pushed along by its mother .
He said : " They are not very good parents in the wild and if they have a family of six babies , about two will never make it . "
Baldrick 's mother eventually took her other babies away , abandoning her bald son who ended up at the wildlife centre .
Mr Garner said when Baldrick was brought in in August aged about six weeks he weighed 240g , but is now up to about 800g .
Since hedgehogs rely on their spikes for protection , Baldrick will not be released into the wild until his spikes return .
If despite treatment , he remains bald , Mr Garner said he will stay at the centre .
Planning applications for new minarets are almost always refused
The people of Switzerland have been voting on whether to ban the building of minarets in their country .
The proposal is backed by the Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) , the largest party in parliament , which claims minarets are a sign of Islamisation .
Opponents say a ban would discriminate , and that the campaign has stirred hatred .
The government opposes a ban .
Switzerland is home to some 400,000 Muslims and has just four minarets .
Referendum results are due at 1700GMT .
Islam is the most widespread religion after Christianity , but it remains relatively hidden .
There are unofficial Muslim prayer rooms , and planning applications for new minarets are almost always refused .
Supporters of a ban claim that allowing minarets would represent the growth of an ideology and a legal system - Sharia law - which are incompatible with Swiss democracy .
But others say the referendum campaign has incited hatred .
On Thursday the Geneva mosque was vandalised for the third time during the campaign , according to local media .
If you are telling me that we are going to ban all religious symbols from all religious buildings , I would not have a problem with that
Elham Manea
Forum for a Progressive Islam
Pointed argument Opinion polls ahead of the vote are close , with signs that a small majority will reject the ban .
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports from Bern that that would be a relief to the Swiss government , which fears banning minarets would cause unrest among the Muslim community and damage Switzerland 's relations with Islamic countries .
Swiss President Hans - Rudolf
Merz said : " Muslims should be able to practice their religion and have access to minarets in Switzerland too .
But the call of the muezzin [ call to prayer ] will not sound here . "
Amnesty International has warned that the ban would violate Switzerland 's obligations to freedom of religious expression .
' Discrimination ' Elham Manea , founder of the Forum for a Progressive Islam , pointed to the recent construction of Sikh temples and Serbian Orthodox churches , saying a ban on minarets alone would be discriminatory .
" If you are telling me that we are going to ban all religious symbols from all religious buildings , I would not have a problem with that , " she said .
" But if you are just telling me that we are going to target only the Muslims , not the Christians , not the Jews , not the Sikhs , only the Muslims , then I have a problem with it because it is discrimination . "
It is nothing against Muslims
Ulrich Schluer
SVP member of parliament Most of Switzerland 's Muslims come from former Yugoslavia .
There is no history of Islamic extremism , but supporters of a ban say minarets are far more than religious architecture .
They claim allowing them would be a sign that Islamic law is accepted in Switzerland .
Sunday 's referendum is being held after the SVP collected 100,000 signatures from eligible voters within 18 months calling for a vote .
SVP member of parliament Ulrich Schluer said the referendum campaign had helped integration by encouraging debate .
He rejected the charge of discrimination .
" Every Muslim is allowed to come together with other Muslims to have the religion together , " he told the BBC .
" But a minaret is a political symbol .
It is a symbol for introducing , step - by - step , Sharia rights also in Switzerland , parallel to the Swiss law which is a result of Swiss democracy .
And this is the problem .
It is nothing against Muslims . "
In recent years many countries in Europe have been debating their relationship with Islam , and how best to integrate their Muslim populations .
France focused on the headscarf , while in Germany there was controversy over plans to build one of Europe 's largest mosques in Cologne .

Police in the US are investigating a detective who appears to draw his gun during a mass snowball fight on the streets of Washington DC .
The video appears to show the detective holding a gun in his left hand as he begins to approach a large group of people , which had gathered for the snowball fight .
People in the crowd can be heard saying " he has a gun " .
Police say they are looking into reports that the plain - clothed police officer stepped out of his own vehicle and drew his weapon after his car had been hit by snowballs .

Babies May Read Your Poker Face A Harvard lab finds babies can recognize fear and anger before they can talk .
Nov. 13 , 2009  --
Book smarts can get you far , but the ability to read a person can get you a date , ward off scams or , if you happen to be Eric Buchman , it can help you earn $ 2.5 million .
On Monday Buchman , 30 , finished fourth in the World Poker Series in Las Vegas adding $ 2.5 million to the hundreds of thousands of dollars he 's won at World Poker Series tournaments before .
With eight years of professional poker underneath his belt , Buchman 's win was due to his skill and , in part , his ability to read other people .
" You might be able to read their face , how they 're handling their chips , how they 're looking at you , if they 're looking away , betting patterns -- everyone 's different , " said Buchman , of Valley Stream , N.Y .
" Some people might look nervous because they 're weak , and some people may look nervous because they 're strong . "
Scientists at Harvard think that sort of emotion - detection is so crucial in everyday life that they 're willing to cajole crying , squirming babies into an electrode " net " to see how to see how humans first learn to read faces .
At Dr. Charles Nelson 's lab at Children 's Hospital Boston , babies help him determine when humans begin to recognize faces not by pushing buttons or pointing , but simply by looking at pictures on a screen .
Cameras embedded in the screen track the baby 's eye movements within a millimeter of accuracy as they examine the faces .
Meanwhile , a computer logs the child 's brain activity .
By comparing changes in eye movement and brain activity for each picture , Nelson can determine when a child recognizes a difference in a face -- such as in a surprised face or a frightened one -- and when the child misses those subtleties .
" There are individual differences to sensitivity to faces , and our hypothesis is they have the origins early at life , " said Nelson , a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School .
In fact , Nelson said children may start distinguishing faces by species , gender , race , and age by their first birthday .
However , there 's a tradeoff :
The more specialized humans become recognizing some faces , the more they sacrifice abilities to recognize other faces .
A Baby Could Tell Two Monkeys Apart , Can You ?
" If I showed you [ an adult ] two different monkeys you would have a difficult time distinguishing the two faces .
You could do it , but it would take time , " said Nelson .
However , " at 6 months of age a baby can easily discriminate two monkey faces , but at 9 months it 's difficult for them , " he said .
Nelson 's work has shown that infants are capable of distinguishing happiness , fear , anger , sadness and disgust even before they can speak .
Humans are especially good at recognizing fear .
" Infants look longer at fear ; they show more brain activity at fear , " said Nelson .
" They are n't afraid , but if given the choice they look at fear . "
He is n't sure why babies pay more attention to fearful faces , but Nelson hypothesizes it is hardwired into children 's brains to protect them .
The faster a child picks up on mom and dad 's fear , the faster the child realizes there 's danger .
Results from Nelson 's experiments also have shown that a child 's environment can influence their ability to read faces .
Children who were physically abused at a young age have proven to be much faster at detecting an angry face than a child who was not abused .
Nelson said researchers in Kentucky found that while most infants prefer female faces , babies raised by stay - at - home dads preferred male faces .
But nurture is n't everything .
Scientists also have found that genetics may play a role .
For example , scientists recently have discovered that the 5 - HTT gene , which codes for the powerful brain chemical serotonin , can determine the risk of depression .
Each person has two copies of the gene , called alleles , and each copy can vary in length .
Get a short - short combination of 5 - HTT and you 're at higher risk for depression than if your get a long - long combination .
Nelson thinks 5 - HTT also may influence a child 's ability to decipher emotions on faces .
" If you have short - short , you show more brain activity for fearful faces than if you had long - long , " said Nelson .
Despite all of Nelson 's discoveries , he said his lab and others have yet to try testing a child 's ability to recognize deceit .
According to other scientists , it may be difficult to study lying through facial recognition alone .
" There is no facial indicator of deception .
There 's nothing that you do with your face when you 're lying that you do n't do at other times , " said Jeff Cohn , a professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh .
Deception Is Difficult to Read in a Face
Cohn works with computer scientists to classify , analyze and detect emotions on people 's faces , including pain and clinical depression .
Rather than look at still photographs , Cohn said it 's easier to detect deceit through the order and intensity of facial movements .
For example , take a person 's smile when they receive a gift .
" If they tell you how much they loved your gift and if the smile is missing the contraction of the sphincter muscle around the eye -- the crow 's - feet wrinkles -- the person probably was n't so keen on your gift , " said Cohn .
Cohn uses a method called Facial Action Coding System [ FACS ] developed by famous researcher Paul Ekman to train students to detect such signals .
But Cohn warned it is n't something that can be picked up in a day .
" It is something that can be learned , " said Cohn .
" When we train people in the lab , typically it would take a semester . "
Indeed , elite poker players bet on the difficulty to read deception on a person 's face .
" Some people are easier to read than other people you know , " said Buchner .
" I just try to keep a straight face .
Most people can't read physical traits anyway . "

The moment an American police detective pulls out a HANDGUN after he's hit with SNOWBALLS
This is the terrifying moment that an American police detective pulled out his handgun after he was targeted in a snowball fight .
Washington police are investigating the incident , when the off - duty officer drew his gun in the midst of the light - hearted battle .
About 200 people from a Washington D.C. neighbourhood had gathered to brave a snowstorm for a massive snowball fight .
' It was pretty fun , ' one unidentified participant told reporters .
' But when the gun came out , it just changed the tone of the thing a little bit . '
The unnamed detective pulls out a handgun after his car was targeted during a mass snowball fight
The police officer 's handgun is circle .
He waved in front of chanting youngsters
The plainclothes officer became angry when his car - a maroon Hummer - was hit by snowballs .
He got out of the SUV and yelled at the crowd , before pulling out his gun and showing it to the crowd .
Eyewitness Matthew Bradley told Washington City Paper : ' We showed up to see a snowball fight already in progress .
Two factions along 14th Street along the intersection .
' It was pretty friendly , mostly OK .
At one point , there was one interaction with the police that I saw .
A cop got stuck in the snow .
People stopped and helped him out .
' A couple moments later , at the intersection , there was this big maroon Hummer .
A small faction of people decided to target it with snowballs .
They 're throwing snowballs at the Hummer .
The plaincothes officer clutches the weapon in his left hand
The detective pulls a man out from the crowd and accuses him of hitting his car with snowballs
The snowball fight on 14th Street in Washington DC was organised via Facebook
' It turns out the driver of the Hummer is a detective .
He gets out .
He 's waving a walkie talkie .
It 's not going well .
Then he starts waving a gun .
' He had n't identified himself at this point .
There was a point where things cooled off a bit , more police showed up , and he identified himself at that point .
The name was Detective Baylor .
' There was a point where it got really tense .
The experience for many people was snowball fight kind of fun ... and then there 's a guy with a gun . '
Uniformed police arrived on the scene to investigate reports of a man waving a handgun .
The detective only calmed down once his fellow police officers arrived .
Later in the incident , the detective went into the crowd and grabbed a man who he thought threw a snowball at him .
Assistant Chief Pete Newsham said : ' We have to see what the entire circumstance was .
But just a snowball fight , not in my mind , that does n't seem a situation where we would pull out a service weapon . '

Halloween is less than a month away now , meaning that those of you who 've yet to start thinking about a costume are getting ever closer to achieving that dreaded status of " waiting until the last moment . "
Some of you may be looking to comic books for inspiration , and both DC and Marvel have a number of licensed costumes available for you to choose from .
But , as ComicsAlliance has already pointed out , those options can be somewhat limited .
Just take a look at these examples :
On the left you can see the Captain America costume from what Marvel calls its " Sassy Deluxe " line .
And on your right you see a man with a more traditional interpretation of Cap 's costume , albeit one that has prominently Liefeldian abs .
Consider these exhibits A and B for the argument that superhero Halloween costumes tend to skew heavily towards male fantasies .
Admittedly not a surprise , as many actual superhero costumes are also designed for the same demographic .
But this time of year that leaves few choices for people looking for something else .
So in an effort to be a helpful , we 'd like to present this list of ...
5 COMIC BOOK COSTUMES FOR WOMEN THAT WON'T TURN YOU INTO A SEX OBJECT

The Question
Over the course of DC's weekly mega-event series 52 Vic Sage , the first Question , passed away and his mantle was taken up by former Gotham City Police Detective Renee Montoya .
All five fans of the original Question were furious and swore to never read anything DC published ever again , but on the bright side it meant a larger role for one of the best new characters introduced to the DC universe in the last twenty years .
And while Montoya 's character in Gotham Central by Ed Brubaker , Greg Rucka and Michael Lark drew a lot of critical praise , DC was n't happy with the sales figures .
Thankfully Montoya 's switch to a costumed hero means DC 's still willing to print stories that feature her and you 've got a Halloween costume option that consists of more than just someone in street clothes holding a gun .
Irma Geddon
Strapping enough weaponry onto your body to obliterate a small army should not be a joy for men alone .
In the pages of " Top 10 , " written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Gene Ha and Zander Cannon , Irma Wornow 's thermonuclear - capable outfit is more for business than pleasure , considering her job is a police officer in the superhuman populated city of Neopolis .
Admittedly Irma does like her work ; she is quick to resort to violence as a solution , and her idea of gun control seems to be using as many firearms as possible at once .
But who among us would n't do the same if someone gave us our own battle armor with a rack of missiles on top ?
Lawyer She - Hulk
For quite some time , Jennifer Walters ' career in the law took a back seat to her life as a superhero .
But certain events leading to the destruction of an entire town ( which , in her defense , was only in Idaho ) caused her to later rethink her life and return her focus to working as an attorney .
And so with the start of writer Dan Slott 's run on " She - Hulk " in 2004 , Jennifer began working for the law offices of Goodman , Lieber , Kurtzberg & Holliway , trading in her normal costume for something a bit more professional .
Granted it was n't much of a change in the company she kept , as her new firm specialized in superhuman law , and admittedly she still looked one ' 80s power chord and loosened hair bun away from looking like .
. . well , looking like what She - Hulk normally looks like .
But the green skin and hair with the power suit all combine to create an appearance that says " I 'm smart , I 'm capable , and the first person to make an inappropriate comment about wanting a look at my ' legal briefs ' is getting punched through the nearest brick wall . "
Delirium
Yeah , I know .
Some of you out there are looking at this choice and going , " No , no way .
Delirium is totally hot . "
Well , I 've got a few responses to that .
First , the affection you 're feeling for the youngest of the Endless from Neil Gaiman 's masterpiece Sandman probably has more to do with the way her character 's been excellently crafted by her writer and artists than it has to do with the clothes she 's wearing .
Second , I should point out to you , dear friend , that in case you 've yet to realize it you 've probably got what psychologists refer to as " a thing for crazy chicks . "
It 's a path that will no doubt cause you a fair amount of suffering , so have fun with that .
But back to the matter at hand :
The great thing about choosing Delirium as a costume is that her level of sexy is scalable to your taste .
Due to the varied depictions of her throughout the run of Sandman , you 're free to pick your favorite or come up with your own take and present whatever amount of sex appeal you 're comfortable with .
Just remember that the real key to the costume is getting the personality right .
And it would be wrong and possibly illegal for me to point out that the two most likely ways to accomplish this are either kidnapping and questioning Neil Gaiman or taking fatal amounts of potent hallucinogenic substances .
Ruby Berserko
So you want a costume that 'll be a challenge ?
All right then , here you are .
Ruby Berserko from " Casanova , " written by Matt Fraction with art by Gabriel Bá and Fábio Moon , is the consciousness of a sexbot , Ruby Seychelle , uploaded into an organic robot body with three fused heads that formerly belonged to a criminal mastermind .
Floating around in a hover chair with big dewy eyes and an curly wig specially made to cover her enormous triple skull , she looks like a cross between Shirley Temple and MODOK .
Oh , and she 's usually found performing intelligence briefings for the book 's hero , super spy Casanova Quinn .
Now if you 've actually got the pieces of a working hover chair lying around in your attic I 'm probably going to be more impressed with that than any Halloween costume you could make .
But I will promise to tip my metaphorical internet hat to you if you 're able to put a convincing Ruby Berserko outfit together .
AND 5 COMIC BOOK COSTUMES FOR MEN THAT WILL SEXUALLY OBJECTIFY YOU
Namor
Namor the Sub - Mariner , ruler of the kingdom of Atlantis .
We should all consider ourselves fortunate that the speedo - and - belt look has never actually caught on among heads of state in our own reality , but should you desire a costume that honors one of Marvel 's oldest creations and makes even bare - chested depictions of Aquaman look like an overdressed prude , then Namor is the right choice for you .
It 's not even that expensive to put together .
After you grab a pair of the Spock ears that should be widely available this year , your only remaining investment is going to be a long and painful chest waxing session .
Weapon X Wolverine
Everybody knows the best part of dressing up like Wolverine is the claws , so why should you even bother with picking up the rest of the outfit ?
Instead , look to one of the character 's thousands of origin stories and go with the Weapon X test subject look .
All you 'll need to do is attach some surgical tubing and electrical wires to your body and then strategically position some random electronic device to provide a tactful cover - up worthy of a ruthless secret Canadian military project .
You may very well find yourself being the best at what you do , although what you do might be making certain that your friends never invite you to a Halloween party ever again .
Spider Jerusalem
The hero of " Transmetropolitan , " written by Warren Ellis and drawn by Darick Robertson .
Already a fairly popular Halloween costume , but one that 's usually achieved with a black jacket and black pants .
What I 'm suggesting is more of the Spider relaxing at home look , wearing only boxer shorts and showing off his many and diverse tattoos .
Getting the tattoos just right is a fun and important part of the look .
And all you 'll need is a sharpie and either the ability to contort your body in such a way that you can draw legibly on your own back or , failing that , friends willing to do the job for you .
If you really want something special about the costume , why not track down Warren Ellis himself and ask him to add his signature ?
You 've got time before Halloween , and I 'm sure that if you show up at his home completely hairless and practically naked and then shove a marker in front of his face absolutely nothing unpleasant will happen to you in any way .
Hercules
Generally speaking , if you 're designing a costume for a hero about to engage in epic amounts of ass - kicking you do n't start with sandals and a skirt held up by one diagonal strap .
But when you 're Hercules you can apparently wear whatever you want as long as the results come in .
The Marvel version of the classic Greek mythological hero has risen to greater prominence in the comic book world lately thanks to a great run on " Incredible Hercules " currently being written by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente .
As unusual as the Greek - influenced Kirby - designed costume may be , it should be noted that Hercules seems to attract significantly more attention from the women of the Marvel universe than most other heroes .
And they only seem to want to kill him about two - thirds of the time .
Dr. Manhattan
This one 's not rocket science .
It 's a simple equation :
You , minus clothes , minus hair , plus lots of blue body paint equals Dr. Manhattan .
And there 's no better time to choose to go as one of the central characters from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ' " Watchmen . "
While in past years you might have had to explain yourself to confused party - goers as " nudist smurf , " with this year 's release of a film adaptation you should be immediately recognized .
And if you were one of the fans of the source material who , at around this time last year , was loudly protesting the possibility that the movie might have elected to not include Dr. Manhattan 's degree in manhood , what better opportunity than this to put your dedication to an exact portrayal on display ?
Well , that 's all .
Ladies , gentlemen , I hope this has helped all of you in your Halloween brainstorming .
Personally , I think I 'm unlikely to go with any of the guys ' costumes I listed .
I figure I 'll end up with something a little more suited to the cold northeastern October evening I 'll be facing .
But , hey , I guess I should consider myself fortunate to live in a world in which those last five were n't typical of the only kind of costume that 's marketed to me .
Updated Hackers have successfully rooted Motorola 's Droid smartphone , allowing users to install applications or services of their choice outside the set menu offered by operators .
A hardware modder , rejoicing in the name Zinx Verituse , has developed and published a Droid rooting exploit .
Instructions on how to break open Droid smartphones , along with links to the exploit were posed on an Android forum , Wired Gadget Lab via CRN reports .
Once rooted , smartphone users gain administrative privileges and thus the ability to download widgets , add applications , or otherwise customise their phone .
The procedure carries a risk of rendering a device inoperable or disabling features .
Attempts to tamper with the phone void Motorola 's warranty and run against terms of service agreements .
An earlier version of this story compared the process of rooting droids to jailbreaking iPhones in order to bypass Apple 's software lock - down and allow the installation of applications not licensed by Apple .
Not so .
An option ( explained here ) on Droid phones already allows non-market applications to be installed .
Rooting the Droid allows users to take complete control of the smartphone .
This allows users to add functionality such as tethering for free , install non-Android applications , copy applications , disable automatic updates , or add multi - touch support .
The Droid is distributed by Verizon Wireless in the US .
A slightly modified version , known as the Motorola Milestone , was released in Germany and Italy last month .
It 's unclear whether the rooting hack works on the modified device . ®

Thanks to Karl Koscher and Jason Porter for each dropping us a note explaining what Droid rooting means and how it differs from jailbreaking iPhones .
I pay a lot of attention to weird things , and to weird weather .
I thought I had heard it all : mammatus clouds , inversion layers , parhelic arcs .
But I can still be surprised !
For example , I would 've sworn up and down that snow rollers -- giant rolls of snow that look like huge white Ho - Hos -- were fake .
But they are , in fact , real .
Back in March , Tim Tevebaugh saw some in Idaho and snapped away .
I could n't believe the photos , they 're so weird , I had to contact Tim .
He kindly replied , and gave me permission to post pictures :
There they are , sitting on a plain .
Evidently , wind conditions need to be just right , and the snow must be precisely the right consistency .
I do n't think anyone has seen them form , but I suspect a small clump of snow gets picked up by the wind and rolls into a snowball .
When it gets too big it collapses , starts rolling again , picks up more snow , collapses again , and eventually forms these long cylinders .
It 's just a guess , but it seems logical .
[ UPDATE : several commenters have pointed out that the ball need not collapse to make a roller ; I had supposed that happened to help spread the ball out horizontally .
I stand corrected ! ]
Just how bizarre are these things ?
Here 's another picture :
If you look at the big one on the right , you can see how it looks like a piece of foam that 's been rolled up , a testament to how it formed .
It like looking down the maw of the Doomsday Machine from Star Trek .
I would love to see something like this as it happened .
I 've not seen anything like it in Boulder , but we 're getting plenty of snow here , and it 's plenty windy here so one day I hope to spot them .
I 'm perpetually amazed at the imagination and creative power of nature .
Snow rollers !
Who knew ?
Tip o' the Frosty magic top hat to James Oberg and my thanks to Tim Tevebaugh for sending me the pictures and giving me permission to post them .
Apparently NASA ’s James Hansen has been as secretive over at NASA as the UK climate warming scientists caught up on Climategate were , refusing to release data by which NASA had made its calculations puruant to a Freedom of Information Act request .
A lawsuit is being filed .
From the story :
The fight over global warming science is about to cross the Atlantic with a U.S. researcher poised to sue NASA , demanding release of the same kind of climate data that has landed a leading British center in hot water over charges it skewed its data .
Chris Horner , a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , said NASA has refused for two years to provide information under the Freedom of Information
Act that would show how the agency has shaped its climate data and would explain why the agency has repeatedly had to correct its data going as far back as the 1930s .
“ I assume that what is there is highly damaging , ” Mr. Horner said .
“ These guys are quite clearly bound and determined not to reveal their internal discussions about this . ”
The numbers matter .
Under pressure in 2007 , NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934 , not 1998 , was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states .
NASA later changed that data again , and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first , with 1934 slightly cooler .
Throw open the books !
This issue is one of the most important of our times and “ the scientists ” have no right to keep the data secret or the methods of coming to conclusions .
Indeed , if global warming is so obvious and beyond debate , they would want us to see all the data .
All of it !
I mean , what better way to prove one ’s position than letting the data speak for itself ?
Ah , but if it is n’t , or if it has been wildly exaggerated , well , secrecy becomes a needed protection , does n’t it ?
I have always thought this was the case : Gore ’s refusal to debate has been more than just a matter of being imperious .
And Congress ?
You can hear the crickets chirping among the majority .
As I have said before , they know what they do n’t want to know .
All Weather Modern Boxhome
The Rintal Eggertsson Architects ’ construction of the lavish prefab home on a 19 sq. m. plot is perfectly developed to easy with the heat along with the stunning beauty .
As compared to the other similar constructions the Boxhome , as it has been named by the architects , is more economically convenient and ecologically sound among the neighborhood .
This eco friendly construction is absolutely compatible with the climatic conditions of the North Europe .
It is truly recommended that with such type of prefabricated modular houses , the provision for a summer and cottage house usage is readily possible though the premise is not quite suitable as a whole family accommodator .
Prefab House in a Remote Hilly Area
The hill tops at the Granite Falls in Washington just outside Seattle locate one of the most complex prefab homes .
The house though situated among spectacular scenic beauty , lacks the supply of electricity , water or road connectivity .
The frame work of this well constructed house is made of steel which indeed works as a preventive wall all along .
The surrounding of this unique and amazing house is thoroughly custom made by some fine artists who were the friends of the owner of this prefabricated house .
Though each and every prefab modular houses are quite similar to each other , this exquisite unique piece of construction is different from the similar houses .

The Obama administration is seeking to reverse a federal appeals court decision that dramatically narrows the government ’s search - and - seizure powers in the digital age .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan and Justice Department officials are asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its August ruling that federal prosecutors went too far when seizing 104 professional baseball players ’ drug results when they had a warrant for just 10 .
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ’ 9 - 2 decision offered Miranda - style guidelines to prosecutors and judges on how to protect Fourth Amendment privacy rights while conducting computer searches .
Kagan , appointed solicitor general by President Barack Obama , joined several U.S. attorneys in telling the San Francisco - based court Monday that the guidelines are complicating federal prosecutions in the West .
The circuit , the nation 's largest , covers nine states : Alaska , Arizona , California , Hawaii , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , Oregon and Washington .
" In some districts , computer searches have ground to a complete halt , " the authorities wrote .
" Many United States Attorney 's Offices have been chilled from seeking any new warrants to search computers . " ( .pdf )
The government is asking the court to review the case with all of its 27 judges , which it has never done .
If the court agrees to a rehearing , a new decision is not expected for years , and the August decision would be set aside pending a new ruling .
Either way , the U.S. Supreme Court has the final say .
The controversial decision , which the government said was contrary to Supreme Court precedent , outlined new rules on how the government may search computers . ( .pdf )
Ideally , when searching a computer ’s hard drive , the government should cull the specific data described in the search warrant , rather than copy the entire drive , the court said .
When that is not possible , the authorities must use an independent third party under the court 's supervision , whose job it would be to comb through the files for the specific information , and provide it , and nothing else , to the government , according to the ruling .
The government said the decision was already chilling at least one rape case in Washington State .
" Federal agents received information from their counterparts in San Diego that two individuals had filmed themselves raping a 4 - year - old girl and traded the images via the internet , " the government wrote .
" The agents did not obtain a warrant to search the suspects ' computers , however , because of concerns that any evidence discovered about other potential victims could not be disclosed by the filter team .
The agents therefore referred the case to state authorities . "
The circuit 's ruling came in a case that dates to 2004 , when federal prosecutors probing a Northern California steroid ring obtained warrants to seize the results of urine samples of 10 pro baseball players at a Long Beach , California drug - testing facility .
The players had been tested as part of a voluntary drug - deterrence program implemented by Major League Baseball .
Federal agents serving the search warrant on the Comprehensive Drug Testing lab wound up making a copy of a directory containing a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with results of every player that was tested in the program .
Then , back in the office , they scrolled freely through the spreadsheet , ultimately noting the names of all 104 players who tested positive .
The government argued that the information was lawfully found in " plain sight , " just like marijuana being discovered on a dining room table during a court - authorized weapons search of a home .
But the court noted that the agents actively scrolled to the right side of the spreadsheet to peek at all the players test results , when they could easily have selected , copied and pasted only the rows listing the players named in the search warrant .
Four players whose names were seized , and who were not linked to the BALCO investigation , have been leaked to The New York Times .
They are Alex Rodriguez , David Ortiz , Manny Ramirez and Sammie Sosa .
Two dissenting judges wrote that the majority was also sidestepping its own precedent in which the circuit court had denied the suppression of child pornography evidence found on a computer during a search for the production of false identification cards pursuant to a valid warrant .
In 2006 , the 9th Circuit originally sided with the government in a 2 - 1 decision , which the court overturned with an 11 - judge " en banc " panel in August .

Moving in slow motion ( Image : MadmàT / Getty )
Boosting brain waves can make people move in slow motion .
This finding is one of the first to show that brain waves directly influence behaviour , and it could lead to new treatments for Parkinson ’s disease and other disorders that affect movement .
Peter Brown and his colleagues at University College London generated a small electrical current in the brains of 14 healthy volunteers using scalp electrodes .
The current increased the activity of normal beta waves – a kind of brain wave that is usually active during sustained muscle activities , such as holding a book .
Beta activity usually drops before people begin a movement .
The participants then carried out a simple task : they moved a spot on a computer screen as quickly as possible using a joystick .
When beta wave activity increased , their fastest times slowed by 10 per cent .

“ This is the first time that beta wave activity has been shown to slow movement , ” Brown says .
Deep currents
Other studies have found that people with Parkinson ’s disease have greater beta activity .
Brown ’s research suggests this could be linked to the slowing of movement seen in those with the disease .
Electrical stimulation deep in the brain is used to treat people with Parkinson ’s , although how it works is a subject of debate .
The electrical currents used in the new study were too small to be felt by the participants , and the researchers were surprised they had such a measurable effect .
“ It ’s very interesting that artificially boosting the beta wave slows movements , ” says Stuart Baker of Newcastle University , UK .
“ This is a completely new way of thinking about how to treat patients with Parkinson ’s disease . ”
The findings are even more relevant for conditions of uncontrolled movement , such as dystonia and chorea , Brown said .
“ An electrode could be inserted under the skull to boost brain activity and slow down uncontrolled movement . ”

Meet Peter Higgs The Man Behind The God Particle
Physicist Peter Higgs is now world famous because of the subatomic particle bearing his name .
But his ideas were initially snubbed by the academic world , with his landmark publication predicting the existence of the Higgs boson being rejected at first .
The editor apparently did n't understand a word of it .
Von Margriet van der Heijden
There 's nothing that occupies a child like a colouring book and a box of crayons .
They can spend hours happily turning the dullest of outline drawings into something which rivals a Jimi Hendrix album cover .
Younger children may not always select the most appropriate colours for the job , but they will try to use different ones in adjoining regions , lest they lose the defined shape of what they 're colouring in .
They find it easier to do this – and it will yield the most psychedelic results – if they have a large box of crayons of every different shade .
On the other hand , if they have only a few crayons , it may still be possible to colour the picture in this way ; but how many do they need ?
Colouring Maps
This is another of those problems which has interested mathematicians for many years .
Now , there 's not much benefit to mankind in knowing how many crayons you might need to colour a picture of a rabbit , but there are some slightly more relevant applications , one being the colouring of maps .
Political maps divide an area of the world by country , state or county , and it 's important to colour adjoining regions differently to make the borders clear .
Cartographers supposedly want to keep their maps looking as simple as possible – and perhaps print them as cheaply as possible – by using the minimum number of colours .
It 's the same problem , though : how many colours do they actually need ?
To some extent it depends on the map .
If you have just a single region – an island , say – then you need only one colour , but then the surrounding sea will need a second colour – blue , presumably .
Islands with two countries – like Ireland , for example , which is divided into the UK - administered North and the Republic of Ireland in the South – would need three colours , including the sea .
Sometimes you need four colours .
Take the land - locked state of Nevada , USA ( pictured in red to the right ) .
This has borders with 5 other states , which , clockwise , are California , Oregon , Idaho , Utah and Arizona .
Let 's say we have only three crayons ( red , yellow and blue ) .
Now , we 'll start by colouring Nevada red , and we 'll use the other two colours for its neighbours .
So , California is yellow , Oregon blue , Idaho yellow , Utah blue , but what about Arizona ?
It has borders with California , Nevada and Utah , all of which are different colours .
We need a fourth , green crayon .
So , we know we need four colours for some maps , but do we ever need five or more for other , more complicated configurations ?
Well , it did n't seem so .
All the maps we drew could indeed be coloured with no more than four crayons .
There was a lingering doubt , though .
Countries we know about are fairly straightforward in shape .
Had we really tested ourselves with all manner of fiendishly shaped nations and twisty borders ?
Until someone proved otherwise , it was always possible that a super - Nevada was out there that needed a fifth , purple crayon .
The thought of some poor cartographer being caught short was not one to be entertained .
The world of mathematics needed an answer .
Guthrie 's Conjecture and Kempe's ' Proof '
The first mathematician to go on record as stating that four colours looked sufficient for all maps was Francis Guthrie , a student at University College , London in the 1850s .
Guthrie had n't proved anything – it was just a conjecture .
Once the problem became discussed in mathematical circles it captured the imagination of some of the finest mathematicians of the age , including Augustus de Morgan ( who was tutoring Guthrie 's brother Frederick ) and Arthur Cayley .
Other mathematicians , including Alexander Hamilton wisely avoided it .
The first ' proof ' was claimed in 1879 by Alfred Bray Kempe , a London barrister .
It was accepted by his peers , and published in both Nature and the American Journal of Mathematics .
It even won this amateur mathematician a fellowship of the Royal Society .
His elegant proof , as with any proof of this theorem , is too long and complicated to describe in full in this Entry , but it was based on the following principles .
Kempe tried to prove the four colour theorem by contradiction .
If there were to exist a map which required five colours , then it would fail to follow a particular argument in mathematical logic .
Therefore , such a map could not exist , so no more than four colours would be necessary to colour any map .
As a starting point , Kempe knew that it was impossible to have a map where every region has six or more neighbours .
Mathematically , this result followed from work by Leonhard Euler , who had established a formula connecting the numbers of sides , corners and edges for geometric figures .
Therefore , every map had to contain within it at least one of the following ' unavoidable set ' of configurations :
A region with two neighbours , or ' digon ' ( like Liechtenstein , landlocked between Austria and Switzerland ) ;
) ; A region with three neighbours , or ' triangle ' ( like Luxembourg , nestled between France , Belgium and Germany ) ;
) ; A region with four neighbours , or ' square ' ( like the Czech Republic , lying between Germany , Poland , Slovakia and Austria ) ; or
) ; or A region with five neighbours , or ' pentagon ' ( like Slovakia , which has Austria , Czech Republic , Poland , Ukraine and Hungary neighbouring it ) .
Kempe then argued that if there were to exist a map which required five colours , then there must be a simplest - possible version of it , having the minimum number of regions , such that when you removed any one of those regions , it would then need no more than four colours .
All he needed to do , therefore , was to consider each of the above configurations ( the digon , triangle , square and pentagon ) , one of which would have to appear in any such map .
In each case , he did the following :
He removed the country from the map , by shrinking it to a point .
By definition , this resulted in one fewer colour being required .
He reinstated the country , then attempted to show that the resulting map could be coloured with only four colours .
If he could do this for every configuration in his unavoidable set , then this would contradict the logical argument and so prove the four colour conjecture to be true .
Kempe tackled each of the configurations in turn .
Maps for the digon and triangle - shaped countries were very simple to reconstruct with four colours ( Mathematicians say a configuration is ' reducible ' if they can do this ) .
The square country was a little more tricky , but by re-colouring the neighbouring countries and considering logical chains of outlying neighbours , he indeed showed the square was reducible .
Finally , he tackled the pentagon , and , by recolouring two countries simultaneously , again showed that it could be reduced .
Kempe had proved the four colour theorem by demonstrating with flawless logic that each configuration was reducible ... or had he ?
Percy Heawood : Party Pooper
Eleven years later , the mathematician Percy Heawood spotted a flaw .
Using Kempe 's logic , Heawood showed that for a pentagon - shaped country , if neighbouring countries were re-coloured simultaneously , then a certain configuration of regions would require a fifth colour .
Neither Kempe nor any of the other mathematicians who had previously embraced his now - shattered proof had any answer to it .
The four colour theorem became a conjecture once again .
Despite this flaw in his reasoning , Kempe had actually done a lot of good mathematical work .
His ideas , particularly the unavoidable set of configurations and consideration of their reducibility , became standard techniques for those who would follow .
Heawood also used Kempe 's analysis to prove that no more than five colours were necessary to colour any map .
Kempe 's work was to inspire other mathematicians , including those who were eventually to solve the problem .
Yet , many years were to pass , as a succession of mathematicians attempted to define the Holy Grail of an unavoidable set of reducible configurations .
The pentagon was clearly not good enough on its own , as Heawood had shown , but it could be split into a larger set of more specific combinations , for example : a pentagon flanked by a square , or one flanked by another pentagon alongside a triangle .
The trouble was that there would turn out to be very many of these , each of which would have to be proven to be reducible .
Countless attempts were made to do just this for much of the 20th Century , yet all claims of success failed under closer scrutiny .
Being such a simple problem to define , many mathematicians became obsessed by it , convinced that it would be easy to solve .
One story involves the wives of American mathematicians George Birkhoff and Arthur Bernhart , who met at a mathematical society meeting .
Said Mrs Birkhoff to the newly married Mrs Bernhart :
Did your husband make you colour maps on your honeymoon , too ?
Map colouring also became a popular subject for so - called mathematical cranks , amateurs who flooded academic institutions with letters outlining their outlandish ' proofs ' , often refusing to accept the flaws subsequently pointed out in their logic .
Mathematicians were only able to finally prove the four colour theorem in the 1970s , using a very un-mathematical technique .
Appel and Haken
It became clear to many that the unavoidable set would be very large , possible including many thousands of configurations , each of which would need to be proven as reducible .
It seemed that this could turn out to be simply too onerous a task .
An advance came in the 1960s , when the German mathematician Heinrich Heesch from the University of Hannover used computers to classify certain configurations as reducible , using a technique from network theory known as discharging .
News of Heesch 's technique then reached Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken of the University of Illinois .
They approached the problem from the other direction : they experimented with programming a computer to compile configurations , checking each in turn for reducibility using an improved version of Heesch 's method , with the aim of eventually completing an unavoidable set .
Every time the computer found an irreducible configuration , or if it spent too long in checking it , then the attempt would be abandoned and the whole process would start again .
Effectively , they were compiling their unavoidable set with an element of trial and error .
In June 1976 , to cut a long story short , they achieved it .
Appel and Haken 's unavoidable set comprised just under 2,000 configurations , and the program took 1,000 hours of computer time to run .
The news hit the headlines around the world :
Their proof , published today , runs to 100 pages of summary , 100 pages of detail and a further 700 pages of backup work .
It contains 10,000 diagrams , and the computer printout stands four feet high on the floor .
— The Times , 23 July , 1976 .
Almost 100 years after Kempe 's ill - fated proof , the four colour conjecture was a theorem once again , but not everybody agreed .
A fierce philosophical debate ensued about the nature of Appel and Haken 's proof .
This was n't the kind of proof you could pick up and read .
It was n't an ' a priori deduction of a statement from premises ' .
There was a gaping hole in the middle of it which was filled with an experiment , one which had been performed by a large piece of tin with flashing lights , also known as an IBM 370 - 168 .
Deep
Thought had provided the answer .
You have to take your hat off to the programmers , though .
As we would later see with Fermat 's Last Theorem , each mathematician tackling this problem had stood on the shoulders of the giants before them to arrive at the final result .
We always thought the four colour conjecture was true , but now we knew it .
Appel and Haken took the glory , and deservedly so .
It was terribly tedious , with no intellectual stimulation .
There is no simple , elegant answer , and we had to make an absolutely horrendous case analysis of every possibility .
I hope it will encourage mathematicians to realise that there are some problems still to be solved , where there is no God - given answer , and which can only be solved by detailed work .
Some people might think they 're best left unsolved .

The North Korean leader Kim Jong -il is trying to smother his country 's fragile free market with a shock currency devaluation that has reportedly sparked panic , chaos and protests inside the isolated Stalinist state .
Monday 's devaluation of Pyongyang 's nearly worthless currency from 100 to a single won has wiped out the savings of impoverished North Koreans and generated a scramble for dollars and Chinese yuan , say sources behind the bamboo curtain .
Millions of Koreans have been given until next Monday to exchange their savings for the new won following Monday 's decree , which has caused " great confusion " and anger , says South Korea 's Chosun Ilbo newspaper .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Intelligence services in the South report that Pyongyang has stepped up security around the country of 23.5 million people as a safeguard against possible protests and riots , with army bases placed on standby .
Officials are bracing themselves for a furious reaction to news that a deposit of 200,000 won in cash to a North Korean bank will yield just 1,100 won in the new currency .
There were unconfirmed reports that brief protests on the streets of Pyongyang had already forced the authorities to slightly increase the amount of currency people would be allowed to exchange .
The devaluation has already sent the price of rice skyrocketing 15 - fold , according to Daily NK , an online newspaper sourced by defectors and informers in the North .
" This move will do nothing other than destroy the fortunes of the people , " it warns .
The significance of the move has divided Pyongyang analysts with some seeing it as an attempt to end inflation .
But others believe the ailing Mr Kim is struggling to reassert control over the economy before he hands the keys to power to his son , Kim Jong-un .
Kim Jong - un has already been declared leader - in - waiting , according to Japan 's Mainichi newspaper , which claims to have seen official documents confirming the handover .
Many believe his father is worried he may not survive the transition unless the North 's disintegrating economy improves .
Famine , compounded by a series of natural disasters , is thought to have claimed 2 - 3 million lives inside the country since the mid-1990s .
Mr Kim has responded with a series of limited Chinese - style reforms designed to loosen central control over the economy .
The reforms have increased wealth disparities and incubated a growing class of wealthier farmers and merchants who are evading state controls and using bribery to keep government officials in line , say Pyongyang watchers .
In January , the government failed in its attempt to rein in the reforms by limiting or closing private markets .
" Currency reform was probably the only option left to neutralise the wealthy merchant class , " a North Korean defector and analyst , Cho Myong - chol , told Chosun Ilbo yesterday .
" The latest measure has made everyone poor again and possibly raised the North Korean government 's hopes of regaining control over its people . "
News of Mr Kim 's decree comes amid claims that the North 's military has also reasserted control over mines and other areas of the economy in a bid to earn hard currency before the transition of power – likely to be one of the most traumatic periods in the country 's troubled history .
The army is reportedly selling minerals to China and hoarding the earnings .
Observers say the devaluation will destroy the savings of poorer and middle - class North Koreans while leaving wealthier traders , who have hoarded yuan , dollars and gold , mostly untouched .
Analysts in South Korea were warning last night that the move could backfire and even spark revolt .
" Currency reform ... will follow in the footsteps of past currency reforms , most likely resulting in further reduced confidence in the North Korean currency and heightened reliance on foreign currency holdings , whilst doing nothing to address the underlying causes of inflation in the highly distorted North Korean market economy , " says Daily NK .
It said some areas of the North were under curfew and that shops have been ordered shuttered while the currency transition takes place .
" I worked like a dog for two months for the winter , but the money became useless paper overnight , " said one man quoted by the Seoul - based support group Good Friends .
Most of us are aware that our cars , our coal - generated electric power and even our cement factories adversely affect the environment .
Until recently , however , the foods we eat had gotten a pass in the discussion .
Yet according to a 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , our diets and , specifically , the meat in them cause more greenhouse gases carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane , nitrous oxide , and the like to spew into the atmosphere than either transportation or industry .
( Greenhouse gases trap solar energy , thereby warming the earth 's surface .
Because gases vary in greenhouse potency , every greenhouse gas is usually expressed as an amount of CO2 with the same global - warming potential . )
The authorities will deal with Nidal Malik Hasan , the Army psychiatrist who is accused of bringing the nightmare of mass murder into the sanctuary of a military base on American soil .
But the rest of us need to look very closely at the stress beyond belief that is being endured by so many other men and women in the armed forces  men and women who are serving gallantly and with dignity , who have not taken out their frustrations on one another , and who deserve better from the broader society .
Simply stated , we cannot continue sending service members into combat for three tours , four tours , five tours and more without paying a horrendous price in terms of the psychological well - being of the troops and their families , and the overall readiness of the armed forces to protect the nation .
The breakdowns are already occurring and will only get worse as the months and years pass and we remain engaged in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq .
None of this is the military ’s fault .
There have not been nearly enough people willing to serve in the all - volunteer armed forces to properly staff two wars that have already gone on for the better part of a decade .
I spent some time on the West Coast recently interviewing doctors and researchers studying the enormous problem of troops returning from Afghanistan and Iraq with some form of mental health disorder , most commonly depression and post - traumatic stress disorder , or P.T.S.D .
The caseloads are off the charts , and very often the P.T.S.D. or depression ( or both ) are accompanied by substance abuse , problems with anger management , domestic violence and family breakdown .
even after a few wearings .
Although I had changed to deodorants that did not contain aluminum , I still had some yellowing .
I tried many things , obviously all wrong , and this worked !
I am so thankful for this information .

Press Release : IMF Announces Sale of 2 Metric Tons of Gold to the Bank of Mauritius
Press Release No. 09/413
November 16 , 2009
The International Monetary Fund announced today the sale of 2 metric tons of gold to the Bank of Mauritius , the nation ’s central bank .
The sale was conducted on the basis of market prices prevailing on November 11 , 2009 with proceeds equivalent to US $ 71.7 million ( SDR 44.7 million ) .
This transaction is part of the total sales of 403.3 metric tons approved by the Executive Board in September 2009 ( see Press Release No. 09/310 ) , and it adds to the 200 metric tons already sold to the Reserve Bank of India ( see Press Release No. 09/381 ) .
As previously announced ( see Press Release No. 09/310 ) , in accordance with the guiding principle of avoiding disruption of the gold market , the IMF ’s Executive Board adopted modalities for the gold sales consistent with guidelines it had earlier established .
In particular , the Fund is standing ready for an initial period to sell gold directly to central banks and other official holders that may be interested in such sales .
Thereafter , on - market sales of any amounts remaining from the 403.3 tons would be conducted in a phased manner over time , following the approach adopted successfully by central banks participating in the Central Bank Gold Agreement .
As previously indicated , the Fund will inform markets before any on - market sales commence , and will report regularly to the public on progress with the gold sales .

The 1861 letter was written personally by President Lincoln
A letter written by former US President Abraham Lincoln to a schoolboy nearly 150 years ago is to go on sale for $ 60,000 ( £ 36,000 ) in Philadelphia .
George Patten was with his journalist father when both met the commander - in - chief .
The 16th US president wrote in 1861 after the eight - year - old was mocked by his disbelieving classmates .
The handwritten , signed note confirms the pair met and was sent two weeks after the Lincoln 's inauguration .
The letter reads : " Whom it may concern , I did see and talk with master George Evans Patten , last May , at Springfield , Illinois .
Respectfully , A Lincoln . "
Lincoln put pen to paper after the boy 's teacher wrote to him .
Nathan Raab , vice - president of the Raab Collection , which is selling the letter , said there were no other known surviving letters written by Lincoln to a child .
This year , a number of events have been held across the US to mark the bicentenary of the former president 's birth .

There are two kinds of priority in the CHP style of concurrent programming : priority on processes and priority on events .
Priority on processes is about specifying that a high - priority process P should run whenever possible , at the expense of a low - priority process Q .
This is difficult to co-ordinate across multiple cores ( especially if lightweight threads are used , as in Haskell ) and is n’t offered by all run-times .
The priority I am interested in discussing in this post is that of events : specifying that if two events A and B are ready to complete , A should happen in preference to B .
There is an immediate problem with local priorities over events , where each process separately specifies its priorities to the events it is offering .
Imagine that you offer to either go to the cinema , or go bowling , and you prefer ( i.e. give priority to ) the cinema .
Your friend also offers to go to the cinema or to go bowling , but they prefer ( give priority to ) bowling .
For a one - off choice of doing one thing , there is no amount of algorithmic cleverness that can resolve such situations to the satisfaction of both parties .
So local priorities , where both sides can specify their own priorities , are fairly meaningless because in general they cannot be resolved correctly .
One way to solve this is to only allow one side to specify a priority .
The occam language did this ; only processes reading from channels were allowed to specify priority , not the writers .
( In fact , only processes reading from channels were allowed to offer a choice ! )
This means that the priorities can always be satisfied because you only have one set of priorities to resolve in each choice .
This falls down with barriers — it becomes difficult to specify which synchronising process of many is allowed to offer priorities .
Another solution is to have global priorities instead .
If we specify up - front that the cinema is always better than bowling , there can be no dispute when we make our offers for activities for the evening .
This could be implemented , for example , by assigning a global integer priority to all events ( perhaps with 0 as the default ) .
I gather that global priorities make things difficult for formal reasoning in CSP , but that does not mean we can not use it .
CHP and Prioritised Choice
So what does CHP do ?
Events do not currently have global priority ( although I would like to implement it at some point ) .
There is an unprioritised choice operator , <-> ( with a list form : alt ) , which is commutative and associative .
But there is also a prioritised choice operator , </> ( with a list form : priAlt ) , which is associative but not , of course , commutative .
Its existence is partly a historical hangover from the first version of CHP ( which was a more direct conversion from occam ) , and it has some slightly intricate semantics , which I ’ll describe here in terms of the list form .
The relative positions in the list of any guards involving reading from channels , writing to channels , or synchronising on barriers are discounted .
So priAlt [ readChannel c , syncBarrier b ] is the same as priAlt [ syncBarrier b , readChannel c ] .
The position of any stop guards is irrelevant because they will never trigger .
The position of any skip guards is important in relation to all the other guards .
priAlt ( skip : others ) is guaranteed to choose the first guard , regardless of what comes after .
Similarly , priAlt ( initialGuards ++ [ skip ] ++ otherGuards ) will never choose any of the otherGuards , but if any of the initialGuards are ready , they will be chosen in preference to the skip .
Effectively , skip is like an early terminator for the list of guards passed to priAlt ( but do n’t go overboard — I do n’t think passing an infinite list of guards will work , even if skip is early on ) .
In contrast , the presence of skip guards in an unprioritised choice is generally wrong ; the outcome of alt [ readChannel c , skip ] is non-deterministic , even if c is ready .
Polling
Generally in my examples on the blog , I have always avoided the use of priAlt and </> in favour of alt and <-> because the former is only really different to the latter when skip guards are present , and thus the latter form , being more clearly an unprioritised choice , is better .
There is one , slightly inelegant , use for prioritised choice though : polling .
Imagine that you want to poll to see if a channel is ready .
If it is , you are happy to read from it , but if it ’s not ready yet , you want to continue on and do something else .
That is easy to capture : readChannel c </> skip .
In fact , it is possible to capture this as a helper function :
poll :: CHP a -> CHP ( Maybe a ) poll c = ( Just < $> c ) </> ( skip >> return Nothing )
You can even nest these things ; this code will check channels c and d for readiness ( if both are ready , either might be taken ) , and return Nothing only if neither is ready :
poll ( alt [ readChannel c , readChannel d ] )
It is also important to be aware that this polling is only a snapshot of the current state .
If you poll channel c , you have no guarantee that the result of the poll will still hold by the time you get the result .
So if you poll channel c , and find it is not ready , it may have turned ready by the time you examine the result and make a subsequent decision .
A particularly bad use would be to have both ends polling : if one process continually polls to read from c , and the other process continually polls to write to c , depending on timing , it is quite possible that no communication will ever take place .
It is only really a good idea to use polling if you know the other end will stay committed to the action once offered ( i.e. that it is not offering a choice of events ) .
Emulating Priority
This pattern can also be used to give one event a form of priority over another .
This code :
readChannel c </> ( skip >> alt [ readChannel c , readChannel d ] )
First checks to see if c was ready .
If so , it takes it , otherwise it waits for the next event of c and d .
So it gives a form of priority to c .
This is not foolproof priority ; if another process later offers c and d there is no guarantee that c will be chosen , so it only provides real priority if different processes are offering the events involved .
Malalai Joya is known around the world as a courageous opponent of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan , the corrupt regime presided over by President Hamid Karzai–and the Taliban and other conservative Islamist forces battling U.S. and Afghan government troops .
An uncompromising fighter for women ’s rights , Joya was elected to parliament in 2005 , where she denounced the presence of representatives who she called “ warlords ” and “ war criminals . ”
In 2007 , she was suspended on the grounds that she had “ insulted ” fellow members .
An international solidarity campaign has rallied support for her .
Joya has been the target of assassination attempts and must travel in Afghanistan with armed bodyguards , wearing a burqa as a disguise .
She has written a new book about her life , A Woman Among Warlords : The Extraordinary Story of an Afghan Who Dared to Raise Her Voice [ 1 ] .
As the first stop on a speaking tour of the U.S. , Malalai Joya was the featured speaker on a panel discussion at the Northeast Socialist Conference in New York City on October 23 .
Introducing her were several American opponents of the U.S. war on Afghanistan , including Iraq Veterans Against the War member Mathis Chiroux .
Here , we print edited excerpts from Joya ’s speech .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
GOOD EVENING , everyone .
First of all , let me thank the [ US ] International Socialist Organization , which invited me here and gave me this opportunity to talk about the ongoing disaster in my country , and about the activities of the so - called “ war on terror ” by the U.S. and NATO – which is not a war on terror , but a war on innocent civilians .
And let me thank our dear brother Mathis .
We are so proud of you , Mathis .
I am short of words on behalf of my people to express my feeling to Mathis and the many Mathises and all of you who will not leave us alone in this disastrous situation .
By your support , you give us more determination and courage , and hopes that will not sit silent .
I will never forget the first time that I met Mathis–it gave me that much hope in the meantime .
Like now , Mathis was talking , and I could n’t control my tears , because he was apologizing to me for the war crimes of the U.S. government .
I said no , it is your government that must first of all apologize to democratic people like you , for deceiving you and sending you to war in my country .
And not only in my country , but Iraq–and today , as one of our friends mentioned , what they are going to do in Pakistan by drone attacks .
I said to Mathis that they first of all must apologize to you , the democratic people of United States , and especially to the troops , because they are the victims of a wrong policy of their government–they have been sent for a bad cause , for war .
Democracy never comes by gun .
Democracy never comes by cluster bomb .
Democracy never comes by war .
I hope that we will have more brothers like Mathis , who will stand up and refuse to go to war in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan .
In fact , the United States occupies these two countries , and especially in my country , it is under the banner of woman rights and democracy .
It is even worse than Iraq .
Why ?
Because they brought into power a photocopy of the Taliban , with a mask of democracy , and a suit and tie .
But do not believe it .
They are still deceiving people around the world .
They are responsible for the current disaster in Afghanistan .
They are the foreign masters , the U.S. government and its allies in NATO .
And now they are going to negotiate with the Taliban .
I have a lot to say about the ongoing disaster in my country , and I can talk for hours about how much this means , the actions of Mathis and the many Mathises .
Mathis , you said I am a hero , but you are our hero .
We really love you , and my people hope one day that we will see you in my country –in a democratic Afghanistan .
This is my dream for the future of Afghanistan .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
THERE IS a famous saying : “ Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . ”
Your international solidarity is key .
As always , nations are separate from the policymakers .
It is the governments that are committing these war crimes .
They are betraying democracy , women ’s rights and human rights , and they are betraying the truth .
The mainstream media is still trying to throw dust in the eyes of democrat people around the world .
You know what your government is doing now ?
They have put a soft name on the Taliban , these terrorist people , to bring them into power as well .
Mullah Omar–this fascist man , this dinosaur–is not in power , and neither is Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , but they want to bring them into power to complete the circle of warlordism and drug lordism and terrorism in my country .
The U.S. is occupying my country and making a military base there .
They are not leaving my country because of their strategy and policies .
They do n’t care about the wishes of my people –how much they are fed up by the situation .
Now , my people are sandwiched between two powerful enemies .
Democracy is the alternative for the future of Afghanistan .
But there are still many risks for us .
Those who tell the truth , those who stand and praise the war against injustice , insecurity and occupation receive death threats .
They get killed or they have to leave Afghanistan .
The first casualty is the truth .
Let me say a few things about the role of troops first , since now Obama wants to surge with more troops in Afghanistan .
His foreign policy is quite similar to the wrong policy of the Bush administration .
It ’s even worse –according to officials statistics , even more civilians have been killed than during the same time period under Bush .
The worst massacre in Afghanistan from September 11 to now happened during the presidency of Obama .
In May , in Farah province , a bombing killed 150 civilians , most of them women and children .
They were even using white phosphorus and cluster bombs .
On September 9 , a bombing in Kunduz province –you may have heard about this through the media–killed 200 civilians , and again , most of them women and children .
Then , after all these crimes , White House says it apologizes , and Karzai ’s government –this puppet regime–says thank you .
That ’s it .
My people are so fed up that they want an end of the occupation –the end of this so - called war on terror–as soon as possible .
As long as these troops are in Afghanistan , the worse the war will be .
Through the mainstream media , they are telling you and democratic people around the world that civil war will happen if the U.S. withdraws , but nobody is talking about civil war today .
Eight years ago , the U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan under the banner of women ’s rights .
Today , the situation for women –half of the population of the country–is hell in most of the provinces .
Killing a woman is as easy as killing a horse .
A few days before I come here , in Sar-e Pol province in the north of Afghanistan , a 5 - year - old girl was kidnapped and killed .
The rape of women and kidnapping and acid attacks–all of this violence is increasing rapidly , even at historical levels .
And all of these crimes are happening in the name of democracy , women ’s rights and human rights .
I ’m saying that as long as these warlords are in power along with these occupation forces , there is no hope to make positive changes in the lives of the men and women of my country .
It ’s not only women who are suffering .
If I talked only about conditions for women , it would be all morning , but I would n’t even be finished .
All of this shocking news that the media never even gives to the people around the world .
Women do n’t even have a human life .
But today , women and men do n’t have liberation .
Millions of Afghans suffer from injustice , insecurity , corruption , joblessness , etc .
Your government says that it sent troops there so that girls can go to school , but according to official figures from the government , more than 600 schools have been closed .
When the girls go to school , they throw acid on their faces .
I think education is important–very important in my country .
I always say that it ’s the key to our emancipation .
But security is more important than food and water .
They keep the situation dangerous like this so they can stay longer in Afghanistan because of their strategy and policies .
To know more about the deep tragedy of Afghanistan , during these eight years , they changed my country to the capital of the center of drug trade .
Today , 93 percent of opium produced in the world is from Afghanistan .
The brother of Hamid Karzai , Ahmed Wali Karzai , is a famous drug trafficker , as the New York Times recently wrote .
Through dirty business of opium , every year , $ 500 million goes into the pocket of Taliban alone .
And since 2001 , there has been a 4,500 percent increase in opium .
If the U.S. government do n’t stop this wrong policy , the drugs will find their way onto streets of New York , and destroy the life of youth here as well .
Another example of the catastrophic situation of my country is that a few days ago , the United Nations human development index ranked Afghanistan 181st out of 182 countries .
This is a country where the government received $ 36 billion over the past years , according to official reports .
Where did that money go ?
Into pockets of warlords and drug lords –these criminals and misogynists .
Today , 18 million people of my country live on less $ 2 a day .
Mothers in Herat and Ghor provinces are ready to sell their babies for $ 10 because they cannot feed them .
And this is another example of many shocking examples that never made it to mainstream media .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
MY PEOPLE are caught now between two powerful enemies , and they are being crushed .
From the sky , the bombs of the occupation forces are falling , killing civilians .
And on the ground , there is the Taliban , and also these warlords .
So we have three kinds of enemies .
But the withdrawal of one enemy –these U.S. occupation forces whose government sends them for war , and that also supports the corrupt mafia system of Hamid Karzai with more money and guys –will make it much easier to fight the enemies that are left .
I promise I will never be tired as long as war is in Afghanistan as well as in other countries –what is going on in Iraq , in Burma , in Pakistan , in Palestine .
The list can be longer .
No nation can bring liberation to another nation .
These are nations that can liberate themselves .
The nations that pose themselves as liberators to others will lead them into slavery .
What we have experienced in Afghanistan and in Iraq prove this point .
If the U.S. and its allies let us have a little bit of space and peace , then we know what to do with our destiny .
The people of Afghanistan do n’t want occupation .
They need honest support , they need educational support , they need your powerful voice –which means , first of all , international solidarity against the warmongers of your government .
Regarding Barack Obama , and the Nobel Peace Prize , they are giving the Peace Prize to the president of war–who is carrying out war in Afghanistan , in Iraq and in Pakistan , and is also supporting the criminal regime of Israel and what is going on today in Palestine .
Many heroes and heroines are risking their lives and doing a lot for peace , but nobody knows their name .
They must be nominated for the prize .
I think the question for Obama is , so far after nine months , what did he do for piece that he received this Nobel Peace Prize ?
And in such a disastrous situation , they are talking about so - called democratic elections .
I think you would agree with us that an election under the shadow of guns , warlordism , drug lordism , awful corruption and occupation forces has no legitimacy at all .
There ’s a famous saying that it ’s not important who ’s voting , it ’s important who is counting .
That ’s our problem .
Some democrats ran for the election in Afghanistan , but all the ballot boxes are in the hands of mafia .
They betrayed the vote of my people .
Before the results of the election , people in my country discussed among each other that the result is like the same donkey –hopefully , I wo n’t be insulting to donkeys–but with a new saddle .
Everyone knows that winner of the election will be picked by the White House .
There ’s a huge difference between the presidential election and the parliamentary and provincial elections .
For the parliamentary election , we have some chance for democrats to run , and that is my message to my people .
If a few of us are allowed , it ’s good to be in these national bodies to be a small voice of our people .
As I experienced , in this parliament , I said it was worse than animals –that it ’s like a zoo .
These criminals told me that I must apologize for this comment .
I said that I must say apologize to the tanimals that I insult .
Do n’t misunderstand–in our parliament , we have a few democrats , men and women .
Unfortunately , you can count them very quickly , but it ’s good to be the voice of the people .
But for the presidential election , we have one choice –the person who will be the next puppet .
Do not be deceived with this melodrama of a so - called democratic election –I think it ’s the most ridiculous election anywhere in the world .
They spent $ 250 million for the election while people do not have enough food to eat .
Less than 10 percent of people participated in the election .
And now they want to waste more money .
That ’s why we believe that your government and NATO are wasting taxpayer money and the blood of your soldiers in Afghanistan by supporting such a terrorist .
I gave only a few examples of the disastrous situation of my country .
I ’m saying that my people can liberate themselves .
But we need your helping hand .
As always , I again stress that we separate people from the - policy makers of their government .
We are honored that we have the support of democratic - minded and peace - loving people in the U.S.
But we need more of your solidarity and support for our country .
Let me conclude my speech with a quote from Bertolt Brecht , who said that “ Those who struggle may fail , but those who do not struggle have already failed . ”
Thanks a lot for your solidarity and support .

This article first appeared in the US magazine Socialist Worker
Way back in 2006 ( and prior to that at my old site ) , I raised a question of how a libertarian society deals with children .
It ’s well summarized from this comment :
If a parent believes in spanking , we do n’t take the child away from the parents .
If the parents are beating their children abusively , we do .
There is a point at which the parent is a danger to the successful development of a child , and the child should not have to pay for the parent ’s sins .
To a statist , there ’s nothing inconsistent here .
The state knows best , and when they believe you are over the line , they take your child .
But to a libertarian , who does n’t believe the state knows best , this is inconsistent .
Kids are pre-adults , and human beings with natural rights .
It can not be true that parents “ own ” their children , as slavery is incompatible with natural rights .
But kids not being capable of fully exercising individual natural rights , it is parents who appoint themselves as “ guardian ” or “ caretaker ” of that child until he / she is old enough to take control of his / her own life .
But where ’s the line between stern and abusive parenting , and where ’s the line between creative and unique upbringing and damaging your child by starting their lives under a fictional language only spoken on a TV show and amongst its most rabid fans :
Is this taking the whole Star Trek thing a teensie weensie bit too far ?
d’Armond Speers spoke only Klingon to his child for the first three years of its life .
Klingon ?
Not Spanish , French , Mandarin ?
Not some gutteral genuflecting concoction from the deepest recesses of Borneo ?
Klingon ?
You heard it right .
( And if you do n’t know about the Klingon Empire , look it up . )
“ I was interested in the question of whether my son , going through his first language acquisition process , would acquire it like any human language , ” Speers told the Minnesota Daily .
“ He was definitely starting to learn it . ”
This case is made even more difficult in that this guy is not some guy living in his parents ’ basement watching Star Trek all day , he has a doctorate in computational linguistics .
So two questions here :
1 ) At what point is it morally acceptable for a libertarian to interfere with a parent in the protection of a child ?
2 ) Where does speaking to your kids in only Klingon until age 3 fall into that spectrum ?
Hat Tip : Popehat
Exclusive to STR
In one easy step , here 's how we do it : pull out completely .
That 's it .
Just leave .
The countries will do just fine without us .
I 'll use history as a guide .
In the 20th Century , America won just one war : Vietnam .
What 's that , you say ?
We did n't win ?
We left in ignoble defeat , fleeing in our helicopters and pushing them off of our ships into the blue deep sea ?
How is that winning ?
I 'll tell you how we won over there .
We left , and the place is doing just fine without us .
If the U.S. had won , do you know what Vietnam would be like today ?
We 'd still be there , spending billions of dollars a year to maintain military bases .
Probably to " contain China . "
Ever been to a military base ?
I have .
They are surrounded by bars and pawnshops .
Oh yeah -- and lots of whores .
Most are disgusting places , and are certainly no place for a young man to be .
If we had won militarily in Vietnam , we'd have military bases there , surrounded by the same things as they are over here , only worse .
Vietnamese hookers ( and lots of half - breed kids ) , gambling , drugs , alcohol , crime , theft , rape , murder .
We 'd have lots of dull - witted bureaucrats over there , screwing things up in their patronage jobs .
The billions of dollars we 'd funnel over there would be skimmed off by corrupt Vietnamese and end up in offshore bank accounts , and right before the crooks find the jig is up , they 'd flee to the French Riveria , and spend the rest of their days in luxury , on my dime .
And yours , too .
That 's what would happen if we had won militarily in Vietnam .
In the 20th Century , we did not win one war except Vietnam , and that " win " cost us 58,000 casualties and a few million dead Southeast Asians .
If we had stayed out in the first place , most of those people would still be alive and whole , and Vietnam would probably be more advanced than it is now .
We did not win World War I , which was a European War and none of our business anyway .
The combatants over there had fought to a stalemate and were about ready to quit -- until we got involved .
Every country in that European war was equally guilty , yet all of it was blamed on Germany .
Enter the utterly deluded Woodrow Wilson and the Treaty of Versailles , and the world ended up with Hitler , Stalin , and World War II .
After World War II , Christian Eastern Europe was delivered to Communist atheists for 50 years , Israel was founded in the middle of a 2000 - year - old war , and the next thing you know , crazed fanatical Muslims are flying airplanes into our buildings to get revenge on us for supporting Arab dictators and Israel .
All those problems are what comes from the U.S. walking to and fro in the world , and meddling mightily in it , and certainly not following what George Washington said in his Farewell Address : trade with the world but stay out of their political problems .
Every place in the world where the U.S. Empire maintains bases has problems because we are over there and not over here .
We even have bases in Portugal .
We still have bases in Germany .
One of my cousins , who had been assigned to Germany when he was in the Army , said the Germans around the bases " hated us , so we hated them back . "
Now when did World War II supposedly end ?
Sometime in the middle of the 1940s , I think ?
What problems do we have with Vietnam these days ?
None that I can think of .
Why ?
Because we 're not over there anymore !
I have decided a long time ago war is more the natural state of mankind than peace .
Since at least World World I , we have been involved in a continuous war , with time off every once in a while for a breather .
And none of it is necessary , if we would just pull out of other countries and just trade peacefully with them .
Fat chance of that , what with our worldwide American Empire trying to impose " democracy and freedom " on all those recalcitrant , ungrateful wogs .
Mostly by killing them by the millions , like we did in Southeast Asia .
Just kill enough of them , and they 'll be our friends !
The only thing good that will come out of the American Empire is that sooner or later it will collapse ( as all empires collapse ) and we will come home .
Of course , it will happen after oceans of mud and blood and folly .
Orwell had it right : when the State gets involved , it tells everyone that War is Peace .
Orwell also said one of the most important things in his life was tending his vegetable garden .
As far as I 'm concerned , he was right on both counts .
Quick - Charge Batteries Get a Boost from Defective Carbon Nanotubes
November 20th , 2009 by Tina Casey
Researchers at the University of San Diego have discovered that carbon nanotubes do n’t have to be perfect to do a better job .
The team of UCSD Professor Prabhakar Bandaru and grad student Mark Hoefer found that defective carbon nanotubes actually store energy more effectively than their unflawed counterparts .
[ social_buttons ]
The effect , which was originally studied at UCSD by grad student Jeff Nichols , rests in the creation of just the right amount of defects – enough to create additional charge sites on the nanotube , but not enough to break down its electrical conductivity .
Though it ’s a long way from commercialization , the breakthrough brings us one step closer to the Holy Grail of the electric car , and to the entire battery operated sustainable infrastructure of the future : a genuine quick - charging , long lasting battery .
Building a Better Carbon Nanotube Battery
Carbon nanotubes are microscopic cylinders up to 100 nanometers in diameter .
Their perfect atomic structure endows them with superior chemical and electrical properties , but defects do occur .
The researchers first discovered that defective nanotubes used in electrodes stored a charge more effectively .
By exposing the nanotubes to argon or hydrogen , they found that they could control the defects and thereby raise or lower the associated charge .
Given the great strength and durability of carbon nanotubes , a nanotube - based electrode could resolve the cost , reliability , and underperformance issues of existing capacitators .
Other Carbon Nanotube Battery Developments
UCSD ’s research joins a flood of new developments in the field of carbon nanotube batteries , including the discovery of “ nanoflower ” configurations that improve storage capacity , and the use of carbon nanotube / metal oxide arrays that boost the efficiency of lithium - ion batteries .
As for cost , researchers at Rice University are cooking up a nanotube stew that could improve the prospects for a low cost , bulk manufacture of carbon nanotubes .

With the mood of reflection common to all year - ends magnified by this being the close of a decade , the list - loving world of film is awash with rundowns of the finest moments of not just 2009 but the entire noughties .
In this very spot , you 'll have already seen the Guardian 's crack team reveal the first 90 titles of their golden hundred , with the final 10 being unveiled over the days ahead .
But in the spirit of fair play , I thought it might also be worth drafting a top 10 of a slightly different nature – not the decade 's best per se , but it 's most underrated .
In short , what with this being the season of goodwill and so on , it might be apt to briefly pick out in the spotlight those films that did n't quite get their due when they were first released , whether from critics , audiences or award ceremony judges .
And more to the point , those that even now , amid the mass of praises being sung in the last days of the noughties , still are n't getting it .
Of course it's an inexact science – one person 's idea of overlooked is another 's deserved obscurity .
And that fuzzy process is made yet fuzzier by the way the net has become the primary forum for discussing movie culture this decade , meaning that even the most out - of - the - way nugget now has some kind of profile to anyone halfway interested .
At the same time , an ever - smaller number of titles make it into British cinemas , leaving a vast layer of films so underrated by the wider industry we never even get to see them .
But among my 10 most underrated , all bar one did spend at least a brief time in UK cinemas – the exception being Tekkonkinkreet , a deliriously tough and imaginative 2006 anime , a genre that 's offered up a number of marvels this decade while still often being patronised and ghettoised .
This is why , odd as it might appear , I also include Spirited Away here – for all the warm words it receives , it still feels regarded less as a true peer of Pixar than an arthouse curiosity , a situation unfair both on the film itself and the actual children who should be seeing it .
But for me many of the noughties ' most underrated came from directors who at other points could n't move for bouquets .
For instance , even as it became in many ways the decade of Michael Haneke , the one film of his that slipped off the radar is also the one with perhaps the most awful relevance to our future .
I speak of Time of the Wolf , a terrifyingly pristine vision of a darkened post - apocalypse that may not be quite as formally exquisite as Hidden or The White Ribbon , but was just as hard to shake from the bones .
Similarly , in the decade where of all unlikely events David Cronenberg went mainstream , his fine London - set portrait of delusion , Spider , rarely rates a mention now .
I have a feeling the more David Lynch 's Mulholland Drive is ( rightly ) ushered into the canon , the more Inland Empire will become an unwatched footnote ; and the garlands for There Will Be Blood should n't obscure Paul Thomas Anderson 's wonderfully sui generis Punch - Drunk Love .
But more unjustly overlooked than any of these , two other films top my list .
The first is the auto - biopic Tarnation – film - maker Jonathan Caouette 's breathtakingly raw account of his relationship with his troubled mother , stitched together on an iMac from home movies and answerphone message .
The second is Morvern Callar – Scottish director Lynne Ramsay 's dazzling adaptation of Alan Warner 's source novel , a movie whose lack of repute has mystified me ever since it was released back in 2002 .
While it may seem contrary to name as the most underrated films of the decade one that does feature on the main Guardian list , I could n't in all good faith put it anywhere else .
Here after all is a movie that , in its account of a small - town checkout girl reinventing herself in Spain with her dead boyfriend 's literary advance , created a mood as inscrutable and seductive as anything I saw this decade .
It conjured up an ambiguity that never once felt like a cop-out , and a whole series of delicately stunning set - pieces as the story segued from dank Oban to sun-bleached Andalucia .
As strange and finally unknowable as its heroine ( played by the note - perfect Samanatha Morton ) , it would n't be fair to paint Ramsay 's difficult second movie as completely neglected .
But the widespread befuddlement that met it before its director fell into an eight - years - and - counting absence from the screen means I can't think of another film more deserving of a belated hurrah .
And so my 10 most underrated films of the noughties are :
1. Morvern Callar ( Lynne Ramsay , UK , 2002 )
2. Tarnation ( Jonathan Caouette , US , 2003 )
3. Tekkonkinkreet ( Michael Arias , Japan , 2006 )
4. Spider ( David Cronenberg , Canada / UK , 2002 )
5. Inland Empire ( David Lynch , US , 2006 )
6. Time of The Wolf ( Michael Haneke , France / Germany , 2003 )
7. Spirited Away ( Hayao Miyazaki , Japan , 2001 )
8. Birth ( Jonathan Glazer , US , 2004 )
9 . Songs from the Second Floor ( Roy Andersson , Sweden , 2000 )
10 . Harry He 's Here To Help ( Dominik Moll , France , 2000 )

A teenage boy has been charged after he allegedly stabbed a man 14 times after robbing him of 20 cents .
Police say the 15 - year - old was one of two youths who approached the man as he was walking back to work from a laundromat in Footscray , in Melbourne 's west , at 2.15 pm ( AEDT ) on November 29 .
The 23 - year - old man from Bundoora told police the youths demanded money and one pulled out a knife .
He gave the 20 cents he had in his hand to the teen who then stabbed him 14 times with a knife to his upper body , arms , neck and face , inflicting serious injuries and leaving him in hospital until last Friday .
The 15 - year - old from St Albans has been remanded in custody to appear at a children 's court on January 5 .
He was also charged in relation to another armed robbery on November 5 .
Police are still looking for the second youth allegedly involved in the Footscray armed robbery .

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is taking a lot of heat over purported inaccuracies in her new book , Going Rogue .
Among the less - known is a claim Palin makes that Alaskans do n’t shoot wolves from helicopters , a fanciful image touted by liberals in the 2008 presidential campaign .
Referring to a prank call where she thought she was talking to French President Nicholas Sarkozy , Palin writes that the prankster “ suggested we get together and hunt from helicopters , which Alaska hunters do n’t do . ”

“ Then [ the fake ]
Sarkozy started talking about hunting and suggested we get together and hunt from helicopters , which Alaska hunters do n’t do ( despite circulated Photoshopped images of me drawing a bead on a wolf from the air ) . ”
But Media Matters for America has found that the aerial hunting program was n’t just something Alaska hunters do — its a program Palin herself endorsed .
“ In 2007 , Palin introduced a bill to ‘ simplify and clarify Alaska ’s intensive management law for big game and the state ’s ‘ same day airborne hunting ’ law , ’ which she stated would ‘ give the Board of Game and state wildlife managers the tools they need to actively manage important game herds and help thousands of Alaskan families put food on their tables , ' ” the group notes .
On Sunday , Palin attacked the Associated Press for questioning claims in her book .
Former Alaska Governor lashed out at the Associated Press Sunday for doing a fact - check on her memoir , “ Going Rogue . ”
“ Amazingly , but not surprisingly , the AP somehow nabbed a copy of the book before it was released , ” she wrote on her Facebook page .
“ They ’re now erroneously reporting on the book ’s contents and are repeating many of the same things they spewed during the campaign and afterwards .
We ’ve heard 11 writers are engaged in this opposition research , er , “ fact checking ” research ! ”
The AP reported that Palin ’s account often contradicted her record as well as current events .
Her depiction of the McCain campaign is also frequently at odds with internal campaign emails .

Alaska state wildlife officials do target wolves under a program aimed at protecting caribou and moose .
Reported the Anchorage Daily News in 2008 :
State wildlife officials believe they have saved more than 1,400 moose or nearly 3,000 caribou — or some combination thereof — with a winter program to kill wolves from aircraft , although the wolf kill remains far below what the state wanted .
Pilot - gunner teams have taken 124 wolves to date , according to Bruce Bartley , spokesman for the Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation .
The goal was 455 to 670 wolves .
Correction :
The original version of this story suggested that Palin had introduced legislation regarding wolf hunting .
The legislation did not in fact specifically refer to wolves .
Despite news reports that the security contractor formerly known as Blackwater has seen its contracts dry up and its influence wane , the company continues to do brisk business in Iraq and Afghanistan — and the Obama administration may be too afraid of the firm to do anything about it , says investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill .
“ You know who ’s guarding Hillary Clinton in Afghanistan right now ?
Blackwater , ” Scahill told MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow Tuesday night .
“ You know who guards members of Congress ?
Blackwater .
They have half a billion dollars in contracts in Afghanistan right now .
CIA , State Department , Defense Department .
Why is President Obama keeping these guys on the payroll ?
There has never been a company in recent history that made the case that corporations are corrupt , evil organizations [ better ] than Blackwater . ”

Scahill was on The Rachel Maddow Show discussing the New York Times ‘ revelation that senior Blackwater executives allegedly arranged for bribes of up to $ 1 million for Iraqi politicians in a bid to retain its contracts and silence criticism of the company in the wake of the Nissour Square massacre in 2007 , in which 17 Iraqi civilians died after Blackwater guards opened fire .
Though the Times report stated that it ’s unknown if the approved bribes ever reached their targets — Iraqi politicians —
Scahill drew a connection between the alleged bribes and the fact that , after the Nissour Sqaure massacre , the Iraqi government first decided to bar Blackwater from operating in the country , and then reversed its position .
“ You had the Iraqi government saying Blackwater was banned from that country , then suddenly doing an about face , and Blackwater remains in Iraq to this day , ” Scahill said .
That sentiment was echoed by Spencer Ackerman at the Washington Independent , who also suggested a link between the alleged bribes and Blackwater ’s continued presence in Iraq .
“ Now we have some inkling of why the Iraqis allowed the firm to stay , ” Ackerman blogged .
Scahill suggested that the security firm ’s deep and continued involvement in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars means the company could potentially embarrass any administration with the things it can reveal .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Another way of looking at this is Blackwater knows where a lot of bodies are buried , ” Scahill told Maddow .
“ These are guys who worked on the CIA assassination program , the drone bombing campaign , and regarding all of the senior officals , they know a heck of a lot about what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan , and those are not guys that you want on the other side of the fence if you ’re running Washington . ”
Scahill dismissed as “ nonsense ” the idea that Blackwater continues to have contracts because its services can’t be carried out by regular military forces .

So the Republicans are so scared of Obama 's electoral success that they would shut down the rule of government .
That is why not one Republican would vote for health care reform
That is why no Republican will vote for any of Obama 's proposals , no matter what the issue is : they want to win in 2012 .
The GOP is that scared of Obama and successful Democrats as candidates .
So health care ?
Job creation ?
Military or defense action ?
Foreign treaty ?
Tax policy ?
Emergency or disaster response ?
Nothing ?
The GOP will never vote with Obama on anything , no matter what it is , because they care that much about winning .
They have decided to put Party above People , every time .
Why are we fighting amongst ourselves , really ?
We argue about issues , policies , solutions .
Often , we argue about values .
But the Republicans never argue about values , because they all have only one : that is their Party defeating Obama .
It is the only way that they can win .
Their party 's victory over Obama is the one thing that unites all their political decisions , every time .
Not the American people or their problems and concerns .
That is what we have to argue home , on every issue :
You can count on them to always take the anti-Obama position .
GOP : Party Before People , Every time
The 21 ministers travelled by helicopter to close to Everest base camp
Nepalese ministers have held the world 's highest cabinet meeting on Mount Everest , to raise awareness of the effects of climate change .
The ministers signed a declaration on climate change during the meeting , which comes before the Copenhagen climate summit starts next week .
PM Madhav Kumar Nepal told the BBC the Himalayas were " a global treasure " that needed to be protected .
Studies show temperatures rising faster there than in the rest of South Asia .
The studies show the rise has led to a reduced snowfall over the mountains and has caused glaciers to melt .
For us , nature is God .
But we are not treating our God fairly and that is why we are facing problems
Nawang Tenge , monk
The entire cabinet of 21 ministers travelled in a fleet of helicopters to Kalipatar - a plateau at 5,200 m ( 17,000 ft ) next to Everest 's base camp .
Medical equipment , oxygen canisters , soldiers and journalists had already been ferried to the site .
During their half - hour meeting , the ministers - some wearing oxygen masks to help them breathe in the thin air - endorsed a resolution on climate change , which they called the Sagarmatha Declaration ( or Everest Declaration in Nepali ) .
" We wanted to stress one point : that the Himalayas are a global treasure , " Mr Nepal told the BBC .
AT THE SCENE Joanna Jolly , BBC News , Syangboche
The ministers sat outside at a specially provided table - complete with table cloth - with a view of Mount Everest behind them .
Some wore oxygen masks which had been provided as a precaution against altitude sickness .
There is growing concern in Nepal about rising temperatures in the Himalayan region that have led to decreased snow fall and glacier melt .
The prime minister said he hoped this cabinet meeting would help focus the world 's attention on climate change in the Himalayas ahead of the Copenhagen summit next week .
" They are the water towers of Asia , feeding its largest rivers and nourishing hundreds of millions of people downstream . "
Crowds of local people , many of them wearing traditional outfits , gathered at the village of Syangboche , from where the ministerial helicopters took off .
Nawang Tenge , a Buddhist monk waiting to greet the minsters on their return , said the meeting gave him hope for the development of the region .
" For us , nature is God .
But we are not treating our God fairly and that is why we are facing problems , " he told the AFP news agency .
" Last year , there was no rain or snow here and the temperatures go up with every passing year . "
Mingma , a 47 - year - old inn keeper , said he was glad the government was " taking initiatives before it is too late " .
" Usually authorities tend to act only after accidents .
We are now hopeful that something might be done , " he told the AP news agency .
' Critical ' Mr Nepal said the mountain range played " an important role in global atmospheric circulation and a centre for unique biodiversity " .
" The lofty peaks and mighty rivers have inspired civilisations and supported a mosaic of cultural diversity and because of that we need to preserve Mount Everest , the mountains and all those places downstream , " he said .
The trip was funded by a group of Nepalese private organisations , many of them from the tourist sector .
Environment Minister Thakur Prasad Sharma shrugged off criticism that the meeting was just a costly publicity stunt .
" The fact is that the glaciers are melting due to global warming .
That has become a critical issue and we want to draw global attention to it , " Mr Sharma told AFP .
Mount Everest is the highest point on earth , with a summit 29,035 ft ( 8,850 m ) above sea level .
The cabinet meeting comes after the government of the Maldives - the world 's lowest - lying country - held an underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight the threat to their territory from rising sea levels .

WANTED : A health insurance plan that seems to be government - run but is not actually government - run .
Must make voters feel like they are getting the same V.I.P. treatment as United States senators and representatives ( who by law are actually not supposed to get any real V.I.P. treatment ) .
Must give beneficiaries a menu of choices while establishing strict standards for the benefits provided and maintaining premium costs within fairly tight limits .
That seems to be what a pivotal group of Senate Democrats are trying to find , as they seek a compromise on the divisive issue of a proposed government - run health insurance plan , or public option .
So far , lawmakers have found that there is very little room for negotiating between the two sides in the debate .
Many senators are either for a government - run plan or against it .
And insurance is either public , like Medicare and Medicaid ; or private , like the employer - sponsored plans offered by major corporations and administered by companies like Blue Cross , Aetna , Wellpoint or UnitedHealthcare .
Or maybe not .
After all , some hybrids already exist .
There are privately - administered Medicare Advantage plans , for instance .
And many states have contracted with private insurers to help run their Medicaid programs .
But neither of these hybrids are generally well - regarded .
Medicare Advantage costs the government more than traditional Medicare .
And so - called Medicaid managed care programs have an uneven record , with some getting high marks and others being sharply criticized .
One quasi - hybrid insurance plan , however , has long tantalized policy makers as a potential model for expanding insurance coverage , and in recent days Democratic negotiators have returned to it as perhaps the last best hope of a deal : the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , which provides insurance coverage to more than eight million federal workers , including members of Congress and their dependents .
A team of 10 senators , tapped by the majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , to fashion a last - ditch deal on the public option , is now focusing on the federal employees ’ plan as a blueprint for a solution .
The goal would be to provide a menu of private , nationwide insurance plans , and for the Office of Personnel Management to oversee them , conducting the same type of negotiation over benefits and premium prices that it does for federal workers .
The federal employees health plan offers federal workers an array of different private insurance plans , including fee - for - service plans , with preferred provider networks and lower cost HMOs .
Several of the plans are national in scope – the most popular is a national Blue Cross plan – and benefits are portable , from state to state , and usually can be carried into retirement .
An easy - to - use Web site serves as a portal for federal employees looking to compare the plans available to them .
Although the plans are all private , the fact that the program is regulated by legislation , overseen by a federal agency , the Office of Personnel Management , and serves federal workers gives it the aura of public insurance even though it is not public insurance .
And giving many Americans the same coverage as members of Congress is a politically potent – and appealing – concept for both lawmakers and the people they serve .
( The Team of 10 Democrats at work on this issue includes five liberals : Charles E. Schumer of New York ; Tom Harkin of Iowa ; John D. Rockefeller of West Virginia ; Sherrod Brown of Ohio , and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin .
There are also five centrists : Ben Nelson of Nebraska ; Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas ; Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana ; Mark Pryor of Arkansas , and Thomas R. Carper of Delaware .
An 11th , Joseph I. Lieberman , Independent of Connecticut , was invited to take part but has not attended the meetings . )
Many Suggestions
Many readers of the Prescriptions blog have posted comments suggesting that members of Congress give up their health benefits until all of their constituents have insurance , or be forced to go on the public plan if one is created .
( For years , some lawmakers , like Senator Sherrod Brown , Democrat of Ohio , and Representative Steve Kagen , Democrat of Wisconsin , using the same reasoning , have actually refused their federal coverage . )
“ How did we as a country , ever allow these clowns in office to have their own health care coverage ? ? ” a reader from South Carolina wrote in a recent e-mail .
“ They should have no more or less than what I have .
PERIOD !
They can always say that they did n’t vote for their own pay raises because it happens automatically .
How long do they get to keep getting paid a salary along with benefits after leaving office ????
We now have a political elite , whose ‘ perks ’ must cause old - time commissars in Russia to turn over in their graves with envy . ”
In an August 2009 report , the Urban Institute , a nonpartisan policy research group highlighted the potential appeal of using the federal employees health plan — or the F.E.H.B.P. — as a model for a broader overhaul of the nation ’s health insurance system .
“ Politically , the program as a model for reform has appeal across the spectrum , ” the report said in its introduction .
“ Conservatives like the program ’s reliance on private health plans and market competition .
Liberals like the prospect of expanding to everyone the F.E.H.B.P.’s large - employer - style benefits , community rating , and close oversight of insurer pricing . ”
The report also contains some warnings about trying to expand the federal employees ’ plan to the general public .
“ It does not seem to be wise simply to open the existing F.E.H.B.P. to non-federal enrollment nor feasible to precisely replicate the F.E.H.B.P. . and its national approach outside the context of federal employment , ” the report said .
Political Risks
There would seem to be political dangers as well .
The federal plans , on average , cover about 87 percent of the health costs of beneficiaries — a figure known as actuarial value , which represents how much of total health costs the plan is expected to pay across a standard population .
That ’s substantially better than the 70 percent actuarial value of the so - called “ low - cost silver plans ” proposed in the health care legislation that are expected to be the standard coverage for most people .
Moreover , the federal government , as an employer , typically pays 70 to 75 percent of premium costs with employees picking up the balance .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , new federal subsidies to help moderate - income Americans buy insurance will cover 35 percent to 96 percent of premiums costs for families , depending on income level , and 13 percent to 94 percent of premium costs for individuals .
So , according to the budget office , a family of four , earning between 350 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level ( about $ 90,100 in 2016 , when the legislation is fully in effect ) would pay about 65 percent , or nearly $ 9,200 , of a total annual premium of about $ 14,100 .
In other words , the legislation as currently written would require people at that income level to pay a higher percentage of premium costs , for less coverage than a government worker covered by the federal employees ’ plan .
One feature that sets federal plan apart from many other employer - sponsored plans is that it requires plans to retain a percentage of premiums in a reserve fund to cushion against potential underestimating by actuaries of the plan ’s expenses .
The reserve funds have helped to soften the impact of premium increases .
Still , premiums for the federal health plan have risen substantially in recent years , in line with other private plans .
For 2010 , the average annual premium will rise 8.8 percent .
For the most popular national plan in the federal program , premiums will rise 12.4 percent for family coverage and 15.1 percent for individual coverage .
A 2002 report by the Government Accountability Office describes how the Office of Personnel Management negotiates benefits and premium prices without setting limits on the plan profits or specifically mandating the exact package of benefits in a given plan .
General Tso ’s Impasse
The Team of 10 worked into Sunday evening over dinner of Chinese takeout , but called it quits before 8 p.m. without reaching an agreement .
They are scheduled to meet again at 3 p.m. on Monday .
Some officials briefed on the discussions said that the proposal would likely include a fallback provision that would allow the Office of Personnel Management to create a government - run health plan if private insurers choose not to participate in the new program , a seemingly unlikely prospect .
The liberal senators who are the strongest supporters of a public plan were also said to be seeking additional tightening of regulations for the insurance industry as one condition of agreeing to any deal .
Some officials said that components of the proposed deal were modeled on other provisions in the legislation aimed at assisting small businesses in providing insurance to their employees .
Senator Olympia J. Snowe , Republican of Maine , and Senator Blanche Lincoln , Democrat of Arkansas , were two of the foremost champions of those provisions on the Senate Finance Committee – and they are two senators who are being courted by the White House and the Democratic leadership .
Open Questions
Lots of questions remain about exactly what the proposal would look like and how it would differ , if at all , from the original core concept of the health care legislation , which is to create government - regulated insurance exchanges , or marketplaces , at the national or state level through which people can buy insurance .
The federal employees plan ’s portal , like the Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector , has always been viewed as a model for what the new insurance exchange would look like .
The public option , if created , was expected to be one insurance plan on a wider menu of mostly private plans .
Whether the Office of Personnel Management will do anything different from what the federal or state governments would have had to do anyway under the law is unclear .
And there is still a gaping divide between supporters and opponents of the public plan .
Senator Brown , of Ohio , who is participating in the negotiations , has said he has little interest in making further concessions on the public plan after moving from a public plan that would pay Medicare rates to a plan that would pay 5 percent to 10 percent above Medicare rates , to a public plan that would negotiate rates with health care providers and that states could opt out of by passing a law .
“ We have compromised four times on the public option , ” he said .
“ Many people wanted to do Medicare for all , but that was never in the cards here .
Rockefeller and I wrote the original public option , where we had Medicare rates and Medicare network and then it was Medicare plus five .
Then it was Medicare plus 10 .
Then it was no Medicare at all .
Then it was the state opt - out .
We have moved three or four or five times on this and those days are over . ”
Mr. Brown added : “ Why should four people decide that they do n’t like the public option the way it is , when 50 plus of us like the public option the way it is ? ”
One of those four people , Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , has called the public plan “ an unnatural and dangerous appendage to health care reform . ”
After a meeting on Sunday between Senate Democrats and President Obama , Mr. Lieberman said he was thrilled that Mr. Obama did not once mention the public option and he said he was prepared to vote against the bill if the public plan was included .
Although Mr. Lieberman has chosen not to participate in the Team of 10 negotiations , to wrap up the debate Democrats will need the unanimous support of all 60 members of their caucus — including Mr. Lieberman — unless they are able to win over Republicans to make up for any Democratic defections .
The centrist Republicans from Maine , Ms. Snowe and Susan Collins , are being courted by the White House but so far are not supporting the bill .
But if the goal is a health insurance plan that seems to be government - run but is not exactly government - run , a new program based on federal employees ’ plan may be the elusive deal that lets Democrats move forward with their bill .
Israel has admitted that forensic pathologists harvested organs from dead Palestinians and others without permission of their families .
The issue emerged with publication of an interview with the then - head of Israel 's Abu Kabir forensic institute , Dr. Jehuda Hiss .
The interview was conducted in 2000 by an American academic , who released it because of a huge controversy last summer over an allegation by a Swedish newspaper that Israel was killing Palestinians in order to harvest their organs .
Israel denied the charge .
Parts of the interview were broadcast on Israel 's Channel 2 TV over the weekend .
In it , Hiss said , " We started to harvest corneas ...
Whatever was done was highly informal .
No permission was asked from the family . "
The Channel 2 report said that in the 1990s , forensic specialists at Abu Kabir harvested skin , corneas , heart valves and bones from the bodies of Israeli soldiers , Israeli citizens , Palestinians and foreign workers , often without permission from relatives .
In a response to the TV report , the Israeli military confirmed that the practice took place .
" This activity ended a decade ago and does not happen any longer , " the military said in a statement quoted by Channel 2 .
In the interview , Hiss described how his doctors would mask the removal of corneas from bodies .
" We 'd glue the eyelid shut , " he said .
" We would n't take corneas from families we knew would open the eyelids . "
Many of the details in the interview first came to light in 2004 , when Hiss was dismissed as head of the forensic institute because of irregularities over use of organs there .
Israel 's attorney general dropped criminal charges against him , and Hiss still works as chief pathologist at the institute .
He had no comment on the TV report .
Complaints against the institute , where autopsies of dead bodies are performed , at the time of Hiss ' dismissal came from relatives of Israeli soldiers and civilians as well as Palestinians .
The bodies belonged to people who died from various causes , including diseases , accidents and Israeli - Palestinian violence , but there has been no evidence to back up the claim in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that Israeli soldiers killed Palestinians for their organs .
Angry Israeli officials called the report " anti-Semitic . "
The academic , Nancy Sheppard - Hughes , a professor of anthropology at the University of California - Berkeley , said she decided to make the interview public in the wake of the Aftonbladet controversy , which raised diplomatic tensions between Israel and Sweden and prompted Sweden 's foreign minister to call off a visit to the Jewish state .
Sheppard - Hughes said that while Palestinians were " by a long shot " not the only ones affected by the practice in the 1990s , she felt the interview must be made public now because " the symbolism , you know , of taking skin of the population considered to be the enemy , ( is ) something , just in terms of its symbolic weight , that has to be reconsidered . "
While insisting that all organ harvesting was done with permission , Israel 's Health Ministry told Channel 2 , " The guidelines at that time were not clear . "
It added , " For the last 10 years , Abu Kabir has been working according to ethics and Jewish law . "

Here is a puzzle known as the Covent Garden Problem , which appeared in London half a century ago , accompanied by the somewhat surprising assertion that it had mystified the best mathematicians of England : Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Jones had equal number of apples but Mrs. Jones had larger fruits and was selling hers at the rate of two for a penny , while Mrs. Smith sold three of hers for a penny .
Mrs. Smith was for some reason called away and asked Mrs. Jones to dispose of her stock .
Upon accepting the responsibility of disposing her friend 's stock , Mrs. Jones mixed them together and sold them of at the rate of five apples for two pence .
When Mrs. Smith returned the next day the apples had all been disposed of , but when they came to divide the proceeds they found that they were just seven pence short , and it is this shortage in the apple or financial market which has disturbed the mathematical equilibrium for such a long period .
Supposing that they divided the money equally , each taking one - half , the problem is to tell just how much money Mrs. Jones lost by the unfortunate partnership ?

WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano's initial assessment of the Christmas Day airliner attack -- that " the system worked " -- does n't quite match the absurdity of " Brownie , you 're doing a heck of a job . "
But only because she quickly took it back .
A system that allows a man identified to U.S. officials as a potential threat -- by his own concerned father -- to board a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit with powerful explosives sewn into his underwear ?
That lets this man detonate his bomb as the plane prepares to land , igniting a potentially catastrophic fire ?
That depends on a young , athletic passenger to be seated nearby ?
That counts on this accidental hero to react quickly enough to thwart the terrorist 's plans ?
If that 's how the system works , we need a new system .
Do n't misunderstand .
I 'm not blaming the Obama administration for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's alleged terrorist attack , and it would be reprehensible for anyone to try to use the incident to score political points .
The White House is guilty only of defensiveness in not immediately recognizing the obvious :
We have a problem .
Actually , we have two problems .
The first is that the Abdulmutallab incident reveals serious deficiencies in the " system " that Napolitano and others were so quick to defend .
At this point , no one can doubt that civilian aviation remains a major target of al - Qaeda , affiliated groups and wannabe imitators .
Most of us are under the impression that removing our shoes at the airport and limiting ourselves to those tiny , trial - size containers of toothpaste , shaving cream and lotion are enough to ensure a safe flight .
For passengers on Northwest Flight 253 , this was not the case .
One solution -- expensive and intrusive , but effective -- would be to make use of new airport screening technology mandatory .
Either a " whole - body imaging " scanner , which gives a much more detailed picture than a regular metal detector , or a " sniffer " machine , which analyzes trace chemicals , would have been likely to detect the explosives that Abdulmutallab allegedly was carrying .
In this instance , however , the system seems to have malfunctioned well before Abdulmutallab reached Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport .
Abdulmutallab's father , wealthy Nigerian banker Alhaji Umaru Mutallab , had warned U.S. and Nigerian authorities about his son's increasing radicalization -- information that led U.S. officials to put Abdulmutallab's name on a watch list , along with more than 500,000 other names , but not to revoke his multiple - entry visa or keep him off a Detroit - bound jetliner .
It is an ordeal for anyone from the developing world to obtain a visa to enter the United States .
We already turn away multitudes .
It will be no small task , but the system needs to be re-engineered to let the right people in and keep the dangerous people out .
When Abdulmutallab allegedly set his lap on fire , there were no air marshals on board to handle the situation .
I realize it is not possible to provide an armed federal escort for every single flight .
But whatever algorithm officials use to determine which flights get marshals evidently needs improvement .
The second problem we face is much bigger , and there is no real solution in sight .
According to reports of Abdulmutallab's statements to authorities after his arrest , he claims to have gotten the bomb -- and instruction on how and when to use it -- from al - Qaeda operatives in Yemen .
As noted previously in this space , and illustrated by a sobering report Monday in The Washington Post , Yemen features prominently in al - Qaeda 's expansion plans .
Abdulmutallab's story suggests that an infrastructure for indoctrination , training and bomb - making is already in place , and that this ambitious young branch of al - Qaeda is confident enough in its abilities to launch an attack on what the George W. Bush administration infelicitously called the " homeland . "
Our enemy apparently sees its future in places such as Yemen -- or perhaps Somalia , a failed state for almost two decades , where militant fundamentalist Islam is on the march .
The enemy 's leadership is believed to be ensconced in remote areas of Pakistan , beyond the government 's reach .
Yet the United States will soon have about 100,000 troops chasing shadows in Afghanistan , where al - Qaeda 's presence is now minimal .
I understand and appreciate the fear that if the Taliban were to take power again , it could invite al - Qaeda back into Afghanistan to set up shop .
But I can't escape the uneasy feeling that we 're fighting , and escalating , the last war -- while the enemy fights the next one .
From the NAR : Pending Home Sales on a Record Roll
The Pending Home Sales Index , a forward - looking indicator based on contracts signed in July , increased 3.2 percent to 97.6 from a reading of 94.6 in June , and is 12.0 percent higher than July 2008 when it was 87.1 .
The index is at the highest level since June 2007 when it was 100.7 .
...
NAR estimates that about 1.8 to 2.0 million first - time buyers will take advantage of the $ 8,000 tax credit this year , with approximately 350,000 additional sales that would not have taken place without the credit .
emphasis added
The increase in pending sales has been mostly from lower priced homes with demand from first time home buyers ( taking advantage of the tax credit ) and investors .
And look at the cost of the tax credit !
If NAR is close to being correct , 2 million buyers will claim the tax credt - times $ 8,000 - is $ 16 billion .
But this only resulted in " approximately 350,000 additional sales " .
So this tax credit cost taxpayers about $ 45,000 per each additional home sold .
Not very effective ... especially considering most of these are lower priced homes .
Buried in the California Controller 's November analysis is a guest article : Overview of the Commercial Property and Capital Markets with Implications for the State of California by Dr. Randall Zisler . ( ht picosec )
Here are some excerpts :
Whereas excessive and imprudent leverage fed the bubble , deleveraging not only popped the bubble , but , in the process , destroyed record amounts of equity and debt .
Most deals financed with high leverage from 2005 to the present are under water .
The equity is gone and the debt , if it trades at all , trades at a deep discount to face value .
Most leveraged equity invested in real estate has evaporated since property prices , if marked to market , have fallen 30 % to 50 % .

The chart [ right ] shows overall U.S. property total returns , quarterly ( at annual rates ) and lagging four quarters .
This appraisal - based , lagging index shows sharp negative returns exceeding the deterioration of the RTC ( Resolution Trust Corp . )
period of the early 1990s .
( See Chart 1 . )
Second quarter 2009 returns indicate the possibility that total returns , while still negative , may have hit a point of inflection .
We expect that property values in many sectors , especially office , retail , and industrial , will likely deteriorate further in 2010 with improvement beginning sometime in 2011 .

A crisis of unprecedented proportions is approaching .
Of the $ 3 trillion of outstanding mortgage debt , $ 1.4 trillion is scheduled to mature in four years .
We estimate another $ 500 billion to $ 750 billion of unscheduled maturities ( i.e. , defaults ) .
Unfortunately , traditional lenders of consequence are practically out of the market and massive amounts of maturing debt will not easily find refinancing .
Marking - to - market outstanding debt will render many banks , especially regional and community banks , insolvent , especially as much of the debt is likely worth about 50 % of par , or less .
The inability of many banks and other capital sources to lend not just to real estate firms but to other businesses in the State as well presents a real challenge to the private sector and state and local governments .
I am concerned about the potential impact of CRE on the broader economy ... there could be an impact resulting from small banks ' impaired ability to support the small business sector — a sector I expect will be critically important to job creation .
...
Many small businesses rely on these smaller banks for credit .
Small banks account for almost half of all small business loans ( loans under $ 1 million ) .
Moreover , small firms ' reliance on banks with heavy CRE exposure is substantial .
Banks with the highest CRE exposure ( CRE loan books that are more than three times their tier 1 capital ) account for almost 40 percent of all small business loans .
The author points out that many local and regional banks will fail because of CRE loans .
FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair said today : " We do obviously have a lot more banks that will close this year and next , " Bair said , adding the failures " will peak next year and then subside .
" These bad loans are also limiting lending to small businesses .
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart made the same argument this morning :
IN 2007 young pizza shop employee Brian Sommer must have thought he had it made .
The computer whiz had stumbled across a system which could cheat ATMs out of thousands of dollars .
After perfecting his system he targeted an ATM at a Bundaberg service station , taking $ 21,120 , and then drove down the road an hour and found a friendly machine in Hervey Bay which handed over $ 7500 to him .
Unfortunately he soon found out that when something sounds too good to be true it usually is .
The problem with his scam was that he needed to use real people 's credit cards to access the ATMs and so he used his own , his mother 's , his girlfriend 's and those of two of his friends .
His great scheme finally concluded yesterday when he fronted the Bundaberg District Court .
Prosecutor Sarah Klemm told the court Sommer had found information on the internet and in an ATM manual that allowed him to change the machines ' settings so he could make huge withdrawals of cash .
“ He had passwords that enabled him to access the hard drives of the machines , ” Ms Klemm said .
“ He used the machine , accessed the hard drive and changed the settings . ”
Sommer was charged on August 24 , 2007 , with one count of computer hacking to gain benefits to the value of $ 5000 or more and two attempted computer hacking offences .
Ms Klemm argued for a two - year prison term for Sommer .
“ This is a much more prolonged period of offending , ” she said .
“ It perhaps started off as curiosity but went from there . ”
But defence counsel Peter Zufic said his client had a cheque ready to pay back the money he had stolen .
Mr Zufic also said a conviction should not be recorded because Sommer had applied to the Australian Defence Force to become an avionics technician
“ He has excellent prospects of rehabilitation , he 's otherwise of good character ... and he has not re-offended at all in the intervening period , ” he said .
Judge Anthony Rafter said he took into account the defendant 's age , character references and his academic record when he sentenced the defendant .
“ It is also to your credit that you are able to make instant compensation , ” he said .
Sommer was sentenced to two years ' probation , 100 hours ' community service and was ordered to pay back $ 23,160 .
A conviction was not recorded .
It seems the John Birch Society was n't too happy about Rachel Maddow 's December 18th show and some of the things she said about them promoting conspiracy theories .
Sadly for the John Birch Society as Rachel notes , there is a public record that contradicts their complaints .
I agree with her on their sponsorship of CPAC this year .
Given the direction the Republican Party is headed , it just looks like a natural fit .
One last note on the potential future of the Repulican Party and its ties to the John Birch Society and Sarah Palin .
Does anyone besides myself think that this picture might have led to why Palin had so much trouble telling Katie Couric what she read and that McCain 's handlers might have told her not to bring up the John Birch Society , and her brain fried when trying to think of anything else when answering ?
That 's just my own personal theory of why she vapor locked and could n't give her an answer and that may very well be wrong , but I 'd love to know if anyone else was thinking the same thing when they watched her .
Transcript via Lexis Nexis .
Unfortunately , there is a record here .
There`s an actual record of what the John Birch Society said it was doing at that time and why , quote , " The communists had used the racial question as grist for their mills for 30 years , and ground out nothing but amazing disappointments for themselves .
Not until the Supreme Court decision of May 17th , 1954 -- Brown v. Board -- did they even begin to make any head way in their nefarious aims .
And that defiant reversal simply by judicial decree of our long - established law is quite justly known as the Earl Warren decision . "
You know , if I were in the John Birch Society today , I would want people to think that , you know , I hadn`t wanted to impeach a Supreme Court justice because of Brown v. Board of Education .
I wouldn`t want anybody to think that .
I understand .
Now , the John Birch Society came after us for that last week , saying that we totally got it wrong .
For example , they`re claiming now that their campaign to impeach Earl Warren was not for his role in ending discrimination against African - Americans in the South .
They said that it had nothing at all to do with that .
It had nothing to do with the Supreme Court`s decision to desegregate schools .
The John Birch Society was , in fact , so opposed to civil rights that they responded to the Supreme Court`s Brown v. Board of Education decision to desegregate schools with billboards calling for the impeachment of the Supreme Court`s chief justice .
The John Birch Society also contended that fluoride being added to drinking water was a communist mind control plot and they contended that the secret conspiracy to destroy America encompassing everything from that darn fluoride to the League of Women Voters and the Civil Rights Act .
That communist conspiracy that they wanted to rout and their fevered imaginings included President Dwight Eisenhower .
According to the John Birch Society at that time , Ike was , quote , " a dedicated conscious agent of the communist conspiracy . "
We talked about that article and about the John Birch Society itself on this show last week , when it was announced that the John Birch Society would be a co-sponsor of this year of CPAC , the big influential Conservative Political Action Conference which takes place every spring .
Inspirational to some , sure -- but not to the John Birch Society , who had posted an article about the new Matt Damon movie on their Web site , which declares that , quote , " Mandela is nothing more than a communist terrorist thug . "
MADDOW : So , it`s almost Christmas .
And this year , there are a lots of movies battling for the " I want to sit in the dark and not talk to my family anymore " box office bounty that Christmas tends to bring .
There`s the new Sherlock Holmes movie .
Romantic comedy with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin ; " Avatar " ; the long - awaited " Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel . "
But wait , there`s more .
Quote ,
" The fact that Warren could remain on the Supreme Court after such arrogant disregard of the Constitution , of the principles of English - American law , and of his own oath of office , as were shown in the school segregation cases , was decidedly reassuring to the liberal establishment , it encouraged communists and their dupes and sympathizers . "
The John Birch Society , co-sponsor of this year`s CPAC wanted to impeach Earl Warren for desegregating schools .
It`s in the record -- even if they don`t want it to be .
And while we`re on the subject of the co-sponsor of this year`s CPAC and race , how about this ad placed by the John Birch Society in the August 29th , 1960 edition of " The Birmingham News " ?
It `s titled , " What`s Wrong With Civil Rights ? "
It says , quote , " The average American Negro`s security of person and assurance of honorable treatment by his fellow citizens in all of the utilitarian relationships of living have been exactly on par on par with those of his white neighbors . "
So , what is all the complaining about ?
The complaining or the civil rights movement , as we`ve come to know it , according to the John Birch Society was actually a secret communist plot to create , and I quote , " a Negro Soviet Republic in the United States . "
The exact boundaries of which were undetermined but which would definitely include cities like Richmond , Virginia , and New Orleans and Memphis .
You got that in civil rights secret plot to establish a Negro Soviet Republic , so says the cosponsor of this year`s CPAC conference .
Another issue the nice people at the John Birch Society say that we got wrong on this show was their position on the fluoridation of drinking water .
In their online retort to our segment from last week , the John Birch Society said it never labeled fluoridation of water as a communist mind control plot , because that sounds crazy , right ?
They wrote that actually , the John Birch Society opposed water fluoridation because it represented , quote , " a precedent for the socialized medicine Maddow supports . "
I know they would love that to be true .
But , well , here`s a page from the March 1960 John Birch Society bulletin .
You`ll see that there is a section here at the bottom of the page -- do we have here ?
Yes .
A section at the bottom of page 13 titled , " How to Defeat Fluoridation in Your City . "
After advising the reader to paper his or her city council school board PTA and church community with anti-fluoridation pamphlets , the John Birch Society warns , quote , " If you live in a large enough city , or if the communists have been able to beguile a sufficiently large enough , powerful enough , and determined enough clique into supporting fluoridation , the above formula , alone , may not stop them . "
John Birch Society , you may wish that you hadn`t said that fluoridation was a secret communist plot -- but you did in writing , and we have a library card .
I do have to say though that the most amusing complaints / clarification against us by the John Birch Society was this .
They wrote , quote , " The John Birch Society ways always cautious in accusing people of being part of a conspiracy . "
All right , gather around here for a second .
I know we`re on the eve of a holiday and everything , and I just want to read to you for a sec from the minutes of the first meeting of the John Birch Society National Council on January 9th , 1960 .
We got this document , thanks to a freelance researcher named Ernie Lazar .
He`s used FOIA request to the FBI and original John Birch Society records to put together a pretty amazing archive of the group`s history .
So , this is John Birch Society founder Robert Welch .
" Today , gentlemen , I can assure you without the slightest doubt in my own mind that the take - over at the top is , for all practical purposes , virtually complete .
Whether you like it or not , and whether you believe it or not , our federal government is already literally in the hands of the communists .
Our Congress now contains a number of men who are certainly actual communists , and plenty more who are sympathetic to communist purposes for either ideological or opportunistic reasons . "
He then lists a number of contemporaneous members of Congress at that time , including John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey .
And he says they`re definitely commies or at least commie symphs .
And then there`s this , quote , " Our Supreme Court is so visibly pro- communist that no argument is even needed .
Our State Department is loaded with communists from top to bottom , to the extent that our roll call of ambassadors almost sounds like a list somebody has put together to start a communist front .
It is estimated , from many reliable sources , than from 70 percent to 90 percent of the responsible personnel in the Department of Health , Education and Welfare are -- guessed it -- communists .
Our Central Intelligence Agency under Allen Dulles is nothing more nor less than an agency to promote communism throughout the word .
Almost all of the other departments are loaded with communists and communist sympathizers .
And this generalization most specifically does include our whole Defense Department . "
But , remember , the John Birch Society has always been very cautious about accusing any one of being part of a conspiracy .
You know , except for that one time when they accused everybody of being part of a giant conspiracy .
Listen , the John Birch Society denying it ever made those accusations is almost as ridiculous as believing that had been taken over by communists in the first place .
So , CPAC and modern conservative movement choosing to align itself with these guys , letting these guys cosponsor a mainstream conservative event like the Conservative Political Action Conference in February -- I mean , that`s just -- it`s , well , wait .
On the one hand , given what the John Birch Society was and is , it is kind of hysterical that CPAC has chosen to align itself with them .
On the other hand , given the state of the conservative movement today , maybe this is a natural coming together .
Certainly a lot of people calling other people commies now .
Listen , if I were the John Birch Society , I wouldn`t want people to know these things about my record , either .
But your record is your record , and when confirmed speakers at next year`s CPAC like Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney get up to speak at that event , they will be speaking at an event cosponsored by the John Birch Society .
And maybe then it will be worth asking if they also think that the civil rights movement was a secret plot to turn , say , Arkansas into a Negro Soviet Republic .
Lying outstretched on a rocky outcrop , with wet heather soaking my trousers , my elbows and knees in mud , adrenalin is coursing through my veins .
I 'm oblivious to the cold and discomfort , suffering from " buck fever " – the nervous excitement felt by a novice hunter at his first sight of game .
For below me , perhaps 140 metres away , is a red deer stag .
And the majestic animal , complete with nine - point antlers , is at the centre of my rifle 's telescopic sights .
" Up just a touch , aye , that 's it .
He 's a fine beast , just wait for him to turn broadside , " Ally McNaughton , the Ardeonaig hotel 's head deer stalker , whispers in my ear .
Then , after what seems like an age , the stag gently turns .
This is it .
I 'm a city boy through and through , but I feel no hesitation , no compunction .
I take a deep breath , bring the barrel of my rifle level with the stag 's central mass , pause for the briefest of moments , then squeeze the trigger .

A deafening crack echoes across the glen as the gun jerks back into my shoulder , and I hear the unmistakable thud of metal smashing into flesh .
The beast rears up , staggers , then subsides .
My ears still ringing from the report of the rifle , I turn to Ally grinning , knowing I 've done something truly special , and that shrink - wrapped supermarket meat will never taste the same again .
" Well done , " he says , shaking my hand .
" Good shot . "
Still buzzing with excitement I look down the scope again .
To my consternation the stag is still clinging on to life .
" He 's a big old stag , and he 'll just take a few minutes to bleed out , " Ally says , trying to reassure me .
My heart racing , I slide down the incline , rushing to reach the stag before Ally .
Approaching the dying animal it strikes me : until now the most interaction I 'd had with a deer was swerving to avoid an errant muntjac on a country road .
But when the moment came , I had n't hesitated .
I 'd shot him down without demur and now he was " bleeding out " in front of me .
Standing alone over the stag he looks serene enough , but I 'm suddenly unsure of myself .
Ally arrives and interrupts my thoughts : " He 's unconscious now , most likely not feeling too much pain , " he says looking down at the now motionless beast .
" How do you feel ? "
Venison may be steadily increasing in popularity , despite the recession , but the actual killing remains controversial .
In January , when Prince William 's girlfriend Kate Middleton admitted she was looking forward to bagging her first set of antlers , the League Against Cruel Sports described deer stalking as " a barbaric and unacceptable pastime " .
But deer populations are increasing in numbers and geographical range across Britain , and supporters of stalking and several wildlife bodies insist deer have to be culled .
In 2004 the Deer Initiative , a partnership of groups who want to keep a healthy deer population , estimated there were 1.5 million deer in Britain , but Peter Watson , spokesman for the group , admits that number " could be nearer to two million now " , making deer more abundant and widespread now than at any time since the Norman conquest 1,000 years ago .
Around 350,000 deer are culled annually ( the vast majority of which end up in the pot ) , but there are fewer than 1,000 stalkers , and few deer are culled outside of the season ( which varies according to the six deer species , but can be said to run from July or August to October ) .
" We need to be shooting 25 per cent of the population to keep it in check , but even shooting 350,000 we are still behind the curve – they are breeding faster than we can cull them , " says Watson .
" Everything is in their favour .
The warmer weather – especially the winters – and year - round crops are ideal for them and , without natural predators such as wolves , they flourish and can do terrible damage to forests and farmland . "
My stalk had begun earlier that day when Ally collected me from my lodge at the Ardeonaig Hotel on the shores of Loch Tay in Perthshire , where an outing on the nearby Ardtalnaig estate costs £ 150 per day , or £ 375 if you successfully shoot a deer .
After a shooting test to make sure I 'll be safe on the hill and able to hit a deer we head off into the 8,000 - acre estate , first in Ally 's Land Rover , then in an Argo – an eight - wheel off - road amphibious vehicle which has replaced the pony among Scottish stalkers .
Ardtalnaig is split into three glens and Ally , a third - generation stalker , decked out in tweed with a Mannlicher hunting rifle and leather telescope case slung over his shoulder , soon spots deer on the heights of one .
We set off on foot , staying downwind and out of sight , to make our approach over the last three or four miles .
As we tramp along I manage to snatch fragments of whispered conversation with Ally .
" What sort of reaction do you get from someone like me on their first kill , " I ask .
" What do you mean someone like you ? " he replies .
" Well , someone from the city who 's never killed before , " I reply between pants .
" We get all sorts of people up here now , " he says .
" So you never can tell exactly how someone will react , but I did have a chap cry on me once . "
With this weighing on my mind , I remind myself why I 'm here – to shoot my supper .
Unlike food critic A A Gill , who recently upset animal welfare activists by shooting an " entirely inedible " baboon during an African safari , because he " wanted to get a sense of what it might be like to kill someone " , there is a purpose to my stalk – to provide meat for the Ardeonaig hotel kitchen .
We press on , Ally moving like a sure - footed mountain goat , trying hard not to spook any sheep or dislodge any scree , both of which would quickly alert the nearby deer to our presence .
The final approach involves a tiring and damp crawl .
Finally , after almost five hours ,
Ally thinks we are near enough to set up the rifle , and I take my shot .
My stag is around nine years old , and , according to Ally , weighs around 90kg .
The bullet enters behind the heart and lungs , slipping between two ribs to smash into the beast 's liver at over 900 metres per second .
Drawing a small but sharp blade ,
Ally skilfully cuts the beast 's throat , before moving down its body to gralloch it – removing its stomach and intestine in an unavoidably bloody procedure .
His hands covered in congealed blood , he turns to me and shakes my hand before rubbing my face with the warn , sticky liquid .
I 've been " blooded " , a traditional rite of passage for a hunter 's first kill .
I 'm shattered but elated , even proud of what I 've achieved .
Though , as Ally loads the beast onto the Argo , I can't help but feel disconcerted by the brutality of what has just happened .
I feel no guilt or remorse for what I 've done – it seems as natural to me as instinct itself , but nonetheless I feel a sadness .
When I mention my feeling to Ally he seems to understand my mixed emotions – he felt them with his first kill .
The next day , in the far more clinical environment of the Ardeonaig hotel 's kitchen , Gottgens , originally from South Africa , prepares a venison loin for me .
The plan had been to eat the liver of the beast I 'd felled the day before , but my marksmanship put paid to that .
Instead , Gottgens produces a dish from an animal Ally had shot several days before ( here 's one I made earlier ... ) , served with a simple but delicious jus from the bones , a little garlic and olive oil .
Gottgens is evangelical about venison , a meat which is very low in fat , but he treats it in an unorthodox manner compared to some other chefs : " I do n't believe in hanging for days on end , as I want the meant to taste as it was supposed to taste .
Ageing is effectively rotting .
" You have to have respect for the produce , both as Ally does on the hill and here in the kitchen – so that means no wastage and serving it fresh .
It was once a living thing and all of Ally 's skill has been require to bring it to the table , so we have a real impetus to honour it in the kitchen and on the plate , " he adds .
The meat is delicious and fresh , nothing like the venison I 've tasted before .
And , as I think back to the day before and the stags roaring and rutting for dominance , it all makes perfect sense .
Their deep , primeval roars , a lust - crazed claim to sovereignty over my stag 's now leaderless herd , are part of the same natural order as man hunting beast .
Many will disagree , but for me , in the wilds of Perthshire , shooting my supper seems as natural as popping down the local supermarket .
Cooking with venison : A chef 's tips
Keep it very simple .
Venison should be eaten as nature intended , in its prime condition .
The less you do to the meat the better .
The animal already has flavour , so all you need to do is add salt and pepper when frying or searing .
What the animal has eaten in the wild gives it its flavour .
If you do want to try a sauce , use blueberries ( a berry common in the Scottish Highlands ) .
That 's what they eat on the hill on our estate so we often marry the two back together in the kitchen .
If you can't trace where an ingredient or meat cut comes from , do n't buy it .

A Sacramento County trucker , who spent his murder trial cracking jokes and proudly admitting that he had killed his sister and her husband in their El Cerrito home , celebrated his birthday Tuesday by being sentenced to die by lethal injection .
Edward Wycoff had asked to be sentenced Tuesday , his 41st birthday .
" Welcome to my birthday party !
Is everyone having fun ?
Is everyone having a good time ? " he bellowed in a Martinez courtroom filled with friends and relatives of the slain victims and many jurors from the trial .
Wycoff , clutching a Monopoly " Get out of jail free " card , did n't get what he told the court he really wanted : his release from custody so he could go back to hauling commercial explosives , " running people off the road and blowing things up . "
Instead , Judge John Kennedy of Contra Costa County Superior Court formally sentenced him to die for murdering his sister , Julie Wycoff Rogers , 47 , and her husband , Paul Rogers , 48 , after he broke into their hillside home on Rifle Range Road early Jan. 31 , 2006 .
Wycoff , a Citrus Heights resident who acted as his own attorney in the trial , said he had killed the couple because he thought they were too liberal , were raising their children wrong and because they had n't invited him over for Christmas .
Kennedy said it was clear that Wycoff had committed " wanton murder " in reaction to " petty slights , perceived transgressions and imagined insults . "
The judge rejected Wycoff 's automatic appeal for the punishment to be reduced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Jurors deliberated just 70 minutes before returning their verdict last month in the penalty phase of the trial .
The same jury had taken only 45 minutes to convict Wycoff of two counts of first - degree murder with special circumstances for using a knife and a wheelbarrow handle to kill the couple , who left behind three children .
Eric Rogers , 21 , the couple 's eldest son , had told jurors his uncle 's life should be spared .
He later said his parents had opposed capital punishment .
Rogers said in a courtroom statement Tuesday that Wycoff is " completely childish and sick and immature .
I think it 's very clear he struggles with a mental illness .
" For us to kill a crazy person would be wrong , " Rogers said .
" I would hate to see that done in my parents ' name . "
The Missing Element
Every day , U.S. doctors perform more than 50,000 state - of - the - art procedures using a radioactive isotope called technetium - 99 .
Injecting technetium into a patient allows doctors to monitor the blood supply to the heart , look at cardiac function in chemotherapy patients , see whether certain cancers have spread to a patient ’s bones , or monitor a tumor during breast cancer surgery .
Most patients take for granted their ability to undergo these procedures .
But they might be surprised to learn that nuclear medicine in the United States is dependent on one 52 - year - old , leak - prone nuclear reactor that is currently offline , should have been shut down for safety reasons a decade ago , and moreover , undermines international nuclear nonproliferation goals .
How did we get into this predicament ?
In short : Blame Canada .
The National Research Universal ( NRU ) reactor in Chalk River , Ontario , supplies about one - third of the world ’s supply and about half of the U.S. supply of the molybdenum isotope that decays to form technetium .
The reactor , built in 1957 , is operated by the government - owned company Atomic Energy of Canada Limited .
The reactor was first shut down for safety only a year after it opened , when a nuclear fuel rod caught fire , and it has suffered sporadic accidents and outages ever since .
In 2007 , after the reactor was shut down for a safety upgrade , the Canadian government , due to fears of an isotope shortage , ordered it open again over the objections of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission .
Canada ’s Natural Resources Ministry , which oversees the nuclear power industry , never intended for the NRU reactor to still be operating .
Construction of two new reactors , known as MAPLE 1 and 2 , began in 1996 after it became clear the NRU reactor was nearing the end of its useful life .
The MAPLES were supposed to have become operational in 2000 , but after numerous construction delays and unresolved safety issues and hundreds of millions of dollars spent , they were finally scuttled by Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s government in 2006 .
So the NRU reactor was left to sputter on alone , without backup .
This May , the inevitable happened : A leak of radioactive water was detected at the facility , and it was again shut down .
The government ’s handling of the isotope debacle has been a front - page political story in Canada , particularly after Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt was caught on tape describing it as a " sexy " issue that she wanted to resolve to further her political career .
Raitt later issued a tearful public apology to cancer patients .
Because disruptions to medical care have been minor in the United States so far , the issue has n’t garnered much attention below the border .
But that could change in March .
Since the NRU reactor went down , a Dutch reactor in Petten has been picking up the technetium slack , along with smaller reactors in Belgium , France , and South Africa .
But starting in late March , Petten , itself a 48 - year - old dinosaur plagued by technical glitches , will be off - line for scheduled maintenance .
The Canadian Natural Resources Ministry expects the NRU reactor " will return to service in the first quarter of 2010 , " according to spokesperson Micheline Joanisse .
But that date has already been pushed back several times .
And even if the reactor does go back online in 2010 , it ’s unclear how much longer it can stay operational .
The University of Texas at Austin ’s Alan Kuperman , a former senior policy analyst for the Nuclear Control Institute , notes the fragility of the situation .
" Even if the Canadian reactor comes back online , we ’re only going to be one blip from a major supply crisis , " he says .
This would be a serious blow to hospitals and cancer patients in the United States and abroad .
" If the Canadian reactor is n’t up and running , we ’re going to really be struggling come April , " says Robert Atcher , director of the National Isotope Data Center and former president of the Society of Nuclear Medicine , who thinks that current technetium supplies are enough for only about two - thirds of global demand .
Depending on how long the United States goes without a reliable supply of technetium , the effect could be anything from a minor irritation to a major catastrophe .
In Canadian hospitals , which were almost entirely dependent on domestic technetium supplies and are already feeling the pinch , some nuclear - medicine practitioners report canceling the majority of their diagnostics , and tests for heart damage and the spread of cancers have been delayed for weeks , with untold financial and health costs .
Giuseppe Esposito , director of nuclear medicine at Georgetown University Hospital , says that his department has n’t felt the effects of the shortage yet , but that a more permanent disruption would make many of his regular procedures impossible to carry out .
" For lung and bone imaging , there really are no substitutes [ to technetium ] , " he says .
You might think that , given the relatively small number of suppliers , the United States , which accounts for about 50 percent of global demand for technetium , would have wanted to develop its own supply .
And indeed , there were plans to build a reactor for medical use in New Mexico in the mid-1990s .
But the project was abandoned after Canadian authorities made what Atcher describes as a " compelling case " that the ill - fated MAPLE facility would meet international demand .
Joanisse denies that the Canadian government misrepresented the state ’s production capabilities to its customers .
" All along , our message to the international community has been simple , " she said via e-mail .
" We rely on ageing reactors and a fragile supply chain .
There is a collective responsibility to bring forward additional sources of supply and to manage available supplies responsibly , particularly in periods of shortage . "
But given the costs of building a nuclear reactor , governments , including the U.S. government , were all too happy to let Canada shoulder the burden .
" No one wants to spend the money and political capital to build a new reactor these days , " says Edwin Lyman , senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists ’ global security program .
" Everyone put their eggs in the Canadian basket . "
Faced with the possibility of a technetium shortage within coming years or even months , the U.S. government is finally taking action .
A bill passed in the House of Representatives and under consideration in the Senate would allocate $ 163 million to investigate new methods for producing medical isotopes .
Although this money probably is n’t enough to build even a single reactor , it ’s the first step the United States has taken in years to developing isotope independence .
A research reactor in Missouri is also being converted to produce isotopes , though Lyman notes that even under the best conditions , " there wo n’t be a stable substitute … for at least three years . "
Most importantly , the proposed legislation would also specify how medical isotopes are made .
Both the Canadian and Dutch reactors produce technetium from bomb - grade highly enriched uranium , a situation that keeps nonproliferation experts up at night .
" The Canadian government always gets up and says , ‘ We ’re a leader on nonproliferation , ’ " U.T. Austin ’s Kuperman says .
" But they ’re also the country in the world using the largest amount of bomb - grade uranium for civilian purposes .
You ca n’t have it both ways . "
Under the proposed legislation , all suppliers to the U.S. market would be required to use safer , though slightly more expensive , low - enriched uranium .
An expert panel convened by Canada ’s Natural Resource Ministry recommended last week that the country switch entirely to low - enriched uranium , though in the short term highly - enriched will continue to be used at the NRU reactor .
In any event , Canada ’s days as a leader in medical isotopes seem to be over .
The Natural Resource Ministry ’s panel recommended the construction of a brand - new multipurpose research reactor , though given the emergency measures that other countries are taking — the Netherlands and Australia are also looking to boost their production capacity — it ’s not clear that there will still be a market by the time it is completed .
In June , Harper said , " Eventually , we anticipate Canada will be out of the business " of producing medical isotopes — a realization that patients around the world might have wished for a decade ago .
Eight people were shot and four others injured by flying debris Sunday night when someone opened fire during a fight outside a concert in San Francisco , police said Monday .
All the victims suffered non-life - threatening injuries , police said .
The incident happened outside the Regency Ballroom at 1290 Sutter St. shortly before 10:15 p.m. Sunday .
An argument between two men escalated into a fight among four men , police said .
Another man walked up to the crowd , pulled out a gun and began shooting .
Eight people were struck by gunfire , and four others were wounded by shrapnel or broken glass , authorities said .
They were treated at San Francisco General Hospital and Kaiser hospitals in Vallejo and Oakland .
The gunman fled on foot .
He was described as black , in his 30s , wearing an unbuttoned white shirt with pinstripes , white T - shirt , blue jeans and a baseball cap .
Police did not report any problems inside the sold - out concert , KMEL House of Soul .
The program director for KMEL , Stacy Cunningham , did not return a call seeking comment .
Police detained one man after the shooting , but witnesses said he was not the gunman .
He is being held on other weapons allegations .
" This was at the end of an event , and several people were around at the time and witnessed what happened , " said Sgt. Wilfred Williams , a Police Department spokesman .
" We are encouraging those people to come forward and help us identify the shooter . "
A spokesman for the Regency Ballroom , Michael Roth , emphasized that the shooting happened in the middle of a street and that it is not known whether it was tied to the event .
Roth said the gunman " was not in the show , because he was observed outside the theater several times in the evening by our security . "

For the past 10 months , the SEIU has fought to hold on to 150,000 members in its Union of Healthcare Workers affiliate , or UHW .
The challenge comes from a group of former UHW leaders and Stern confidantes .
Pushed out by Mr. Stern after a prolonged power struggle , they started a rival outfit , the National Union of Healthcare Workers , or NUHW , in January and immediately moved to build it up by wooing away members from the SEIU 's local , UHW .
Now these upstarts charge that the UHW threatened workers with deportation and tampered with secret ballots to narrowly win a pivotal election last summer in Fresno , Calif .
The NUHW allegations , contained in a complaint filed last Friday and previously not made public , take the battle to a new level .
Australian journalist Nigel Brennan says he was chained up and pistol - whipped during a 15 - month hostage ordeal in lawless Somalia .
Mr Brennan and his companion , Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout , were captured by militants in Somalia in August last year .
They were released and handed over to Somali officials yesterday and they are now in a hotel in the capital Mogadishu .
A kidnapper claims a ransom of around $ 1 million was paid , although it is unclear who may have put up the money .
" I 'm just happy that I 'm alive , " said Mr Brennan , who revealed he had been pistol - whipped and locked in chains for the past 10 months after a failed escape attempt .
" Tonight we were ripped out of our rooms , stripped of everything , told to put on new clothes and then thrown in a car and then driven - we had no idea what was going on , " Brennan told Reuters by phone from a hotel in Mogadishu .
" We were always kept by the same people .
That was especially one of my concerns towards the end .
They were talking about selling us to another group , " he said .
" We 've been through a pretty rough time , both of us .
It 's just to be free is amazing , " the AFP news agency reported Mr Brennan as saying .
" It has n't been the most pleasant experience of my life , but I 'm just happy that I 'm alive .
I 'm alive and looking forward to seeing my family and trying to pick up the threads of my life . "
The pair are now trying to leave Somalia within the next 24 hours .
Mr Brennan 's sister - in - law Kellie Brennan released a statement saying she had confirmed the release on behalf of the Brennan family .
Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the Government was working to get official confirmation of the pair 's release .
The Australian and Canadian governments had both been working to secure the release of the pair .
Tortured
Ms Lindhout told Canadian TV that she was beaten and tortured during her captivity .
" It was an extremely , extremely difficult situation , " she told CTV .
She said the kidnapping was criminal rather than political and that the ransom money paid by their families was going to be used by her captors to escape from Somalia .
" It was extremely oppressive , I was kept by myself at all times , " she said .
" I had no - one to speak to , I was usually chucked in a room with a light and a window , I had nothing to write on , or with .
" There was very little food .
Basically my day was sitting in a corner on the floor of the room , 24 hours a day for 15 months . "
She says she was abused , probably to help motivate her family to get the ransom .
" There was times that I was beaten , that I was tortured , extremely , extremely difficult situations , " she said .
" The money was n't coming quickly enough for these men and they seemed to think that if they beat me enough then when I was able to speak to my mother - they would put me on the line with her every couple of months - I would be able to say the right thing to convince her to pay the ransom for me , which was $ 1 million .
" My family did n't have $ 1 million and it did n't matter what I said to them but they did n't really understand that , they thought ' she 's Canadian , everyone in Canada is rich , she must have $ 1 million ' .
So they would beat me to try to prompt me to say these magic words that the money would produce itself .
But of course it never did . "
Ms Lindhout estimates they were taken to 11 different hiding places around Somalia but that most of their time was in the capital .
She says throughout her ordeal she focused on the possibility of reuniting with her family .
" There were some pretty dark moments ... but I think human beings have an enormous capacity to adjust to trying circumstances and it was the idea of coming home , of a reunion with my family that kept me going , " she said .
" In that darkness I would just try to escape in my mind to a sunny place , usually Vancouver , in my mind .
I 'd imagine running around ... and things like that .
And that kept me going .
She says the phone calls to your mother were also helpful .
" It was always great to hear my mother 's voice , " she said .
" The conversations were very short and they were usually scripted on my part .
My mother was n't allowed to ask any questions and I also was n't allowed to say what I wanted to say .
They would come to me beforehand with a pen and paper and sort of guide me and tell me what I needed to say to her .
" It was always wonderful to hear mother 's voice , that , the circumstances that we are talking were not very happy . "
Seized leaving Mogadishu
Mr Brennan , whose family comes from Bundaberg in Queensland , and Ms Lindhout were kidnapped on August 23 , 2008 as they were leaving Mogadishu .
They were en route to a refugee camp in a town just outside the capital where they planned to cover a story on internally displaced people in Somalia .
A Somali journalist , Abdifatah Mohammed Elmi , who was working as their interpreter , was also kidnapped .
He was released in January .
A hotel employee told AFP that the two journalists were " very tired " following the end of their ordeal , one of the longest - running of many kidnappings in the lawless country .
In September 2008 , a local tribal chief participated in negotiations to try to free the pair and said the kidnappers wanted $ US2.5 million in ransom .
In January , he said the demand had been reduced to $ US100,000 .
According to Somali media , the two Westerners had escaped in February and found refuge at a mosque before being recaptured .
In May , the pair provided proof that they were still alive by calling media outlets .
" I have been sick for months , " Ms Lindhout said at the time .
" Unless my government , the people of Canada , all my family and friends can get $ 1 million , I will die here .
That is certain . "
" The situation here is very dire and very serious .
I 've been a hostage for nine months , the conditions are very bad , I do n't drink clean water , I am fed at most once a day , " she said .
" I 'm being kept ... in a dark windowless room , completely alone . "
Somalian MP
Ahmed Diiriye said Mr Brennan and Ms Lindhout were brought on Wednesday from southern Mogadishu by militiamen and were handed over to the people who had negotiated the release .

People often ask , what is the most beautiful spider in the world ?
You are lucky because I know the answer – it ’s the Jumping Spider ! ( a.k.a Salticidae )
I have to admit , I ’m being a bit subjective here , because there have n’t been to any spider beauty contests yet .
This little hairy spider disprove the stereotype about spiders being ugly and scary ( anyone with arachnophobia here ? ) .
Jumpers ’ beauty secret is their eight big spider eyes , and besides looking very cute , these little creatures are also very curious ones .
I ’m giving lots of bamboo leaves for macro photographers – without them , we could n’t see these incredibly cool photos , and now let ’s jump to the good stuff .
( Bamboo leaf for teejaybee via : boredpanda.com )
I ’m sure you would love some spider facts accompanying these interesting photos , so here are some of them .
Jumper can jump 20 to 60 or even 75 to 80 times the length of its body .

Jumping spiders are known for their curiosity .
If approached by a human hand , instead of scuttling away to safety as most spiders do , the jumping spider will usually leap and turn to face the hand .
Further approach may result in the spider jumping backwards while still eyeing the hand .
The tiny creature will even raise its forelimbs and hold its ground .
It might even jump on the hand .

Varlamov out with a groin muscle strain
Let 's start with the big news of the day : Semyon Varlamov , as I 'm sure you 've heard by now , is hurt .
The team has officially listed the rookie as day to day with a lower - body injury .
But I 'm told that he suffered a groin muscle strain on the last shot of the game in Tampa on Monday night .
Coach Bruce Boudreau said he hopes Varlamov will be able to practice Friday and play Saturday in Toronto .
While that 's a best - case scenario , I can tell you this :
There 's no worse injury for a goalie than a groin strain -- especially for a goalie with a history of them -- and sometimes these types of injuries take weeks to heal .
But there are some encouraging signs .
Varlamov did not appear to be favoring either leg and was able to walk without even a hint of a limp this morning .
With Varlamov out , Jose Theodore is expected to get the start tonight against Ryan Miller and the Sabres .
Miller , an early MVP candidate who has played all but three games for the Sabres , leads the league in goals against average ( .935 ) and save percentage ( 1.90 ) .
Without him , there 's no way the Sabres are challenging Boston for first place in the Northeast Division .
Theodore will be backed up by Michal Neuvirth , who has been recalled from Hershey and joined the team in Buffalo .
Theodore took a puck to the collarbone from defenseman Milan Jurcina ( who has the hardest shot on the team ) in the morning skate , but other than some minor swelling and a welt , he says he 's good to go .
The same , however , cannot be said for Mathieu Perreault , who said he 's not feeling well and thinks he has food poisoning .
The rookie center is questionable for tonight .
Some other notes from HSBC Arena :
* Matt Bradley , who returned home for the birth of his son , has not rejoined the team .
So he 's out tonight .
* Alex Ovechkin on the suspension : " Ca n't do nothing about it .
I 'm not crying . "
* Ovechkin on whether his reputation took a hit because of the suspension : " I do n't care about reputation .
I 'm a hockey player .
Sometimes you get in some bad situations .
I do n't want to hurt nobody . "
* Ovechkin on whether he was bothered by the media criticism of his style of play : " No , not really .
I just try to do n't think about it .
But I can't [ ignore ] it because of you guys [ reporters ] ask all time ... same questions .
I just try to concentrate on my game and not some suspensions . "
* Ovechkin on getting booed in visiting arenas : " Fans love me ... and I love them .
Some fans like my style of game , some fans no .
Everybody have a different mind and everybody can think whatever they want .
It does n't matter what happen , whether they boo me or not , I still love them because they are fans who come to watch hockey game and they support their team and not us . "
* Bruce Boudreau on being asked the same questions about Ovechkin in every city : " I love talking about Alex because a ) there 's so much to talk about and b ) he 's so good and deserves it .
But sometimes you would like [ reporters ] to talk about other people because the other guys are good as well . "
* Boudreau on whether anything Ovechkin does still surprises him : " Oh yeah , he does that once a game .
In Tampa , he comes over [ the blue line ] , you could see it from our bench , Semin giving him the pass .
As soon as it hit his stick , it was in the net .
There was no chance a goalie could save it .
We could hear it , the stick hitting the ice and the puck with such force .
I turned to Dean Evason and said , ' No wonder he breaks so many sticks . ' "
* John Erskine stayed on the ice for some extra work with Mike Knuble ( broken finger ) and Neuvirth .
That could mean Erskine is the odd man out
* Although Michael Nylander has cleared waivers once , he was placed on waivers again today .
That has to happen every 30 days -- just in case he accepts a deal that would send him to Russia on loan .
There is , however , no indication that something is cooking .
I 'll check in later with a lineup .
The last time Iowa atheists put up bus ads , they were quickly taken down ( and then later put back up ) , a bus driver refused to do her job because an atheist ad was on her bus , and the governor complained .
All that because of this * horribly * offensive banner :
So what are the Iowa Atheists & Freethinkers doing now ?
Well , with the publicity they got last time , they ’re obligated to do a repeat performance !
This time , they ’re using the following ad :
Why this wording ?
[ Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers spokesperson Lily ] Kryuchkov says : “ Simply because it ’s kind of a difficult time for non-believers , because everybody around you is going to church , there ’s always religious charities , there ’s religious songs and stuff like that , and people feel really alone and kind of left out .
And so we just wanted to speak to them and say ‘ hey we know that you are a good person too ’ , basically . ” … …
Kryuchkov says the group is not out to shut down religious groups .
Kryuchkov says that has never been their intent and they are “ not at war with anybody . ”
She says they ’re just speaking to the people that are like them and share their views and are open to dialogue with people who do n’t share their views and we can all co-exist …

A company called Stryker Biotech was in court last week defending a bone - growth product it sold for years , despite reports that it would " drift " in the body , causing bones to grow in random locations .

To boost sales of a product called OP - 1 Implant with a bone - setting filler called Calstrux .
The mixture was not approved by the FDA , and in fact OP - 1 was only supposed to be used on a rare bone disease , not on people who simply needed to have their bones knit together fast .
Surgeons were urged by Stryker to shape the OP - 1 / Calstrux paste into a " tootsie roll " or " vienna sausage " shape and implant it .
Unfortunately , the substance often broke down and drifted through patients ' bodies .
Bids of sprouting bone that looked like " oatmeal " or " white sesame seeds " would appear far from the site of injury where the substance had been implanted .
According to NPR :
When those wayward bits bit landed in places they should n't have , bone sprouted and , in some patients , had to be surgically removed .
According to the papers , then - president of the company , Mark Philip , touted the combination at sales meetings as " perfect " even while knowing it was n't FDA approved and that the company was receiving complaints about nasty side effects .
The indictment say the president and sales team continued to promote the illegal mixture for two more years , until Feb. 2008 , without informing surgeons of the side effects to keep sales rolling .

Robert Center was speeding down Broadway , his head down over the handlebars , his body curved for minimum wind resistance .
His eyes may have strayed from the path in front of him to the road beneath him — for a second , maybe longer — when suddenly and without warning , he slammed headlong into a coal cart and was killed .
His death , in the spring of 1895 , sparked a debate about the behavior of cyclists in traffic .
Some blamed Mr. Center for riding too fast , and others , including bike advocates like I. B. Potter , the local head of the League of American Wheelmen , accusing the larger , horse - drawn vehicles of dangerous behavior themselves .
It was the height of a great bicycle boom in America .
A century before City Room and its Spokes feature , The New York Times followed the debate over “ scorchers ” like Mr. Center and other local urban cycling news in a regular column known as Gossip of the Cyclers .
Part racing results , part travel guide , part club bulletin , part tip sheet for local cycling - related politics , Gossip of the Cyclers was a one - stop shop for city riders to bone up on all the news related to “ the wheel , ” as bikes were commonly known .
From 1894 to 1899 , it tracked the growing popularity of cycling in its nascent years , offering a revealing — and often amusing — window into the days when riding on two wheels was as high tech as writing code .
“ It was the P.C. of back then , ” said Carl Burgwardt , owner and curator of the Pedaling History Bicycle Museum in Buffalo .
“ That was the topic of the day .
The bicycle was the hot thing . ”
Some ideas about riding were tested in the column , such as the notion that one would develop “ bicycle face ” from riding : “ the strained , half - despairing look which has come to be regarded as a characteristic of wheelmen . ”
Other columns voiced similarly specious health concerns , with particular emphasis on the danger to the lungs posed by arching one ’s body for speed , a position the column once called “ the monkey hump . ”
Needless to say , the unnamed Times cycling reporter did not look kindly on drop handlebars , or velocity of any sort .
Such coverage was not limited to The Times , said David V. Herlihy , author of “ Bicycle : The History . ”
Practically every daily newspaper had a column .
The boom , which began with the introduction of the pneumatic tire in Ireland in 1889 and peaked around 1896 , reached across the city ’s social classes .
Despite the hefty price tag for a new bike , around $ 100 at a time when many only took home that much in a month , a market for used bikes developed as cycling grew more widespread .
“ It was fairly democratic ” in the way it drew people from disparate social classes together , Mr. Herlihy said .
“ People called it the fraternity of the wheel . ”
“ The magnitude of cycling as a pastime is hard to grasp in these end - of - the - century days , when one is told that ‘ everyone ’ is now a wheelman , ” Gossip of the Cyclers reported two weeks before Mr. Center ’s accident .
Indeed , as cycling became middle class , The Times took a decidedly middle - of - the - road editorial stance , supporting such things as the free passage of cyclists over the Brooklyn Bridge ( there had been a toll ) while advocating tougher punishment for “ scorchers , ” whose behavior elicited vehement denunciations — in the days before blog comments — in letters to the editor .
“ Have pedestrians any rights in crossing the streets that bicyclists should respect ? ” asked one angry reader in 1895 .
( The more things change … )
As is the case today , many of New York ’s riders cruised on bikes with no brakes , though this was more from technological limitation than choice .
“ They were essentially fixed - gear bikes , ” Mr. Herlihy said .
Whether brakes should be added even became a source of debate .
“ The bicyclist brake question seems to have stirred up a great amount of controversy , ” the Times column reported in February 1896 .
( By the end of the year , the column writer noticed that people were coming around to the idea . )
Gossip of the Cyclers was part of a constellation of similar tip sheets for other pursuits .
There was Gossip of Horsemen , and a column known as Among the Oarsmen , a rowing feature , and an an earlier , related cycling feature called Among the Wheelmen .
Inevitably , the paper began tracking the Gossip of the Automobilists .
Though Gossip of the Cyclers ended at the turn of the century , interest in riding certainly did not .
Within a few years , velodrome bike racing would explode in New York .
“ The boom was more than a fad , ” Mr. Herlihy said .
“ Of course there was a fad element , when high society started riding around on bikes .
But people really did see this as a vehicle to the future . ”
Or , as it was expressed in Gossip of the Cyclers in July 1896 :
“ So many changes have come with the bicycle , and will ensue with the motor carriage , that they are beyond the possibility of prediction and imagination .
The revolution is coming , and the sooner the better . ”

Nearly every year the goat is razed , sometimes within hours of being built A giant straw goat - the traditional Scandinavian yuletide symbol - erected each Christmas in a Swedish town has been burned to the ground yet again .
The 13 - metre ( 43 - ft ) high billy goat has been torched 24 times since it was first erected in Gavle in 1966 .
The goat was set alight in the early hours of Wednesday morning in the city north of Stockholm .
City spokeswoman Anna Ostman said the incident , which is being treated as serious vandalism , was " sad " .
" We had really hoped that he would survive Christmas and New Year 's , " she said .
Blogging goat
As well as being burnt , the goat has over the years faced other acts of vandalism including being run over by a car , having its legs removed and being smashed .
BILLY GOAT'S ROUGH TREATMENT 1966 :
The first goat is burned down - beginning the tradition 1970 :
It is set on fire six hours after being erected 1971 : Schoolchildren build a miniature ; it is smashed to pieces 1976 : A car crashes into the goat 1979 : Goat is burned down before it is finished 1987 : Goat is treated with fire - proofing , but is still burned down 2001 : Tourist from Cleveland , Ohio is jailed for burning goat 2005 : Two men dressed as Santa and Gingerbread Man torch goat After some experimentation , city officials decided not to spray the straw - covered wooden structure with fire - proofing chemicals as this discoloured the straw , making it " look like a brown terrier instead of a yellow straw goat " Ms Ostman said .
The city 's website offers a bilingual blog and Twitter feed , as well as webcams to allow fans to follow the beleaguered goat 's fate .
In one of its last entries , the goat writes : " Terrible night !
Slept so well under my beautiful snow blanket , when it suddenly became awfully hot .
It was fire !!!
At 0300 someone managed to set me on fire and destroy the amazing Christmas spirit in Gavle . "
Just 10 of Gavle 's goats , built in the town 's central square , have survived beyond Christmas since 1966 .
Most have been burned , sometimes within hours of being erected in the first week of December .
The culprits are seldom caught .
However , a 51 - year - old American tourist spent 18 days in jail after being convicted of setting it alight in December 2001 .

" It does n't really feel like a sequel , " Ubisoft 's Charles Randall told me as I sat down to play Assassin 's Creed 2 for the first time at a recent press event in Toronto .
" It feels like a whole new game . "
And that should be welcome news .
Because while it was n't a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination , the first Assassin 's Creed certainly had its problems .
At times it felt like the game 's ambitions were far greater than what the developers were actually able to create , leaving gamers with an ambitious but somewhat disappointing experience .
And that 's something Ubisoft has worked very hard to fix in the sequel .
During the half - hour or so I spent with the game , the major difference I saw was that of polish .
The action flowed smoothly and organically , and bugs — which often seemed abundant in the first game — were almost nowhere to be seen .
The large , open world you 're given to explore also felt much more real thanks to small details , like the ability to throw money to beggars , causing a crowd to form , with greedy hands clamoring for cash .
You 'll also see nonplayable characters interacting with one another for the first time .
When a thief attempted to steal my money and failed , I naturally set off after him in order to exact some revenge .
But I was n't the only one , as a guard was also chasing the thief .
It seems that the AI is smarter this time around .
No longer can you simply dive into a bale of hay to hide from pursuing guards .
They will now search areas more thoroughly , and might even give those hay bales a poke to get you out of your hiding place .
It 's details like this that makes the 15th century Italy depicted in the game feel truly alive .
The reason for this , Randall explained , has to do with the amount of time the team actually had to make the game .
On the first Assassin 's Creed , the developers at Ubisoft Montreal spent a year creating the new engine , leaving them with just one year to develop the entire game .
And for an experience as massive as AC , that 's not a lot of time .
This time around , the team had a full two years of development time , allowing them to add a number of new features while polishing other aspects of the game .
And it certainly shows .
Though I was n't able to play the more guided experience that most players will enjoy — instead I was simply thrust into the game 's world , able to mess around as I pleased — there was plenty to experience .
The mini-map in the lower right corner of the screen was littered with things to do : from optional assassinations to actual story missions to simply running around the city finding hidden loot or interacting with the crowd .
The side missions I played were of the usual " go here , kill him " variety .
For example , one mission involved climbing up to a fairly tall tower — in an area where the rooftops are plentiful with guards with bows — and taking out a madman who had taken up residence there , spouting religious nonsense .
There are also new , hidden areas called " Assassin 's Tombs , " which feel as if they were ripped straight out of the Prince of Persia : Sands of Time trilogy .
When you enter into one of these segments , the camera pans around , giving you the lay of the land and allowing you to devise a strategy from getting from where you are to where you 're supposed to be .
Though optional , these areas can be quite challenging ; Randall explained they can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour to complete .
The entire game , I was told , can take anywhere from 13 - 40 hours to complete , indicating that there will be a wealth of optional content for those who choose to explore it .
As for the gameplay itself , that too feels like a refinement on the original .
The combat is more nuanced , with a heavy emphasis on timing and one - shot kills , while the free - running and climbing feels slightly less automatic , requiring a little more skill and determination to reach out - of - the - way areas .
Of course , I was only able to experience a very small slice of AC2 , so it 's hard to judge , given the sheer size of the game .
Randall told me early on in the demo that it would be impossible to show even a fraction of what the game had to offer in such a short time .
" So what 's new ? " I asked him .
" Everything , " he answered , with a smile .
We 'll be able to see just how new Assassin 's Creed 2 feels very soon , as the game will be coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on November 17 .
The PC version , meanwhile , will be available in early 2010 .

The Oracle Audio File
I have n't watched CBS ' " 60 Minutes " in years .
But it was one of those stories that stops you in your tracks : Medicare fraud is " a $ 60 billion crime . "
Medicare is the $ 456 billion government health insurance program serving 46 million elderly Americans .
Its credibility as a government - run program is at the heart of the health - care reform debate .
If Medicare is n't doing the job , the government certainly can't .
Except that the fraud claim is not true .
" 60 Minutes " ' amateurish journalism would n't get past your average small - town copy editor 's fact - checking .
The first thing I did after watching the show was get in a big funk : Maybe conservatives are right .
Government can't run anything .
And this is " 60 Minutes , " not some tabloid sap like " Dateline . "
The second thing I did was apply the first lesson of the trade : verify the facts .
It did n't take long for the story to unravel .
There are no facts .
" 60 Minutes " does n't know how much Medicare fraud there is .
You do n't know .
I do n't know .
The federal government does n't know .
Nobody knows , because Medicare fraud as a whole is n't tracked .
That 's why " 60 Minutes " correspondent Steve Kroft said fraud is " estimated now to total about $ 60 billion a year . "
Estimated .
Fine .
By whom ?
You 'd think Ed Murrow 's ghost at the Columbia Broadcasting System might still compel his descendants to attribute colossal estimates to a reliable source .
Not this time .
I called " 60 Minutes . "
I asked to speak to one of the two producers of the segment .
I was patched through to a spokesman instead , who said the $ 60 billion figure came from Kirk Ogrosky , a Justice Department prosecutor in charge of Medicare fraud .
But it did n't .
Nowhere in the " 60 Minutes " broadcast or its written report does Ogrosky mention the figure .
Nor is the figure attributed to him or Attorney General Eric Holder , who makes a cameo on the show .
The spokesman 's best explanation : Ogrosky was cited in the piece , " 60 Minutes " got the figure from him , and the Justice Department did n't call the next day to dispute the figure ( as if the Obama administration were going to start a credibility war with yet another network ) .
I was welcome , the spokesman said , to check with Ogrosky 's office at Justice .
I did , asking if Ogrosky or anyone at the department had given " 60 Minutes " that $ 60 billion figure , and if it stood by it .
After cutting through the initial bureaucratic hurdle , Charles Miller , one of the Department of Justice 's spokesman , wrote me : " This sounds like a good question for HHS , " meaning the federal Department of Health and Human Services .
I let Charles know the buck - passing was getting old .
He tracked down Ian McCaleb , the spokesman for the department 's criminal division , who worked with " 60 Minutes " on the segment .
McCaleb 's answer : " The estimate range in the Attorney General 's Q and A was $ 27 to $ 90 billion , but that is using National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association and General Accounting Office estimates on total federal expenditures . "
McCaleb and the attorney general were wrong , too .
GAO has never estimated total Medicare fraud .
It investigates targeted programs within Medicare , finding fraud in the millions , not billions .
And it 's not total federal expenditure that those estimates McCaleb referred to are based on .
It 's total public and private expenditure on health care .
The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association , a partnership between private insurers and the federal government , says that it " estimates conservatively that 3 percent of all health care spending -- or $ 68 billion -- is lost to health care fraud . "
The association bases that figure on 2007 total health care spending of $ 2.27 trillion in the United States .
It 's an unscientific , very dubious way of making estimates .
But even if you go with it , well over half that spending is private sector .
Medicare in 2007 was a $ 436 billion program .
Applying the association 's 3 percent standard , that works out to an estimated $ 13 billion in Medicare fraud .
For argument 's sake , throw in Medicaid 's $ 191 billion spending in 2007 .
You 're up to $ 19 billion in fraud .
Steve Kroft and his producers never bothered to trace their facts to the source for viewers , relying instead on the slob - journalist 's cheapest cop-out : attribution by estimates .
Nor did they make the equally important point :
Insurance fraud is n't unique to Medicare or government - run programs .
If anything , it affects the private sector more .
Shame on " 60 Minutes " and the Justice Department for throwing around wild numbers .
Those are the numbers -- the fictions -- shaping public opinion across the country and public policy in Washington .
Medicare fraud is a serious problem .
But singling it out and exaggerating it beyond credibility wo n't fix it , although it may help doom any government expansion of health care .
In that regard , the " 60 Minutes " segment did its death - panel best .

Self - Taught Inventer Creates Homemade Electric Wheelchair
Li Rongbiao , a 67 year old pensioner and inventor , is making headlines in China because of his handmade electric chairs .
Also known as the Walking Chair , it is assembled from spare parts and consists of spare wheels that ease stairway access for wheelchairs .
Rongbiao started playing around with the idea of an affordable electric wheelchair when his wife ended up with a broken leg .
It so happened that in this period , they faced a number of hassles , including difficulty accessing their fifth floor apartment .
That ’s how this self - made inventor found himself buying computer books and looking for financing for his project .
However , the building of the chair took a bit of time since Rongbiao first had to handle all the basics .
Thus , he taught himself computer designing for 6 months before spending the rest of the year constructing his dream chair .
As for funding , the innovator was so dedicated to this dream that he pooled all of his income into this project .
This included his savings , pension money as well as odd $ 70,000 he made from the sale of his apartment .
All this effort is not in vain as his Walking Chair is gaining popularity in China .
In fact , after he demonstrated his invention at one of the biggest disability shows in China , he has been receiving orders for the electric chair .
And so , following his visit to this expo , interested parties have bought 30 of his Walking Chairs and there is still a backlog of more than 300 orders .

La mafia in TV - Dell ' Utri : Mangano era un'eroe
Oggi pomeriggio Marcello Dell ' Utri era ospite dell ' Annunziata nel programma
“ In ½ ora .
Nulla di nuovo sotto il sole , il Senatore del PDL , condannato in primo grado a 9 anni per associazione esterna alla Mafia , ha fatto la sua parte cercando di convincere i telespettatori che tutto quello che sta accadendo nel suo processo d'appello è solo frutto di falsità .
Cosa è accaduto ?
Proprio mentre il processo era in dirittura d'arrivo i giudici decidono di acquisire agli atti le dichiarazioni di Gaspare Spatuzza , il Boss mafioso che si autoaccusa di aver partecipato all 'assassinio di Paolo Borsellino .
Le ultime dichiarazioni di Spatuzza tirano in ballo Dell ' Utri e Berlusconi nel ruolo di protezione politica ai Fratelli Graviano , i Boss di Brancaccio .
Il senatore oggi a “ In ½ ora ” ha passato tutto il tempo farneticando , le di chiarazioni di Spatuzza sono tutte falsità ha affermato ( nonostante i giudici lo considerano credibile ) , il Lodo Alfano è stato un ottimo tentativo per fare in modo che Berlusconi potesse governare indisturbato ( peccato che fosse incostituzionale ) .
L'affermazione più ridicola è quella che riguarda Vittorio mangano , quando l'Annunziata dice che Manganano è stato definito un 'eroe da Berlusconi , Dell 'utri conferma e addirittura afferma che lo ripeterebbe .
Secondo Dell ' Utri Mangano , nonostante secondo lui fosse imbeccato in tutti i modi , non ha mai accusato Berlusconi questo è l'eroismo del Boss mafioso assunto come stalliere ad Arcore .
Peccato che le sue parole non siano accompagnate in nessun modo da fatti come invece lo sono quelle di Spatuzza .
Alla luce delle ultime dichiarazioni di Spatuzza viene da chiedersi , mangano non ha accusato Berlusconi perchè era realmente estraneo alle stragi oppure per altre ragioni che riguardano anche i fratelli Graviano ?
Attendiamo fiduciosi gli sviluppi , intanto andiamo tutti al No Berlusconi day

Even small amounts of oil leave a fluorescent sheen on polluted water .
This oil sheen is difficult to removeâ € ” until now .
According to a recently published article in the journal Chemosphere , an inexpensive new method has been developed to remove oil sheen by repeatedly pressurizing and depressurizing ozone gas , creating microscopic bubbles that attack the oil so it can be removed by sand filters .
" We are not trying to treat the entire hydrocarbon content in the water -- to turn it into carbon dioxide and water -- but we are converting it into a form that can be retained by sand filtration , which is a conventional and economical process , " says lead author Andy Hong , University of Utah professor of civil and environmental engineering .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Hong says the technology -- for which patents are pending -- could be used to clean a variety of pollutants in water and soil , including :
Oil - contaminated wastewater discharged into coastal waters
So - called " produced water " from oil and gas drilling sites on land .
" If we have technology to clean it , it could be put into beneficial uses , such as irrigation , especially in arid regions where oil and gas tend to be produced , " says Hong .
Water from mining of tar sands and oil shale
Refinery wastewater and oil spills at refineries or on waterways
Groundwater contaminated by MTBE , a gasoline additive that pollutes water due to leaking underground gasoline storage tanks
Wastewater polluted with medications and personal care products
Soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs , from electrical transformers ) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs , from fuel )
The study showed that the new method not only removes oil sheen , but also leaves the treated water so that any remaining acids , aldehydes and ketones are more vulnerable to being biodegraded by pollution - eating microbes .

In a significant blow to medical marijuana caregivers in Los Angeles , the city council voted Tuesday to limit the number of allowed dispensaries to just 70 , ultimately forcing hundreds of shops out of business .
Almost 1,000 dispensaries operate in Los Angeles today .
The drug was authorized for sale for medicinal purposes in 1996 .
The city council said on Tuesday 137 dispensaries would remain open for now , but it intends to reduce the number to no more than 70 over time .
ADVERTISEMENT
The council also decided to enact a series of new restrictions in the sale of marijuana .
“ Councilman Jose Huizar proposed a cap to ensure that dispensaries would not be concentrated in any one neighborhood , ” The Los Angeles Times added .
“ Currently , with no ordinance in place to control their location , dispensaries have clustered in some neighborhoods , such as Eagle Rock , Hollywood and Woodland Hills , drawn by empty storefronts or by proximity to night life . ”
Because of the council ’s concerns , if a dispensary wants to stay in business it must abide by new restrictions “ including staying several hundred feet away from any school , public park , religious institution , licensed child care facility , youth center , hospital or rehab facility , and other collectives , ” noted The Los Angeles Independent .
The council ’s move against the pot shops comes following threats by the district attorney , who claimed “ about 100 % ” of medical marijuana dispensaries are operating illegally by selling the drug to patients over the counter in a storefront setting .
Over the counter sales of marijuana to licensed patients accounted for some $ 18 million in tax revenue last year , according to The Christian Science - Monitor , during a time when California is facing the greatest budgetary challenges in its history .

There are three voter - sponsored initiatives circulating California at the moment which seek to put complete legalization and taxation of marijuana on the state - wide ballot in 2010 , the Orange County Register added .
“ If one of these initiatives passes , California would become the first state to legalize marijuana and impose a tax on it , a move proponents say could help get the state out of an unprecedented budget crisis , ” the paper reported .

The winless New Jersey Nets have fired coach Lawrence Frank with immediate effect .
The Nets announced the move Sunday shortly after ESPN .
com 's report that Frank would not coach the Nets in Sunday night 's road game against the Los Angeles Lakers .
Despite playing hard for assistant coach Tom Barrise , the Nets matched the worst start to an NBA season with their 17th straight loss as the Lakers overwhelmed New Jersey 106 - 87 .
The Nets ' announcement said that Frank 's permanent replacement has not yet been chosen .
Sources with knowledge of New Jersey 's thinking told ESPN.com that the Nets wanted to delay the widely anticipated coaching change until after the team returned from its four - game West Coast trip .
Yet it appears that Nets management determined that it had to make the move before facing the Lakers after reports became more widespread that Frank 's dismissal was imminent .
The Bergen ( N.J. ) Record and Yahoo !
Sports reported Sunday that Frank 's firing was expected as early as Monday no matter the outcome Sunday against the Lakers .
After New Jersey 's first loss of the week Tuesday in Denver , ESPN.com quoted a source close to the situation as saying that Frank could not survive a winless trip .
" I want to thank Lawrence for more than a decade of service to the Nets , first as an assistant coach and then as the head coach for the past six and a half seasons , " Nets president Rod Thorn said in a statement .
" Lawrence always approached every day with a passion for his craft that was infectious , and his dedication to the game as well as his work ethic are to be both admired and appreciated .
I wish he and his family only the best of good fortune in the future . "
Nets assistant coach John Loyer and general manager Kiki Vandeweghe are considered the internal co-favorites to succeed Frank for the rest of the season , although neither has ever been an NBA head coach .
It 's believed that the Nets will settle on Frank 's replacement in time for Tuesday 's scheduled practice after organization meetings to assess all of their options .
A source close to Frank told ESPN.com 's Chris Sheridan earlier Sunday that Frank has known for a week his departure was imminent , with the only question being where and when it would happen .
According to The Associated Press , players were shocked when Frank showed up at the team 's morning team meeting in Los Angeles not wearing his Nets gear .
" It 's tough , because he was the hardest worker on the team , " center Brook Lopez said .
" He 's so passionate about what he does .
It was a rough situation , and he did a great job of not using our injuries as an excuse .
He came in every night and had us prepared . "
Frank , who set an NBA coaching record by winning his first 13 games as Byron Scott 's replacement in the 2003 - 04 season , is in the final year of a contract that pays him $ 4 million this season .
He is the second NBA coach to be fired this season after Scott 's dismissal by New Orleans earlier this month .
Speculation has been mounting all week in New Jersey that Vandeweghe would be asked to replace Frank , largely as a cost - saving measure given the relative inexperience and anonymity of the coaches on Frank 's staff .
Frank 's record as Nets coach is 225-241 .
Injuries have plagued the team throughout its 0 - 17 start , which includes four losses by three points or fewer , but New Jersey 's effort and energy have noticeably deteriorated since a home loss to New York on Nov. 21 , amid increasingly strong signals that Frank would soon be dismissed .
The Nets entered Sunday 's play averaging an NBA - low 85.6 points and shooting a league - worst 40.3 percent from the field .
Eleven of their losses have come by double digits , including all four games of this Western road trip .
With the loss to the Lakers , New Jersey joined the 1988 - 89 Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Clippers during the lockout - shortened 1999 season as the only teams to start 0 - 17 .
Another source close to the situation told ESPN.com on Tuesday : " The team has n't lost interest in each other , which is a good sign , but I do n't know how much more interest they have in [ Frank 's message ] . "
New Jersey 's streak had reached 16 with Friday night 's 109- 96 defeat to Sacramento , which matched the franchise 's longest losing streak .
The Nets have dropped 17 straight road games dating to March 18 , when they routed the Knicks by 26 points .
New Jersey has also lost 28 of 36 all - time road games against Los Angeles .

EARLIER this year my colleague wrote
What is hard to imagine is that a state might actually admit that it had executed an innocent person .
But up until recently , Texas was getting awfully close .
Thanks to David Grann 's piece in the New Yorker last month , the case of Cameron Todd Willingham is getting the exposure it deserves .
Willingham was executed by the state of Texas for setting fire to his home in 1991 .
The blaze killed his three young children .
His conviction was largely a result of the testimony of two local arson investigators , who said Mr Willingham had deliberately set the fire .
But subsequent reviews found troubling problems with the arson finding .
In 2004 , as Willingham sat on death row protesting his innocence , an independent investigator reviewed the original report and concluded that the fire was accidental and that the initial investigation was based on " junk science " .
That report was sent to the governor 's office and the Board of Pardons and Paroles , but Willingham 's appeals were turned down and he was executed on February 17th 2004 .
Since that time , there have been three other investigations into the fire .
Here are the results , as summed up by the Chicago Tribune :
Over the past five years , the Willingham case has been reviewed by nine of the nation ’s top fire scientists — first for the Tribune , then for the Innocence Project , and now for the [ Texas Forensic Science Commission ] .
All concluded that the original investigators relied on outdated theories and folklore to justify the determination of arson .
So there seems to have been a bit of a foul - up with the initial investigation , as even the prosecutor admits .
Could this be the case that anti-death - penalty advocates have dreamed of — where a state actually admits to killing an innocent man ?
Of course not .
Shortly after the Texas Forensic Science Commission was formed in 2005 it took up the Willingham case .
The commission hired Craig Beyler to review the initial investigation and , as noted by the Tribune , he reported that the original findings were deeply flawed .
Mr Beyler was set to present his review to the commission last month when ... three ( and now four ) of the commission members , including the chairman , were replaced by the governor , Rick Perry .
The governor was perfectly within his rights to do this , but the timing seems a bit suspect .
After all , Mr Perry allowed the execution to proceed in 2004 , despite having in hand the first of the reports that questioned the investigation .
The governor , who is up for re-election in 2010 and facing a very tough primary battle , has dismissed that report , and all the others , calling the fire investigators who reviewed the case , " latter - day supposed experts " .
( For supposed experts , they have very impressive resumes . )
The now - former commision chairman also says he felt pressured by aides to Mr Perry .
The governor , as you may have guessed , remains confident that Willingham was guilty .
Mr Perry is not the first politician to show disdain for experts and science — it seems to happen rather often when the science does n't comport with one 's personal views .
You might think that the importance of a death penalty case would lead to a more considered approach , but a flagrant disregard for evidence is what has allowed the death penalty to persist all these years .
A substantial amount of research shows it comes at a high cost to states without deterring murder .
More than 130 people who had been sentenced to death have been subsequently exonerated .
Yet a majority of Americans continue to support executions , perhaps because this is the way we show our indignation for the evil act of murder .
Revenge demands blood — even the blood of an innocent man , it now seems .
( More on the Willingham case :
The prosecutor in the case claims that testimony from the trial , apart from the arson investigation , " contains overwhelming evidence of guilt " .
I am not convinced , but you can be the judge .
Both the orignal New Yorkerarticle and subsequent follow - ups refute the prosecutor 's claims . )

Unbeknownst to him , four copies of his private e-mail are stored in locations around the world .
The first is stored locally on his phone , a second on a search engine giant ’s servers , a third on a consumer electronics company that he forwards his e-mail through and a fourth on the massive social network ’s servers where the flirty message originated .
Each of these copies are duplicated across servers for the safety of redundancy .
Four separate corporations , run by people he will never meet , store his most private messages .
A fifth corporation , a telecommunications conglomerate , logs the entire process and associates it with his account .
Unknown to him , he is video recorded as he leaves his home by his apartment ’s security system .
The resulting tape is scheduled to be stored in a permanent archive .
When he first got on the bus , he scanned his bus pass which logged his account identifier into the metro system .
After doing so , he walked by an on - board microphone that was set to record the entire bus .
At the same time he was recorded by two different video cameras on the ceiling of the bus .
As he travels down the road , the GPS in the bus sends its coordinates back to the bus station .
Meanwhile 23 other GPS enabled devices sit in the pockets of the passengers .
In any of those cell phones ring , they will enable microphones that would pick up and transmit the man 's voice .
Even if the GPS features are disabled , the cell phones can still be triangulated via cell towers .
In the off chance that both the GPS features and cell networks were disabled , the Internet enabled phones could still be geo-located when they accessed public WiFi routers .
Together there are 70 different ways that the man sitting in his favorite seat on the bus could be tracked .
As he walks the half mile from his bus stop to his office , he is recorded by 4 different video cameras .
The first is in the police car , the second and third are intersection cameras and the final camera is in the ATM he walks by .
As he entered the office building , he swiped his card and was identified as having opened the door .
This action was stored in a remote database .
He then walked into the office where he entered a room with 25 other cell phones .
There are also 26 computers .
Together there are over 50 different devices that can access the internet .
Each of them identify their location and general details every time they connect to a server .
As soon as the young man opened his Internet browser , his operating system immediately began logging each website he visited .
When his homepage loaded , the action was logged by the search giant .
This record is owned by the same company that owns the second website he visited to watch the music video .
Both actions are stored somewhere on an unknown server .
The third site he visits , his favorite social network , logs every action he takes and associated it directly with his account .
The same is done for all of his friends .
After leaving that closed garden , he shares his popcorn thought with his acquaintances on the micro blogging service .
His message is dispersed through a massive API where an untold number of services permanently store it and associate it with his account .
He has a similar experience when he browses his favorite social news website .
All of his actions on the domain are stored and associated with his account .
Even after he leaves this domain to view the day ’s funny pictures and top ten lists , his actions are tracked either by the search engine giant or a large Redmond based software company .
At one point he is n’t on a page that displays ads by these major ad networks , but is instead tracked by a specific online retailer who has its own ad network .
The online retailer associates his page views with his shopping account .
All of this data is stored permanently and mined to ensure that the online retailer is able to maximize profits .
He finishes his morning internet round by buying tickets on a movie ticket site .
The popular site stores his zip code and credit card details .
As soon as he stepped into the grocery store he was picked up by one of about 20 video cameras that continually record shoppers .
As he approached the checkout stand he started a three tiered identification process that rivals that of getting a Passport .
The first method was via government ID and was paradoxically the least useful to the grocery store .
The cashier ignored his picture and instead focused on typing his birthdate into the register computer as speedily as possible .
The second form of identification was via his phone number that was tied to his grocery card number .
This allows the grocery store to log all of the young man ’s purchases .
This data is later analyzed to determine spending patterns of different demographics and to identify sale combinations that maximize profits .
The final form of identification underwent the most analysis .
The man ’s credit card required an autograph .
This transaction was stored by four different companies .
The first was stored locally at the point of sale by the grocery store .
The second was stored on his credit card ’s servers .
The third was on his bank ’s servers and the final copy was stored on the servers of his favorite personal finance website .
The package on his doorstep hints at only the tip of two data icebergs .
The first one is owned by the online retailer and the second one is owned by a worldwide shipping company .
His address and name are stored in massive databases owned by the two corporations .
He will never have access to his information stored in shipping database .
Records of the contents of the package , along with his credit card information are stored by the online retailer so that it can show relevant suggestions when he visits the website .
His address , phone number , name and pizza preferences are stored by the pizza company when he places his order .
This transaction is also stored by the pizza place , his bank , the credit card company and his personal finance website .
His movie selection is stored on the server ’s of the consumer electronics manufacturer from earlier .
Again his financial transaction is recorded by four corporations .

It will apply to you and your work but not in the way that you are familiar with .
It is an experiment for both of us .
He wakes up at 7:31 AM just like the day before .
With ignorance as his shield , he ventures out into a world without privacy .
The young man ( a title given to him by his mother ) sits submissively in his bed and idly scans e-mail on his phone .
Another notice from his bank , a forwarded e-mail from his friend , five new e-mails from his co-workers , and an intimate message from a girl he met last weekend at a party .
He suppresses a smirk , she is toying with him and he knows it .
After checking his e-mail , he pulls himself out of bed , takes a shower , and eats a homemade breakfast burrito .
Just wearing a towel , he glances over to see if his blinds are closed .
He is most conscious of his privacy when he is alone .
He pulls his favorite shirt out of his closet ( a medium sized black unlabeled t- shirt ) and pulls it over his head .
He leaves his apartment after double checking that he locked the deadbolt on his front door .
He walks the two blocks to his bus stop just in time to catch the 43 .
He sits down on his normal seat on the bus ( between the middle door and the support pole ) and puts in his headphones .
For the entire 30 minute duration of the ride , none of the 23 people on the bus make eye contact with each other .
The bus driver lazily and incoherently babbles into the onboard PA .
He sits calmly and listens to the Garden State Soundtrack for the 46th time .
Eventually he reaches his stop and steps off the bus and into the city .
Adjusting his earphone , he starts the short hike to work .
He nods at the police officer who is stopped at a red light .
The cop does n’t nod back .
He eventually makes it to his office building and continues up the staircase .
He says “ hi ” to the friendly man at front desk , grabs a glass of water and unpacks his laptop .
He greets his co-workers and eventually settles at his desk .
He sits down at his desk and loads up all of his normal browser bookmarks to quickly skim the days news .
He checks his e-mail again .
One of his friends sent him a link to an online video of a little kid singing a Beatles song .
Having already seen it , he responds with a “ lol ” and switches tabs so he can skim the most popular articles on his favorite social news site .
He clicks several of the corresponding links and is taken to some websites with various clever images and lists .
The content is designed to be consumed quickly .
He digests it like watching a flip book .
Around the office he hears erratic bursts of laughter as his coworkers click the same links .
Noticing this " popcorn effect " for the first time , he shares his thought on a micro blogging service .
Later , after finishing a long day at work , he stops by his local grocery store to pick up a six pack of beer .
He goes straight to the back of the store and brings the drink back to the register .
Despite his facial hair , the clerk requests to see his ID .
He complies and pulls it out of his wallet .
The young man keys in his phone number in absence of his grocery store loyalty card so that he can save $ 0.50 .
The cash register prints out a receipt and the cashier shoves it in a plastic bag along with the purchase .
The man thanks the grocer and continues on his way home .
As he finally gets back to his apartment he grabs the package from his doormat and settles down for the evening .
He orders in a pizza because he is too tired to cook for himself .
The young man finishes his day by splitting the beers with his roommate and watching a movie .
Back in his bed , he looks at the calendar , the date is November 3rd 2009 .
This is not some day off in the distant future , it is today .
This is not some made up character , this is my life and it extends directly into yours .
The balance between privacy and convenience is fickle .
It is unproven and the rules are uncertain .
Just because something is free online does not mean you are not making a sacrifice when you use it .
That said , I do not believe that sharing personal data for convenience sake is evil .
Many times it is economical and even beneficial .
The fact that your pharmacy has access to all of your prescriptions gives them the ability to check for potentially lethal interactions .
This is fundamentally good .
Policies like these save lives .
Information is not a scarce resource like oil or coal , it is bountiful and truly limitless .
I believe it should be up to the individual to decide what they want to do with their person data .
After all , a few of the corporations above were opt in .
At some point in the future , I plan to completely open source my life .
By this I mean , puttingof my personal data online .
This will include everything from my browsing history to my digitized DNA .
I have been conducting research on the ramifications of this for a little over a year and this article unveils some of the realizations I have had .
As you can see , the leap to throwing away my privacy is actually much smaller than I originally thought .
In fact , both you and I are already almost all of the way there .
The references to major corporations made above were all real .
The actual corporations are listed below with some relevant facts .
In addition to the data points listed above , Google is storing hundreds of other metrics about it 's users Apple is rumored to be building a $ 1 billion data center so it is likely that more data like that mentioned in post will be stored in the future .
In total , 25 Terabytes of user activity data is stored daily by the online social networking service .
AT&T reported only has 20,268 servers .
This is infantile compared to Google 's estimated 1,000,000 servers .
Twitter recently peaked at 5,000 messages a second following Michael Jackson 's death .
Odds are one of them was yours .
Digg says that only about half of its server load is from visitors to its website .
The other half is a mix of Digg buttons and API calls .
This means a non-trivial amount of information that Digg collects is from people who are not even on the Digg domain .
Youtube serves over 1,000,000,000 ( billion ) views a day .
Odds are you are one of them .
The major credit card companies are now hiring psychologists and statisticians to mine your buying data and figuring out who is a liability .
Microsoft is in the process of finishing one of the world 's biggest data centers in anticipation of creating the world 's first mainstream cloud - based operating system , Microsoft Azure .
In Microsoft 's eye , the future is in your data .
( Google and I agree ) Amazon has more 55 million active customer accounts Mint Software was recently bought by Intuit Inc. making its combined collection of personal finance information one of the biggest in the world .
The United Parcel Service ( UPS ) can reach more than 4 billion of the earth 's 6.3 billion people to which it delivers more than 13.3 million packages each day .
Each of the 40,000 systems in the company 's franchises are connected to their global network .
Your pizza order is not alone .
Separating Explosives from the Detonator
Chechen terrorists did it in 2004 .
I said this in an interview with then TSA head Kip Hawley in 2007 :
I do n’t want to even think about how much C4 I can strap to my legs and walk through your magnetometers .
And what sort of magical thinking is behind the rumored TSA rule about keeping passengers seated during the last hour of flight ?
Do we really think the terrorist wo n’t think of blowing up their improvised explosive devices during the first hour of flight ?
For years I ’ve been saying this :
Only two things have made flying safer [ since 9/11 ] : the reinforcement of cockpit doors , and the fact that passengers know now to resist hijackers .
This week , the second one worked over Detroit .
Security succeeded .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/26 ) : Only one carry on ?
No electronics for the first hour of flight ?
I wish that , just once , some terrorist would try something that you can only foil by upgrading the passengers to first class and giving them free drinks .

David Nutt was chairman of the UK government ’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs until he was dismissed last week by the UK home secretary ( Image : Lucy Goodchild / Imperial College London )
IF THERE is one thing that politicians can and should do to limit the damage caused by illegal drugs , it is to take careful note of the evidence and develop a rational drug policy .
Some politicians find it easier to ignore the evidence , and pander to public prejudice instead .
I can trace the beginning of the end of my role as chairman of the UK ’s official advisory body on drugs to the moment I quoted a New Scientist editorial ( 14 February , p 5 ) .
Entitled , fittingly enough , “ Drugs drive politicians out of their minds ” , the editorial asked the reader to imagine being seated at a table with two bowls , one containing peanuts , the other the illegal drug MDMA ( ecstasy ) .
Which is safer to give to a stranger ?
Why , the ecstasy of course .
I quoted these words in the Eve Saville lecture at King ’s College London in July .
This example plus other comments I have made – such as horse riding is more harmful than ecstasy – prompted Alan Johnson , the home secretary , to say that I had crossed the line from science to policy .
This , he said , is why I had to go .
Advertisement
But simple , accurate and understandable statements of scientific fact are precisely what the advisory council is supposed to provide .
Why would any scientist take up some future offer of a government advisory post when their advice can be treated with such disdain ?
As well as ignoring its own advisers , the UK is falling out of step with international trends .
When Portugal softened its drugs laws in 2001 , drug use remained roughly constant , but ill health and deaths from drug taking fell .
Decriminalisation quietly crept up the agenda in Vienna this year at a meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs , where governments heard new , independent evidence on how the harms of criminalisation were outweighing the benefits .
In August , President Felipe Calderón of Mexico approved a law decriminalising possession of small amounts of marijuana and other drugs .
And just last month , Eric Holder , the US attorney general , instructed federal prosecutors to stop hounding medical users of marijuana in the 14 states where such use is legal .
No one doubts that heavy users of marijuana are risking trouble with their mental health .
What I have simply pointed out is that we need a consistent policy , recognising that heavy users of alcohol and tobacco are more numerous and are causing themselves – and others – even more trouble through their indulgence .
Policies that ignore the realities of the world we live in are doomed to fail .
This is true for just about all the biggest issues that we confront , from energy and climate to criminal justice , health and immigration .
I ’m not arguing that science dictate policy ; considerations such as cost , practicality and morality also have a role .
But scientific evidence should never be brushed aside from the political debate .
The current British government has said repeatedly that it wants its policies to be evidence - based , but actions speak louder than words .
On ecstasy , for example , it made policy first , sought advice second – and cynically rejected the advice it was given .
The result is shambolic policy - making which gives great cause for concern if that is how governments operate more generally .
The results of a government inventing its own reality and acting on it can be seen in the appalling consequences the George W. Bush presidency had for world peace , the environment and human rights .
The message for the British government is a simple one : do n’t exclude rational argument in order to exploit a visceral public response .
Politicians have to win the hearts and minds of their electorate .
If your policy is informed by an underlying moral imperative , be open about what that is , and do n’t try to disguise it with a veneer of pseudo - science .
We ignore scientific evidence at our peril .
I finally finished the Haskell blog project that I ’ve been doing for a long time !
You ’re looking at it now ( unless you are reading this a few months / years after I wrote it , in which case I will probably have again re-implemented my blog software in my new language - du - jour … ) [ EDIT : I switched to blogofile in June 2012 ]
The blog software itself is not particularly interesting — fairly standard features , Atom feeds etc .
It uses HDBC Sqlite for storage , and HStringTemplate for rendering ( a nice library , BTW ) .
For framework stuff , it uses my own Ella library .
I did n’t find a forms / validation library I could use , and ended up just using a few adhoc bits and pieces .
I ’ve used the lovely pandoc to allow reStructuredText both for my own posts and for comments , which is a nice feature IMO .
The main interest for me has been the learning process .
You get a much better , rounded understanding of a language from a project like this than you do from the small code samples that people knock around .
The project nearly failed at the last hurdle .
Everything was working , but when I uploaded to my server , it failed on some URLs .
I realised it was a memory problem — the CGI program must have been killed for using too much memory .
At first , I thought the limits on the server must be unreasonably small .
Understanding the output of +RTS -s - RTS is kind of difficult .
When I eventually found out that GHC compiled programs never release any memory back to the operating system , I realised that it ’s the first figure — the total amount of memory allocated in the heap — that was killing me .
On the bigger pages , this was over 160 Mb .
At that point I stopped complaining to my web host !
By changing to ByteString instead of Data .
Text for StringTemplate , and using ByteString in a few other places , I achieved a 4 - 5 fold reduction in memory usage , along with a significant speed up .
Most pages now only use about 10 - 15 Mb to render , which is OK for a short running process I think .
It ’s not ideal , especially when an additional 1 k comment on a page seems to require at least 300 k extra memory to render , but it ’s good enough for now .
Profiling further will be very hard , as I suspect it will mainly be to do with the guts of HStringTemplate .
I ’ll be blogging about the experience of developing this over the next few days / weeks , and what I ’ve learnt .
It ’s certainly been enjoyable overall , although it ’s definitely had its pain points too !
I ’ve put redirection in for all the old , crufty URLs , so there should n’t be any broken links .
Feed readers will likely be confused , sorry !
If you have problems getting through my spam protection , please let me know .
It enforces a 10 second wait before it accepts submissions , which serves to prevent thoughtless comments as well as spam :-)
Andy Warhol talked of a time when everyone would be famous for 15 minutes .
With hindsight , however , he might have wanted to revise that down to about five minutes .
On today 's web , phrases such as " here today , gone tomorrow " seem to involve ridiculously long timescales .
People who moaned that blogging represented a move to shorter attention spans – 250 - to - 350 - word posts rather than 1,000 - word stories – have now seen blog posts start to look big and , frankly , old - fashioned .
Today 's trendsetters are using " microblogging " sites such as Tumblr , Posterous and Soup.io , which are taking the opportunity for creative " borrowing " to new heights .
But the smash hit of 2009 has been ( apologies : I know this will cause pain )
Twitter , where 1,000 - word stories are reduced to 140 - character tweets .
Short attention spans R us .
Twitter 's rapid growth and open programming interface have given the site a wide impact .
Hundreds , possibly thousands , of ancillary sites and services have been launched to help Twitter users post pictures , track followers , or – more usefully , from a commercial point of view – find out what the " hive mind " is thinking .
Twitterfall is just one example .
More recently , Listorious stepped in to make it easier to find and explore lists made using Twitter 's new list feature , while The Twitter Tim.es cleverly turned selected tweets into a personalised newspaper .
How many of these sites will survive is , of course , open to question .
Some are less like standalone sites than parasites .
Major web players such as Facebook , Google , and Microsoft also got involved .
Both Google and Microsoft signed deals for Twitter searches , while Facebook paid it the ultimate compliment of more or less copying its service .
Or , perhaps , copying FriendFeed , which many users link to both Twitter and Facebook .
Facebook , while far from new , was another big player in 2009 , reaching more than 350 million users .
And through Facebook Connect , it has extended its presence across the web .
Once you have a Facebook identity – and you must have one , must n't you ?
– then you can use it to access a growing number of sites and services .
And that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
The web might be a kinder , more polite place if people said things under their real names , which is what Facebook 's about .
Those in search of their five minutes of fame or , more likely , five minutes of fun fun fun , headed for YouTube .
Although it has been challenged by rivals such as Vimeo and Microsoft 's Soapbox ( RIP ) , its dominance has not been seriously threatened .
Only the pornographers have been able to build much of a following outside YouTube .
Which is not to say that YouTube owns the web video market .
The BBC has made a huge impact with its iPlayer catchup service , and in the US , Hulu has enjoyed great success with TV series and movies .
Of course , both sites are showing videos that YouTube would love to offer , at a profit , and it will be interesting to see how this plays out .
Music has been a significant player in the growth of the web since Napster , and its influence continues to grow .
Spotify has made the biggest impact this year , gaining mindshare lost by Last.fm and Pandora .
Meanwhile , Pitchfork has expanded its role as the web 's authoritative music magazine , and The Hype Machine came to prominence as a source of instant erudition by tracking the music blogs .
Almost finally , it may be that we are seeing the return not just of the browser wars but of the search engine wars as well .
Google still rules the world , but in Bing , it now has a competitor that does some things better and has , in Microsoft , an owner with deep pockets .
Alas , Bing also does many things a lot worse .
Possibly the most contentious part of this year 's list is celebrity gossip .
The argument against would be summed up by a Wikipedian in two words : " not notable " .
The argument for is that sites such as Perez Hilton and AOL's TMZ are now helping to drive the news agenda .
Even if you are n't interested in Michael Jackson 's death , Tiger Woods 's affairs or whatever , this stuff has become impossible to avoid .
This is one case where many people would prefer the web 's short attention span to be even shorter .

In a study that confirms what anyone with common sense already knew , Banks with political ties got bailouts .
U.S. banks that spent more money on lobbying were more likely to get government bailout money , according to a study released on Monday .
Banks whose executives served on Federal Reserve boards were more likely to receive government bailout funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , according to the study from Ran Duchin and Denis Sosyura , professors at the University of Michigan 's Ross School of Business .
Banks with headquarters in the district of a U.S. House of Representatives member who serves on a committee or subcommittee relating to TARP also received more funds .
Political influence was most helpful for poorly performing banks , the study found .
Banks with an executive who sat on the board of a Federal Reserve Bank were 31 percent more likely to get bailouts through TARP 's Capital Purchase Program , the study showed .
Banks with ties to a finance committee member were 26 percent more likely to get capital purchase program funds .
President Obama said in October that despite the bailout , there was still too little credit flowing to small businesses .
Appearances Are Deceiving
appears
Politicians For Sale
The banking industry has long been criticized for using political influence to obtain bailouts .
How about , “ The politicians have long been criticized for granting political favors in exchange for campaign contributions . ”
If the politicians were n’t for sale , they could n’t be bought .
Look familiar ?
For a story that broke on Twitter it 's only fitting that the first reported picture of the mythical , magical " Google Phone " ( AKA , Nexus One ) would appear there as well .
The tweeted image above appears courtesy of one Cory O'Brien , an account manager at a San Francisco Bay Area marketing agency that does not list Google as a client .
That note of caution aside , the image above is an exact match to that leaked HTC Passion / Bravo image from October , only this time lacking the HTC logo on the top - side bezel .
Besides the pic , O'Brien tweets that the " Google Phone = i Phone + a little extra screen and a scroll wheel .
Great touch screen , and Android . "
Granted , none of this is confirmed yet , but with Google releasing so many of the devices as part of its " mobile lab " concept , well , we expect to see plenty more sightings in the run up to the rumored January launch . :
A quick search for " nexus one " on Google 's Picasa photo service reveals several pictures taken with a camera pegged as the HTC Nexus One in the EXIF data .
The very first of these geotagged 2592 ×1944 pixel ( that 's a 5 megapixel sensor folks , hardly " weirdly large " as described by TechCrunch ) images were taken by user Bradley ( who just happens to be a Picasa friend to Sergey ... hint ) in the SF Bay Area on November 27th .
A few are clearly lit by an onboard flash as well .
In fact , many of the pics appear to be taken from within Google 's offices and at Google sponsored events .
The quality is not exactly spectacular and that wo n't likely change in the final product because even Google 's bound by the laws of physics when it comes to tiny cellphone sensors . :
The device seems to have been around earlier with an EXIF identifier of " Phone88 . "
Fortunately , Google 's own employees have uploaded pics of the device , by the device , for us to marvel at -- so meta .
Check the gallery for the images or a quickie close - up posted after the break .
WASHINGTON Historical moments are best judged from a distance , when the eye is able to focus on the whole canvas .
Given the misconceptions that seem to surround the fall of the Berlin Wall , what is striking about the 20th anniversary of the events of Nov. 9 , 1989 , is not how much , but how little time has passed for countries still living under totalitarian conditions .
Many people , young and old , believe the collapse of communism in Europe was bound to happen .
 Crushed by its own weight ,  implosion and untenable  are usually attached to the disintegration of the Soviet empire , symbolized in the announcement given by East German propaganda minister Gunter Schabowski on the fateful day that East Berliners were free to cross to the other side .
If much of the worlds intelligentsia thought that socialisms triumph was unstoppable before it was stopped , their peers today conveniently dismiss the importance of those events as predictable  in order to concentrate the mind on the true enemy capitalism .
But there was nothing inevitable about the opening of the Berlin Wall .
At the time , hard - liners still held sway in Czechoslovakia , Romania and , of course , East Germany itself , where Egon Krenz , who had deposed Erich Honecker , had assumed power in order to bring civil unrest under control .
Yes , Mikhail Gorbachev had sent ripples through the empire with his perestroika and glasnost ,  and signaled that the various communist governments could no longer depend on Moscows intervention .
But the reactionary forces were powerful even inside the Soviet Union , as the coup against Gorbachev proved two years lateran uprising that would probably have succeeded if Boris Yeltsin had not defied it so effectively .
It is true that the Soviet empire was an economic failure .
But it had always been a failure .
It had survived thanks to a near perfect police state and a military machine that absorbed a quarter of the nations output .
Those structures could have continued to suppress any form of popular discontent were it not for key actors who refused to act in such a way in certain defining moments .
Furthermore , East Germany was much less backward than the Soviet Union .
As a recent book by Michael Meyer The Year That Changed the Worldsuggests , what eventually sprung many East Germans into action was not so much their economic condition but the bewitching images of capitalisms cornucopia beamed by West German TV every night .
People who made conscious decisions and leaders who seized favorable circumstances that they themselves had helped shape were responsible for opening the wall .
History did not make them ; they made history .
Incidentally , the fact that Margaret Thatcher , who inspired so many behind the Iron Curtain , was hardly mentioned at a recent celebratory conference in Berlin featuring Gorbachev , George H.W. Bush and Helmut Kohl in Berlin tells us how much the world takes for granted what happened 20 years ago .
The anniversary reminds us that the lessons of 1989 have been lost on Russia .
In an eye blink , that country went from totalitarianism to an autocracy reminiscent of the Romanovs .
As Tony Brenton , a former British ambassador to Moscow , recently wrote in The Times of London , the failure of Russias transition to the rule of law and the market economy was due to the fact that there were no rules , institutions or habits to prevent the ruthless and unscrupulous from taking all they could . 
One could add that a series of foreign policy humiliations seeing NATO expanded and Kosovo taken away from Serbian control , among othersadded to the national frustration that opened the doors to Vladimir Putin and his cronies .
How has the world reacted ?
Ironically , Germany , whose reunification was so feared by Thatcher and Frances Francois Mitterrand ( the latter belatedly accepted it , the former never did ) , has not only avoided throwing its weight around on the international stage , it has supported Russias new assertiveness  even as the Kremlin used state terror against Chechnya , crushed Georgia , and blackmailed Ukraine by turning off gas supplies in order to extract political concessions .
The anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall finds millions of human beings still under recalcitrant communist tyrannies that have defied the historical inevitability  of totalitarianisms demise .
We owe it to the inhabitants of Cuba , North Korea , Laos and Cambodia not to speak of China and Vietnam , where the ruling party continues to be communist but the beast is of a very different nature to take a fresh look at what happened on Nov. 9 , 1989 .

In 2009 , consumers paid an average fee of $ 3.54 to use another bank 's ATM , up 16 % from 2004 .
Despite the recession , banks are charging consumers record fees for checking account services .
In August , ATM fees and monthly service charges on interest - bearing checking accounts climbed to new highs , while bounced - check fees hovered near a high after adjusting for inflation , according to a new survey that will be released today by Bankrate.com .
While bank fees have been rising for years , Congress is paying more attention to them as consumers struggle to pay their bills .
The findings show that if you " slip up by overdrawing your account , not maintaining the required balance or going to another bank 's ATM , you will pay an ever - higher price , " says Greg McBride , a senior analyst at Bankrate.com , a bank - account comparison site .
HOW TO AVOID FEES : Six tips from Bankrate.com ATM fees have risen for three - consecutive years .
In 2009 , consumers paid an average fee of $ 3.54 to use another bank 's ATM , up 16 % from 2004 .
This includes the fee charged at the ATM , as well as the fee charged by the customer 's bank .
This year , consumers are paying a record charge of $ 12.55 per month for an interest - bearing checking account , up 3.5 % from 2004 , Bankrate 's data show .
The average bounced - check fee was $ 29.58 this year , near the inflation - adjusted high of $ 29.73 reached in 2005 .
" As fees continue to move higher , it 's more important than ever for consumers to shop around and get the best terms so they can keep more of their hard - earned money , " McBride says .
In this economy , consumers are also paying more for their credit cards .
A 2009 survey by Consumer Action , an advocacy group , said late fees climbed 9 % from 2008 , to an average $ 28.19 .
Balance - transfer fees are also going up , along with interest rates for new and existing customers .
" This is a way that lenders can earn more money from card holders , and they 're going to do this until it becomes more difficult , " says Ruth Susswein , deputy director of national priorities for Consumer Action .
The American Bankers Association , a trade group , says that the majority of consumers are n't paying bank fees .
A 2008 survey from the bankers ' group shows that 52 % of consumers paid nothing for checking account maintenance and ATM use .
Meanwhile , a 2009 bankers ' survey reveals that only 17 % of consumers paid an overdraft fee in 12 months .
" It is very possible in this country to have a checking account and to never pay a dime for it , " says Carol Kaplan , a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association .

KENT , Ohio --
Is that any way to treat a hero ?
A 19 - year - old Kent man wants to know why he was tasered by police and arrested outside his burning home after he risked injury by getting seven people to safety early Sunday morning .
" I was panicked , I was excited , my house was burning down , " said Micheal Bartlett Jr. , of the 600 block of Crain Avenue .
" They were just standing there and one of them cursed at me .
Then they threw me to the ground , put a knee to my head and tasered me .
I did nothing wrong . "
Kent Police Chief Jim Peach said it happened differently .
" It was 4:30 in the morning , our officers just got there , " he said .
" The occupants of the house were very intoxicated .
One kept yelling to the police to go into the burning building and get his personal belongings .
The police refused .
The man started chest - butting the officers .
The police tried to give him space , but he would not stop .
So they tasered him to get him under control and placed him under arrest for misconduct at an emergency . "
Bartlett denied chest - butting the officers .
" I have witnesses who saw the whole thing , " he said .
" The police officers were just standing there .
I asked them to do something and one of them cursed at me . "
Fire officials said the two - story house was destroyed in the fire , with damages at more than $ 90,000 .
The cause of the fire is under investigation .
Bartlett said he was in downtown Kent that morning and went home at 4:30 a.m. and saw flames in his sister 's room .
" I was afraid my sister was in her room , " Bartlett said .
" The whole room was in flames .
I ran in , but I could not breathe .
I went to the basement because five of my friends were down there .
I ran down and got them up and out of the house .
" Then , I went back in because I knew that two more friends were sleeping upstairs , " he continued .
" The smoke was so thick , I could not breathe .
I reached them and got them out .
We could hear the windows popping as we ran outside .
It turned out my sister was at her boyfriend 's house . "
Bartlett 's father , also named Micheal , said his son received second degree burns on his ears , head and back and was left in a jail cell until the next day .
" I could not believe that they did n't take him to the hospital , " he said .
" They made him go before a judge before they released him to me .
I took him to Robinson Memorial Hospital in Ravenna .
" I just do n't get it , " Bartlett Sr. said .
" My son saved seven people 's lives and they taser him and arrest him .
It does not make sense . "

Ms Geimer said Polanski had been forced to flee by a " corrupt " judge
The victim of the sexual assault committed by Roman Polanski has called for charges against the film director to be dismissed , court documents show .
Lawyers for Samantha Geimer , who was 13 when Polanski had sex with her in 1977 , urged a dismissal in a motion filed at a California appeals court on Friday .
She had suffered health problems after being hounded by the media following Polanski's arrest last month , it said .
The director is currently being held in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant .
On Friday , the US embassy in Bern submitted a formal extradition request , on which the Swiss authorities must rule within 40 days .
Swiss officials informed the US that the 76 - year - old was travelling to Zurich from France to collect an award at the city 's film festival .
' Oprah has called '
The director , who holds dual French and Polish citizenship , has been wanted in the US since he fled the country in 1978 , after pleading guilty to having unlawful sex with an under - age girl .
He was originally charged with six offences .
No matter what his crime , Polanski was entitled to be treated fairly ; he was not
Court papers filed on behalf of Samantha Geimer After Ms Geimer sued him in 1988 when she was 25 , Polanski agreed to pay her $ 500,000 , but it is unclear if she ever received the money .
The papers filed on behalf of Ms Geimer , who lives in Hawaii , ask judges at California 's 2nd District Court of Appeal to rule on a previous motion to dismiss the charges against Polanski .
Claiming that Polanski had been forced to flee by a " corrupt " judge , they state : " No matter what his crime , Polanski was entitled to be treated fairly ; he was not . "
They also complain that Ms Geimer is being stalked by journalists from news outlets and talk show producers , and that she and her lawyer had received nearly 500 telephone calls in a month .
" Larry King has called , Oprah has called , every national network morning show has called .
The LA Times has three reporters calling , as do nearly every major newspaper in the United States and abroad .
The response - ' Please leave me alone . '
But they wo n't . "
" The pursuit has caused her to have health - related issues , " the court papers add .
" The pursuit has caused her performance at her job to be interfered with and has caused the understandable displeasure of her employer and the real possibility that Samantha could lose her job . "
The filing ends with the request : " Leave her alone . "

Why Good Programmers Are Lazy and Dumb
I realized that , paradoxically enough , good programmers need to be both lazy and dumb .
Lazy , because only lazy programmers will want to write the kind of tools that might replace them in the end .
Lazy , because only a lazy programmer will avoid writing monotonous , repetitive code – thus avoiding redundancy , the enemy of software maintenance and flexible refactoring .
Mostly , the tools and processes that come out of this endeavor fired by laziness will speed up the production .
This makes a lazy programmer a good programmer .
Of course , this is only half the truth ; for a lazy programmer to be a good programmer , he ( or she ) also must be incredibly unlazy when it comes to learning how to stay lazy – that is , which software tools make his work easier , which approaches avoid redundancy , and how he can make his work be maintained and refactored easily .
( By the way , the word “ unlazy ” has 14,400 hits in Google ; I ’m sure this makes it legal . )
Second ( and I will elaborate a bit more on this because I find the concept to be less known than the first ) a good programmer must be dumb .
Why ?
Because if he ’s smart , and he knows he is smart , he will :
a ) stop learning
b ) stop being critical towards his own work
Point a ) will make it hard for him to try to find new techniques to allow him to work faster .
Point b ) will give him a hard time debugging his own work , and refactoring it .
In the endless battle between a programmer and the compiler , it ’s best for the programmer to give up early and admit that it ’s always him and never the compiler who ’s at fault ( unless it ’s about character encoding issues , which is the part even the compiler gets wrong ) .
But there ’s a more crucial point why a good programmer must be dumb .
That ’s because for him to find the best solutions to problems , he must keep a fresh mindset and manage to think out of the box ( or rather , know its actual shape ) .
In a way , this leads to the mindset of a child ; incredibly creative because he never heard “ no " for an answer .
The direct opposite approach would not be very constructive ; to be knowledgeable about the parameters at hand , and accept them .
Because who knows how many limits you think are there are for real ?
The less you know , the more radical will your approaches be ; the better the tools you develop , and the better the product you develop with them .
I know from my work that a good programmer , when confronted with a problem from management , will adopt this mindset of being dumb ; he will start asking the most simple , child - like questions .
Because he does n’t accept the parameters suggested to him that someone thinks make up the problem .
Here ’s a typical conversation from the lost land of web development :
“ Since yesterday , our client ca n’t see the logo on the web site . ”
“ Did he restart his browser ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Did he restart his computer ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Did he empty his cache ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Does he run Internet Explorer 6 ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Is he sure he ca n’t see it ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Did he look at the web site on the screen ? ”
“ What ? ”
“ Well , he might have printed it out . ”
“ No , he was looking on it on the screen . ”
“ Did he also not see other images besides the logo ? ”
“ What ?
Well , I will ask him . ”
For the sake of argument ( and this was entirely hypothetical ) let ’s say the client indeed turned off images in his browser .
Or his son did .
Whatever the case , this answer could not have been found if you would work in “ smart ” mode * .
None of the questions asked by the programmer required any programming skills .
No ; simply because the problem is so stupid , only stupidity can tackle it .
In similar fashion , when one of my co-programmers asks me : “ Why is n’t this working ? ” most of the time it ’s because they ’re working on the wrong file ( e.g. , they linked to library 1 but they ’ve altered library 2 , and their revision is n’t showing , or they simply did n’t link the library at all ) .
When you ask a colleague for help , particularly in programming , you want him to know less about your project ... so he will ask the stupid questions you sub-consciously avoided asking yourself because you thought you knew the answer , when in fact you did n’t .
There ’s another side to it .
The too - stupid person will just run off and , without a second thought , do something wrong .
The too - smart person will sit down and plan something right , without taking any action .
A pragmatic programmer is sort of in - between ; he knows making the wrong decision 1 out of 10 times does n’t hurt the goal as bad as making only right decisions 5 out of 10 times , and making no decision at all the other 5 times .
It ’s like the story of the centipede .
The centipede was very good at walking with its hundred legs .
It never spent a thought on just how it could walk .
Until one day , when a big black bug asked the centipede “ How can you manage to walk with all those feet ?
Do n’t you find it hard to coordinate their rhythm ? ”
The black bug already left , when the centipede was still sitting down , pondering how it could walk , wondering , and ( for the first time in his life ) even worrying a little bit .
From that day on , the centipede could n’t walk anymore .
So you better not think too much if you want to achieve something .
And of course this is only half the truth , too ...

( CNN ) --
Her choppy blue - and - blond hair hiding the fear in her eyes , a 15 - year - old voiced her dislike for a hip - hop music group and got punched in the face by a classmate .
The whole thing was caught on tape and social media helped police in their investigation .
A crowd of six to 10 classmates were following the self - described emo girl and her boyfriend home from school in Newark , Ohio , on an autumn day in September .
Some kids were taping it and others were egging on the assailant , who was on the school wrestling team .
It all started because Alexis Xanders does n't like Insane Clown Posse .
One of the students who recorded the incident contacted Xanders on MySpace and sent her the video two months later .
The teen says she wanted something done , so she uploaded the video to YouTube and CNN iReport last week .
While only six to 10 people witnessed the alleged assault , the video has received more than 1,000 views on CNN iReport to date .
A local newspaper reporter saw the video and alerted the local police department , says Newark Police Sgt. Scott Snow .
A police report was filed on September 24 , and authorities are now investigating the other kids in the video who were goading the suspect .
The 15 - year - old suspect , who CNN is not naming because she is a minor , was charged as a juvenile Tuesday with individual counts of assault , menacing and unlawful restraint , Licking County Prosecutor Ken Oswalt said .
He also confirmed they are looking into charging other people from the video for inciting the fight .
The same day as the bullying incident , Chicago , Illinois , honors student Derrion Albert was beaten to death .
The incident was captured on video and shared online .
Three teens pleaded not guilty and were set to appear at a hearing on Wednesday .
These examples of bullying are not isolated incidents .
Cameras are very accessible these days and social networking has made it easy to post videos for anyone to see .
Dr. Patricia Walton Agatston , a counselor with the Cobb Prevention / Intervention Center in Marietta , Georgia , is co-author of " Cyber Bullying : Bullying in the Digital Age . "
She says posting videos online allows for bullies to be more visible to authorities .
Nancy Willard , director of the Center for Safe and Responsible Internet Use , says tracking bullying arrests and charges that arise from videos posted online is no easy task .
" There 's no source of that kind of data .
Nobody 's in a position to track that , " she said .
When Xanders posted the video to CNN iReport , she wanted something to happen , but she did n't expect to see a detective at her door the next day .
" Someone did see it and sent it to a detective .
I did n't think anything would actually happen with all of this because it happens all the time , " the high school freshman told CNN .
The mother of the teen suspect could not be reached for comment on Wednesday .
Xanders says the suspect has n't liked her since fifth grade , when the harassment allegedly started .
" I do n't really know why .
She just never liked me , " she said .
" They would wait for me everyday after school .
... I did n't go to school the day before .
They were in a big huge group , waiting and stuff .
Once all of my friends were walking , we'd have five or six people , but that day it was only me and [ my boyfriend ] , she did something . "
Officer David Bardsley and the school principal held a peer mediation session between the two girls a couple of days before the assault .
The suspect said , " They were talking crap about me , " according to Bardsley .
But , after a 20 - minute conversation , the girls assured him everything had been smoothed over .
Whenever the school becomes aware of bullying , it gets Bardsley involved immediately .
He 's been the officer on the grounds of Newark High School for nine years .
He stands behind the peer mediation process at the school , which has 1,700 to 1,800 students enrolled .
" I would say that more than 90 percent would be an accurate success rate , " he said .
" Most of the kids say that when we rationalize with them , they realize that they 're being silly . "
Doug Ute , the superintendent of Newark City Schools , confirmed Wednesday that the suspect agreed not to attend the school 's homecoming celebrations .
Since charges were filed , the high school has barred her from participating on the school wrestling team .
The suspect is no longer a student , as she withdrew from the school , Ute said .
" Anytime there 's bullying or harassment , it 's an unfortunate incident and we discourage that type of behavior with our students , " he said .
Xanders , who dyes her hair frequently and rocks out to alternative and scream - o music , uploaded the video to iReport and says she told her parents about it afterward .
Tanya Xanders , her mother , said she did n't mind , especially if the video might help bring attention to bullying .
In the video , Xanders did not push back or return a punch .
" She 's not a fighter ... that 's what she 's all about , " her father , Chad Bartlett , told CNN .
Xanders says that while she stood back from fighting , she 'd tell other kids who are being bullied to fight back in another way .
" Tell somebody and do something about it , " she said .
" Do n't just sit there and take it .
You can use your words and not your hands . "

The SEC sure has a sense of humor .
With everyone screaming for the agency 's blood unless it does something to curb rampant and blatantly speculative high frequency trading , as well as to tighten insider trading regulation , what does the Mary Schapiro - lead circus do ?
Just the opposite .
And even as the commission is weeping that its $ 1 billion budget is woefully inadequate , the agency decides to reduce its own projected revenue in the form of Section 31 fees , to benefit the High Frequency Scalping brigade .
The schizophrenic , sociopathic , deranged lunatics have certainly taken over the asylum at 100 F Street , NW Washington .
Zero Hedge has written previously about Section 31 .
We also , prophetically , pointed out , that the SEC is massively conflicted on the topic of HFT as the paradigm generates revenues for the agency .
We , however , did not realize just how conflicted Mary Schapiro is , and just how pervasive the HFT lobby power is : in order to make the lives of High Frequency Traders easier ( and their lobby ever wealthier ) , the SEC is willing to axe one of its own revenue streams .
All this is happening even as the SEC is bleating daily that its catastrophic corruption and incompetence can be easily fixed by just one or two $ 100 million budget boosts .
And with the US taxapayer raped daily by the administration , certainly not an ounce of KY will be needed to fill the ... budget shortfall from making the P&Ls of HFTs even more artificially propped up .
Yes , we are not making this shit up .
Read the following SEC press release and weep :
Effective Jan. 15 , 2010 , the Section 31 fee rate applicable to securities transactions on the exchanges and over - the - counter markets will decrease to $ 12.70 per million dollars .
Until that date , the current rate of $ 25.70 per million dollars will remain in effect .
The Section 31 assessment on security futures transactions will remain unchanged at $ 0.0042 per round turn transaction .
The Office of Interpretation and Guidance in the Commission 's Division of Trading and Markets is available for questions regarding Section 31 and may be reached at ( 202 ) 551-5777 or by e-mail at tradingandmarkets@sec.gov .
So much for inflation :
Under the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act , the Commission is required to adjust the filing and securities transaction fee rates on an annual basis to levels the SEC estimates will generate collections equal to numeric targets set in the statute .
A copy of the Commission 's April 30 , 2009 , order regarding fee rates under Section 6 ( b ) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 13 ( e ) , 14 ( g ) , and 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for fiscal year 2010 is available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2009/33-9030.pdf.
And here is the piece de resistance that proves that the SEC is convinced only illiterate apes who have access to a busted abacus fetish read its press releases :
The adjusted fee rates will not affect the amount of funding available to the Commission .
The Commission will announce the new fee rates for fiscal year 2011 no later than April 30 , 2010 .
These fee rates will become effective Oct. 1 , 2010 , or after the Commission 's fiscal year 2011 appropriation is enacted , whichever is later .
We are certain that the GETCO et als of the HFScalping world have sent numerous " To Cash " checks and Christmas cards expressing their gratitude to the tradingandmarkets@sec.gov address .
We urge all our readers to do the same .
After all , the ponzi casino has to be kept up one way or another , lest everyone realize just how hollow the US stock market truly is .
And since bullshit rarely travels alone , why should the SEC 's public excretions , er , relations , machine be any exception .
The other SEC press release that caught our eye is simply a stunner .
It appears that the SEC is planning to gradually repeal Reg FD .
Long live insider trading .
They caught Raj Raj ( and SAC is allegedly going down next ) - so their quota for the next 20,000 years is now fulfilled .
If you feel like blowing chunks at your monitor , please read the following insanity :
Washington , D.C. , Dec. 22 , 2009 —
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has proposed amendments to Rule 163 under the Securities Act to further facilitate the ability of certain large companies to communicate with broader groups of potential investors and gauge the level of interest in the market for their securities offerings .
In other words , Reg FD can be circumvented in order to make sure that the 18,274th in a row follow - on offering for DDR or Kimco will go through without a glitch , 1E ^ 1,000,000,000 dilution be damned .
The proposed amendments would apply to companies that are " well - known seasoned issuers " ( WKSIs ) and would allow them to authorize an underwriter or dealer to communicate with potential investors on their behalf about potential securities offerings prior to filing registration statements for such offerings .
Under the current Rule 163 , only WKSIs are permitted to communicate directly with potential investors before filing a registration statement .
A WKSI is an issuer that is current and timely in its Exchange
Act reports for at least one year and has either $ 700 million of publicly - held shares or has issued $ 1 billion of non-convertible securities , other than common equity , in registered offerings for cash in the preceding three years .

Renewable technology that uses energy stored in the ground to heat buildings and provide hot water could be installed in hundreds of thousands of homes and offices by the end of the next decade , a report said today .
About 8,000 ground - source heat pump systems were operating in the UK – far fewer than in other European countries , such as Sweden , although the market was expanding rapidly and doubled last year , the Environment Agency report said .
The document concluded that the technology could be installed in 320,000 homes and businesses by 2020 with support from the government .
If enough support was given through the renewable heat incentive , which will be introduced in 2012 and pay homeowners and businesses a guaranteed price for generating renewable heat , more than 1 m ground - source heat pumps systems could be put in place .
At the top end of its potential , ground - source heat technology could be installed in more than one in 10 homes and in 40 % of commercial buildings , the report said .
Even if growth was limited to 320,000 homes and business – 1 % of households and 11 % of commercial buildings – it could provide 30 % of the renewable heat the UK needed to produce to meet its 2020 target .
" Ground - source heating is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to produce at least 30 % of the country 's renewable heat needs – but it needs financial support in order to grow , " Tony Grayling , the head of climate change and sustainable development at the Environment Agency , said .
" We would like to see this technology given adequate financial support through the new renewable heat incentive to meet its full potential in the UK . "

Acer 's Liquid A1 probably fits the bill .
Sure , it 's another in a long line of slate - style phones with Android , but the quirky ( if chunky ) design and zippy Snapdragon processor are certainly worth paying attention to .
The best part ?
It 's shipping now in the UK , with a price hovering in the £ 330 range ( about $ 540 US ) .
If someone manages to shoehorn Android 2.0 onto this thing we might start talking serious , but for now it 's probably a stretch for a bit of EDGE - only ( or 3G if you win the tri-band lottery and us AT&T ) import action in the US .

Once again , the spotlight is on Saudi Arabia for all the wrong reasons .
This time , the kingdom is attracting criticism for condemning a self - styled psychic to death on the vague charge of " witchcraft " .
Ali Sibat , who is Lebanese , was arrested by Saudi Arabia 's notorious moral police at his hotel room in Medina on May 7 last year , while in town for a pilgrimage .
After languishing in jail for a year and a half , he was sentenced to death in November for reportedly practising witchcraft .
His lawyer has said Sibat was told that if he confessed to witchcraft , he would be released and allowed to return home .
Sibat was known for his appearances on a Lebanese satellite television station , where he offered callers advice and predictions about the future .
Human rights organisations and media reports allege that these TV appearances were the only evidence used to condemn Sibat to death .
This is a point worth emphasising : Sibat did n't kill , torture , terrorise or kidnap anyone , or commit any crime that put anybody else 's life at risk .
He told the superstitious whether they would find happiness or have children , and as a result , he has been condemned to death .
Such an extraordinarily harsh sentence highlights the kingdom 's ferocious and disturbing thirst for executions ( in some cases even having the decapitated heads sewn back on for the public to gawp at ) .
Saudi Arabia put to death 102 individuals in 2008 , the third - highest rate in the world .
Saudi Arabia continues to favour capital punishment even as the international community increasingly turns its back on the practice .
In December 2008 , the UN general assembly overwhelmingly voted to adopt a second resolution calling for a moratorium on use of the death penalty , with a view to eventual complete abolition .
Today , 138 states have either abolished or imposed a moratorium on the death penalty , and that number is expected to grow .
What 's particularly horrifying is the way in which Saudi Arabia decides whom to march off to be executed .
According to Amnesty International , prisoners there are often sentenced in unfair and secret trials .
Defendants , especially if they are migrant workers from outside the Arab world , are often not provided with defence lawyers or interpreters .
Investigations have also shown that foreign prisoners , their families and embassies are not properly informed about their sentencing .
Moreover , Saudi Arabia has executed , and continues to execute children or individuals who committed crimes while under the age of 18 , in flagrant disregard for the convention on the rights of the child to which Riyadh is a signatory .
Astonishingly , Saudi Arabia also has no written penal code , meaning that those who live in or visit the kingdom have no way of knowing whether or not their actions constitute criminal activity .
Accordingly , judges have the power to determine what behaviour is unlawful and to bestow on prisoners any punishment they see fit , including the death penalty .
Since word of Sibat 's sentencing emerged , newspapers in the Middle East have been running photographs of his family .
One photo is particularly poignant : Sibat 's young daughter sits at home in rural Lebanon , smiling innocently next to a framed picture of her father .
She probably has no idea what the Saudi " justice " system has in store for him .
Ali Sibat 's death sentence makes a mockery of Saudi Arabia 's judiciary and underscores the need for a worldwide halt to capital punishment .
No state should deprive a person of their right to life , especially for something as nebulous as witchcraft .
The Lebanese government , which itself has introduced a moratorium on capital punishment , should stand up to Riyadh and demand that Sibat 's senseless sentence be overturned .

Washington ( CNN ) --
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled her willingness Thursday to consider a health care bill that lacks a government - run public health insurance option .
Pelosi has previously insisted the public option was necessary for House approval of a health care bill .
Last month , the House passed its version of the sweeping health care measure that includes the public option .
However , Senate Democrats agreed this week on a tentative deal to drop the public option from their health care bill in order to ensure the measure can pass the chamber .
Under a proposed alternative , the Senate bill would permit private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage overseen by the government and expand the Medicare program for senior citizens to allow people as young as 55 to buy in .
Pelosi , D - California , at her weekly news conference said she wants to get the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Senate alternative before judging it , but she opened the door to a final bill without the public option .
" We in the House believe that the public option is the best way to keep insurance companies honest and also to increase competition , " Pelosi said , adding : " If you have a better way , put it on the table . "
With President Obama supporting the Senate alternative , Pelosi 's openness to consider it represents a potential major step toward eventual passage of a health care bill by Congress .
If the Senate eventually passes a health care bill , it would be merged with the House version by a conference committee .
Both chambers would have to approve the final bill before it could be sent to Obama to be signed into law .
The House and Senate bills are " probably 75 percent compatible , " Pelosi said , adding that a final merged bill could win approval from both chambers before Christmas if the Senate completes its work by the end of next week and a conference committee can meet over the weekend of December 19 - 20 .
Liberal Democrats call the public option the only way to truly reform the health care system by ensuring people have access to affordable coverage and providing low - cost competition to private insurers .
Republicans and some moderate Democrats consider the public option an unnecessary federal intrusion in health care that could lead to an eventual government takeover of the system .
The House narrowly passed its health care bill last month , and the Senate is in the second week of debate on its version .
Senate Democrats need all 60 votes in their caucus to overcome a Republican filibuster to pass the bill , and some senators in the Democratic caucus have rejected the public option .
Democratic sources said the Senate deal reached Tuesday night includes proposals to replace the public option by creating a not - for - profit private insurance option overseen by the Office of Personnel Management , much like the current health plan for federal workers , along with the Medicare expansion .
A Democratic source with knowledge of the deal said the alternative also includes a " trigger " mechanism that would create a public option in the future if the nonprofit private alternatives fail to effectively expand coverage and bring down costs .
However , the source said the trigger provision was tentative for now , based on whether moderates opposed to a public option would accept it .
Pelosi said she had yet to see details of the Senate plan .
She listed essential elements for passing a health care bill , including making coverage more affordable for middle - class Americans , sustaining the solvency of the Medicare program for senior citizens while eliminating a gap in their prescription drug coverage , no deficit increase and holding insurance companies accountable .
" What I have said , as I 've always said to my members , give the Senate room , " Pelosi said , adding , " We will know a great deal more when the paper comes back from the Congressional Budget Office .
But seeing their bill and our bill , I know one thing for sure -- we 'll have a great bill when we put them together . "
In particular , the idea of expanding Medicare to those 55 and older was appealing , Pelosi told reporters after the briefing .
Obama said Wednesday that the Senate agreement created " a new framework that I believe will help pave the way for final passage " of what he called historic health care reform legislation .
" I support this effort , especially since it 's aimed at increasing choice and competition and lowering cost , " Obama said .
However , the American Medical Association and American Hospital Association both said on Wednesday they oppose the Medicare expansion provision in the Senate package .
" We are extremely concerned about the approach because it removes people from the private sector and puts them in government care , which is chronically underfunded , " said Alicia Mitchell , a spokeswoman for the hospital association .
In addition , two moderate Democratic senators who took part in the talks said the package must first be analyzed by the CBO before anyone can claim a final agreement .
" There is not specific compromise .
Those were discussions , " Sen .
Mary Landrieu , D- Louisiana , told reporters .
Some liberals also had reservations .
Sen .
Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , one of 10 Democratic senators involved in talks on the deal , said he had concerns about the lack of a public option to ensure affordable coverage for those younger than 55 and therefore ineligible for the Medicare expansion .
Two senators who oppose a public option , moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine and independent Sen .
Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , said they were open to the nonprofit private alternative in the deal .
" It can be an innovative approach , " said Snowe , considered perhaps the lone GOP senator who might support the health care bill .
" I just would need to understand more about how it would work . "
Lieberman , a member of the Democratic caucus who has said he would join a Republican filibuster if the health care bill contained a public option , called the alternative " an idea worth considering , so long as it remains private insurance companies that would be essentially regulated by OPM . "
However , Lieberman and Snowe expressed concern over the idea of allowing Americans 55 or older to buy into Medicare .
" I want to make sure we 're not adding a big additional burden to the Medicare program , which we need to figure out how to save , because it 's going bankrupt , " Lieberman said .
CNN 's Dana Bash contributed to this report .
THE NSW Government has warned principals about a Church of Scientology attempt to infiltrate primary schools with propaganda videos and booklets aimed at Year 6 students .
The Sunday Telegraph has learned an organisation called Youth for Human Rights , which is sponsored by the controversial group , sent an educational DVD about human rights to schools last month .
Titled Youth for Human Rights - 30 Rights , 30 Ads , it is a series of public service announcements concerning each article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
But the misleading cover letter does not acknowledge the relationship between the organisation and the church .
The sole indicator that the DVD is linked to the Church of Scientology is an L. Ron Hubbard quotation printed on the back of the DVD cover that reads : " Human rights must be made a fact , not an idealistic dream - L. Ron Hubbard . ''
Inside the DVD case is an educational booklet offering quotes from " famous human rights leaders ' ' .
Hubbard heads the list , ahead of Gandhi and Martin Luther King .
Education Minister Verity Firth has warned all NSW primary schools about the DVD .
Principals have been advised in a message not to distribute " the DVD and / or booklet as a marketing exercise for Year 6 students ' ' as the Church of Scientology is not approved to conduct any activities in NSW public schools .
" It 's not appropriate for the Church of Scientology to distribute materials , '' Ms Firth said .
One primary - school principal , who did not want to be named , was outraged the group was exploiting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to promote Scientology .
" I find it very worrying that they are not identifying themselves , or the funding behind the distribution of these DVDs , '' the principal said .
Independent senator Nick Xenophon is pushing for a federal inquiry into the Church of Scientology after last week accusing it under parliamentary privilege of extortion , forced abortion , torture , perjury and financial coercion .
The organisation has denied these allegations , which Senator Bolkus said were based on evidence from former members .
Scientology spokesman Cyrus Brooks said Youth for Human Rights was sponsored by the organisation , but the DVDs were not intended to lure new members .
" There 's no subliminal message ; we believe educating children on their rights is for the greater good .
" If you all of a sudden want to become a Scientologist by watching the DVD , that 's good , but many members of Youth for Human Rights are n't Scientologists themselves , and I 'm fine with that , '' he said .
Mr Brooks said the group usually declared its relationship with organisations , but in this case Youth for Human Rights had requested that the acknowledgement be left out .
" The point is n't to advertise the church ; that might distract from the message , '' he said .
Anti-Scientology activist John Lurincich said the Government should do more to monitor information distributed to schools .
" The Church of Scientology is famous for sucking people in with the human - rights line , '' he said .

[ It was either that title or " E- ring in the New Year " . ]
Here 's an unusual shot from the Cassini spacecraft : Saturn 's faint , diffuse E ring , seen almost edge - on :
I like this picture !
First , we 're used to seeing Saturn 's rings looking sharp and well - defined , but this ring is fuzzy .
It 's huge ; it does n't even start until well outside the main rings , about 130,000 km ( 78,000 miles ) above Saturn 's cloud tops , and is 300,000 km ( 180,000 miles ) across !
It 's thought that the ice particles in the ring are supplied by geysers from the moon Enceladus .
Second , we 're also used to seeing pictures of Saturn sitting in inky darkness .
Saturn , its rings , and most of its moons are very bright , far brighter than the background stars .
Exposing the images correctly for Saturn means the stars do n't show up , so the background is black ( though not always , as this nice shot of the Pleaides from Cassini attests ) .
But the E-ring is so faint that a longer exposure was needed , and then the fainter stars show up in multitudes .
This image was taken when Cassini was 2.5 million km ( 1.5 million miles ) from Saturn , which was far enough to fit in a good amount of the edge of the ring .
I really love all the images Cassini takes , but it 's the more unusual ones I really enjoy .
Here 's hoping we see lots more in 2010 !

Actor Macaulay Culkin is reportedly " the mystery dad of Michael Jackson 's son Blanket , " said David Willetts in The Sun. Culkin , who is " godfather to Jacko's other two children , " is " said to have donated sperm " to help the late King of Pop " create his 7 - year - old offspring — real name Prince Michael II — with an unknown surrogate " mother .
And Culkin " has told pals he will not comment in public out of loyalty to his late pal . "
Macaulay Culkin very well could be Blanket 's father , said Steve Gow in Metro Vancouver .
The Home Alone star had " a special relationship with the King of Pop " — he " even testified in the '90s in Jacko 's favor at that infamous molestation trial . "
If Culkin was willing to do that , who knows what else he did for his good " pal . "
" Really , this must stop , " said Andrew Belonsky in Gawker .
Blanket and his brother and sister have enough troubles without " the media circling like vultures , questioning from whence they came . "
Marlon Jackson this past weekend " said perhaps the most sensible thing any of the family has said since Jackson 's death : ' Those were Michael 's kids — regardless of where they came from . '

Union officials , power industry executives , regulators and some environmentalists have also expressed concern about the impact of the monument legislation , but few would speak publicly for fear of antagonizing one of California ’s most powerful politicians .

The debate over the monument encapsulates a rising tension between two goals held by environmental groups : preservation of wild lands and ambitious efforts to combat global warming .
Not only is the desert land some of the sunniest in the country , and thus suitable for large - scale power production , it is also some of the most scenic territory in the West .
The Mojave lands have sweeping vistas of an ancient landscape that is home to desert tortoises , bighorn sheep , fringe - toed lizards and other rare animals and plants .
As conflicts over building solar farms in the Mojave escalated earlier this year , Mrs. Feinstein trekked to the desert in April .
The senator ’s caravan , including the heads of two of the nation ’s largest utilities , top energy regulators and a group of environmentalists , bumped along a dirt track and pulled up to a wind - whipped tent .
Inside , executives with a Goldman Sachs - owned developer waited to make their case for building two multibillion - dollar solar power plants .
The presentation over , the entourage rolled on to the next solar project site to hear the developer ’s pitch .
Mrs. Feinstein gave the developers a hearing but was not moved by their arguments , according to five people present on the tour .
The senator seemed concerned about the visual effect of huge solar farms on Route 66 , the highway that runs through the Mojave , they said .
“ When we attended the onsite desert meeting with Senator Feinstein , it was clear she was very serious about this , ” said Gary Palo , vice president for development with Cogentrix Energy , a solar developer owned by Goldman Sachs .
“ It would make no sense for us politically or practically to go forward with those projects . ”

WASHINGTON  The Justice Department has concluded that the Obama administration can lawfully pay the community group Acorn for services provided under contracts signed before Congress banned the government from providing money to the group .
The department ’s conclusion , laid out in a recently disclosed five - page memorandum from David Barron , the acting assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel , adds a new wrinkle to a sharp political debate over the antipoverty group ’s activities and recent efforts to distance the government from it .
Since 1994 , Acorn , which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , has received about $ 53 million in federal aid , much of it grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for providing various services related to affordable housing .
But the group has become a prime target for conservative critics , and on Oct. 1 , President Obama signed into law a spending bill that included a provision that said no taxpayer money  including money authorized by previous legislation  could be “ provided to ” the group or its affiliates .
Lawyers who told thousands of individuals that they held proof of their illicit file - sharing , have made a surprise announcement .
ACS : Law , who help companies generate revenue from porn movie copyrights , say they are dropping many cases because litigation is neither viable nor beneficial to their clients .
UK law firm ACS : Law has made quite a name for itself in recent times .
Representing companies such as Germany ’s DigiProtect and their pornography business partners , ACS : Law has sent out many thousands of letters to individuals it claims have been sharing their clients ’ movies illegally online .
Their scheme has attracted much negative press , even provoking statements from Members of the House of Lords in the UK .
“ Of late , we have seen a proliferation of lawyers ’ letters , acting for the pornography industry , as the noble Lord , Lord Lucas , pointed out , often against innocent people asserting copyright claims and threatening court action , ” said Lord Clement - Jones recently .
Now there has been a surprising “ Christmas update ” from ACS : Law .
Referencing earlier legal threats they made to thousands of individuals in the UK ( you ’ve been caught file - sharing , we can prove it , and if you do n’t pay up we ’re taking you to court ) , the law firm has announced that it will drop many of its cases .
As Christmas approaches , here at ACS Law we have been working hard dealing with our file sharing projects .
We have been reviewing all cases which are currently open , and a good number of these cases have been dropped , where we do not either consider litigation to be a viable option or to be beneficial to our clients .
So , despite the “ forensic ” standard proof the company claims to hold on individuals , it appears that , as we ’ve said many times here on TorrentFreak , this scheme is all about money .
If individuals have no money to pay , ACS : Law can not get blood from a stone .
Furthermore , when trying to force others to pay up who may actually have the money , faced with holding a single IP address as evidence and absolutely no way of identifying a specific individual sitting at a keyboard and conducting or authorizing the actual infringement , they have little choice but to back down .
James Bench , who works with Being Threatened , a consumer group which offers resources to individuals who are targeted by ACS : Law , says that those accused are becoming increasingly empowered by the knowledge currently available .
“ Recently leaked documents exposed the inner workings of the process , dubbed by some ‘ speculative invoicing , ’ showing that claims are assigned a ‘ litigation rating ’ , ” he told TorrentFreak .
“ Factors affecting the rating tended not to be based on the evidence supporting the claim but on the appointment of legal representation , technical ‘ savvy ’ and the finances of the client – or lack thereof , ” he added .
So does this mean that ACS : Law will be backing down completely ?
Hardly .
The law firm says that following the court orders they obtained in November , more threatening ‘ pay up or else ’ letters will be sent out in January 2010 .
Anyone receiving a letter from ACS : Law should refrain from replying to the company until they have spoken to the support team at BeingThreatened.com , who will give completely free advice .
The United States has the highest number of students pursuing higher education on its land .
This is according to the 2009 Open Doors Report which is considered to be the most important and comprehensive on international students studying in various American Universities .
This clearly proves the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security with their Open Doors Policy which has maintained the borders yet attracted many to come to the United States .
This clearly proves the balance that is maintained between attracting visitors yet securing a stringent policy on its boundaries .
In addition , the partnership between the Immigration and Costumer Enforcement and the academic community has shown positive results with a substantial rise in the number of foreign students coming to the United States .
This is especially true for the last three years in a row .
Such significant rise has been experienced the first time after 1980 .
At present , there are more than 670,000 foreign students studying in the United States .
In 2003 , a web based Student and Exchange Visitor Information System ( SEVIS ) was started by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Through this system , all the records of the students , exchange visitors and other dependents are efficiently managed during their residence in the United States .
This has led to the correct numbering of students entering the country and thus , keeping a track of it at all times .
On the other hand , it also proves the standards of education offered in the United States to be at par with the rest of the world .
Thus , many students prefer to come and study here .
With this , the country is also one of the developed nations in the world offering state of the art facilities .
What more does one require ?
Marine researchers have found a pair of Imperial Japanese Navy submarines on the sea floor off Hawaii's Oahu Island – vessels so advanced for their day they would provide plenty of fodder for a fresh novel by Tom Clancy .
Known by their vessel numbers , the I - 14 was a 375 - foot submarine aircraft carrier – its crew capable of assembling and launching two float - plane bombers in roughly 20 minutes .
The other craft , the I - 201 , was an attack submarine , twice as fast as any in the US fleet and faster than subs in any other Navy during World War II .
" This is one of the most significant marine - heritage findings in recent years , " according to Hans Van Tilburg , a marine archaeologist who is the maritime - heritage coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's National Marine Sanctuaries in the Pacific .
The find was announced Thursday .
" These submarines are 60 - year - old time capsules offering first - hand insight into a military technology that was far ahead of its time , " he says .
The subs were so advanced , Mr. Van Tilburg continues , that had they appeared earlier in the war and in larger numbers , " the submarines had the potential to turn the tide of war . "
Among the approaches Japanese designers used : a rubbery coating on the outside of the hull and conning tower to absorb radar and reduce the likelihood that sonar aboard US destroyers or subs would pick up sounds from inside the Japanese vessels .
The aircraft - bearing subs were designed to bring the war to the US mainland and strategic choke points such as the Panama Canal by hiding offshore and releasing the single - engine bombers on what would be one - way missions .
The tactic Japanese war planners envisioned provided a chilling foretaste of tactics the US and Russian navies would use with their ballistic - missile submarines during and after the cold war .
Indeed , the I - 14's larger sibling , the I -400 class subs , could be considered the forerunners of today 's ballistic - missile " boomers . "
At 400 feet long , the I -400 subs were designed to travel 37,500 miles without refueling – enough range to cruise around the world 1 - 1 / 2 times between fill - ups and have enough fuel left for their three aircraft .
Intended targets for the subs ' bombers included Washington and New York .
None of these long - range missions were carried out .
The expedition was conducted using manned submersibles operated by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory , a cooperative venture between NOAA and the University of Hawaii .
Partial funding for the effort came from the National Geographic Society 's cable TV arm , the National Geographic Channel .
Today 's announcement comes four and a half years after the same submersible team spotted the remains of one of the largest subs , the I -401 off the Hawaiian Islands .
The I -401 , along with the I - 14 and I - 201 , were captured at war 's end and sailed to Hawaii , where US naval intelligence officers could plumb the ships ' secrets .
They are three of five advanced Japanese subs the US sailed to Pearl Harbor after the war .
All were scuttled to avoid having to share the information with the Pacific war 's late - comer and co-claimant to such prizes , the former Soviet Union .
For a US submarine officer of the day , the largest of these Japanese vessels were little short of awe inspiring .
" The giant submarine 's proliferation of compartments was hard to get used to , " wrote the late Thomas Paine , who at the time was a lieutenant in the US submarine service and was an officer on the I -400's prize crew as it sailed from occupied Japan to Pearl Harbor .
Along the way , the crew tweaked the galley to fit American taste buds and added other amenities .
Thus , Mr. Paine writes , his tale " may be historically significant when future underwater archaeologists diving on the I -400 in deep water off Hawaii wonder why her scuttlebutts [ water fountains ] were equipped with General Electric refrigerated fountains . "
" Why did her galley feature gourmet cooking equipment ( including an ice cream machine ) ? " he writes .
" Why deluxe porcelain plumbing fixtures in the heads ?
Why crude military electronics topside , while bunks below were wired for music from a deluxe jukebox with flashing colored lights ?
You have the explanation . "
Indeed , within the next week , the submersible team that discovered the I -401 , I - 14 , and I - 201 will be taking their craft for test dives ahead of a new undersea research season .
The team plans to use those dives to look for the I -400 , as well as the I -201 's sister ship , the I -203 .

Scientists use the “ molecular clock ” — an estimated rate of DNA mutation — to date key events such as migrations and the divergence of species .
But just how accurately the clock keeps time has long been debated .
A new study of living and ancient Antarctic penguins , like those on Ross Island at left , suggests that DNA mutates six times faster than predicted .
That could mean that some species — such as chimps and humans — could have split off from each other much more recently in time than previously thought .
The finding should help improve the dating of relatively recent events , including when people domesticated various crops and animals , and when major human migrations occurred .
To use the molecular clock , scientists estimate the rate of mutation in DNA , estimating that the mutations occur in a steady , clocklike manner .
For example , if a gene accumulates changes at a rate of five every 1 million years , 25 mutations in a genetic sequence would mean that the sequences had diverged 5 million years ago .
The technique has been used to estimate when humans separated from the other great apes , to estimate the arrival of people in the Americas , and to create evolutionary trees for many species .
Molecular clocks are usually calibrated by using the age of a known species from the fossil record .
But scientists disagree about the speed or rate at which mutations occur and under what circumstances the rate is influenced by natural selection or other factors .
To see just how accurate molecular dating is , David Lambert , an evolutionary biologist at Griffith University in Queensland , Australia , and colleagues looked at AdÃ©lie penguins .
These Antarctic birds may be the best species yet for building an accurate clock , the team argues , because scientists can study the genetic sequences of both living and ancient members of the species .
The penguins generally return each year to the same nesting ground ; thus , each rookery can have layers of bones dating far back in time .
Indeed , the birds have nested at some rookeries for 44,000 years .
“ You can take blood samples from the living penguins and then literally collect the bones of their ancestors ” in the ground below , says Lambert , because the penguins usually return to their natal colony to mate .
Other studies usually can only compare genes from organisms separated in time by millions of years .
Using modern blood and ancient bone samples , the researchers extracted the entire mitochondrial genome from 12 modern and eight ancient penguins , including two that were dated to 44,000 years ago using radiocarbon methods .
They then compared the mitochondrial DNA of the living penguins with the ancient ones to determine the number of mutations that had occurred .
Because they had radiocarbon dates for the ages of the ancient penguins , the scientists could accurately measure the bird ’s average mutation rate , ultimately calculating that its mitochondrial genome had evolved at a rate two - to - six times faster than previously estimated .
The team ’s findings , reported in this month ’s issue of Trends in Genetics , support similar results for faster clocks in mitochondrial sequences in cattle .
But in this new study , the researchers succeeded in calculating the rate of mutation within almost the entire mitochondrial genome , providing “ more conclusive evidence , ” for a rapidly ticking clock , says Dee Denver , an evolutionary biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis and one of the paper ’s co-authors .
They also focused on a region of the genome that is known to not be influenced by natural selection , they write in the paper .
Thus , they say that the resulting clock is not merely a reflection of penguin evolutionary history and can be applied to other species .
“ It ’s novel and groundbreaking work , ” says Mark Hauber , an evolutionary biologist at Hunter College in New York City , who was not affiliated with the study .
“ It ’s a significant discovery , ” adds Elizabeth Matisoo - Smith , a biological anthropologist at Otago School of Medical Sciences in Dunedin , New Zealand , who expects it will help resolve several discrepancies between genetic data and the archaeological record , such as the peopling of the Pacific Islands and the Americas .
However , the penguins ’ rapid clock “ should be confirmed on a wide diversity of species ” before being adopted as the new standard , says Robert Wayne , an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California , Los Angeles .

Shortly after 8 p.m. on May 4 , American B - 1 bombers began pounding the Afghan village of Granai in an effort to protect a group of Afghan soldiers who had come under fire .
When the airstrikes ended seven hours later , somewhere between 26 and 140 Afghan civilians were dead ( depending on whose figures you believe ) .
The casualties added fuel to an anguished debate about civilian deaths in wartime that has raged since the war in Afghanistan began -- and for hundreds of years before that .
Below , some questions and answers on the rules of war .
How many civilians are being killed in Afghanistan ?
The Brookings Institution concludes in its “ Afghanistan Index ” that more than 5,000 civilians have died in the war between 2006 and the first half of 2009 .
Nearly 2,000 of the deaths are attributed to pro-government forces , including the U.S. , other international forces and the Afghan army .
How do those numbers compare with other conflicts ?
Advertisement
Frankly , they ’re low .
In the same period in Iraq , for instance , more than 60,000 civilians were killed ( as a result of military actions by all the parties in the conflict ) , according to Brookings .
Certainly , the number of civilians who have died in Afghanistan is tiny compared with the number in previous conflicts the U.S. has been involved in .
Civilian deaths during the Vietnam War , for instance , were estimated to be in the millions , helped along by such atrocities as the massacre of between 300 and 500 villagers by U.S. soldiers in My Lai in 1968 , and by carpet bombings of the countryside that indiscriminately killed whoever was below .
In World War II , nearly 40 million noncombatants were killed , according to historian Niall Ferguson , thanks , among other things , to the mass starvation tactics adopted by the Germans on the Eastern Front , the devastating firebombing by the Allies of Japanese and German cities and the bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 .
World War I killed more than 6 million noncombatants , by most estimates , and about 50,000 civilians died in the Civil War , according to historian James McPherson .
Why so many fewer this time ?

War is different today .
Precision weapons -- smart bombs , Predator drones and the like -- make it possible both to identify targets and to hit them with more accuracy and less guesswork .
Also , military leaders , politicians , the media and the public are more sensitive to the issue , in part because the rules of war have evolved .
So we should be pleased by the lower civilian death toll ?
Not at all .
The killing of innocent noncombatants remains a serious problem not just morally but strategically as well .
The new U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , acknowledged as much after Granai , saying that reducing civilian casualties is “ essential to our credibility ” with the Afghan people and issuing new orders limiting the use of airstrikes .
Since then , however , more civilians have died .
But is n’t that what war is all about -- killing and maiming more of them than they can kill and maim of you ?
Advertisement
That ’s what was believed for most of man ’s existence .
From the beginning of history until the 17th century , armies were free -- ethically as well as legally -- to kill , wound or enslave as many members of an enemy ’s civilian population as they chose .
This was simply the nature of war .
Things began to change with the Thirty Years ’ War .
That conflict , which ended in 1648 , was so devastating to what is now Germany that European leaders finally began to consider whether war should be not between entire populations but between armies .
The shock and revulsion felt across the Continent caused the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius to start developing rules of engagement that included distinctions between combatants and noncombatants .
So we decided in 1648 that it was time to stop killing civilians , but 3 1/ 2 centuries later we ’re still blowing up women and children in Afghanistan .
What gives ?
It ’s not for lack of work on the part of “ just war ” theorists and proponents of international law .
The principle that acts of war must be directed toward legitimate military targets rather than noncombatants was articulated to one degree or another in the Hague Conventions in 1899 and 1907 , the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg and again in the Geneva Convention .
Advertisement
It was also a tenet of the Lieber Code , written in 1863 to govern the behavior of Union troops in the Civil War , that “ the unarmed citizen is to be spared ... as much as the exigencies of war will admit . ”
Still , as the brutal disregard for civilian life in World War I and World War II shows , we ’re a long way from full compliance .
You ’ve discussed the intentional targeting of civilians .
How about unintended casualties ?
Collateral damage -- injuries and death suffered by civilians as the consequence of a legitimate military operation -- is considered deeply regrettable but sometimes unavoidable .
Advertisement
Nevertheless , it is an established tenet of international law that damage to civilians must be “ proportionate . ”
That means that the benefit you would gain from hitting your legitimate military target has to be weighed against the anticipated cost in innocent lives and destroyed property .
Who says what ’s proportionate ?
The law is certainly vague , and military commanders are left an awful lot of leeway .
But consider how it works in Afghanistan .
In a grisly calculus known as the “ collateral damage estimate , ” U.S. military commanders and lawyers often work together in advance of a military strike , using very specific , Pentagon - imposed protocols to determine whether the good that will come of it outweighs the cost .
We do n’t know much about how it works , but in 2007 , Marc Garlasco , the Pentagon ’s former chief of high - value targeting , offered a glimpse when he told Salon magazine that in 2003 , “ the magic number was 30 . ”
That meant that if an attack was anticipated to kill more than 30 civilians , it needed the explicit approval of then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld or President George W. Bush .
If the expected civilian death toll was less than 30 , the strike could be OKd by the legal and military commanders on the ground .
Advertisement
Frankly , it ’s hard to see how armies can justify the deaths of any noncombatants at all .
Oh , but they do .
The most common justification is a utilitarian one : that the deaths of some civilians now will save more people in the long run .
That ’s how the U.S. justified bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
About 200,000 people died , most of them noncombatants , but ( the argument went ) the Japanese then surrendered unconditionally and an Allied invasion of the Japanese mainland , which would have cost even more lives , was avoided .
On the other hand , there are absolutists who argue that killing a civilian is morally indefensible even when the benefits clearly outweigh the costs .
When the established rules of war are violated , is anyone punished ?
Sometimes , especially in extreme cases .
Think of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda war crimes tribunals .
Or the court - martial of 2nd Lt. William Calley after My Lai .
Or the effort to prosecute the U.S. soldiers who killed 24 civilians in the Iraqi village of Haditha in 2005 .
Advertisement
But these cases are never easy .
Calley , in the end , served only three years of a life sentence , and most of the charges were dropped against the soldiers in the Haditha case .
So should we give up trying to inject morality into war ?
Former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara , who died earlier this month , wrote an Op - Ed article for The Times in 2003 in which he described spending the evening of March 9 , 1945 , with Gen.
Curtis LeMay in Guam when the lead crews of the 21st Bomber Command returned from a firebombing mission over Tokyo .
That night alone , the bombers incinerated about 83,000 Japanese civilians .
LeMay had no doubts about the raids he ’d ordered .
His position was that if you ’re going to fight , you should fight to win , and if you ’re going to use force , you should use overwhelming force .
“ All war is immoral , ” he told McNamara , “ and if you let that bother you , you ’re not a good soldier . ”

Looking back , long after that war ended and after his own unhappy experience in Vietnam , McNamara disagreed .
“ War may or may not be immoral , ” he wrote , “ but it should be fought within a clearly defined set of rules . ”

The term glurge was invented by a regular contributor to Snopes.com , a website dedicated to cataloging and often debunking urban legends .
Unfortunately , while the word glurge may be fictional , the phenomenon it describes is not .
Glurge is best described as the cloyingly sentimental stories , testimonials and object lessons frequently sent as email or chain letters .
Glurge can also be experienced at the end of religious services or motivational speeches , usually in the form of a ' true ' example of perseverance against seemingly impossible odds .
A glurge might involve someone who prays for the return of a contact lenses and finds an ant carrying it .
There is usually no malicious intent by the sender of glurge , but the messages may not be as inspirational as the sender had hoped .
Many examples of glurge tend to collapse under their own weight , as the writer adds one impossible circumstance upon another to drive home the moral of the story .
One such example of overwrought glurge concerns a novice mountain climber who loses a contact lens .
After asking God for a miraculous recovery of the lens , the mountain climber later discovers an ant carrying the contact lens on its back .
The utter implausibility of the story often negates the inspirational impact of glurge .
A glurge may be associated with religious experiences and figures .
Some examples of glurge are attributed to famous personalities , although their historical accuracy is often brought into question .
The actor John Wayne , for example , is said to have converted to Christianity after receiving a letter from an evangelist 's injured daughter .
Various political leaders are rumored to have excused themselves from official duties in order to witness for Jesus Christ .
While these stories may indeed be inspirational and image - building , they are rarely supported by official records .
This is not to suggest that all glurge is fictional or does not serve a valid purpose .
Some of the stories and historical factoids are indeed true and educational , although presented in a maudlin or sentimental writing style .
The senders of glurge may be responding to a chain letter - style request to forward the message to others .
Many examples of glurge have been circulating around the world for years , including alleged predictions by Nostradamus , as well as the plight of young cancer victims looking for new pen pals or greeting cards .
Most glurge stories are relatively harmless , if a bit over - the - top .
These messages rarely contain malicious attachments or solicit the recipients for money .
The real problem lies with allowing email acquaintances to forward unsolicited messages through a mass mailing .
Some senders may not screen the stories for appropriate content before forwarding , which could create a problem for certain recipients .
Unlike email spam , which is usually unsolicited , glurge is often forwarded through a chain of personal address lists , making the original sender virtually impossible to track down .
A number of websites can provide examples of glurge , along with the true facts behind the stories .
Many examples of glurge are well - written pieces of inspirational fiction , worthy of repeating as object lessons or motivational anecdotes .
It 's the blurring of truth and embellishment that can make glurge sound artificial and saccharine .
rsync is an open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer .
Installation
Install the package .
rsync must be installed on both the source and the destination machine .
Front-ends
Grsync — GTK front -end .
gutback — rsync wrapper written in Shell .
JotaSync — Java Swing GUI for rsync with integrated scheduler .
luckyBackup —
Qt front - end written in C ++.
Other tools using rsync are and AUR .
As cp/mv alternative
rsync can be used as an advanced alternative for the cp or mv command , especially for copying larger files :
$ rsync - P source destination
The - P option is the same as -- partial -- progress , which keeps partially transferred files and shows a progress bar during transfer .
You may want to use the -r / -- recursive option to recurse into directories .
Files can be copied locally as with cp , but the motivating purpose of rsync is to copy files remotely , i.e. between two different hosts .
Remote locations can be specified with a host - colon syntax :
$ rsync source host : destination
or
$ rsync host : source destination
Network file transfers use the SSH protocol by default and host can be a real hostname or a predefined profile / alias from .ssh / config .
Whether transferring files locally or remotely , rsync first creates a file - list containing information ( by default , it is the file size and last modification timestamp ) which will then be used to determine if a file needs to be constructed .
For each file to be constructed , a weak and strong checksum is found for all blocks such that each block is of length S bytes , non-overlapping , and has an offset which is divisible by S.
Using this information a large file can be constructed using rsync without having to transfer the entire file .
For a more detailed practical explanation and detailed mathematical explanation refer to how rsync works and the rsync algorithm , respectively .
To use sane defaults quickly , you could use some aliases :
function cpr ( ) { rsync -- archive -hh -- partial -- info=stats1 --info=progress2 -- modify - window=1 " $ @ " } function mvr ( ) { rsync -- archive - hh -- partial -- info=stats1 --info=progress2 --modify-window=1 -- remove - source - files " $ @ " }
Note :
The use of the term checksum is not interchangeable with the behavior of the -- checksum option .
The -- checksum option affects the file skip heuristic used prior to any file being transferred .
Independent of -- checksum , a checksum is always used for the block - based file construction which is how rynsc transfers a file .
Trailing slash caveat
Arch by default uses GNU cp ( part of GNU ) .
However , rsync follows the convention of BSD cp , which gives special treatment to source directories with a trailing slash " / " .
Although
$ rsync -r source destination
creates a directory " destination / source " with the contents of " source " , the command
$ rsync -r source / destination
copies all of the files in " source / " directly into " destination " , with no intervening subdirectory - just as if you had invoked it as
$ rsync -r source / .
destination
This behavior is different from that of GNU cp , which treats " source " and " source / " identically ( but not " source / . " ) .
Also , some shells automatically append the trailing slash when tab - completing directory names .
Because of these factors , there can be a tendency among new or occasional rsync users to forget about rsync 's different behavior , and inadvertently create a mess or even overwrite important files by leaving the trailing slash on the command line .
Thus it can be prudent to use a wrapper script to automatically remove trailing slashes before invoking rsync :
#!/bin/zsh new_args=( ) ; for i in " $@ " ; do case $ i in /) i= / ; ; */) i= $ {i%/} ; ; esac new_args +=$i ; done exec rsync " $ {( @ ) new_args} "
This script can be put somewhere in the path , and aliased to rsync in the shell init file .
As a backup utility
The rsync protocol can easily be used for backups , only transferring files that have changed since the last backup .
This section describes a very simple scheduled backup script using rsync , typically used for copying to removable media .
Automated backup
For the sake of this example , the script is created in the /etc / cron.daily directory , and will be run on a daily basis if a cron daemon is installed and properly configured .
Configuring and using cron is outside the scope of this article .
First , create a script containing the appropriate command options :
/etc/cron.daily / backup
#!/bin/bash rsync - a -- delete -- quiet / path/to/backup /location/of/backup
- a indicates that files should be archived , meaning that most of their characteristics are preserved ( but not ACLs , hard links or extended attributes such as capabilities ) -- delete means files deleted on the source are to be deleted on the backup as well
Here , / path / to / backup should be changed to what needs to be backed - up ( e.g. / home ) and / location / of / backup is where the backup should be saved ( e.g. / media / disk ) .
Finally , the script must be executable :
# chmod +x /etc/cron.daily / backup
Automated backup with SSH
If backing - up to a remote host using SSH , use this script instead :
/etc/cron.daily / backup
#!/bin/bash rsync - a -- delete -- quiet -e ssh / path / to/ backup remoteuser@remotehost:/location/of/backup
-e ssh tells rsync to use SSH remoteuser is the user on the host remotehost - a groups all these options - rlptgoD ( recursive , links , perms , times , group , owner , devices )
Note : Rsync will try to modify any previously backed up files on the target machine to match their current state at the source machine , with each incremental backup .
This means that when backing up files that are owned by root over SSH ( and when preserving permissions and ownerships such as with the - a option ) , root access to the target machine is needed .
The preferred way to achieve this for automation is to set up the SSH daemon to allow root to login using a Rsync will try to modify any previously backed up files on the target machine to match their current state at the source machine , with each incremental backup .
This means that when backing up files that are owned by root over SSH ( and when preserving permissions and ownerships such as with theoption ) , root access to the target machine is needed .
The preferred way to achieve this for automation is to set up the SSH daemon to allow root to login using a public key without password and run the rsync command as root .
Automated backup with NetworkManager
This script starts a backup when network connection is established .
First , create a script containing the appropriate command options :
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/backup
#!/bin/bash if [ x " $ 2 " = " xup " ] ; then rsync -- force -- ignore - errors - a -- delete --bwlimit=2000 --files-from=files.rsync /path/to/backup /location/to/backup fi
- a group all this options - rlptgoD recursive , links , perms , times , group , owner , devices -- files - from read the relative path of / path / to / backup from this file -- bwlimit limit I/O bandwidth ; KBytes per second
The script must be owned by root ( see NetworkManager # Network services with NetworkManager dispatcher for details ) .
Automated backup with systemd and inotify
Note : Due to the limitations of inotify and systemd ( see this question and answer ) , recursive filesystem monitoring is not possible .
Although you can watch a directory and its contents , it will not recurse into subdirectories and watch the contents of them ; you must explicitly specify every directory to watch , even if that directory is a child of an already watched directory .
This setup is based on a systemd / User instance .
Instead of running time interval backups with time based schedules , such as those implemented in cron , it is possible to run a backup every time one of the files you are backing up changes .
systemd .
path units use inotify to monitor the filesystem , and can be used in conjunction with systemd .
service files to start any process ( in this case your rsync backup ) based on a filesystem event .
First , create the systemd .
path file that will monitor the files you are backing up :
~/.config/systemd/user/backup.path
[ Unit ] Description =Checks if paths that are currently being backed up have changed [ Path ] PathChanged=%h/ documents PathChanged=%h/ music [ Install ] WantedBy=default.target
Then create a systemd .
service file that will be activated when it detects a change .
By default a service file of the same name as the path unit ( in this case backup .
path ) will be activated , except with the . service extension instead of . path ( in this case backup. service ) .
Note :
If you need to run multiple rsync commands , use Type=oneshot .
This allows you to specify multiple ExecStart= parameters , one for each
If you need to run multiple rsync commands , use .
This allows you to specify multipleparameters , one for each rsync command , that will be executed .
Alternatively , you can simply write a script to perform all of your backups , just like cron scripts .
~/.config/systemd/user/backup.service
[ Unit ] Description =Backs up files [ Service ] ExecStart=/usr / bin/rsync %h/./documents %h/./music -CERrltm -- delete ubuntu :
Now all you have to do is start / enable backup .
path like a normal systemd service and it will start monitoring file changes and automatically start backup .
service .
Differential backup on a week
This is a useful option of rsync , resulting in a full backup ( on each run ) and keeping a differential backup copy of changed files only in a separate directory for each day of a week .
First , create a script containing the appropriate command options :
/etc/cron.daily / backup
#!/bin/bash DAY =$ ( date + %A ) if [ -e /location / to / backup/incr/$DAY ] ; then rm - fr /location / to / backup / incr / $DAY fi rsync - a -- delete -- quiet -- inplace -- backup -- backup-dir=/location/to/backup/incr/$DAY
/ path/to/backup/ /location/to/backup/full/
-- inplace implies -- partial update destination files in - place
Snapshot backup
The same idea can be used to maintain a tree of snapshots of your files .
In other words , a directory with date - ordered copies of the files .
The copies are made using hardlinks , which means that only files that did change will occupy space .
Generally speaking , this is the idea behind Apple 's TimeMachine .
This basic script is easy to implement and creates quick incremental snapshots using the -- link - dest option to hardlink unchanged files :
/usr/local/bin/snapbackup.sh
#!/bin/bash # Basic snapshot - style rsync backup script # Config OPT= " - aPh " LINK= " -- link-dest=/snapshots/username/last / " SRC= " /home/username/files / "
SNAP= " /snapshots/username / " LAST=" /snapshots/username/last " date=`date " +%Y -%b-%d:_%T" ` # Run rsync to create snapshot rsync $ OPT $ LINK $ SRC $ {SNAP}$ date # Remove symlink to previous snapshot rm -f $ LAST # Create new symlink to latest snapshot for the next backup to hardlink ln -s $ {SNAP}$date $ LAST
There must be a symlink to a full backup already in existence as a target for -- link - dest .
If the most recent snapshot is deleted , the symlink will need to be recreated to point to the most recent snapshot .
If -- link - dest does not find a working symlink , rsync will proceed to copy all source files instead of only the changes .
A more sophisticated version keeps an up - to - date full backup $ SNAP / latest and in case a certain number of files has changed since the last full backup , it creates a snapshot $ SNAP / $ DATETAG of the current full - backup utilizing cp - al to hardlink unchanged files :
/usr/local/bin/rsnapshot.sh

Full system backup
This section is about using rsync to transfer a copy of the entire / tree , excluding a few selected directories .
This approach is considered to be better than disk cloning with dd since it allows for a different size , partition table and filesystem to be used , and better than copying with cp - a as well , because it allows greater control over file permissions , attributes , Access Control Lists and extended attributes .
rsync will work even while the system is running , but files changed during the transfer may or may not be transferred , which can cause undefined behavior of some programs using the transferred files .
This approach works well for migrating an existing installation to a new hard drive or SSD .
Run the following command as root to make sure that rsync can access all system files and preserve the ownership :
# rsync - aAXHv -- exclude= { " / dev / * " , " / proc / * " , " / sys /* " , " / tmp /*" , " / run /* " , " / mnt/* " , " / media /* " , " / lost + found " } / / path/to/backup
By using the - aAX set of options , the files are transferred in archive mode which ensures that symbolic links , devices , permissions , ownerships , modification times , ACLs , and extended attributes are preserved , assuming that the target file system supports the feature .
The option - H preserves hard links , but uses more memory .
The -- exclude option causes files that match the given patterns to be excluded .
The directories / dev , / proc , /sys , /tmp , and /run are included in the above command , but the contents of those directories are excluded .
This is because they are populated on boot , but the directories themselves are not created .
/ lost + found is filesystem - specific .
The command above depends on brace expansion available in both the bash and zsh shells .
When using a different shell , -- exclude patterns should be repeated manually .
Quoting the exclude patterns will avoid expansion by the shell , which is necessary , for example , when backing up over SSH .
Ending the excluded paths with * ensures that the directories themselves are created if they do not already exist .
Note :
If you plan on backing up your system somewhere other than / mnt or / media , do not forget to add it to the list of exclude patterns to avoid an infinite loop .
or , do not forget to add it to the list of exclude patterns to avoid an infinite loop .
If there are any bind mounts in the system , they should be excluded as well so that the bind mounted contents is copied only once .
If you use a swap file , make sure to exclude it as well .
Consider if you want to backup the / home / directory .
If it contains your data it might be considerably larger than the system .
Otherwise consider excluding unimportant sub - directories such as /home/*/.thumbnails/* , /home/*/.cache/mozilla/* , /home/*/.cache/chromium/* , and /home/*/.local / share/Trash/* , depending on software installed on the system .

If Dhcpcd ≥ 9.0.0 is installed , exclude the / var / lib / dhcpcd / * directory as it mounts several system directories as sub- directories there .
You may want to include additional rsync options , or remove some , such as the following .
See for the full list .
If you run on a system with very low memory , consider removing - H option ; however , it should be no problem on most modern machines .
There can be many hard links on the file system depending on the software used ( e.g. if you are using Flatpak ) .
Many hard links reside under the /usr / directory .

You may want to add rsync's -- delete option if you are running this multiple times to the same backup directory .
In this case make sure that the source path does not end with /* , or this option will only have effect on the files inside the subdirectories of the source directory , but it will have no effect on the files residing directly inside the source directory .

The -- numeric - ids option will disable mapping of user and group names ; instead , numeric group and user IDs will be transfered .

To avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when recursing , add the option -x / -- one - file - system .
This will prevent backing up any mount point in the hierarchy .
Restore a backup
If you wish to restore a backup , use the same rsync command that was executed but with the source and destination reversed .
File system cloning
rsync provides a way to do a copy of all data in a file system while preserving as much information as possible , including the file system metadata .
It is a procedure of data cloning on a file system level where source and destination file systems do not need to be of the same type .
It can be used for backing up , file system migration or data recovery .
rsync 's archive mode comes close to being fit for the job , but it does not back up the special file system metadata such as access control lists , extended attributes or sparse file properties .
For successful cloning at the file system level , some additional options need to be provided :
rsync - qaHAXS SOURCE_DIR DESTINATION_DIR
And their meaning is ( from the manpage ) :
-- hard - links , - H preserve hard links -- acls , - A preserve ACLs ( implies -- perms ) -- xattrs , -X preserve extended attributes -- sparse , - S turn sequences of nulls into sparse blocks
Additionally , use -x if you have other filesystems mounted under the tree that you want to exclude from the copy .
Produced copy can be simply reread and checked ( for example after a data recovery attempt ) at the file system level with diff 's recursive option :
diff -r SOURCE_DIR DESTINATION_DIR
It is possible to do a successful file system migration by using rsync as described in this article and updating the fstab and bootloader as described in Migrate installation to new hardware .
This essentially provides a way to convert any root file system to another one .
rsync daemon
rsync can be run as daemon on a server listening on port 873 .
Edit the template / etc/rsyncd.conf , configure a share and start the rsyncd .

Note : As of 3.2.0 - 1 the package adopted the upstream systemd unit files rsyncd .

This makes the / boot / , /etc / and /usr / directories read - only .

Tom Hayes : For GOP Congress is now the opposite of Progress
Thomas Hayes is an entrepreneur , journalist , and political analyst who contributes regularly to a host of web sites on topics ranging from economics and politics to culture and community .
It would be laughable if it was n't such obvious partisan grand - standing .
The minority party wants to have their cake , and eat it , too .
After years ofexercising rock - solid legislative control with Congressional majorities they 're finding the rules are n't as fun when the other guys are in charge .
The GOP leadersthey want the President to , and , But along the way he'd better compromise with them .
The latest example comes from the stage of international relations .
The President 's supposed to represent indecision in Copenhagen , courtesy of the 7 GOP members of the Senate 's Environment and Public Works Committee .
These esteemed Senators have threatened a boycott of planned work sessions - get this - to delay the start of the committee debate .
We 're not even talking about a vote , they do n't even want to talk about the bill yet .
Progress is n't supposed to be the opposite of Congress , is it ?
Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , who chairs the committee , said , because she hopes Republicans will , She 's extending the deadline for Republicans to notify her of amendments they 're considering , and canceled the Tuesday session so Environmental Protection Agency staff could come appear before EPW to answer technical questions , even .
She 's bending over backwards to craft a bi-partisan bill and get a committee vote before the Copenhagen Climate talks .
But she does n't have to .
All the posturing about costs , and how acting too quickly will surely be a burden on business , are echoes of the tired , familiar litany that the GOP always recites whenever their lobbyists have n't blessed a bill .
Even if the 7
Republicans do n't show up the committee still has the necessary quorum to conduct business .
It only takes 10 votes to move the bill forward to the floor , and 12 of the 19 members are Democrats .
Obviously Senator Boxer and the administration know this simple math .
Evidently the decision has been to to compromise on some of the procedures , and possibly even policies , but to set an agenda that shows American values in the court of world opinion - yet the GOP chooses to play obstructive games while complaining that Obama does n't exhibit leadership in world affairs .
I know that sort of thing can be spun into indignant rants by extreme pundits selecting judicious sound - bites .
Yet , when Swedish Prime Minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , has called on China to set a tougher target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions after 2020 as its part of the international agreement to be negotiated in Copenhagen , should n't the U.S. Congress step back from the rhetoric and help set the stage for U.S. participation ?
The facts are stark ; the U.S. can lead in Copenhagen , or we can trail along behind petulantly like a spoiled brat .
If you ’re familiar with the electronics company Sharp – it may be because they produce you ’re television .
But little did you probably know , Sharp is also the largest manufacturer of mobile phones in Japan .
But they ’ve got plenty of competition , so to keep their edge over the likes of Panasonic , Mitsubishi , Kenwood , Toshiba , NEC , Denso , Pioneer , Sanyo , Kyocera , Hitachi , Casio , and others , Sharp will be launching an Android Phone in early 2010 .
While no specifics were included and no carrier promised , company executive Masami Ohbatake did say that NTT DoCoMo “ is expected to be first in line . ”
I do n’t see that as anything less than an endorsement with the option to back out if DoCoMo somehow self destructs .
Whether the Sharp Android Phone will make it to other Japanese carriers or better yet , other markets around the world , is yet to be determined .
We ’ll bring you news as this story develops , but to be blunt , Sharp will likely stick to Japan for Android Phone Round 1 .

* Will keep majority of discount stores open 24 hrs
* Will disperse crowds throughout its stores
SAN FRANCISCO , Nov 11 ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N plans to implement new crowd control efforts in its U.S. stores this Thanksgiving holiday weekend , after stampeding holiday shoppers trampled a worker to death last year .
Black Friday , or the day after Thanksgiving , typically marks the official launch of the U.S. holiday season , when retailers offer eye - popping deals and discounts to attract shoppers .
But last year , Jdimytai Damour , 34 , was knocked to the ground and trampled to death when frenzied shoppers broke down the doors and surged into a Long Island , New York Walmart discount store at 5 a.m. on Black Friday .
This year , the retailer will open most of its Walmart discount stores on Thanksgiving morning at 6 a.m. and keep those stores open through Friday evening .
Last year , those stores closed Thanksgiving evening and reopened early Friday morning , creating long lines of anxious shoppers waiting outside its stores .
“ ( Shoppers ) will be dispersed through a 200,000 square foot store as opposed to all being right by the front door , waiting to go in , ” said spokesman David Tovar .
Walmart supercenters , which combine a full grocery store and discount store , already stay open 24 hours a day .
Once inside , the retailer will allow customers to line up by displays of must - have merchandise throughout the store .
When those products go on sale Friday at 5 a.m. , workers will supervise the lines and distribute the merchandise .
It is an effort to end the scuffles that inevitably break out between shoppers who rush through stores Black Friday morning , hoping to grab limited supplies of cut - price flat panel televisions or laptop computers .

Michael Moore tweeted within the past hour , in response to yesterday 's shooting spree at Fort Hood :
After a shooting like this it's very important that no one jump to conclusions and take out any revenge against doctors or psychiatrists .
The wingnuts , of course , are out for blood following the shooting .
Predictably , they 're going after Muslims , under the presumption that the suspect , Army psychiatrist Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan was acting out of incitement from Islam .
If that turns out to be true --- and there 's no actual evidence to support that at this time , as far as I know --- I 'd agree that any person or persons who would incite such violence should be held accountable .
Just as those who'd incite similar violence --- for example , in the cases of the murder of Kansas obstetrician Dr. George Tiller or the hanging of Clay County , KY census worker Bill Sparkman --- should be held similarly accountable .
Yet , I heard few such calls from the Right after those incidents .
In the case of Tiller , his accused murderer Scott Roeder was regarded by the Right as either a hero or a lone , crazy guy ( depending on how far to the Right they happened to be ) .
I 've heard no condemnation from the Right , or calls for accountability for the constant , repeated , almost daily characterization of Tiller , to millions and millions of Americans over the air waves by folks like Bill O'Reilly ( the most watched man on cable news ) , as a " baby killer " , " executing babies " , " death merchant " , etc. , even though Tiller was a medical doctor performing lawful services .
I heard no wingnut condemnation of Bernie Goldberg --- and certainly not of Christianity as a whole --- even after it was revealed that his book , 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America ( And All Franken Is # 37 ) , was a major inspiration for Jim David Adkisson 's shooting spree at a Knoxville , TN Unitarian Church in July of 2008 which killed two and injured seven others ...
" This was a symbolic killing . , " Adkisson wrote in his manifesto [ PDF ] just before his murderous rampage .
" Who I wanted to kill was every Democrat in the Senate & House , the 100 people in Bernard Goldberg 's book .
... I could n't get to the generals & high ranking officers of the Marxist movement so I went after the foot soldiers , the chickenshit liberals that vote in these traitorous people .
Someone had to get the ball rolling .
I volunteered .
I hope others do the same . "
He went on to add : " It saddens me to think back on all the bad things that Liberalism has done to this country .
The worst problem America faces today is Liberalism .
...
Liberals are evil , they embrace the tenets of Karl Marx , they 're Marxist , socialist , communists .
...
I 'd like to encourage other like minded people to do what I 've done .
If life aint worth living anymore do n't just Kill yourself , do something for your country before you go .
Go Kill Liberals . "
Addkison was also a professed fan of O'Reilly , Ann Coulter , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Michael Savage and the rest of that crowd , yet I do n't recall any of them calling for either Fox " News " to be shut down , or for Christians to regarded as a terrorist group .

The entire episode of wingnut hypocrisy is the case of the Fort Hood shootings is , perhaps , most amusingly and sadly illustrated by this quick exchange from last night 's Larry King Live on CNN between former POW Shoshana Johnson ( captured along with Jessica Lynch ) and wingnut attorney and JAG officer Tom Kenniff ...
Wanna hold someone accountable ?
Fine .
I 'm all for it .
But make sure you hold everyone equally accountable .
And make sure it's for something they actually did , versus something you imagine they did , due to your own prejudices --- for example , hating Islam as much as you hate yourself .
ADDENDUM : In the wake of today 's shooting spree in Orlando , Media Matter 's Eric Boehlert tweets :
Funny , I do n't hear ANY media chatter about what religion the alleged Orlando shooter is .
... and then ...
Why wo n't Fox News confirm whether Orlando shooter is Christian ?
This year try practicing a mindful chocolate .
For many people , it is okay to eat chocolate rather than completely avoid it .
Not only would eliminating chocolate be no fun , but it also is n't realistic .
books want you to believe that you can eradicate chocolate and other treats from your life .
Instead , learn to eat candy and other foods you crave in a new mindful way .
Why does slowing down and eating candy mindfully help ?
For people who eat chocolate , they are often thinking about the next piece of candy before they even finish the one they are enjoying .
That is when they go for more .
You can eat an entire candy bar and not really taste one bite .
Eating chocolate mindfully is intended to help you to really get joy from it and to eat just enough to feel satisfied .
This is such a challenge .
Before you get started :
1 ) Practice mindfully eating chocolate before you have a craving , prior to Halloween and when you are in a good mood .
It 's like learning how to swim .
You do n't want to practice swimming during big waves .
Get the hang of it when things are calm .
2) Be mindful of how much candy you buy .
Buy only exactly what you need or a little less .
If you are afraid of running out , you are less likely to overeat it .
As we all know , more is not necessarily better .
The pleasure can quickly turn to displeasure when you eat too much chocolate .
3 ) Considering buying yourself an expensive piece of chocolate to eat mindfully and save the cheap version for kids ( or if you feel that kids will get more than enough candy , buy stickers or a cool pencil to drop in bags ) .
4 ) Timing is everything .
Buy trick - or - treat candy as close as you can to the date .
Having candy hanging around can be too difficult for people who crave chocolate .
5 ) Put the candy away .
Out of sight , out of mind ( for the most part ) .
The harder it is to get to the treats in the back of the closet or up on a high shelf , the better .
You are likely to make the effort to get it when you really want it .
Steps to Mindfully Eating Chocolate : Use one chocolate kiss or a mini candy bar .
1. Notice the weight of a piece of chocolate in your hand .
Look at it closely .
2. Observe the shape and color .
Use at least three words to describe it to yourself .
3 . As you unwrap it , listen closely to the crinkle of the foil or paper .
4 . Bring the chocolate up to your nose , and inhale deeply .
Notice what
thoughts come in your mind as you do this .
The smell of chocolate can bring up some powerful feelings and memories .
Deeply Inhale .
5 . Do any critical thoughts come up like , " I should n't eat this " ?
If so , let the thoughts come and go as if you are letting go of a balloon .
6 . Place the chocolate in your mouth .
Notice the flavor , richness , and
texture .
Pay to how the sensations change as it melts and molds to your mouth .
7 . Follow the sensations as the chocolate slips down your throat into your stomach .
This is how you can eat chocolate mindfully .
Again , it takes practice .
Notice how different this is from popping pieces of chocolate mindlessly into your mouth .
When you are less afraid of uncontrollably eating Halloween candy , you 'll be able to more fully enjoy the experience and eat just enough to join in the festivities without going overboard .

San Jose , California ( CNN ) --
One day , while uploading yet another text file to the Google Docs Web site , I started to wonder :
When I save this file online , where does it actually go ?
I store tons of information on the Internet instead of just on my laptop or work computer .
Often , I do this specifically so I can access information from both places , or from my mobile phone if I need it on - the - go .
Without realizing it , I 'd started cloud computing , that nebulous term that refers to the idea that computing power is moving off home PCs and laptops and onto the Web .
I keep thousands of photos on Flickr .
I 've also got them on Facebook and tucked away in five years of Gmail messages .
My videos are on 12seconds and YouTube ( including a really embarrassing one of me landing on my face during a college diving meet ) .
I 've blogged from Madagascar on Blogger ; my tech writing is on WordPress ; and I post random snippets of info on Tumblr and Twitter .
This is not just data .
It 's my life .
And I would be sick if I lost it .
Previous generations stored their family photos and important documents in safety deposit boxes or under the mattress .
Here it is 2009 , and I have no idea where my data lives .
I was curious and I wanted to find the scattered bits of my online life before dumping everything on my laptop onto the Web .
So I decided to go on a scavenger hunt into the cloud .
Secret ' data centers '
Before I started the search , when I thought about cloud computing , this is the image that came to mind : a giant cartoon cloud just slurped information off of my computer like magic .
My files just floated in the sky until I wanted them back .
The cloud does n't work like that .
It 's made up of a massive and growing network of data centers , which are huge warehouses full of computers .
They store and process information from all around the world , largely in secret .
Read about how the cloud is similar to electric utilities
I found it shocking that the gut of the cloud , an image I found so soft and quaint , was actually comprised of an enormous and ever - growing network of machines .
But apparently lots of people already knew this .
" All the clouds live in data centers , " Rich Miller , editor of a prominent cloud - computing blog called Data Center Knowledge , told me .
" There 's always hardware involved , and bricks and mortar .
...
It 's not a fluffy cloud .
It 's living in someone 's building . "
Awesome .
So all I needed to do to find my family photos and the rest of my data was to call up the data center where it lives and go there , right ?
Wrong .
I quickly learned tours of the cloud are n't easy to come by .
Amazon , which has turned into a major player in cloud computing , declined to give me a tour of one of its centers .
Adam Selipsky , vice president of Amazon Web Services , seemed to want to preserve the cloud 's aura .
" From a customer 's perspective , " he said , " it is a cloud , and it can be magic . "
Google , which has most of my sensitive data , like e-mail , calendars , to - do lists and documents , declined an interview request for this story .
A spokeswoman said the company does n't give tours either .
Go figure .
Dismayed , I started turning to companies who do n't have my data , just hoping to get a sense of how this system worked .
IBM offered to give me a tour , maybe because , like me , it 's trying to break into the cloud world .
A walk in the cloud
It seems like the last place you would go on a quest to find computer files would be a valley full of farms and cows .
But that 's where this search took me .
In the hills outside San Jose , California , across the street from a farm that sells pumpkins and corn this time of year , IBM runs a cloud - computing center that 's nearly the size of a football field .
It 's in a metal building that 's part of an office complex .
Inside , I found rows of black , refrigerator - sized computer towers , 4,000 of them in all .
They buzzed and whirred so loudly that I had to lean in to hear my tour guides .
In front of the towers , grates and pinholes in the floor pump out frigid air to keep the machines from overheating .
The computers breathe this air in and then exhale air as hot as a hair dryer's .
I 'm told the cooling bill here costs more than running the computers .
Read more about the cloud 's CO2 lining
Inside each computer rack , about a dozen individual machines , each shaped like a pizza box , are wired together .
Some process data .
Others store it .
Marty Yarnall , one of IBM 's data center advisers , said one of these flat computers , called " blades , " has the computing power of about 50 personal laptops .
In all , this center stores more than 1 petabyte of data , or billions of healthy - sized photos files .
I imagined all of my cloud data shimmying through these machines , having plenty of room to stretch out and have billions of cloud - data children .
As impressive as the size of this place is the fact that the files stored here have some serious jet legs .
Some data here is accessed primarily by people in India and China .
When people in these far - flung offices save files in this data center , lightning storms of orange LED 's flicker up and down the computer towers almost instantly .
As I walked around the center , IBM employees did their best to explain this hyper - complicated system .
They rattled off machine types , specs and technical details faster than I could write them down .
I confess that I left the IBM tour not feeling much better about the safety of my data .
Not that there seemed to be anything wrong with their cloud computing center .
The IBM staff was friendly and helpful .
The machines looked nice .
But I do n't have an IT degree .
How would I know if this place is working or not ?
Trust what you ca n't see
When I arrived home in Atlanta , Georgia , I got on the phone to continue pressing the Web sites I use to tell me where and how they store my data .
Some gave small details : Facebook told me it stores my party photos and status updates on servers in Virginia and in the San Francisco Bay , for example .
Tumblr stores my random blogs in Austin , Texas , and in New York before casting its blog posts to Amazon 's network on the West Coast .
I learned some companies , like Microsoft and Amazon , replicate data several times , on servers around the world .
They scatter it all over the place so as not to lose it .
Data moves around both within cloud centers and from one data center to another , often crossing oceans and trekking continents to get there .
Some of these cloud companies employ armed guards , retina scans and " man traps , " where doors lock on both sides of would - be entrants before letting them inside .
Many companies , like Amazon , said nothing specific , citing security concerns and competitive advantage .
On one hand , I was annoyed .
I thought my search was finished .
But the more I mulled over my failing scavenger hunt , the more I thought that maybe I was asking the wrong question .
Perhaps it does n't matter where my data is , just that there 's some way for me to get a sense of how well it 's managed .
Read about ' server huggers '
Still , without information , it 's hard to know who to trust .
That makes it easy to fall back on flimsy methods of comparison , like going with a brand you already know .
I 'm sure this is how I ended up with so much data on Google 's servers .
It 's a huge company .
Billions use their search .
Tens of millions save files with Gmail .
They 've got to know what 's up , right ?
That 's exactly what the big cloud companies hope you will think .
Microsoft 's general manager of Windows Live , Brian Hall , told me brand recognition is the best way for people to compare services .
" Consumers , they do n't really care if there are 9,000 data centers or two data centers as long as they have confidence that we 're going to protect their data and they 'll have access to it when they want to have access to it , " he said .
( In case you 're wondering , Hall said Microsoft has " between 10 and 100 data centers " worldwide .
Really specific . )
Clearing the fog
Having left the cloud , I tried to navigate my way through this new fog .
I kept looking for other ways to check up on my data without visiting it .
I thought about what I want in a cloud service .
I want my data to be available all the time .
And I do n't want there to be any chance the company could lose it , a tricky request since the hardware that stores our data is designed to fail from time to time .
Google and Amazon both guarantee their paid cloud services will be up and running 99.9 percent of the time , and they offer service credits to make up for failures .
The only problem is that these types of agreements , for now , only apply to paid services .
Too bad for my free Gmail account .
" Terms of service " agreements offer some details on free services .
But , after reading several , it 's still unclear to me who owns my data , if I can ever delete it from some sites and what would happen if any of these companies goes bankrupt .
In response to an e-mail question about what would happen to Facebook data if the site closed , a company spokeswoman wrote , " The business is doing well and continuing to grow . "
Lastly , on my tour in San Jose , when I felt the heat coming off the computer towers , I started to wonder if there 's a way to compare one data center 's energy efficiency to another's .
There has been some progress in this area .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and an industry group called The Green Grid are trying to compare the green records of these centers and cloud companies .
Lifting the veil
For now , I think I 'll hold off on dumping my whole laptop onto the cloud .
But I 'll keep using it as back - up .
I saved drafts of this story , and my research , on a cloud storage site called Dropbox .
That made it easy to work from my office in Atlanta , my tour in California and from my apartment .
I 'm going to continue storing data on my laptop , and , since I know my laptop can break ( it 's happened before ) , I 'll probably keep backing it up on an external hard drive or on DVDs when it 's something really important , like my travel photos or those of family .
I conclude my journey a bit disappointed .
I still wish I could have found my Google docs , Blogger posts or YouTube videos in the real world .
But , on my quest , I did get a sense that the haze around the cloud is starting to lift .
Google , for instance , recently posted a video tour of one data center online .
That 's a good sign because it means consumers may soon have logical ways to compare cloud companies .
The most important thing I realized on this search , though , was rather basic :
The cloud is not some fluffy ball of magic , it 's an energy - sucking and fallible machine .
One I 'll be more cautious before trusting .
A consumer who reported himself to an anti-piracy group to try to force a change in copyright law has finally received a response .
Denmark 's Antipiratgruppen acknowledges that the man broke the law when he circumvented DRM , but have told him that since it was for personal use with no further distribution , there is no desire to sue him .
Danish copyfighter Henrik Anderson has a dilemma .
Although the laws in his country allow him to copy DVDs for his own personal use , they forbid him to remove the DRM in order to do so .
Wanting to have this legal contradiction dealt with by his government , he confessed to anti-piracy group Antipiratgruppen that he had illegally broken the DRM on a hundred movies and TV shows .
The full background to the case can be found here .
After Antipiratgruppen missed the deadline to respond , Henrik announced a couple of days ago he would report himself to the police .
But now the group has responded , in a way that is possibly as confusing as the original law , although in a way that also makes perfect sense .
Their first paragraph notes that it is illegal to circumvent the “ so - called effective technological measures ” without the consent of rights holders – a reference to copy protection on a DVD .
They also note that making a copy of the DVD in order to watch it on a media center ( this issue Henrik is trying to draw attention to ) is also illegal .
So far , so good .
Now here ’s the interesting part :
That said , the main purpose of the rule is to ensure against abuse of films and music being illegally copied and distributed further .
The Association of Danish Videodistributors certainly have no interest in suing consumers who like you have purchased legitimate products – quite the contrary .
In a nutshell , Antipiratgruppen says that as long as people buy movies initially , they do n’t mind them a taking digital copy for their own use , as long as there is no distribution to 3rd parties – despite both acts being equally illegal .
Commenting on the news , Henrik told TorrentFreak : “ I ’m glad that they will not prosecute me .
But at the same time it ’s still illegal , so … ”
Henrik says that since this section of copyright law has no effect in the real world , it should simply be abolished so that people know where they stand , since other people in the future might take a different stance .
“ Who is to say that if the anti-piracy group suddenly falls over a man with a 1000 films that they would not prosecute him , even though he has paid for his films ?
Once again : it is still illegal , ” he told us .
Although Antipiratgruppen have responded promising not to prosecute , Henrik told Torrent Freak that he ’s not going to rest here .
“ Act ( § 75C ) is not modified / removed yet .
Only on the day where the Culture Minister said the law will be removed / changed will my goal be reached . ”
Next week , Henrik will try to contact the Culture Minister , who thus far has n’t been interested in doing much , but at least at this point must realize that there is something very wrong with the law .
The full response from Antipiratgruppen can be found here .
The sounds are described as ringing , buzzing , roaring , hissing or whistling Research has raised the possibility of successfully treating the ear - ringing disorder tinnitus soon after its onset .
Some forms of the condition are associated with spontaneous nerve activity in the brain .
A team from the University of Western Australia showed this activity is , for a time , dependent on nerve signals generated in the inner ear .
They believe it might be possible to treat tinnitus - for a limited period - by reducing these signals from the ear .
Tinnitus causes an unpleasant ringing , buzzing or whistling sound in one or both ears , or the head .
More than a third of the UK population will suffer from the condition at some point in their lives and about one in 100 will experience serious problems with long - term , established tinnitus .
This finding indicates there may be an early phase of tinnitus development which could be arrested
Professor Don Robertson
University of Western Australia Tinnitus is often associated with some degree of hearing loss .
The increased nerve activity in the brain associated with the condition is often caused by exposure to loud noise - such as music or machinery .
The researchers , working on animals , found that this increased activity could be reduced back down to normal levels by reducing nerve signals coming from the inner ear .
Cooling the ear
They achieved this in three ways : by removing a part of the inner ear called the cochlea , by cooling it down , and - crucially - by using drugs to block generation of the nervous impulses .
However , their work also suggested that after about six weeks , the increased nerve activity generated in the brain becomes independent of input from the ears .
This suggests that if tinnitus can be treated by dampening down nerve signals from the ear , it must be done swiftly before the condition becomes irreversibly established .
The researchers said further work was needed to find ways to exploit this potential window of opportunity .
' Extremely excited ' Lead researcher Professor Don Robertson said : " This finding indicates there may be an early phase of tinnitus development which could be arrested by temporarily dampening down the firing from the cochlea .
" And although a lot more research needs to be done at this stage , it is a very exciting prospect . "
Dr Ralph Holme , director of biomedical research at the charity RNID , which funded the research , said : " Tinnitus affects seven million people in the UK , yet there are no safe or effective ways of alleviating this stressful condition .
" We are extremely excited about the significant progress this research has made into identifying a possible window of opportunity for future treatments . "
The research will appear in the journal Neuroscience .

What are these ?

In the run-up to Copenhagen , the United Nations Environment Programme published a map of extreme weather events around the world
So , you ’re in your early thirties .
I ’m 31 .
Bar mitzvah age backwards .
Do you have any interest in running for political office ?
None at all .
Do you want to continue to cover politics ?
Yeah , I intend to do what I ’m doing , but more .
More intensely .
How did you vote in the presidential election ?
I did n’t .
I was completely unable to vote .
I ca n’t believe that my plants in my apartment are even alive because I was never there -- I was covering the campaign .
I could n’t even fill out an absentee ballot ; I was n’t in one place long enough .
Do you think Obama has lived up to liberals ’ expectations of him ?
Many liberals projected their own ambitions onto Barack Obama , as if he were a tabula rasa .
Some had higher expectations of him than I ’d seen of any politician from the Democratic Party .
Some of the followers of Barack Obama during the campaign reminded me of the Christian right , and he used evangelical language to appeal to them , with New Age themes like : “ We are the ones we ’ve been waiting for ” -- which is a phrase introduced originally by Maria Shriver .
It ’s a Hopi end times prophecy actually .
This became a theme of his campaign .
I saw his campaign as an illusion that brought together people from all different backgrounds , and actually did create a hopeful vehicle for change .
However , he ’s become the centrist I always expected him to be .
And in a different environment than when [ President ] Clinton was a centrist .
Clinton was triangulating in response to a Republican Congress and a right - wing political environment .
Barack Obama is dealing with a progressive moment .
He ’s being pulled by various forces to the center and even to the right .
Those that are disappointed with him should be disappointed with themselves because they ’re not demonstrating the same energy that they displayed in propelling him into the White House and making him a historic figure .
They ’re not propelling his agenda and they ’re not pushing him to fulfill any of the promises he made during the campaign .
They have a faith in him , but no one should have faith in politicians .
Politicians are there to be pressured .
My book shows how the Christian right operates , and the Christian right only comprises 12 % of the population .
They exert a disproportionate influence by affecting politics on the local level , by working through ballot initiatives and by seeing the big picture .
For them it was n’t about just having George W. Bush as president , it was about pressuring Bush through various means , pressuring the Republican Congress , and pressuring politicians at the stake to enact their radical agenda .
You ’ve become a well - known videographer , particularly with the YouTube videos .
Why did you start with video ?
How did you go from penning stories to actually putting people on camera ?
I originally started doing it to show people what it was like covering this movement .
When you read about it , it is almost unfathomable .
But when you see it , it becomes undeniable .
Seeing is believing .
Beyond that I wanted to distill my work to a younger audience that might even be more politically apathetic , but has intrinsic progressive tendencies .
What age were you aiming for ?
Any age from zero to 25 .
This sort of reporting appeals to them more .
They ’ve become attracted to my videos .
They ’ve become really popular among the young audience .
For example , I spoke at University of California Riverside and they created an events page for me on Facebook , titled “ Remember the Chicken Hawk Guy ? ” -- referring to my video about the College Republicans .
I showed my videos to the entire high school of Dalton High in New York , and they were cheering and asking provocative questions , even the ninth - graders .
People could be more engaged in politics , if the way it was reported was more interesting and entertaining .
At the same time , I want to continue to operate within ethical journalistic parameters .
When I do my videos , I ’m often accused of infiltrating , as if I were these right - wingers who did the ACORN videos .
But I never provoke situations , and I apply for credentials everywhere I go , I tell people who I am and I say what publication I ’m from , and I give them a business card .
So what I ’m doing is really just reporting on what ’s actually happening .
The fact that ’s threatening to the right says a lot about how out of touch they are with mainstream America .
The Republican Party :
Why do you think moderates have been edged out ?
Is that the course of the GOP for the next 8 - 10 years ?
Moderates from the Republican Party have been permanently edged out because the movement of the Christian right has become the party .
They ’ve run primary candidates against moderates .
They called people like Chris Shays in Connecticut a RINO .
They refused to support Lincoln Chafee in Rhode Island , and he is now a former Republican who called Sarah Palin a “ cocky wacko . ”
Olympia Snowe , one of the last Republican moderates in elected office , said : “ It ’s not my party anymore . ”
Congressional Republican approval rating in the Northeastern United States is 6 % .
In the deep South , Congressional Republican approval rating is 60 % .
It ’s become the party of birthers , deathers , and Civil War reenacters .
In the book you talk about a “ culture of personal crisis ” that is defining the radical right .
Can you discuss ?
This culture of personal crisis was impossible to deny in covering this movement .
When you meet so many of the movement ’s adherents , they ’ll tell you that they had some terrible episode in their past which gave them a pessimistic view of themselves , of the self , and of their bodies even .
They sought transcendence from what they saw as a sinful past through their involvement in the culture war .
They believed they had to do what God wanted them to do -- the strict father archetype of God .
Because when do what they want to do , they believe that they would inevitably do some really freaky stuff .
And they say as much .
If you look at what Mark Sanford said .
Mark Sanford ’s an ordained Baptist minister and a darling of the Christian right who would have been a contender in the 2012 Republican primary .
In his press conference announcing his affair with his Latin lover , he said : “ We follow God ’s law because it restrains the self from the self .
The self is the most sinful part of us . ”
They want to obliterate the self in a holy cause .
So there ’s this culture of personal crisis , and it ’s out there , and leaders have been exploiting it for a generation , particularly James Dobson , who is the most popular figure in the Christian right .
Although he ’s aging , he remains the most influential figure .
I wrote about him because he cultivated the sensibility of the movement by exploiting the culture of personal crisis as a psychologist , who has no religious credentials and no theological training .
His correspondence department in Colorado Springs is so large that it has its own ZIP Code .
He just handles thousands and thousands ...
... of pieces of mail and telephone calls from everyday Americans seeking help with mundane problems .
But then he enters them into a data bank , and bombards them with political mailings about the homosexual agenda , about abortion , about liberalism , about federal judges , slowly converting them into Republican shock troops .
And they become a loyal army that he levels against moderate Republicans and vulnerable Democrats .
He ’s used them to destroy the careers of moderates from Bob Dole to Colin Powell to even Newt Gingrich , who was n’t conservative enough for him .
You describe the psychology of a people “ willing to surrender their freedom ” to authoritarian figures .
Where is this coming from ?
Why would anyone want to give up their freedom ?
This idea , which is central in my book , is inspired by the psychologist Erich Fromm , who wrote a book called " Escape from Freedom " in 1941 after he fled from the Third Reich in Germany .
He saw the rise of authoritarianism in a democratic society , and his book was a warning about the peril of authoritarianism in his new country -- the United States .
He discussed the ways in which people are attracted to authoritarians and why they want to give up personal freedom , something that seems to go against their best interests .
I discovered this book while I was covering the Christian right because of all of the confessions people had made to me unprompted about why they joined the movement , why they converted to this Calvinistic brand of Christianity .
[ Fromm ’s book ] brought together so many of my observations .
Those who feel that the American Dream that they imagined -- which is a white , patriarchal America -- [ they ] feel under pressure .
By joining in this glorious cause and this crusade , they experience this euphoria and a sense of security .
By joining with like - minded believers , that helps them medicate the anxiety they feel in this rapidly changing country .
They ’ll always be a force to be reckoned with in American politics because America never stays the same .
America constantly moves forward .
Who are the people who follow this movement ?
Many of the followers of this movement are well - meaning people who are seeking relief .
They ’re being exploited and used as human tools by the power - hungry and the pulpit pimps of our society .
You paint a portrait of the Republican Party in the grip of the right wing .
You describe : “ Exclusively white , overwhelmingly evangelical , fixated on abortion , homosexuality , and abstinence education ; resentful and angry . ”
Will the GOP remain this way ?
When you have a losing record , you tend to go through a rebuilding process .
But the Republican Party appears to be doubling down on all its failed talent .
There ’s no better example of this than the elevation of Sarah Palin to a national leader of the Republican Party .
Or Rep. Joseph Wilson -- the neo-Confederate Congressman from South Carolina -- who with one rebel yell vaulted onto the national stage as the de facto communications director of the Republican Party .
The adulation that the Republican grass roots shows for people who have extremist tendencies and are incapable of mounting a viable national campaign shows how unable the party will be to go through a rebuilding process .
Who is the Republican Party ’s future ?
The Republican Party ’s future is Sarah Palin .
The big tent party of Dwight Eisenhower has become the one - ring circus of Sarah Palin .
The 2012 campaign , of any potential candidate she ’s the only one right now generating any media interest .
Even if she does n’t run , she ’ll have an impact , and it will be a negative impact on the Republican Party .
She has two constituencies : the Christian right and lovers of comedy .
I belong to that second constituency .
I do n’t know any liberal who does n’t want her to run .
The future of the party is vaudeville of gloom , doom , conflict and perpetual despair .
In exploring the radical right , you say you ’ve interviewed hundreds of Christians and Christian leaders .
What did you learn from them ?
I learned so much .
The psychological insight on human nature -- I had none of this before I began this journalistic project .
It ’s not just learning about them , it ’s learning about anyone who ’s willing to give up their freedom .
It ’s prompted a lot of self - reflection as well .
You profile many right wing leaders in the book -- digging into their personal pasts .
What made you explore this specifically ?
I did n’t go into their personal lives for the salacious quality , or the tabloid quality of their personal histories .
I did it to provide evidence of my concept of the culture of personal crisis that lies behind the right ’s politics .
This is a journalistic observation of a movement .
I ’m making a pretty controversial observation , so I needed to provide evidence .
Do you mind that the book is called your “ muckraking debut ” ?
It ’s my first book .
There was a lot of muckraking involved in writing it .
I do n’t paint a pretty picture .
If I could liken it to any piece of art , it would Ivan Albright ’s Picture of Dorian Gray .
When you probe beneath the flag - waving and the cross - bearing , it ’s almost as though you ’re Dorian Gray staring into the mirror , seeing this besotted and decadent , hideous soul .

The Massachusetts unemployment rate fell in November for the second straight month , adding to evidence that the state ’s economy has begun a recovery and the struggling job market is nearing a bottom , analysts said .
The state ’s jobless rate slipped to 8.8 percent , following a sharp drop in October , when it plunged nearly a half - point to 8.9 percent , the state Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development reported yesterday .
The national unemployment rate fell to 10 percent in November from 10.2 percent in October .
The state ’s job market , however , remains weak .
Massachusetts employers sliced payrolls by another 1,700 jobs in November , with the heaviest toll in retail , personal services , real estate , and government .
Still , two sectors that increasingly drive the state ’s economy posted strong gains .
Education and health services added 3,100 jobs , while professional and business services , which include technology , scientific , and research firms , added 1,200 jobs .
“ The downward trend in unemployment , and the fact that we ’re seeing growth in some of our most important industries , is good news , ’’ said Nancy Snyder , interim secretary of Labor and Workforce Development .
“ We ’re not out of the woods yet , but it ’s hopeful . ’’
Trends in unemployment and payroll jobs can diverge because they are based on separate surveys by the US Labor Department .
Payroll employment estimates come from a survey of businesses .
The unemployment rate is estimated from a survey of households .
The household survey also captures a broader swath of labor market by including workers , such as independent contractors , who do n’t show up on payrolls .
Many analysts had expected the state ’s unemployment rate to rise again after October ’s sharp drop , and were surprised by November ’s decrease .
If the rate declines for a third month , it could indicate that the most dismal forecasts were off , according to Elliot Winer , an independent economist in Sudbury .
The New England Economic Partnership , a nonprofit forecasting group , recently projected that state ’s unemployment rate would peak at 9.6 percent around mid-2010 .
“ If it goes down in December , ’’ Winer said , “ you might be able to say the worst is over . ’’
Other data suggest the worst may already be over for the Massachusetts economy , said Alan Clayton - Matthews , an economics professor at Northeastern University .
State withholding taxes have increased in each of the past two months , a sign that employers , if not hiring , are at least increasing hours for workers .
Massachusetts exports have risen more than 20 percent since April .
Several indicators , such as growing worldwide semiconductor sales , point to an improving technology sector .
In addition , two of the hardest hit industries posted job gains in November .
Manufacturing added 900 jobs , the first monthly gain in nearly three years .
Construction , which has lost one in five jobs since the beginning of the recession , added 200 jobs , the second consecutive monthly gain .
“ The unemployment rate was rising sharply , and now it ’s leveling off , ’’ said Clayton - Matthews .
“ It ’s consistent with an economy that has bottomed out , and a labor market that is getting near the bottom . ’’
Most economists expect a long climb back .
More than 300,000 Massachusetts residents are still unemployed , and many more are underemployed or no longer looking for work .
Only those who actively seek work are counted as unemployed .
More than 15 percent of Massachusetts workers were unemployed , underemployed , or no longer seeking work in November , compared with about 17 percent nationally , according to the US Labor Department .
As a result , consumers continue to curb the spending on which some industries rely .
Massachusetts retailers shed 1,700 jobs in November .
Real estate firms cut 1,300 jobs .
Leisure and hospitality , which include hotels and restaurants , shed 200 .
“ The worst of the employment declines might be behind us , ’’ said Michael Goodman , an economic analyst and professor of public policy at the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth .
“ But the impact of consumers ’ retrenchment is evidence that we ’re not there yet . ’’

November 6 , 2009
CHICAGO -- Workers at SK Hand Tools prevailed in a 10 - week strike that forced their employer to restore health care coverage and pensions that were cancelled earlier this year , though the new contract contains a significant wage cut .
The 70 workers , members of Teamsters Local 743 , make tools that are marketed under the SK brand , as well as Sears ' Craftsman line .
They voted by a 3 - 1 margin to accept the new contract , which includes wage cuts of 20 percent in the first year of a three - year agreement .
Wages will rise 2 percent in the second year , and 2.5 percent in the final year .
Shop steward Emilio Lunar , a member of the local 's organizing committee , said that workers feel the strike is a victory because it forced the owners to fully fund their pensions and restore health insurance that was cancelled May 1 .
The company 's extreme actions drew national attention as the SK Hand Tools battle became a symbol of the crisis in the employer - based health care system .
An activist network sprang up around the strike , and the local labor movement promoted solidarity efforts as well .
Workers at SK Hand Tools hit the picket line to defend their health care benefits
" Our main concern was health care , " Lunar said .
" We were looking at three items -- health care , pensions and wages . "
While workers with family health plans will have to pay somewhat more for coverage , most workers feel that they had won an important gain , he said .
Pensions , too , were a critical issue .
" We have a lot of people in their 50s , and who are near retirement , " he said .
On other issues , such as vacations , " everything gets back to status quo . "
The wage cuts " were hard to swallow , but it was less important than health care , " Lunar said .
" We know the economy is bad shape , and the company is in a hard situation , so that 's why we gave concessions on wages . "
The wage cuts come after six years in which workers had no raises .
But the contract is far better than what CEO Claude Fuger wanted - - a deal that would have put workers almost at the minimum wage with no health care or pensions at all .
After Fuger unilaterally cut off health care benefits May 1 , Local 743 began preparing for an unfair labor practices strike that began August 25 .
THE SK Hand
Tools struggle broke out a time when far bigger unions have been unwilling or unable to stand up to employer demands for concessions .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers are down 95 percent over last year -- and are at the lowest level since records were first kept in the 1940s .
The SK Hand Tools strike was too small to be included in those statistics .
But it showed the potential for workers ' struggles to rally support at a time when there is growing anger at the bankers and the wealthy , while workers face their worst prospects in decades .
The workers ' picket line on Chicago 's Southwest Side became a regular stopping point for members of other unions and activists of all kinds .
Strikers were featured at a variety of labor and social movement events , from the Chicago Federation of Labor 's Labor Day rally , to an immigrants ' rights march the same day , and to a meeting with LGBT activist Cleve Jones to build the National Equality March in Washington , D.C. Activists from around the city attended a successful fundraiser at the Local 743 union hall .
" All the people who came to our line gave us a big boost in our spirits , " Lunar said .
" We are very thankful to people who donated food and money , or just their time .
It really helped keep our spirits up .
It was the most amazing experience .
We did n't feel alone for a minute . "
A major factor in the struggle was Local 743's New Leadership reform slate , headed by local President Rich Berg , who also served as chief negotiator with SK Hand Tools management .
Since replacing a corrupt union leadership -- including officials who are now in jail -- Local 743's new administration has focused on rebuilding rank - and - file activism .
The SK Hand Tools strike highlighted the stark differences between the reformers and the old guard .
" For years , I heard people say , ' The union does n't do anything but take money from our pockets , ' " Lunar said .
" Today , people realize that it 's important to have a strong union . "
This is not a webpage about parachuting a cat .
I would never have been involved with anything like that .
This is not a cat wearing a homemade jumpsuit , harness and crash helmet .
This picture was not taken in the radome of a USAAF Nike Missile site ( Circa - 1982 ) .
I would never have trespassed on military property .
I have never owned New Balance shoes .
I did , however , own a black cat .
This is not a cat being lowered out of the access window of a missile site radome .
If this is a cat dangling from the access window of a missile site radome , I 'm sure that he must have climbed out on his own .
Cats like heights .
That is not a 13 ' Hefty Bag & packing tape parachute coming out of that window .
Once again , this is not a cat parachuting from the radome of a USAAF Nike Missile site .

I do not know and have never met the person who is about to catch whatever that is .
Intel dominates the personal computer microchip market Intel is facing a federal lawsuit that accuses it of using " illegal threats " to dominate microchip sales .
The New York attorney general accuses Intel of using " bribery and coercion " to make computer manufacturers buy its chips instead of those from its rivals .
Andrew Cuomo said the anti-competition federal lawsuit follows an investigation lasting almost two years .
Intel said in a statement that the " decision to file suit against [ us ] is just plain wrong " .
The quicker Intel owns up to its actions the quicker it , and the entire computer industry , can move on
Ed Black , Computer and Communications Industry Association " Neither consumers , who have consistently benefited from lower prices and increased innovation , nor justice , are being served by the decision to file a case now , " it added .
In May , Intel was fined $ 1.5 bn ( £ 948 m ) by European competition authorities .
The firm denied any wrongdoing in that case and is now appealing .
' Systematic campaign ' Mr Cuomo said Intel - the world 's largest maker of semiconductors - had been engaged in a " worldwide , systematic campaign of illegal conduct " .
" Rather than compete fairly , Intel used bribery and coercion to maintain a stranglehold on the market , " he added .
" Intel 's actions not only unfairly restricted potential competitors , but also hurt average consumers who were robbed of better products and lower prices . "
Mr Cuomo said the details of the case were revealed in email exchanges .
Intel is accused of paying millions of dollars each year - and " in some years billions " - in payoffs to computer makers in exchange for them only buying its chips .
It is further said to have withdrawn this payments to punish those computer firms " perceived to be working too closely with Intel 's competitors " .
Ed Black , president of trade body Computer and Communications Industry Association , said Mr Cuomo had put forward a " strong case " .
" The quicker Intel owns up to its actions the quicker it , and the entire computer industry , can move on , " he said .
In the European case , the European Commission ruled in May that Intel had paid manufacturers and one retailer to favour its chips over those of key rival Advanced Micro Devices between 2002 and 2007 .

A Jefferson County ( Wisconsin ) courtroom erupted into chaos on Monday afternoon after the suspect in a double killing in Jefferson this weekend lunged toward the audience and had to be restrained by several officers .
The outburst happened just moments after a judge ordered Andrew Wirth 's bail set at $ 1 million .
He let loose a stream of obscenities and appeared to try and throw himself over the courtroom bar toward those in the audience section .
Wirth was tackled by a group of officers and authorities used a Taser on him to bring him under control and hustled him off to another room .
Wirth is charged with two counts of first - degree intentional homicide in the deaths of Gregg Peters and his girlfriend Jennifer Luick , a Town of Oconomowoc police officer and single mother .
Luick 's family was seated in the front row of the courtroom on Monday clutching the woman 's pictures and wiping tears during the short arraignment proceeding .
When the outburst began , deputies rushed the family out of the courtroom to safety .
Luick 's fellow officers were seated right beside the family to offer support and protect them .
" I had my lieutenant seated off to the side to protect the family and deputies took care of their responsibilities , " said Town of Oconomowoc Police Chief Jim Wallis .
Wallis said Monday 's outburst makes the family 's loss that much more unbearable .
" I know the emotional outburst inside was very hard on the family and they would like to see justice done , and so would we " said Wallis .
According to the criminal complaint , released on Monday , Luick and Gregg Peters were at Vinnie 's Rock Bottom Bar in Jefferson on Saturday night to listen to a band .
Carol Blasier , Luick 's friend who was with her that night , told police that Luick was having fun dancing and drinking that night .
Blasier said the two women were " grabbing everyone 's butts in the bar as a joke and to be playful . "
Blasier said that she saw Luick touch a guy 's butt and he seemed to take offense to it .
Police said that they believe that person was Andrew Wirth .
Wirth told police , " I was on a ( expletive ) date and that guy 's girlfriend grabbed my ( butt ) . "
Wirth said he said something to the woman , who went and told her friends .
Wirth said the guy came up to him and told him to step outside .
The report said Wirth went outside with the guy and from his perspective the other guy started it .
Wirth stated , " If he wanted to ( expletive ) with me , that 's life .
" Several witnesses in the complaint report watching Wirth shoot both Peters and Luick and then leave the bar .
Wirth was apprehended a short time later , waived his Miranda rights and told police where they could find the gun used in the shooting .
Detectives reported that Wirth asked repeatedly about the conditions of the victims .
Wirth told police he , " did n't wish for anyone to be dead , but ( Luick 's ) the one that started it . "
He told detectives he " did n't think the guy got hit enough times so that he would die .
" According to the criminal complaint and the Jefferson County district attorney 's office , Wirth has some connection to the Los Diablos motorcycle gang in the area .
His parents and friends were seated in the courtroom on Monday , as well as members of the media and victim 's families .
Officials said that no trial date has been set as yet .

I was working on another project related to the CRU emails and came across this email from Dr. Phil Jones .
I was stunned , not only because he was dissing another dataset , but mostly because that dissing hit many of the points about problems with the NASA GISS products we ’ve covered here on WUWT and at Climate Audit .
Here ’s the email with my highlights added .
Email addresses have been partially redacted .
The original email can be seen at this link :
http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=1042&filename=1254850534.txt
Here ’s the thing , we ’ve seen the problems with CRU ’s temperature series in the code already .
If Dr. Jones is aware of those problems , and he thinks GISS is inferior , well then , wow , just how bad is GISS ?
I thought this statement was quite telling :
Their non-use of a base period ( GISS using something very odd and NCDC first differences ) means they can use very short series that we ca n’t ( as they do n’t have base periods ) but with short series it is impossible to assess for homogeneity .
One thing about GISS that has bothered a lot of people – the base period they use for calculating temperature anomaly is for 1951 - 1980 .
See it listed here on the GISTEMP page .
No other data sets use that period .
Critics ( including myself ) have said that by using that period , it makes this graph ’s trend look steeper than it would if the current 30 year period was used .
In the past couple of years we ’ve seen two significant errors with NASA GISS that had to be corrected after they were discovered through the work done here at at WUWT and Climate audit .
Public errors have not been found in CRU products during that time , because the data an code have been withheld .
To the credit of NASA GISS , they have been more transparent than CRU on data , stations used , and code .
Here are some of the relevant posts on WUWT where we address issues found with the NASA GISS temperature products :

Las Vegas hotels are often considered a prime example of overbuilding during the bubble .
But Dubai makes the Vegas overbuild look conservative .
Over at The New Geography , Wendell Cox puts it in the starkest terms :
It seems fair to ask what Dubai was seeking to accomplish .
On one hand , there was an interest in developing a strong tourism base , and tourism has increased over the past decade .
Yet , Dubai attracts only 1/10th of tourism of Las Vegas , while having more than one - half the hotel rooms .
One challenge is that what has been built may already be too large to be supported by the permanent population , Emirati or expatriate .
As we 've said before , Dubai was such an obvious bubble it's hard to believe anyone missed it .
Teachers given powers to search pupils for drugs
Teachers will be given new powers in a fresh crackdown on bad behaviour
Teachers have gained new powers to search pupils for drugs , alcohol and stolen goods , it has been revealed .
They will gain the legal right to frisk pupils and search school bags without consent in a fresh crackdown on bad behaviour .
The move extends the existing right of teachers to look for weapons and is enshrined in new legislation .
It is designed to stamp out a culture of drug - taking and underage drinking that is developing in schools .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls said the powers would ensure all pupils knew that a ' teacher 's authority in the classroom is unquestionable ' .
But teaching leaders warned that staff could face false allegations of assault from pupils as a result .
It will also increase the responsibilities of teachers .
Schools can already look for weapons by removing children 's jackets and jumpers and ' patting down ' their clothing .
They can also screen them using the sort of metal detectors seen at airports .
But while they can ask pupils suspected of possessing drugs to turn out their pockets and open their bags , only police can frisk for drugs or other items .
Staff must call their local police if they believe a search is warranted .
Mr Balls said : ' Low level behavioural problems can sometimes be a forerunner to more serious issues and I want to help schools step in early to prevent problems further down the line .
' We need to ensure schools have the powers and support they need to maintain good behaviour and to stop problems in the wider community , such as drugs and alcohol use , entering the school grounds . '
The new powers are set out in the Apprenticeships , Skills , Children and Learning Act 2009 which gained Royal Assent on Thursday night .
The Government plans to issue new guidance to schools in the next few weeks about how the new powers will be implemented .
Teachers were yesterday divided over the legal rights , which come into force in September 2010 .
Mary Bousted , general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , said : ' I welcome the extension of teachers ' rights to search but it is not without its problems .
' We know classroom teachers face false allegations of assault from pupils and searches mean they can be put in a vulnerable situation .
Teachers need the training to enable them to exercise this right properly . '
John Bangs , head of education at the National Union of Teachers , claimed the powers do not go far enough because they do not support teachers ' judgements .
He said : ' If a teacher felt that a student posed imminent harm to himself or herself or others , they should be allowed to search .
But that has to be the teacher 's judgement .
' The idea that you can only search for drugs , alcohol and stolen goods , from the other things that a kid might be hiding is ridiculous .
' The examples we have used are if a child has got hold of legal drugs but have a lot of them , such as a large packet of paracetamol or if they have pornography . '
But John Dunford , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said : ' We welcome this and think it will make it easier to solve discipline issues in schools .
' There will be guidance coming out that will make sure that headteachers how to do it in a way that 's within the law . '
The Act also requires schools to record and report ' significant incidents ' in which staff have used force to restrain a pupil .
Surveys show that growing numbers of pupils are turning up to lessons drunk or hungover .
New Government guidance stresses the need for primary schools to begin alcohol education ' before young people start experimenting ' .

I went to Evan ’s and Evan ’s when a friend had told me that they had won her disability case for her .
I had already been denied disability twice and I appealed for a hearing , I had been trying for about a year and a half at this point .
I was extremely sick and unable to work any longer , I was losing my apartment and on the verge of being homeless and the bills just kept coming in and piling up I had no more money and no way of getting anymore .
I was really scared and desperate and did n’t know where to turn , I called and set up a time to meet with Richard Sly , very laid back kind of guy .
I explained my situation to him and he agreed to take my case , he never promised or sugar coated anything and when I left I was n’t really sure how I felt or what the outcome would be , but I at least had someone in my corner now and all I could do was hope for the best and pray for a miracle .
They did all the leg work for me and I did n’t hear much from them unless they needed something like a signature or permission to get medical records .
Fast forward to the hearing day , I was extremely nervous and scared because if I do n’t win my case I do n’t know where I will live or what I will do because I am still extremely sick and unable to work .
I met with Richard Sly about a half hour before the hearing was set to begin we went over a few things about my case and then it was time .
We were in front of the judge for maybe 15 - 20 minutes and then it was over .
I had no idea what had just happened to be honest , I just felt like I could n’t hear or understand anything that was being said , Richard and I walked out into the hallway , and I asked him okay what now , how long until I find out if I am approved or denied ?
He did a little chuckle and said you just won , the judge approved you for disability .
I was in shock , I wanted to scream , hug him and cry all at the same time , the instant relief that I had felt from those words I cannot explain .
I am so very grateful and thankful for Richard Sly and Evan ’s and Evan ’s for taking my case and everything that they did .
I ’m still going to be sick , but at least now I do n’t have to worry about having a place to live and how I ’m going to pay my bills .
I do n’t think they know how much of an impact they make to someone ’s life , this is something they do everyday , but for me it is life changing a miracle for me .
Thank you Richard Sly and Evan ’s and Evan ’s , I am forever grateful , Evelyn M .

Easter Island is 20 miles long with a population of 4,000
The inhabitants of Easter Island in the South Pacific have voted to restrict immigration amid overpopulation fears .
More than 90 % of those who voted in this weekend 's referendum said they were worried about an influx of residents from Chile .
Chile has administered the remote island outpost , famous for its carved stone statues , since the 19th century .
The referendum was organised by the Chilean government , which says the island is struggling to cope .
Constitutional change
With a population of just 4,000 people , Easter Island might not sound that crowded .
But the island is just 20 miles ( 32 km ) from one end to the other .
It is also more than 2,000 miles from the Chilean mainland , which generates all sorts of problems .
Disposing of rubbish in a sustainable , environmentally friendly way , for example , is becoming increasingly difficult .
Some 50,000 tourists visit the island each year to see the famous Maoi , the enigmatic carved stone heads that are dotted around the island .
As tourism has increased , hundreds of Chileans have moved in from the mainland to work in hotels , bars and as taxi drivers .
The Chilean parliament must now approve a change to the constitution to bring the new rules into effect .
Caster Semenya 's makeover has become a talking point
Enlarge Image
South African runner Caster Semenya , whose gender was queried by athletics officials , has defended her looks and taken part in a makeover in a magazine .
Ms Semenya , the 800 m world champion , posed for the cover of South Africa 's
You magazine .
" I am who I am and I am proud of myself , " the 18 - year - old said .
" I 'd like to dress up more often and wear dresses but I never get the chance , " she said as she was photographed in several outfits .
The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says the outfits show a softer side of Ms Semenya , who most of the world has seen only in a green - and - gold running outfit and training shoes .
The outfits included black leather trousers with a sequined top , a grey knee - length dress worn with a grey cropped jacket and a black - and - white cocktail dress worn with stilettos .
The controversy over Ms Semenya 's gender has angered many in South Africa , including her family who insist she is female .
Now that I know I can look like this I 'd like to dress like this more often
Caster Semenya
Homecoming for Semenya
And our reporter says her makeover has become a talking point since the magazine hit the shelves on Monday evening .
Listeners have been phoning up radio stations to give their thoughts on " the new and improved " Ms Semenya .
Some felt she should not have been " improved " while others said it was a " great look " .
Ms Semenya , who has said very little about the gender controversy surrounding her , says she is not bothered by the negative publicity following her gold medal at the Berlin World Championships last month .
" I see it all as a joke , it does n't upset me .
God made me the way I am and I accept myself , " she said .
" I 've never bought my own clothes , my mum buys them for me , but now that I know I can look like this I 'd like to dress like this more often , " she added .
The magazine said it was " under strict obligation not to comment " on the makeover , but said the cover has sparked a lot of international interest .

American health care policies are driven by personal testimony rather than by science .
In the case of alcoholism , such testimony is invariably from alcoholics who have recovered through AA .
There are many such people .
But they are still a tiny minority of those who experience alcohol problems , including those who recover on their own , those who are harmed by AA or 12 - step treatment , and others for whom the 12 steps are ineffective or offensive .
The Stanton Peele Addiction Website , November 25 , 2009 .

I Just Want to Testify ( about my alcoholism )
American health care policies are driven by personal testimony rather than by science .
In the case of alcoholism , such testimony is invariably from alcoholics who have recovered through AA .
There are many , many such people .
But they are still a tiny minority of those who experience alcohol problems , including those who recover on their own , those who are harmed by AA or 12 - step treatment , and others for whom the 12 steps are ineffective or offensive .
America is a country that worships personal tales of redemption .
If public figures are caught out drunk or on drugs , cheating on their wives , then they quickly head off to Betty Ford or Hazelden , apologize to their families and constituents , and promise not to stray or drink again .
And we forgive them .
This process derives from America 's religous revivalist tradition .
At the revival meeting , people rise and denounce the evil of their former ways , declare themselves saved , and commit themselves to God .
This was the format of the Temperance lecture that dominated the nineteenth century American landscape .
And the Temperance confession is still with us in the form of Alcoholics Anonymous .
For those of you who have been missing your 12 - step meetings , here are selected steps to practice at home ( note the presence of God , and the absence of alcohol ) :
3 . Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God .
5. Admitted to God , to ourselves , and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs .
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings .
Although such penitence is repeated nightly around the country , these stories conflict with rational public policy .
According to the latest government research ( called NESARC ) , 30 percent of Americans at some point in their lives qualify for an " alcohol use disorder . "
But , within four years , 70 percent recover without AA 's or Betty Ford 's help .
Others take longer .
But only 1 percent of Americans fit the model of the AA members whose drinking carries them to the doors of hell and from which only God can rescue them .
Among 300,000,000 Americans , that 's 3 million people .
But 90 million Americans develop a different sort of drinking problem .
Many entertainment figures had bad drinking periods ( Bing Crosby , Robert Redford , Steve Martin ) and cut back - the typical problem - drinking profile .
We do n't hear much about them because they - and millions of others with similar stories - do n't go on lecture tours to tell their tales .
Craig Ferguson 's compelling testimony about his dead - end alcoholism on You Tube , on the other hand , has had a million - and - a - half views .
How can you top that ?
Nonetheless , for the first time - due to the NESARC research - government officials are questioning received opinion .
Dr. Mark Willenbring , director of treatment and recovery research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , declared : alcoholism " can be a chronic , relapsing disease .
But it is n't usually . "
Thus , intensive treatment addresses a small - albeit important - part of America 's substance abuse problems .
( Disclosure : I have created a non -12 - step abstinence - oriented treatment program for this group . )
The limits of public testimony for determining American health policy is also apparent in yet another declaration of a learned council that cancer screening is overutilized .
Up to 1,900 women must be screened ten years in their 40s in order to prevent one death from breast cancer .
But , along with all that irradiation , 1,000 false warnings will be generated from such testing leading to biopsies and other procedures that create their own dangers .
If you talk to the one in 1,900 women whose life was saved by screening - there are plenty , and I can't compete against them - you determine that there is no way America can better spend its finite health care allotment .
But there are actually many more productive , less harmful , more life - saving ways to spend that money - including even for cancer prevention .
Someone has to make these choices .
America can listen to one of two groups - health economists and oncologists and internists like those making up the government panel recommending scaling back breast cancer screening , or people who swear that screening is the best use of our health care budget because it worked for them .
While we 're at it , we can treat every kid caught with a reefer or who gets drunk as though he or she had a lifetime disease .
After all , you can find very moving and convincing stories of people who claim that being forced into AA at age 15 saved their lives .
But it 's craziness to do so , even though we wo n't hear the far more frequent stories of people who were scarred by such experiences .
P.S. NESARC changes everything .
Apropos of the yet - to - be- fully realized significance of NESARC , consider the year - end summary by the president of the Linnean Society following the presentation of the work of Wallace and Darwin on evolution ( although others had outlined evolution earlier ) :
“ The year which has passed has not , indeed , been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize , so to speak , the department of science on which they bear . ”
P.S.S .
As to my alcoholism : Commenters frequent diagnose my mental disorders - the current favorite being that I am bipolar .
On the drinking front , I can go wrong one of two ways .
Either I am in denial about my alcoholism , or I am not alcoholic and so I can't possibly understand alcoholism .
In other words , if I do n't share the experiences and outlook of testifiers , I can't enter the Kingdom of Alcoholism .
For the record , I struggle to drink as much as I should for my health .
What Do You Do When Someone Hands You A Yarmulke ?
As the Chanukah season approaches , I ’m reminded of my regular moments of discomfort when any Jewish holiday approaches .
I get uncomfortable because invariably someone hands me a yarmulke to wear during the recital of some prayer or during an entire ceremony .
I ’ve been handed skull caps at weddings , Passover , Purim , Rosh Hashanah , and Shabbat .
Just to allay any fears that I might be converting , I should say that my wife and her lovely family are mostly secular Jews , but they still celebrate Jewish holidays , so I often find myself at Jewish homes on those occasions .
As more and more of this extended family learn that I am a secular humanist , this issue comes up less often , but the question remains :
What should a secular person do when someone hands him a yarmulke ?
My gut has always answered that I do n’t want to wear this .
Yarmulkes are worn as a sign of reverence to the God of Abraham whom I do n’t happen to believe in .
Judeo - Christians should n’t take offense though .
My Godlessness extends to all gods , so it ’s nothing personal .
( I do n’t genuflect in church , or face Mecca 5 times a day either . )
The discomfort I sometime feel comes from what my brain tells me .
I ’m a guest in their home on a day when people are observing a holiday .
Do n’t be such a goy , my brain says .
What ’s the harm of popping the cap on for a while ?
It ’s not like I ’m converting …
Gut :
Ok , you ’re not converting , but it feels wrong … and you are acknowledging the existence of a deity .
Brain :
No I ’m not .
I ’m just putting a hat on for a few minutes .
Gut :
It ’s not just a hat – it ’s a religious hat that makes God happy .
And God does n’t exist , remember ?
Brain : I know , I know , I taught you that !
But wearing this will make the hosts happy .
Do it for them .
It ’s no skin off your teeth .
Gut : I really do n’t want to offend these nice people after they were kind enough to invite me to their home , but it feels like I ’m selling out .
I ’m a professional atheist for God ’s sake !
Brain : Huh ?
Gut :
You know what I mean .
Brain :
You could wear another kind of hat …Technically , it does n’t have to be a yarmulke .
Gut : I would consider wearing one of those upside - down flowerpot hats that Devo wore in the 80s … or maybe a miter …
Brain :
You want to wear a Pope hat to a Jewish gathering ?
Gut : I do n’t want to wear any hat !
This interior dialogue went on for years .
Most of the time I found ways to skate around being handed the yarmulke – a few times I wore one to avoid causing a scene .
Eventually I asked three people I respect highly what they thought I should do .
My father , Eddie Tabash , and Paul Kurtz all gave me the same answer :
Do n’t feel obligated to wear a yarmulke .
I was off the hook .
My atheist father married my Catholic mother , so he had some experience with being an outsider in church matters .
And two of these three wise men ( Kurtz and Tabash ) were raised Jewish , so I figured I was free of the beanies .
And so I am .
I do n’t wear yarmulkes anymore – ever .
When offered , I smile and say “ No thank you , devout atheist . ”
If someone feels strongly enough to disinvite me from the gathering because I wo n’t don the little cloth dome , then so be it .
I will graciously excuse myself from the affair and occupy myself elsewhere .
Wearing a piece of clothing to acknowledge or pay respect to something that almost certainly is n’t there is just too far from my view of the universe to stomach .
My gut ( i.e. my brain ) was right after all .
It ’s too bad really …
I ’ve got a growing bald spot that a yarmulke would cover nicely .
TV of the 2000s : The Top 10 “ Doctor Who ” Stories of the Decade
There has been no better decade to be a fan of “ Doctor Who ” than the ‘00s .
The show , once considered a punchline for jokes made by Trekkies , has risen from the ashes of the ‘ 80s and been reborn as a serious sci- fi / fantasy force with which to be reckoned .
It ’s managed to generate two spinoffs in the form of “ Torchwood ” and “ The Sarah Jane Adventures , ” as well as open up the entire 26 previous seasons to a whole new generation of fans .
Yeah , it ’s a good time to be a “ Doctor Who ” fan , because more than ever , people are less than likely to look at you “ that ” way when you tell them it ’s your favorite series .
With that in mind , here ’s an entirely subjective list of its crowning achievements since the new series started in 2005 ; it ’s just a shame I ’ve not yet seen David Tennant ’s two - part finale , “ The End of Time , ” so it could warrant possible inclusion .
In any case , here ’s to , at the very least , another full decade of time and space travels inside the TARDIS .
10 . “ School Reunion ” – There are other stories that from a plot standpoint are much better written than this one , and thus more deserving of being in this Top 10 , but I ’ve an enormous fondness for this outing simply because it not only brought Lis Sladen ’s Sarah Jane Smith back into my life , but it did it in such a way that left me a sobbing mess .
If , like me , you grew up watching Doctor # 4 ( Tom Baker ) and Sarah Jane battle the evil Morbius on Karn , defeat the diabolical Sutekh on Mars , and kill the giant Krynoid at the estate of Harrison Chase , then seeing her character – as well as her relationship with the Doctor – hit a poignant and dramatic high note of finality was most definitely a strong cup of tea .
It ’s a bit of a shame Sarah Jane has her own series now , because everything about her that ’s come since has somewhat eroded what was beautiful about this story in the first place .
9 . “ The Waters of Mars ” – It ’s entirely possible I ’m riding a “ Who ” high at the moment , and that in time “ Mars ” wo n’t seem quite as perfect as it does at present .
Further , since it wo n’t play on BBC America until Dec. 19th , it would be wrong to discuss it in any great detail .
Nevertheless , it ’s got an intricate premise from Russell T. Davies and Phil Ford , deft direction from Graeme Harper , creepy monsters , outstanding set design , and one helluva complex performance from David Tennant , that ’s clearly aimed at setting up “ The End of Time . ”
The last 20 minutes are frenzied and game - changing ; this is Davies pulling the rug out from under the Time Lord and redefining everything we thought we learned about him over the past four seasons .
It ’s fucking glorious , and even if the big finish does n’t quite live up to the buildup , I ’ll know they made a damn good go of it .
8 . “ The Impossible Planet / The Satan Pit ” – Here ’s another story that might leave a reader or two scratching their heads , but it ’s a tale that holds an immense amount of nostalgia for me .
See , my kid was 13 at the time it premiered , as were his friends .
For the second season of new “ Who , ” the fates conspired so that he and his buds gathered at the house nearly every weekend to watch the latest episode with me , and the otherworldly goings - on at Sanctuary Base in particular had all of us riveted .
“ Do n’t Turn Around ! ” became the catchphrase for a good long while around my casa , and further , this was the story where Tennant “ became ” the Doctor for me .
The scene where he was being lowered into the Satan Pit , talking of how the specifics of the creature did n’t fit his “ rules ” was the defining moment .
If I ’d had even a vague vibe that he might not be precisely the right actor for the role before this , any such thoughts were dashed immediately after viewing that scene .
Beside , the Doctor meets Satan ?
Hot diggity damn !
This two - parter also unleashed the Ood , who have clearly become one of the defining alien races of the new series ; they returned for the aptly named “ Planet of the Ood ” in Season Four , and will be returning again for Tennant ’s finale .
7 . “ The Parting of the Ways ” – “ Who ” season finales are hyper - dramatic and a lot of fun , but typically they do n’t stand out as being the cream of any given block .
That was n’t the case , however , with Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston ’s swan song from Season One , which was in fact so perfect in its seasonal finality that Davies has n’t topped it since .
The thing is , when it was being written , he had no idea whether or not the show was even going to get a second season , and therefore it fell upon him to craft a story that put a fine point on everything he felt he needed to say about the concept .
Eccleston is quite literally fantastic here , but perhaps even more so is Billie Piper , who just shines with one of her most painful performances in the series .
I still get shivers when I watch the hologram scene , punctuated by her cries of “ Take me back ! , ” as well as the moment between her and Jackie , when she explains how the Doctor took her to meet her deceased father : “ That ’s how good the Doctor is ! ” I ’m man enough to admit I ’m tearing up a bit just writing these words .
Oh , and “ Parting ” also unveiled an army of friggin ’ flying Daleks .
There was a time when such a sight was indeed something to behold ; now it ’s somewhat unfortunately become the norm .
6. “ The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances ” – As good as “ The Parting of the Ways ” was , Steven Moffat managed to unleash a Season
One tale that was just a tad better , and he brought the unforgettable phrase “ Are you my mummy ? ” to the table , for which we are eternally grateful .
Everything about this two - parter is just bloody brilliant : WW II , the London Blitz , a blond girl dangling from a barrage balloon , the introduction of John Barrowman ’s Captain Jack Harkness , and gratuitously lush use of Glenn Miller .
Who can forget the Doctor ’s moves at the end , followed by his joyous cry of “ Just this once – everybody lives ! ” ?
It was obvious the Moff was a force with which to be reckoned coming out of the gate , and in just a few months he ’s going to literally be running the show ( actually , he already is – we just have n’t gotten to sample the wares ) .
5 . “ The Girl in the Fireplace ” – And so how does Grand Moff Steven top an epic like “ The Empty Child ” ?
By doing an intimate episode in which the Doctor , for all intents and purposes , falls in lust for the first time , although it ’s a strange , neutered lust to be sure .
This was another game - changer as far as the character of the Doctor goes , and thematically reflected what much of Season Two was about :
The Doctor ’s inability to see the effect he has on the people with whom he comes into contact .
In this case the person is Madame de Pompadour , also known as Reinette ( Sophia Myles ) , who encounters the Doctor periodically throughout her entire life , from childhood until death , even though the same events only occupy a few hours of time from his standpoint .
It ’s got a heartbreaking ending , gorgeous set design and costumes , and a truly inspired group of villains in the form of the Clockwork Androids , who very likely kept children of all ages awake at night ages after having viewed it .
4. “ Midnight ” – What happens when the Doctor loses his voice , which is perhaps his most valuable asset ?
The events that occur onboard the shuttle bus en route to the planet Midnight are some of the most unsettling the new series presented .
Over the course of this hour we viewed the very worst aspects of humanity , which is a marked change from Russell T. Davies generally more positive outlook .
Well , OK , Davies writes some pretty nasty material – what would a series like this be without villains ?
– but the folks onboard the shuttle bus with the Doctor might as well be you and me , and it ’s in his presentation of these “ normal ” folk that the ugly beauty of this episode lies .
Well , that and the fact that it ’s utterly horrific in its depiction of an unseen creature that at first tries to break into the bus , and then later settles on taking over the mind and voice of passenger Sky Silvestry ( Lesley Sharp , giving an atypically chilling performance ) .
Towards the end , the mysterious force moves on to the Doctor , and he just seems so bloody helpless .
3. “ Blink ” – For many , “ Blink ” remains the crowning achievement of new “ Who , ” and with good reason – it ’s an outstanding hour of TV that not only works as a great example of what this show can do when it stretches itself , but it also works in a vacuum ; you could watch this episode without knowing anything about the series at all and still come away endlessly entertained and spooked .
Funny that the Doctor is barely even in it , but therein lays a great deal of its perfection .
Instead , he ’s trapped in 1969 , as well as on a series of 17 DVDs as an Easter Egg , and as a result our central figure is Sally Sparrow ( Carey Mulligan of “ An Education ” ) .
It ’s up to her to stop the Weeping Angels ( creatures from beyond so perfectly constructed , that a reappearance could only be a letdown ) and get the TARDIS back to ’69 so the Doctor can resume his travels .
Once again written by Steven Moffat , this hour is his strongest offering to the series , and more than anything else proves that he knows his way around wibbly - wobbley time - wimey balls of , um , time .
Mulligan comes out of the gate , owning the series as if she ’d been there since day one , and it ’s no surprise that she ’s moving up in the world of film and TV .
Good thing , too , as people who ’ve never even watched “ Who ” will likely soon start discovering this gem simply because they ’re looking for older work from this up and coming talent , and really , what better episode to use to get someone into the show ?
An angel has the key to the phone box indeed .
2. “ Love & Monsters ” – There probably is n’t a more controversial episode that I could ’ve chosen for this list than “ Love & Monsters , ” let alone the fact that I ’m putting it at # 2 .
I ’m sure I ’ve seen this one labeled more than any other as the worst episode of the new series – a sentiment with which I take obvious issue .
A “ Who ” buddy of mine assures me this feeling only comes from stodgy , vocal old school fans who do n’t like having their “ Who ” tampered with in this particular manner , and that the reality is that it ’s actually a very well - liked episode .
I ’d like to think so , because the tragicomical story of Elton Pope ( Marc Warren ) and the other members of L.I.N.D.A. , a group dedicated to collecting information on the mysterious Doctor , is one of the finest odes to the art of fandom ever written ( thank you again , Russell Davies ) .
This piece sings , makes my heart swell and manages to say everything and nothing about “ Who ” simultaneously – and it ’s crammed full of ELO tunes !
What more could a “ Doctor Who ” fan possibly want ?
1. “ Human Nature / The Family of Blood ” – While Davies and Moffat wrote some of the best episodes of the decade , the # 1 spot is reserved for a story from Paul Cornell .
His previous outing , “ Father ’s Day , ” was also very good , and came close to making this Top 10 .
But close only counts in horseshoes , hand grenades and body odor , so if by any chance Paul reads these words , hopefully he ’ll forgive me leaving “ Father ’s Day ” off the list in lieu of placing him at the very top .
Mind you , that ’s not really a strategical maneuver , as this two - parter , which features the Doctor becoming human and falling in love , is actually the greatest 90 minutes of ‘ 00s “ Who . ”
Unfortunately , it would pack very little resonance for anyone unfamiliar with the series – you ’ve got to be invested and well - versed in the new series up to this point in Season
Three to get the most out of it , but that can hardly be counted against it .
It ’s a thing of beauty , the bee ’s knees , the best of the best , the crème de la crème of all things new “ Who . ”
Tennant is a marvel here , proving to viewers just how damn good an actor he is , in the calculated performance as John Smith , the schoolteacher living in a pre-WWI England .
But Smith has strange dreams at night – dreams of a blue box and of being another man altogether .
So do we , John , so do we – and Paul , we ’ll never look into a mirror quite the same way again .
Gold - plated Tungsten
What Is Tungsten Alloy Jewelry ?
